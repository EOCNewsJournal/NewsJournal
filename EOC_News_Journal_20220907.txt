I think global situation changed a lot since I made that statement in the 2020 bu…","Even though the government is yet to make up its mind on inclusion of G-Secs (Government Securities) in global bond indices  Wall Street brokerage Morgan Stanley expects indices major JP Morgan to make an announcement in this regard as early as next week. On Monday finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told an industry gathering that the 2020 budget proposal on allowing bond inclusion in international indices could not move forward as the fund flows did not meet the desired levels  due to many reasons including the Covid pandemic.Without offering any details like a timeline or the tax and stamp duty breaks that investors were demanding  Sitharaman said: ""I don't know whether we're holding it back or not. I think global situation changed a lot since I made that statement in the 2020 budget.""Global fund flows have not been as big as we wanted it to be primarily due to other reasons. So it'll come to its natural  logical conclusion soon.""According to the RBI data  G-Secs outstanding stood at Rs 84.7 lakh crore  or over USD 1 trillion  as of end-June 2022 and the corporate bonds outstanding at Rs 40.4 lakh crore.In a note on Tuesday  Morgan Stanley strategists Min Dai  Madan Reddy and Gek Teng Khoo said that ""now we believe that there is a very good chance that JP Morgan will announce the index inclusion of India 's bond market in mid-September.""They also said they expect the inclusion to drive in as much as USD 30 billion into the country next fiscal alone  even though there is no clarity on the tax breaks  which is a necessary condition for inclusion.Explaining how they arrived at USD 30 billon inflows  they said G-Secs Asset Under Management (AUM) that is tracking the GBI-EM is about USD 300 billion. Hence  10 per cent weight for India in the index will attract USD 30 billion of inflows versus current foreign ownership of USD 17.8 billion. The monthly inflows of USD 3 billion would start in Q4FY23  spanning over 10 months until Q2FY24  they said.Currently  there are 20 bonds in the FAR (Fully Accessible Route) list with total outstanding of USD 263 billion  and they are eligible for actual inclusion.The report assumes that monthly increase of the FAR list bonds is USD 10 billion in the next 12 months  which means that eligible bonds will be about USD 360 billion in second half (H2) of 2023  making it the second-biggest bond market after China in the index.As a result  India would join the 10 per cent club with China and Indonesia while the other 10 per cent countries -- Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa -- will see their weight dropping. The biggest fall will be for Thailand (-1.4 per cent)  Poland (-1.4 per cent)  South Africa (-1.3 per cent)  the Czech Republic (-1 per cent) and Brazil (-0.8 per cent).The government has to make some changes in capital gains tax norms to address the questions from Euroclear  which is a necessary condition for the index inclusion.Additional forex inflows would help shore up current account and balance of payments  which are facing huge headwinds this fiscal due to crude price rise and increase in other imports.Consensus view is that the Q2 CAD (Current Account Deficit) will jump to 5 per cent from 3.6 per cent in Q1  which will be the highest CAD since Q3FY12 and close the FY23 at 3.5 per cent as they expect crude and commodity prices to soften from the second half of the fiscal.The Morgan Stanley strategists see two key takeaways from the inclusion: the index team now has more incentive to include India on the back of Russia 's exclusion; and most GBI-EM investors either support or don't object to the inclusion.They also expect India to achieve 10 per cent in the GBI-EM index once inclusion is completed at the expense of Thailand  Poland  South Africa  the Czech Republic and Brazil.Investors need a long lead time for the inclusion  hence we expect the actual inclusion to happen in Q3 of 2023. We believe that Euroclear is still achievable ahead of the actual inclusion.Stating that 2022 budget disappointed a bit on the inclusion side  they said ""after our visit to India in July and talking to officials  we felt that the government is still open and keen to have the index inclusion"". They also admit that the inclusion per se doesn't trigger inflows but it can improve sentiment.In the index review last October  India was put on the watch list as 60 per cent of investors supported the decision.According to the report  JPM has already said that India needed to improve market access  trading and settlement to achieve index inclusion and said achieving Euroclear will improve market access significantly.""While India made some progress in the past 10 months  we don't feel that this is material enough to change the overall assessment."" But what happened in February/ March changed the dynamics  as Russia  with close to 8 per cent weight  was excluded from the index. The result is that now seven countries in the GBI-EM index have a 10 per cent weight: China  Indonesia  Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa  making the index quite unbalanced  they argued.The GBI-EM index now has 20 countries. This means that the other 13 countries share the remaining 30 per cent  which never happened before as in the past  the top seven countries accounted for an average of 64 per cent of the index. Even back in 2016 when the top seven of the 15 countries accounted for 68 per cent.Since exclusion of Russia has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced  JPM has more incentive to include India  even without Euroclear  as long as GBI-EM investors don't object to that  they said.They said their in-house survey shows that 60 per cent of real money investors are either fully ready for index inclusion or almost ready  while their proprietary GBI-EM positioning tracker shows that investors have been actively managing India as an off-benchmark holding  although they have been cutting both duration and forex risks in the past few months.",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.06,0.19,0.75,True,English,"['global bond index', 'JP Morgan', 'next week', 'Morgan Stanley', 'G-Secs', 'close to 8 per cent weight', 'Fully Accessible Route) list', 'finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'capital gains tax norms', 'The Morgan Stanley strategists', 'other 10 per cent countries', 'Wall Street brokerage', 'natural, logical conclusion', 'Rs 84.7 lakh crore', 'Rs 40.4 lakh crore', 'Gek Teng Khoo', 'two key takeaways', 'long lead time', 'current foreign ownership', '10 per cent weight', 'stamp duty breaks', '10 per cent club', 'major JP Morgan', 'Current Account Deficit', 'Additional forex inflows', 'crude price rise', 'Global fund flows', 'The GBI-EM index', 'biggest bond market', 'global bond indices', 'FAR list bonds', 'most GBI-EM investors', 'USD 30 billon inflows', '5 per cent', '3.6 per cent', '60 per cent', 'weight dropping', 'watch list', 'seven countries', 'tax breaks', 'global situation', 'other reasons', 'other imports', 'biggest fall', 'market access', 'bond inclusion', 'next week', 'industry gathering', 'international indices', 'many reasons', 'Covid pandemic', 'RBI data', 'corporate bonds', 'Min Dai', 'Madan Reddy', 'good chance', 'necessary condition', 'monthly inflows', 'eligible bonds', 'second half', 'South Africa', 'Czech Republic', 'huge headwinds', 'Consensus view', 'Q2 CAD', 'highest CAD', 'commodity prices', 'overall assessment', 'index team', 'index review', 'next 12 months', 'past 10 months', 'actual inclusion', 'inclusion side', 'monthly increase', '2020 budget proposal', 'G-Secs Asset', 'index inclusion', 'Government Securities', '1.3 per', '20 bonds', '2022 budget', 'mind', 'announcement', 'regard', 'Monday', 'levels', 'details', 'timeline', 'statement', 'end-June', 'note', 'Tuesday', 'India', 'mid-September', 'country', 'clarity', 'Management', 'AUM', 'Q4FY23', 'Q2FY24', 'total', 'outstanding', 'report', 'China', 'result', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Malaysia', 'Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Poland', 'changes', 'questions', 'Euroclear', 'balance', 'payments', 'Q3FY12', 'fiscal', 'incentive', 'back', 'Russia', 'exclusion', 'expense', 'visit', 'July', 'officials', 'sentiment', 'decision', 'JPM', 'trading', 'settlement', 'progress', 'March', 'dynamics']",2022-09-06,2022-09-07,economictimes.indiatimes.com

Khussairiee Ahmad  Independent Non-Executive DirectorDear ShareholderAnnual General Meeting 2022I am writing to invite you to our 2022 Annual General Meeting  which will be held at our Head Office at Suite 2B-25-2  25th Floor  Block 2B  Plaza Sentral  Jalan Stesen 5  50470 Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  on Thursday 29 September 2022 at 4.30 p.m. (Malaysian Time). Whether or not you are able to attend the Annual General Meeting  please complete and return the enclosed proxy form. Further information on the ways you can appoint a proxy is given in Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. Completion and return of a proxy form will not prevent you from attending and voting in person at the Annual General Meeting.The consideration of resolutions at the Annual General Meeting is important. Your Directors believe that it is essential that the voting intentions of all shareholders are taken into account  not just those who are able to attend the Annual General Meeting. It is for this reason that all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting are voted on by way of a poll rather than a show of hands  as this allows the votes of all shareholders to be counted. Shareholders (or their duly appointed proxies) attending the Annual General Meeting will still have the opportunity to ask questions and vote on each resolution.You will find set out at the end of this document a notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company for 4.30 p.m. (Malaysian Time) on 29 September 2022  at which resolutions will be proposed:to receive and adopt the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year ended on 31 March 2022  and the Directors’ Report and the Independent Auditors’ Report on those accounts; to reappoint  as a Director  Shailen Popatlal  who  in accordance with the Articles  is required to retire by having been appointed since the law annual general meeting and  being eligible  offers himself for reappointment; to reappoint  as a Director  Simon James Retter who  in accordance with the Articles is required to retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting and  being eligible  offers himself for reappointment; to reappoint  as a Director  Dr Md. Khussairiee Ahmad who  in accordance with the Articles is required to retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting and  being eligible  offers himself for reappointment; to re-appoint Shipleys LLP as the auditors of the Company until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and to authorise the Directors to determine the level of the remuneration of the auditors; to grant the Directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company; and to disapply the statutory pre-emption rights for certain shares; to grant the Directors authority to purchase own shares;Resolutions 1 and 5 are self-explanatory. Information on the other resolutions is provided below. Resolutions 1 to 6 are ordinary resolutions which require to be passed with the approval of a simple majority of shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy or authorised representative. On a show of hands each shareholder so present has one vote  but should a poll be demanded each such shareholder has one vote for each share held by him or her. Resolutions 7 and 8 are special resolutions that require to be passed with the approval of 75% of shareholders  attending the meeting and entitled to vote. As described above the voting may be by a show of hands or by poll.Resolution 6: Authority to issue sharesResolution 6 seeks an authority to allot shares  subject to the normal pre-emption rights reserved to shareholders contained in the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”). The Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) recommends that a company seek an annual authority to allot up to a third of their issued share capital; however  the ABI have issued further guidelines permitting a company to seek authority to allot an additional third of their issued share capital  provided such additional third is reserved for fully pre-emptive rights issues of equity shares. Resolution 6 reflects the ABI’s recommendations.Resolution 7: Disapplication of pre-emption rightsResolution 7 covers the granting of a waiver of pre-emption rights over the number of shares in resolution 6  as applicable  and up to 20 per cent of the shares currently in issue for cash. The Directors consider it important to renew this authority. In addition  the resolution allows the disapplication of pre-emption rights to deal with the possibility of fractional entitlements and legal or regulatory restrictions to a share issue.Resolution 8: Authority to Purchase Own SharesResolution 8 seeks an authority  proposed as a special resolution  to make purchases up to a maximum of 15 000 000 ordinary shares (being approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the Latest Practicable Date) and specifies the maximum and minimum purchase prices for the shares. Any shares purchased by the Company under this authority would be cancelled or held as treasury shares. A maximum of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital may be held as treasury shares.Action to be takenA form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting is enclosed. Shareholders are advised to complete and return the form of proxy in accordance with the instructions printed on it so as to arrive at the Company’s registered office at MSP Corporate Services Limited at Eastcastle House  27/28 Eastcastle Street  London W1W 8DH  United Kingdom  as soon as possible  but in any event no later than 4.30 p.m. Malaysian time (9.30 a.m. BST) on 27 September 2022. The return of a form of proxy or the electronic appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting if you so wish.RecommendationThe Directors consider that the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders  and they recommend shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions.Yours faithfully ______________________Shailen PopatlalChairman6 September 2022Notice ofAnnual General meetingNOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF HRC WORLD PLC (THE “COMPANY”) WILL BE HELD AT SUITE 2B-25-2  25TH FLOOR  BLOCK 2B  PLAZA SENTRAL  JALAN STESEN 5  50470 KUALA LUMPUR  MALAYSIA ON THURSDAY 29 SEPTEMBER 2022 AT 4.30 P.M.

You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. In the event of a conflict between a blank proxy form and a proxy form which states the number of shares to which it applies  the specific proxy form shall be counted first  regardless of whether it was sent or received before or after the blank proxy form  and any remaining shares in respect of which you are the registered holder will be apportioned to the blank proxy form.

9531,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/jp-morgan-may-include-g-secs-in-global-bond-index-as-early-as-next-week-122090601106_1.html,'JP Morgan may include G-Secs in global bond index as early as next week',Even though govt is yet to make up its mind on inclusion of G-Secs in global bond indices  Morgan Stanley expects indices major JP Morgan to make an announcement in this regard as early as next week,"Even though the government is yet to make up its mind on inclusion of G-Secs (Government Securities) in global bond indices  brokerage expects indices major to make an announcement in this regard as early as next week.On Monday finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told an industry gathering that the 2020 budget proposal on allowing bond inclusion in indices could not move forward as the fund flows did not meet the desired levels  due to many reasons including the Covid pandemic.Without offering any details like a timeline or the tax and stamp duty breaks that investors were demanding  Sitharaman said: ""I don't know whether we're holding it back or not. I think global situation changed a lot since I made that statement in the 2020 budget.""Global fund flows have not been as big as we wanted it to be primarily due to other reasons. So it'll come to its natural  logical conclusion soon.""According to the RBI data  G-Secs outstanding stood at Rs 84.7 lakh crore  or over USD 1 trillion  as of end-June 2022 and the corporate bonds outstanding at Rs 40.4 lakh crore.In a note on Tuesday  strategists Min Dai  Madan Reddy and Gek Teng Khoo said that ""now we believe that there is a very good chance that will announce the index inclusion of India's in mid-September.""They also said they expect the inclusion to drive in as much as USD 30 billion into the country next fiscal alone  even though there is no clarity on the tax breaks  which is a necessary condition for inclusion.Explaining how they arrived at USD 30 billon inflows  they said G-Secs Asset Under Management (AUM) that is tracking the GBI-EM is about USD 300 billion. Hence  10 per cent weight for India in the index will attract USD 30 billion of inflows versus current foreign ownership of USD 17.8 billion. The monthly inflows of USD 3 billion would start in Q4FY23  spanning over 10 months until Q2FY24  they said.Currently  there are 20 bonds in the FAR (Fully Accessible Route) list with total outstanding of USD 263 billion  and they are eligible for actual inclusion.The report assumes that monthly increase of the FAR list bonds is USD 10 billion in the next 12 months  which means that eligible bonds will be about USD 360 billion in second half (H2) of 2023  making it the second-biggest after China in the index.As a result  India would join the 10 per cent club with China and Indonesia while the other 10 per cent countries -- Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa -- will see their weight dropping. The biggest fall will be for Thailand (-1.4 per cent)  Poland (-1.4 per cent)  South Africa (-1.3 per cent)  the Czech Republic (-1 per cent) and Brazil (-0.8 per cent).The government has to make some changes in capital gains tax norms to address the questions from Euroclear  which is a necessary condition for the index inclusion.Additional forex inflows would help shore up current account and balance of payments  which are facing huge headwinds this fiscal due to crude price rise and increase in other imports.Consensus view is that the Q2 CAD (Current Account Deficit) will jump to 5 per cent from 3.6 per cent in Q1  which will be the highest CAD since Q3FY12 and close the FY23 at 3.5 per cent as they expect crude and commodity prices to soften from the second half of the fiscal.The strategists see two key takeaways from the inclusion: the index team now has more incentive to include India on the back of Russia's exclusion; and most GBI-EM investors either support or don't object to the inclusion.They also expect India to achieve 10 per cent in the GBI-EM index once inclusion is completed at the expense of Thailand  Poland  South Africa  the Czech Republic and Brazil.Investors need a long lead time for the inclusion  hence we expect the actual inclusion to happen in Q3 of 2023. We believe that Euroclear is still achievable ahead of the actual inclusion.Stating that 2022 budget disappointed a bit on the inclusion side  they said ""after our visit to India in July and talking to officials  we felt that the government is still open and keen to have the index inclusion"". They also admit that the inclusion per se doesn't trigger inflows but it can improve sentiment.In the index review last October  India was put on the watch list as 60 per cent of investors supported the decision.According to the report  JPM has already said that India needed to improve market access  trading and settlement to achieve index inclusion and said achieving Euroclear will improve market access significantly.""While India made some progress in the past 10 months  we don't feel that this is material enough to change the overall assessment."" But what happened in February/ March changed the dynamics  as Russia  with close to 8 per cent weight  was excluded from the index. The result is that now seven countries in the GBI-EM index have a 10 per cent weight: China  Indonesia  Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa  making the index quite unbalanced  they argued.The GBI-EM index now has 20 countries. This means that the other 13 countries share the remaining 30 per cent  which never happened before as in the past  the top seven countries accounted for an average of 64 per cent of the index. Even back in 2016 when the top seven of the 15 countries accounted for 68 per cent.Since exclusion of Russia has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced  JPM has more incentive to include India  even without Euroclear  as long as GBI-EM investors don't object to that  they said.They said their in-house survey shows that 60 per cent of real money investors are either fully ready for index inclusion or almost ready  while their proprietary GBI-EM positioning tracker shows that investors have been actively managing India as an off-benchmark holding  although they have been cutting both duration and forex risks in the past few months.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.06,0.2,0.74,True,English,"['global bond index', 'JP Morgan', 'next week', 'G-Secs', 'close to 8 per cent weight', 'Fully Accessible Route) list', 'finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'capital gains tax norms', 'other 10 per cent countries', 'natural, logical conclusion', 'Rs 84.7 lakh crore', 'Rs 40.4 lakh crore', 'Gek Teng Khoo', 'two key takeaways', 'long lead time', 'current foreign ownership', 'stamp duty breaks', '10 per cent weight', 'Current Account Deficit', '10 per cent club', 'Additional forex inflows', 'crude price rise', 'Global fund flows', 'USD 30 billon inflows', 'FAR list bonds', 'The GBI-EM index', 'global bond indices', 'most GBI-EM investors', 'weight dropping', '5 per cent', '3.6 per cent', '60 per cent', 'watch list', 'tax breaks', 'other 13 countries', 'global situation', 'other reasons', 'other imports', 'seven countries', 'next week', 'industry gathering', 'many reasons', 'Covid pandemic', 'RBI data', 'corporate bonds', 'Min Dai', 'Madan Reddy', 'good chance', 'necessary condition', 'monthly inflows', 'eligible bonds', 'second half', 'South Africa', 'biggest fall', 'Czech Republic', 'huge headwinds', 'Consensus view', 'Q2 CAD', 'highest CAD', 'commodity prices', 'market access', 'overall assessment', 'bond inclusion', 'index team', 'index review', 'next 12 months', 'past 10 months', 'monthly increase', 'actual inclusion', 'inclusion side', '2020 budget proposal', 'G-Secs Asset', 'Government Securities', 'index inclusion', '20 countries', '20 bonds', '2022 budget', 'mind', 'brokerage', 'major', 'announcement', 'regard', 'Monday', 'levels', 'details', 'timeline', 'statement', 'end-June', 'note', 'Tuesday', 'strategists', 'India', 'mid-September', 'country', 'clarity', 'Management', 'AUM', 'Q4FY23', 'Q2FY24', 'total', 'outstanding', 'report', 'China', 'result', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Malaysia', 'Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Poland', 'changes', 'questions', 'Euroclear', 'balance', 'payments', 'Q3FY12', 'fiscal', 'incentive', 'back', 'Russia', 'exclusion', 'expense', 'visit', 'July', 'officials', 'sentiment', 'decision', 'JPM', 'trading', 'settlement', 'progress', 'March', 'dynamics', 'remai']",2022-09-06,2022-09-07,business-standard.com

Artprice counted a record number of auction transactions around the world and observes a growing enthusiasm for works by artists from the second half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century  whose prices are highly volatile.Four indicators of the health of global Fine Art auction activity in H1 2022Four indicators of the health of global Fine Art auction activity in H1 2022 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) Ferdinand Hodler  Der Brienzersee von Breitlauenen aus (1906); sold for CHF 2 875 000 (~$3 million) on 17 June 2022 by Galerie Kornfeld in Bern (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1891851/Artmarket_Fine_Art_Infographic.jpgthierry Ehrmann  President  and Founder of Artmarket.com: ""A comprehensive study of the results of public auctions reveals growing competition between New York  London  and Hong Kong. This competition is rapidly inflating the prices of works by young artists to levels usually reserved for great masters. On the occasion of the Frieze London and Paris+ fairs (the latter run by Art Basel)  Artprice will be publishing an exclusive report dedicated to 'Ultra Contemporary' Art: a term that designates a dynamic that is developing around artists under 40 years old  like Matthew Wong  Avery Singer  and Refik Anadol.The analysis of the Art Market presented in this H1 2022 Report is based on the Fine Art public auction results recorded by Artprice and only concerns paintings  sculptures  drawings  photographs  prints  videos  installations  tapestries as well as NFTs  and excludes antiquities  anonymous cultural property  and furniture. All prices indicated in this Report refer to public auction results  including buyers' fees  and the $ sign refers to the US dollar.H1 2022 KEY FIGURESGlobal Fine Art auction proceeds reached $7.49 billion .. The art market's 5th most prosperous H1 period ever recorded.An increase of 8.8% versus H1 2021.A record 326 000 lots sold in H1 2022 versus 313 400 in H1 2021Christie's hammered the 2nd best art auction result of all time at $195 million .. The unsold rate rose to 31% versus 27% in H1 2021.With a turnover of $3.27 billion   New York was clearly the world's leading marketplace.  was clearly the world's leading marketplace. In second and third place  London hammered $1.43 billion and Hong Kong took $610 million .hammered and took . Not far behind  the Parisian art market generated $518 million and has attracted a growing number of international institutions.and has attracted a growing number of international institutions. Christie's and Sotheby's account for 38% of global fine art turnover.The Macklowe Collection became the most expensive collection ever sold in the world  generating $922 million .. 180 NFTs sold at auction generating $8.5 million .ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE ART MARKETAs the health crisis wanes worldwide  Fine Art auctions settled down to an unsold rate of 31%  almost one in three works offered for sale. This level corresponds to a stable average over the last twenty years  fluctuating between 36% in 2009 and 27% in 2021. Indeed  this key market indicator has reacted quite differently compared with how it reacted in the last major crisis that affected the global art market  the 2009 financial crisis. Back then  collectors decided to take less financial risk  whereas the health crisis of 2021 prompted buyers to switch to a new entirely dematerialized sales channel.In the first half of 2022  the market found a new balance thanks to the coexistence of two different and complementary sales channels (one physical  the other digital)  which allowed auction transactions to continue at a healthy pace reaching a historic number of 326 000 Fine Art lots in six months. In H1 2022 this volume further increased to an unprecedented intensity  despite the postponement of many auctions in China (whose turnover volume is down 53%) due to an additional wave of Covid-19.The United States (up 42% vs. H1 2021) and the UK (up 26%) have driven growth. The two powerful Anglo-Saxon markets alone accounted for exactly two-thirds of global Fine Art auction turnover. China  for its part  only accounted for 12% of global fine art auction turnover  a result that it owes in large part to Hong Kong which accounted for 70% of the value of the entire Chinese art market (including Hong Kong  Macao  and Taiwan).France continued to grow (+14%) consolidating its 4th place ahead of Germany (-5%) after a sensational performance in 2021. In addition to the presence of Christie's and Sotheby's  several Parisian auction operators posted exceptionally strong performances: Artcurial (+42%) and Aguttes (+154%)  among others. Meanwhile  The French capital is attracting a growing number of major international players like David Zwirner  while the Gagosian and Continua galleries have opened new spaces in France. Paris is delighted to see the upcoming arrival of Hauser & Wirth as well as the opening of a Phillips auction room. Bonhams has acquired the French house Cornette de Saint-Cyr (operating in Paris and Brussels). Lastly  the Art Basel company will henceforth be the official organizer of the international autumn art fair organized at the Grand Palais in Paris  entitled Paris+  which will replace the FIAC.Japan and Switzerland also had an excellent start to 2022 with increases of 74% and 145% in their respective auction turnover totals. Without directly competing with Hong Kong (which still weighs seven times more)  Tokyo is positioning itself on the Asian continent as a hub for major contemporary artists  including Andy Warhol  Yoshitomo Nara  Yayoi Kusama  but also young talents like Mr Doodle and Ayako Rokkaku (born in 1982)  whose auction sales have already exceeded $18.6 million this year. For its part  Switzerland is continuing to carve out a place for itself in the Post-Impressionist and Modern Art market  with sales of important works by Ferdinand Hodler  Alberto Giacometti  and Marc Chagall.Ferdinand Hodler  Der Brienzersee von Breitlauenen aus (1906); sold for CHF 2 875 000 (~$3 million) on 17 June 2022 by Galerie Kornfeld in BernPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1891852/Artmarket_Ferdinand_Hodler.jpghttps://www.artprice.com/artist/13632/ferdinand-hodler/painting/27034374/der-brienzersee-von-breitlauenen- ausTRENDS: NFTs AND ULTRA CONTEMPORARY ARTPropelled to center stage in March 2021 with a first public auction result at $69.4 million  NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have created something of a revolution in the art market  with a new type of work  new collectors  and a new currency.Of the 277 NFTs auctioned in H1 2022  65% sold for an average price of $47 000. This situation is very different from H2 2021 in which 225 NFTs were offered for sale  of which 86% sold at an average price of $520 000. Beeple's Human One (2021) fetched nearly $29 million last November at Christie's  whereas the best NFT result in H1 2022 was just $1.38 million for Living Architecture: Casa Batlló (2022) by Refik Anadol.The 104 CryptoPunks that Sotheby's announced in February 2022 were finally withdrawn on the eve of their scheduled sale. The withdrawal of such a lot  estimated between $20 and $30 million  underscores the extent to which NFT market players remain somewhat skeptical about the service provided by traditional intermediaries. Not only are they expensive (transaction costs amount to an average of 20% compared with around 2% to 3% via NFT platforms) but they also are governed by a much less flexible schedule. The major auction houses are nevertheless continuing their efforts to participate in this emerging market  although they only very rarely sell major NFT collections (BAYC  WoW  etc.). For the time being  such projects no longer seem to need the marketing efforts or the legitimacy of regulated auction houses.At the same time  the volatility of cryptocurrencies  has exacerbated the mistrust of traditional collectors vis-à-vis this disruptive market. Fortunately  this lull will provide a good number of artists  dealers  collectors  and institutions – starting with museums – an opportunity to take an interest in digital works and to consider acquiring NFTs without the pressure of record sales and over-mediatization.https://www.artprice.com/nftThe NFT phenomenon stems from the same enthusiasm that Artprice is observing for the work of young artists  some of whom are eliciting record multi-million dollar results even before their work has been exhibited in a major museum or before they have even enjoyed a solo show in a gallery. The recent auction records for works by artists under 40 (whose very recent works are already trading on the secondary market) will be analyzed by the next Artprice Ultra Contemporary Art Report to be published in October 2022. This will notably be an opportunity to highlight the growing success and influence of young female painters.Top 10 personal records for living artists under 40 at auction in H1 2022©artprice.com1.

Jordy Kerwick (1982): $277 200FIVE EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS IN H1 2022Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn elicited the second highest ever art auction bid. For the first time since Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi in November 2017 (four and a half years ago)  the ultra-high-end market is back with a result that once again questions the notion of an absolute masterpiece and its value. The charity sale that produced this result was guaranteed by Christie's and ended with a result of $195 million (including fees). The 'painting' was acquired by Larry Gagosian himself  the powerful gallery owner who had already sold the canvas to Thomas Ammann in the early 1980s.https://www.artprice.com/artist/30269/andy-warhol/painting/26798865/shot-sage-blue-marilyn?p=1The French auction house Artcurial had the honor of presenting an exceptional still-life by Jean-Baptiste Chardin  Le panier de fraises des bois  painted in 1761 and exhibited the same year at the Grand Salon in Paris. While this was the first appearance of this painting at auction  art expert Eric Turquin insists on the immense historical importance of the work  importance to which the labels on the back of the painting attest  having been included in many prestigious exhibitions around the world. A gentle and magic painting  the Jean-Baptiste Chardin masterpiece was estimated between $13 and $16 million and finally sold for $26.8 million.https://www.artprice.com/artist/45915/jean-baptiste-simeon-chardin/painting/26388579/le-panier-de-fraises-des-bois?p=1The biggest sensation of the year was undoubtedly created by the canvas The Sugar Shack (1976) by Ernie Barnes (1938 - 2009). Last year  the African-American painter set a new auction record at $550 000. But on 12 May this year  Christie's proposed his painting The Sugar Shack (1976) in New York with an estimate of $150 000 - $200 000. The work finally sold for $15 275 000  more than 100 times the low estimate. In the days and weeks that followed  six more important Ernie Barnes paintings were offered at Christie's and Bonhams  and they all sold well beyond their estimates.Last year  the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama became the first female artist to enter the world's Top 10 performing artists as calculated by Artprice (all periods of creation combined). She was also the third best performing living artist of the year behind Gerhard Richter and Banksy. This year  Yayoi Kusama has repeated that performance with 208 lots sold worldwide for more than $115 million. She also set a new auction record when her Untitled (Nets) (1959) reached $10.5 million at Phillips on 18 May 2022.https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/yayoi-kusama -at-last-a-female-artist-in-the-global-top-10Matthew Wong would have been 38 if he hadn't taken his own life in 2019. Since his death  his paintings have enjoyed stunning success in auction rooms. On 19 May 2022  his Night Watcher (2018) was acquired for $5.9 million at Christie's New York.

Further  the data show that patients on continuous daily treatment with 50mg obefazimod during the 48 weeks maintenance trial experienced new or maintained clinical response  clinical remission  endoscopic improvement and endoscopic remission.[4]Prof. Séverine Vermeire  M.D.  Ph.D.  Head of the IBD Center at the University Hospitals Leuven  Belgium  and principal investigator of the study  said: ""As principal investigator  I am pleased that these very promising results of the phase 2b induction and 48-week maintenance study have been published in the renowned journal The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology. This validates the safety and efficacy data generated with obefazimod in the initial phase 2a study in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis  including in a patient population refractory to biologics and/or JAK inhibitor treatments. I am impatient to start the global phase 3 program in UC and confident that we can confirm the rapid onset of action and maintained efficacy of obefazimod along with its good safety profile.""Prof. Bruce Sands  M.D.  M.S.  the Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York City  NY  added[5]: ""The data generated so far with obefazimod in the phase 2a and phase 2b induction and maintenance studies gives reason to believe that this drug candidate may change the treatment paradigm for bio-naïve as well as refractory ulcerative colitis patients. The maintained efficacy signal and the good tolerability profile differentiate obefazimod from many other products on the market or in late-stage testing in UC. Further  it offers an easy once-daily oral administration. I am glad to be the lead investigator in the US for the phase 3 testing of this promising molecule.""Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax  commented: ""This publication of obefazimod phase 2b induction and maintenance data in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients in the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology is a great achievement for Abivax. This is very meaningful recognition by the scientific community that obefazimod has the potential to become a safe and effective chronic treatment for UC patients  relieving symptoms and improving quality of life in the long run. Abivax's current priority is the swift start and completion of the global phase 3 program in order to support NDA and MAA review by regulatory agencies to allow obefazimod approval and availability to UC patients in need of innovative  alternative therapeutic options.""254 patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis were enrolled into the phase 2b clinical study and dosed with obefazimod within three once-daily oral treatment groups (25mg  50mg and 100mg) or placebo. 50% of these patients had inadequate response  loss of response  or intolerance to biologics and/or JAK inhibitor treatments while the other 50% were refractory to conventional treatments. Endoscopies were read centrally and blinded by independent reviewers. The baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across all dose groups of obefazimod and the placebo group. Enrolled patients suffered from longstanding UC with an overall mean disease duration of 8.05 years and 71.4% of the patients showed a severe disease profile (baseline modified Mayo Score of 7 to 9 points).At week 8 of the induction study  the primary endpoint (statistically significant reduction of Modified Mayo Score) was met with once-daily administration of obefazimod (25mg  50mg  100mg).Further  all key secondary endpoints  including endoscopic improvement  clinical remission  clinical response and the reduction of fecal calprotectin showed significant difference in patients dosed with obefazimod compared to placebo. Importantly  obefazimod also showed rapid efficacy in patients who were previously exposed to biologics and/or JAK inhibitors treatment.97.7% (217/222) of all patients who completed the phase 2b induction study  irrespective of treatments or treatment outcome during the induction phase  enrolled in the open-label maintenance study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy profile of obefazimod for up to two years.Out of these 217 patients  the 48-week data of the first 78 patients were available at the time of manuscript preparation.Meanwhile  Abivax confirmed the data of these first 78 maintenance patients and reported excellent results from the entire cohort of its phase 2b open-label maintenance study in April this year. This interim analysis after one year once-daily treatment with 50mg obefazimod included all 217 patients who enrolled into the maintenance study and the data emphasizes the capacity of obefazimod to maintain and further improve patient outcomes over time  as well as its continued favorable safety and tolerability.During the induction and the maintenance phases of the 2b study  obefazimod continued to show a good tolerability profile  confirming the data already generated in over 1 000 patients and volunteers treated with obefazimod so far.Global pivotal phase 3 clinical program with obefazimod in ulcerative colitisThe initiation of the global phase 3 clinical program with obefazimod for the treatment of moderate to severe UC is on track and the ""First-Patient-In"" is scheduled for end of September 2022.In consultation with international regulators  including the US and European regulatory agencies (FDA and EMA)  25mg and 50mg will be investigated in phase 3 for both induction and subsequent maintenance in UC.Abivax is working with IQVIA  a global premier CRO  to jointly set-up and conduct these studies across Europe  the US  Japan and other global geographies.Currently  more than 430 study sites  out of the targeted 600 sites  have already been qualified for the phase 3 trials.*****About Abivax (www.abivax.com)Abivax  a phase 3 clinical stage biotechnology company  is developing novel therapies that modulate the body's natural immune machinery to treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases  viral infections  and cancer.

It can be accessed via the following link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00502-3/fulltext.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “This Lancet publication is a strong scientific and developmental validation of the work that has been accomplished at Valneva. We are pleased that more detailed results on our inactivated COVID-19 vaccine are now available to the scientific and broader public health communities.”Valneva reported positive topline Phase 3 results for VLA2001 in October 20211.In August 2022  the World Health Organization issued recommendations for use of Valneva’s inactivated COVID-19 vaccine2.The Company published safety and immunogenicity data from the Phase 1/2 trial of VLA2001 in the Journal of Infection3 in June 2022.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe4 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom5 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates6 and Kingdom of Bahrain7. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States8 and the Kingdom of Bahrain9. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200110. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine11. Valneva is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase. In parallel  the Company is continuing discussions with various other governments around the world  with the aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets in the next six to twelve months.Story continuesAbout Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

9577,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4539041-intercontinental-exchange-the-house-always-wins,Intercontinental Exchange: The House Always Wins (NYSE:ICE),Intercontinental Exchange has had a torrid year so far. Click here to read about ICE stock's valuation analysis and why rate it a Buy.,"Spencer Platt/Getty Images NewsThis has been a torrid year for Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE). Its share price declined from $133.95 at the beginning to the year  to $101.28 as of Sep. 3  2022. I have no doubt that all that ICE is a fantastic business operating in a fantastic industry. So for me the exam question is: Is $101.28 an attractive price at which to buy its shares  given that most probably a recession is about to come?I believe ICE is materially undervalued at the present  that it had a consistently excellent track record in the past  and that its long-term future prospects are brilliant. In this article I explain why.Company profileICE operates three lines of businesses: Exchanges; Fixed Income and Data Services; and Mortgage Technologies. In the Exchanges segment  ICE operates a number of regulated marketplaces for trading and clearing financial instruments  such as shares and derivatives (think the New York Stock Exchange  which it owns). In the Fixed Income and Data Services  ICE provides services such as fixed income pricing  reference data  indices  and analytics. In the Mortgage Technologies segment  ICE uses machine learning algorithms to provide streamlined and simplified solutions for mortgage lenders  which allow them to originate loans more efficiently.They have minority stakes in subsidiary companies. Among them the point of interest is Bakkt  the black sheep of the family. I will touch on it briefly later.Their main competitors are other exchanges based in the US  such as Nasdaq (NDAQ) and the CME Group (CME). They also compete against exchanges worldwide  such as the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF).Some statistics at a glance  as of close of business on Sep. 3  2022:Share price: $101.28Market cap: $57.0 billionP/E ratio: 17.0Debt / EBITDA ratio: 2.4Operating margin: 38.2%Profit margin: 23.5%Upside caseIn this section I describe why I believe ICE shares are undervalued.DCF ValuationI use the discounted cash flow method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 45% above its current price. I consider DCF appropriate to use for the valuation because in the last 10 years ICE has been profitable every year  and has paid out dividends in every year.Moreover  the amount of dividends paid has increased steadily over time. In 2021  each share paid $1.32 in dividends; in 2014  the first full year when ICE paid dividends every quarter  that was $0.13: a highly attractive CAGR of 14.2%.The DCF method gives the fair present value of a share as:V0 = D1 / (r - g)Calculating gI estimate g  the sustainable growth rate for ICE  as:g = RR x ROEMy review of sell-side analyst reports suggests that the median forward-looking return on equity (ROE) for ICE is slightly below 14%. For simplicity  I round this down and set ROE as 13%.On a trailing twelve months basis (for the avoidance of doubt  from Q3 2021 through to Q2 2022)  ICE has earnings per share of $5.97  and paid a dividend of $1.42. The retention ratio is calculated as retained earnings divided by earnings per share. In this case  I find that the retention ratio is 76.2%.This yields a sustainable dividend growth rate of 9.9%. I note that this is materially above the S&P 500's historical dividend CAGR of 6.5%  but it is materially below ICE's historical dividend CAGR (14.2%)  as well as its net profit CAGR (15.2%)--not only are exchanges profitable businesses  ICE is also nursing a number of promising ventures in the wings. Therefore  I consider 9.9% a conservative estimate of ICE's dividend growth rate.Calculating D1ICE pays dividends quarterly. Therefore  I set D1 as the sum of the four dividend payments in the next twelve months  which will occur in Sep. and Dec. 2022  and Mar. and Jun. 2023.ICE has already declared a dividend of $1.52 for the year 2022. Of this amount  they have paid half in March and June  and they will pay the other half in September and December. Therefore  I set $0.76 as first half of D1.I assume the dividend payments in March and June 2023 will grow at the sustainable growth rate of 9.9%. Therefore  I set $0.84 as second half of D1.In this case  I set D1 as $1.60.Calculating rI estimate r  my required rate of return for ICE  as:r = RFR + beta * (TMR - RFR)Since the inception of the S&P 500 in 1957  it has provided investors with an annualised total return of 11.88%. I use the most recent Effective Fed Funds Rate for which data is available (as of August 2022) of 2.33% as the risk free rate. I note that ICE's 5-year monthly equity beta is around 0.90.Therefore  I calculate the required rate of return for ICE asr = 2.44% + 0.9 * (11.88% - 2.33%) = 10.93%.For simplicity  I round up my required rate of return to 11%.Calculating V0In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $1.60 / (11% - 9.9%) = $146.50. This is 45% above its current price of $101.28 as of Sep. 2  2022: a substantial margin of safety.I show my work in Table 1 below.Table 1: DCF valuationEPS $ [a] 5.97 Dividend in Year 0 $ [b] 1.42 Retention ratio % [c] = 1- [a]/[b] 76.2 ROE % [d] 13 Sustainable growth % [e] = [c]*[d] 9.9 Required rate of return % [f] 11.0 Dividend in Year 1 $ [g] 1.60 Fair value in Year 0 $ [h] = [g]/([f]-[e]) 146.50 Share price at valuation date $ [i] 101.28 Implied upside % [j] = [h] / [i] - 1 45 Click to enlargeEV/EBITDA ValuationAs a cross-check  I use the EV/EBITDA valuation method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 47% above its current price. I favour the DCF approach (when it is feasible) over the EV/EBITDA approach  as the method of finding suitable comparables is  in my view  neither exactly a science nor an art  but something close to black magic--highly subjective and sensitive to manipulation.Nevertheless  EV/EBITDA can be useful as a sense-check to the DCF approach. Let's take a look.I select five comparables for ICE: NASDAQ  CME  Cboe (CBOE)  the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and the Japan Exchange Group (JPX). In Table 2 below I note the values for their EVs  EBITDAs  and the corresponding ratios  as well as the average of their EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.9x. (Note that I cannot use Euronext  because it has negative EV.)Table 2: EV / EBITDA ratiosComparators EV EBITDA EV / EBITDA NASDAQ $ b 35.0 1.9 18.9 Cboe $ b 14.5 0.6 25.6 CME Group $ b 73.1 4.2 17.3 LSEG $ b 60.6 4.4 13.9 JPX $ b 6.8 0.8 8.8 Average 16.9 Click to enlargeI apply the average ratio of 16.9x to estimate the fair value of ICE's EV. I note that EV is the sum of market capitalisation and total debt  less cash and cash equivalents. Therefore  I subtract  from my estimate of the fair value of ICE's EV  the total debt  and then add back cash and cash equivalents  to arrive at a fair estimate of ICE's market capitalisation.In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $148.70. This is 47% above its current price of $101.28 as of Sep. 2  2022: a substantial margin of safety.I show my calculations in Table 3 below.Table 3: EV / EBITDA valuationEBITDA $ b [a] 6.0 Fair value EV $ b [b] = [a] x 16.9 101.2 Total debt $ b [c] 18.4 Cash and cash equivalents $ b [d] 0.8 Fair value market cap $ b [e] = [b]-[c]+[d] 83.7 Actual market cap $ b [f] 57.0 Implied upside [g] = [e]/[f]-1 47% Share price at valuation date $ [h] 101.28 Implied fair value of share price $ [i] = [h]*(1+[g]) 148.70 Click to enlargeExcellent track record and brilliant prospectsICE has been expanding steadily over the last 10 years. They have been consistently profitable  and their profits have been growing. For me  this is one of the main selling points for the company.ICE has experienced a 19.9% CAGR for revenues since 2011. The breakthrough came in November 2013  when ICE completed its acquisition of what is now its flagship  the New York Stock Exchange. Revenues surged from $1.7 billion in 2013 to $4.4 billion in 2014  and never looked back--in 2021  ICE booked $9.2 billion in revenue. I show this in Figure 1.Figure 1: Historical revenue growthI pro-rate 2022 revenue by multiplying revenues in the first two quarters by two. (My analysis  based ICE financial statements)While ICE's flagship Exchanges segment is doing very well  the exponential growth of its Mortgage Technology is especially exciting. ICE aims to streamline and automate the mortgage lending procedure by using machine learning algorithms to train over its data (of which it has voluminous amounts) to find and match the optimal mortgage to the optimal applicant. This can improve the accuracy  and cut down the salary costs and human errors  of using human employees for the same work.If they successfully corner this part of the market  I expect this segment to do very well indeed--ICE has a comparative advantage not just in its scale and financial resources  but also the amount of data it has to train its algorithms with. That's why I believe ICE's Mortgage Technology is a promising venture with a strong potential of earning rapid growth in sales and profits.Next  I show in Figure 2 the gross  operating  and net profit margins for ICE.Figure 2: Historical marginsI use Q2 margins for 2022  and end-of-year margins for all other years (My analysis  based on ICE financial statements)As Figure 2 shows  ICE does not have much in the way of margins growth historically. But I do not think that is an issue  because their margins are already excellent. ICE has a deep and  in my view  impregnable ""economic moat"" beloved of Warren Buffett  with which it safeguards its business and its lucrative returns.Because for companies that want to list shares  and for investors who want to trade them  where can they turn to if not ICE? There is  of course  NASDAQ  but it focuses on tech and is not suitable for much of America's ""traditional"" economy such as oil and gas  automotive manufacturing  and banks. CME and Cboe come next  but the first is predominantly commodities and the second predominantly options. All of them compete in the same markets that ICE operates in  of course; but for equity shares  and especially American ones  the New York Stock Exchange and its owner ICE reign supreme.Potential risksI consider three main risks to ICE.The coming recessionThe first  and the most significant  is the looming recession. Obviously  recessions are bad for business  but they could be extremely damaging to the business of exchanges. In economic booms people have lots of money and even more self-confidence  and everyone thinks they can get rich by trading. And every silly loss-making idea with a baby-faced smooth talker can make billions floating their business on exchanges like ICE.That is fair enough--it generates a great deal of business activities and transaction fees for ICE. But in recessions  people stop trading. They stop doing IPOs and they certainly stop doing SPACs. They begin getting defensive and start hoarding cash. If there comes a recession  and I think it will come  ICE's revenue will dry up. Or  in their words: ""A stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering  or IPO  market... could have an adverse effect on our revenues."" (p. 22)In the last recession  ICE's share price collapsed from about $38 in Dec. 28  2007 to $12 in Mar. 6  2009--a 68% decline. It's not just ICE: comparable exchanges  like the LSEG  experienced similarly sharp declines  from about £18 in Dec. 28  2007 to £4 in Mar. 6  2009--a 78% decline.With the benefit of hindsight  we can all see that the market was grossly undervaluing their shares during a recession. Sure  but how good are your nerves? Can you endure a 70% share price decline for over a year?Regulatory risksOne of the previous articles on Seeking Alpha characterised ICE as a company that ""operates quietly in the background"". I do not know what gave that author such an impression  but ICE is a magnet for regulatory attention. Aside from the FTC's review of its proposed merger with Black Knight  I am also aware that CMA may be considering to begin a preliminary abuse-of-domination review of ICE. Meanwhile  ICE also has to deal with the vortex of changing financial regulations  with eagle-eyed regulators waiting on all sides for the slightest slip-up to pounce.ICE is a hugely successful  very profitable company with strong market power and high margins: exactly the kind of company that governments  journalists  and voters (especially in the UK and Europe  but also sadly increasingly in the US) love to hate. For competition regulators  taking on high-profile companies like ICE is a quick and sure way to win plaudits and favourable media attention.Bakkt rektBakkt Holdings is a technology platform for the management of digital assets. That's well and good  but recently people have trouble buying gas to heat their homes and drive to work. They certainly don't want digital assets as much as before. ICE owns a 68% stake in Bakkt. When the company listed in late 2021  ICE booked a substantial income in capital gains from that stake on its income statement: in their 2021 financial statement they noted  with smug self-satisfaction  that 'We recorded a pre-tax gain on the (Bakkt) transaction of $1.4 billion' (p. 105). It's also the main reason why  as you may have noticed on Figure 2  that ICE has higher net profit margin than operating margin (the Bakkt gain is classified as a non-operating income).So what gives? Bakkt's share price  which plunged from a high of $42.56 to $2.56 as of Sep. 2  2022. How did ICE put it  also in their 2021 FS? ""We may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in Bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model."" (p. 20) No  they may not. Cryptos aren't trendy anymore  for the foreseeable future at least. Look forward for some material non-operating losses in 2022.ConclusionI rate ICE a buy because  given what we are certain of now  I believe the fair value of ICE shares is around 45% above the current market value of their shares. But I do not rate it a strong buy  because in my view ICE is far more sensitive than other firms to prolonged economic downturns  and I worry that one is coming soon. If you are a long-term investor  I do not believe you will regret having ICE in your portfolio; and I believe $101.28 is an attractive price to buy more ICE shares.But would it be smarter to wait for a recession to hit first  and then buy the market bottom? I don't know. I don't know!

The combined entity with over €12 billion in revenues is now born. Click here to read more.,"Baloncici/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesBefore commenting on the just released Capital Markets Day from Dufry (OTCPK:DUFRY)  we should report that the company held an extraordinary General Meeting for the merger with Autogrill (OTCPK:ATGSF; OTCPK:ATGSY). The go-ahead from Dufry shareholders represents the key step of the entire operation  which will now have to wait for the green light from the regulators including the Antitrust Authority. In detail  Dufry shareholders  including the private equity fund Advent (11%) and Alibaba (6%)  have approved all the items on the agenda including the future governance. According to the management  the offer will take place in the second half of 2023  probably already in Q1. This process will lead to the delisting of Autogrill from Euronext Milan  and the new Dufry will remain listed on the Zurich Exchange. As for governance  based on the agreement  once the integration is completed  three members of Edizione will be appointed to the board of directors. In particular  the honorary president will be Alessandro Benetton - whose entry into the Dufry board of directors was approved almost unanimously by the shareholders of the Swiss group with a percentage of more than 99% of the quorum present.As we already mentioned  the merger combination will create a global player in the catering and retail services sector with a strong presence in the United States and Europe and a significant base in the Asian markets. The new group will operate in a potential market worth around €105 billion. The merger has the dual objective: 1) developing a new range of products & services and 2) improving travelers' customer experience.Dufry's TAM (Dufry CMD)CMD details and financial implicationsMeeting the needs of new travelers and continuing to lead the Travel Experience are Dufry's strategic long-term goals. To achieve them  the Swiss group has developed a new strategy called ""Destination 2027"" which will rely on four pillars:A better travel experience for customers with a more personalized offer and new industrial collaboration; Geographical presence diversification. Thus  Dufry will invest to enter into fast-growing markets and protect itself from economic cycles and regional shocks; The third pillar aims to promote a culture of operational improvement to enhance the company's profitability and accelerate cash flow generation to reinvest for growth opportunities. More ESG investments.Dufry four pillars plan (Dufry CDM)Looking at the numbers  the ""Destination 2027"" plan will have a strong impact on Dufry's accounts. The company expects annual revenue growth of 5%-7% over the period 2025-2027 as well as improvements in the gross yearly core EBITDA margin from 30 to 40 basis points for the combined entity. On the other hand  the years 2023-2024 are considered for transition and could see an annual increase in turnover of just 7%-10%. In addition  the company aims at a conversion of FCF to core EBITDA of more than 20% in 2023-2024. A figure that could rise over 30% in the following period.Conclusion and ValuationToday  Dufry's stock price is in negative territory  and Wall Street analysts' consensus was forecasting a higher growth rate in the short term (numbers in hand  on average  they were expecting a growth of 21% in top-line sales in 2023). Looking at the negative comments  the current international macroeconomic context is characterized by high fuel prices that will have negative impacts on the travel and leisure sector. A higher addressable market with a new strategic plan for the two combined entities coupled with a strong recovery from travel demand is the recipe for a share rebound. After the half-year results comment  our internal team was already ahead of Wall Street analysts' estimates  so we decide to leave unchanged our target price at CHF 50 per share (based on a 3-stage Discount Cash Flow model with a WACC of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2%). In our initiation of coverage  we would like to report the following consideration - if we normalized the pre-COVID-19 cash generation and adjusted the operating cash flow margin at 13% with the structural saving guided by the management  the derived target price should be even higher.",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.26,0.15,0.59,True,English,"[""New 'Destination 2027' Plan"", 'Dufry', 'OTCMKTS', '3-stage Discount Cash Flow model', 'gross yearly core EBITDA margin', 'operating cash flow margin', ""Wall Street analysts' consensus"", 'current international macroeconomic context', ""Wall Street analysts' estimates"", 'cash flow generation', 'Dufry four pillars plan', 'pre-COVID-19 cash generation', 'extraordinary General Meeting', 'private equity fund', 'strategic long-term goals', '30 to 40 basis points', 'high fuel prices', 'half-year results comment', 'Geographical presence diversification', 'higher addressable market', 'two combined entities', 'higher growth rate', 'long-term growth rate', 'Capital Markets Day', 'new industrial collaboration', 'new strategic plan', 'annual revenue growth', ""travelers' customer experience"", 'retail services sector', 'Destination 2027"" plan', 'new travelers', 'strong presence', 'potential market', 'combined entity', 'annual increase', 'leisure sector', 'growth opportunities', 'Asian markets', 'growing markets', 'new group', 'new range', 'new strategy', 'Travel Experience', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'key step', 'entire operation', 'green light', 'Antitrust Authority', 'second half', 'Euronext Milan', 'Zurich Exchange', 'three members', 'honorary president', 'Alessandro Benetton', 'Swiss group', 'global player', 'United States', 'significant base', 'dual objective', 'CMD details', 'financial implications', 'economic cycles', 'regional shocks', 'third pillar', 'operational improvement', 'ESG investments', 'strong impact', 'stock price', 'negative territory', 'short term', 'top-line sales', 'negative comments', 'negative impacts', 'strong recovery', 'internal team', 'target price', 'following consideration', 'structural saving', 'new Dufry', 'travel demand', 'Dufry CMD', 'Dufry CDM', 'future governance', 'personalized offer', 'other hand', 'following period', 'share rebound', 'merger combination', 'Dufry shareholders', 'Dufry board', 'Baloncici', 'OTCPK', 'company', 'Autogrill', 'ATGSF', 'ATGSY', 'regulators', 'Advent', 'Alibaba', 'items', 'agenda', 'management', 'place', 'Q1.', 'process', 'delisting', 'agreement', 'integration', 'Edizione', 'directors', 'entry', 'percentage', 'quorum', 'present', 'catering', 'Europe', 'products', 'TAM', 'needs', 'customers', 'fast', 'culture', 'profitability', 'numbers', 'accounts', 'improvements', 'years', 'transition', 'turnover', 'addition', 'conversion', 'FCF', 'figure', 'Conclusion', 'Valuation', 'average', 'recipe', 'CHF', 'WACC', 'initiation', 'coverage']",2022-09-06,2022-09-07,seekingalpha.com

This competition is rapidly inflating the prices of works by young artists to levels usually reserved for great masters. On the occasion of the Frieze London and Paris+ fairs (the latter run by Art Basel)  Artprice will be publishing an exclusive report dedicated to 'Ultra Contemporary' Art: a term that designates a dynamic that is developing around artists under 40 years old  like Matthew Wong  Avery Singer  and Refik Anadol.The analysis of the Art Market presented in this H1 2022 Report is based on the Fine Art public auction results recorded by Artprice and only concerns paintings  sculptures  drawings  photographs  prints  videos  installations  tapestries as well as NFTs  and excludes antiquities  anonymous cultural property  and furniture.

Not far behind  the Parisian art market generated $518 million and has attracted a growing number of international institutions.and has attracted a growing number of international institutions. Christie's and Sotheby's account for 38% of global fine art turnover.The Macklowe Collection became the most expensive collection ever sold in the world  generating $922 million .. 180 NFTs sold at auction generating $8.5 million .ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE ART MARKETAs the health crisis wanes worldwide  Fine Art auctions settled down to an unsold rate of 31%  almost one in three works offered for sale. This level corresponds to a stable average over the last twenty years  fluctuating between 36% in 2009 and 27% in 2021. Indeed  this key market indicator has reacted quite differently compared with how it reacted in the last major crisis that affected the global art market  the 2009 financial crisis. Back then  collectors decided to take less financial risk  whereas the health crisis of 2021 prompted buyers to switch to a new entirely dematerialized sales channel.In the first half of 2022  the market found a new balance thanks to the coexistence of two different and complementary sales channels (one physical  the other digital)  which allowed auction transactions to continue at a healthy pace reaching a historic number of 326 000 Fine Art lots in six months. In H1 2022 this volume further increased to an unprecedented intensity  despite the postponement of many auctions in China (whose turnover volume is down 53%) due to an additional wave of Covid-19.The United States (up 42% vs. H1 2021) and the UK (up 26%) have driven growth. The two powerful Anglo-Saxon markets alone accounted for exactly two-thirds of global Fine Art auction turnover. China  for its part  only accounted for 12% of global fine art auction turnover  a result that it owes in large part to Hong Kong which accounted for 70% of the value of the entire Chinese art market (including Hong Kong  Macao  and Taiwan).France continued to grow (+14%) consolidating its 4th place ahead of Germany (-5%) after a sensational performance in 2021. In addition to the presence of Christie's and Sotheby's  several Parisian auction operators posted exceptionally strong performances: Artcurial (+42%) and Aguttes (+154%)  among others. Meanwhile  The French capital is attracting a growing number of major international players like David Zwirner  while the Gagosian and Continua galleries have opened new spaces in France. Paris is delighted to see the upcoming arrival of Hauser & Wirth as well as the opening of a Phillips auction room. Bonhams has acquired the French house Cornette de Saint-Cyr (operating in Paris and Brussels). Lastly  the Art Basel company will henceforth be the official organizer of the international autumn art fair organized at the Grand Palais in Paris  entitled Paris+  which will replace the FIAC.Japan and Switzerland also had an excellent start to 2022 with increases of 74% and 145% in their respective auction turnover totals. Without directly competing with Hong Kong (which still weighs seven times more)  Tokyo is positioning itself on the Asian continent as a hub for major contemporary artists  including Andy Warhol  Yoshitomo Nara  Yayoi Kusama  but also young talents like Mr Doodle and Ayako Rokkaku (born in 1982)  whose auction sales have already exceeded $18.6 million this year. For its part  Switzerland is continuing to carve out a place for itself in the Post-Impressionist and Modern Art market  with sales of important works by Ferdinand Hodler  Alberto Giacometti  and Marc Chagall.Ferdinand Hodler  Der Brienzersee von Breitlauenen aus (1906); sold for CHF 2 875 000 (~$3 million) on 17 June 2022 by Galerie Kornfeld in BernPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1891852/Artmarket_Ferdinand_Hodler.jpghttps://www.artprice.com/artist/13632/ferdinand-hodler/painting/27034374/der-brienzersee-von-breitlauenen- ausTRENDS: NFTs AND ULTRA CONTEMPORARY ARTPropelled to center stage in March 2021 with a first public auction result at $69.4 million  NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have created something of a revolution in the art market  with a new type of work  new collectors  and a new currency.Of the 277 NFTs auctioned in H1 2022  65% sold for an average price of $47 000. This situation is very different from H2 2021 in which 225 NFTs were offered for sale  of which 86% sold at an average price of $520 000. Beeple's Human One (2021) fetched nearly $29 million last November at Christie's  whereas the best NFT result in H1 2022 was just $1.38 million for Living Architecture: Casa Batlló (2022) by Refik Anadol.The 104 CryptoPunks that Sotheby's announced in February 2022 were finally withdrawn on the eve of their scheduled sale. The withdrawal of such a lot  estimated between $20 and $30 million  underscores the extent to which NFT market players remain somewhat skeptical about the service provided by traditional intermediaries. Not only are they expensive (transaction costs amount to an average of 20% compared with around 2% to 3% via NFT platforms) but they also are governed by a much less flexible schedule. The major auction houses are nevertheless continuing their efforts to participate in this emerging market  although they only very rarely sell major NFT collections (BAYC  WoW  etc.). For the time being  such projects no longer seem to need the marketing efforts or the legitimacy of regulated auction houses.At the same time  the volatility of cryptocurrencies  has exacerbated the mistrust of traditional collectors vis-à-vis this disruptive market. Fortunately  this lull will provide a good number of artists  dealers  collectors  and institutions – starting with museums – an opportunity to take an interest in digital works and to consider acquiring NFTs without the pressure of record sales and over-mediatization.https://www.artprice.com/nftThe NFT phenomenon stems from the same enthusiasm that Artprice is observing for the work of young artists  some of whom are eliciting record multi-million dollar results even before their work has been exhibited in a major museum or before they have even enjoyed a solo show in a gallery. The recent auction records for works by artists under 40 (whose very recent works are already trading on the secondary market) will be analyzed by the next Artprice Ultra Contemporary Art Report to be published in October 2022. This will notably be an opportunity to highlight the growing success and influence of young female painters.Top 10 personal records for living artists under 40 at auction in H1 2022©artprice.com1.

For the first time since Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi in November 2017 (four and a half years ago)  the ultra-high-end market is back with a result that once again questions the notion of an absolute masterpiece and its value. The charity sale that produced this result was guaranteed by Christie's and ended with a result of $195 million (including fees). The 'painting' was acquired by Larry Gagosian himself  the powerful gallery owner who had already sold the canvas to Thomas Ammann in the early 1980s.https://www.artprice.com/artist/30269/andy-warhol/painting/26798865/shot-sage-blue-marilyn?p=1The French auction house Artcurial had the honor of presenting an exceptional still-life by Jean-Baptiste Chardin  Le panier de fraises des bois  painted in 1761 and exhibited the same year at the Grand Salon in Paris. While this was the first appearance of this painting at auction  art expert Eric Turquin insists on the immense historical importance of the work  importance to which the labels on the back of the painting attest  having been included in many prestigious exhibitions around the world. A gentle and magic painting  the Jean-Baptiste Chardin masterpiece was estimated between $13 and $16 million and finally sold for $26.8 million.https://www.artprice.com/artist/45915/jean-baptiste-simeon-chardin/painting/26388579/le-panier-de-fraises-des-bois?p=1The biggest sensation of the year was undoubtedly created by the canvas The Sugar Shack (1976) by Ernie Barnes (1938 - 2009). Last year  the African-American painter set a new auction record at $550 000. But on 12 May this year  Christie's proposed his painting The Sugar Shack (1976) in New York with an estimate of $150 000 - $200 000. The work finally sold for $15 275 000  more than 100 times the low estimate. In the days and weeks that followed  six more important Ernie Barnes paintings were offered at Christie's and Bonhams  and they all sold well beyond their estimates.Last year  the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama became the first female artist to enter the world's Top 10 performing artists as calculated by Artprice (all periods of creation combined). She was also the third best performing living artist of the year behind Gerhard Richter and Banksy. This year  Yayoi Kusama has repeated that performance with 208 lots sold worldwide for more than $115 million. She also set a new auction record when her Untitled (Nets) (1959) reached $10.5 million at Phillips on 18 May 2022.https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/yayoi-kusama -at-last-a-female-artist-in-the-global-top-10Matthew Wong would have been 38 if he hadn't taken his own life in 2019. Since his death  his paintings have enjoyed stunning success in auction rooms. On 19 May 2022  his Night Watcher (2018) was acquired for $5.9 million at Christie's New York. In H1 2022  Matthew Wong ranked 52nd in the global ranking of artists by auction turnover (all periods of creation combined)  a success that has a certain Basquiat flavor to it  even if Wong's place in art history has not yet been recognized.Read Artprice.com's H1 2022 Global Art Market Report online at:https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/global-art-market-in-h1-2022-by-artprice-comThe information and econometric studies produced by Artmarket.com are presented uniquely for the purpose of analyzing and understanding the statistical realities of the art market and should in no way be considered as advice or a suggestion or a solicitation to invest in the art market.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/08/image1-H1-Evolution-Fine-Art-Auction-Sales.jpg][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/08/image2-Ferdinand-Hodler.jpeg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The funds will be used to complete development and commercialise the Company's novel lead Plecoid™ Product  PTX-061  to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML).The investments include €3.6 million in new equity committed by Oost NL and a select number of private investors  €5m in government funding from the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland  RVO)  and €8.7 million in equity and R&D project financing from Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext Brussels: HYL) previously announced in late 2021.In total  at final close  the round exceeds the Company's goal of €15 million. It provides sufficient funds to complete the development of PTX-061's regulatory dossier in AML and to be ready for submission to the FDA and EMA as early as 2024  and to accelerate preclinical work in other indications such as Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).Pleco's novel Plecoid™ therapies are patented  innovative treatments that include chelating agents with different characteristics  that have the potential to positively change the balance of protein expression within the cancer microenvironment  removing the burden of toxic metals within the cell  thereby improving the effectiveness of existing chemotherapy.Whilst AML is a relatively rare disease  the effectiveness of current chemotherapy may be limited because the leukaemia cells can become resistant to it over time. The majority of patients will relapse  even after an initial successful treatment. Relapses carry a poor prognosis; most patients no longer respond to treatment and die from anaemia  infection  or multiorgan failure. Worldwide the incidence of AML is estimated to be 350 000 cases per year (4.7 cases per 100 000 population)1. In the US  there was an estimated 20 050 new cases of AML in 2022 and 11 540 deaths2.Pleco's technology provides a platform for the development of a pipeline of therapies. In addition to PTX-061 for AML  the current pipeline includes additional candidates in preclinical testing for the treatment of other rare diseases such as SCLC.Ivo Timmermans  Chief Executive Officer of Pleco Therapeutics  commented: ""We are delighted to have secured the funds needed to progress our lead drug candidate through development  for the treatment of AML  a blood cancer that carries a very poor prognosis. We welcome our new shareholders and are grateful for the support from Oost NL and RVO.""Pleco's funding from the RVO is the maximum granted under its Innovation Credit scheme that helps entrepreneurs with promising and challenging innovations with excellent market perspective. It provides special funding  a national and international network  and personal advice for innovative start-ups.Pleco recently announced its expansion  with the incorporation of its subsidiary  Pleco Therapeutics USA  Inc.  and the appointment of Michael Stalhamer as its President and first US-based employee. Mr Stalhamer also serves on the global leadership team as Vice President (VP) Product Development and Regulatory Affairs.About Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML)AML is a type of heterogenous haematological malignancy that originates from immature white blood cells (blasts) in the bone marrow  which may be derived from either a hematopoietic stem cell or a lineage-specific progenitor cell. AML generally spreads quickly to the bloodstream and can then spread to other parts of the body including lymph nodes  spleen  central nervous system  and testicles. AML is an orphan disease and is the most common type of acute leukaemia in adults and is primarily a disease of the adulthood; the median age of newly diagnosed AML patients is around 67 years. Worldwide the incidence of AML is estimated to be 350 000 cases per year (4.7 cases per 100 000 population  Globocan). In the US  there was an estimated 20 050 new cases of AML in 2022 and 11 540 deaths. Additionally  AML is more common in males. AML can arise de novo or secondarily either due to the progression of other diseases or due to treatment with cytotoxic agents.About Pleco TherapeuticsPleco Therapeutics is a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company which aims to extend the life span and enhance the quality of life of patients through its novel Plecoid™ therapies that have been designed to dramatically increase the effectiveness of current cancer treatments.

To cope with the challenges that this poses  organizations are turning to a growing range of AI-powered tools to supplement their existing security software and the work of their security teams. Today  a startup called Cymulate — which has built a platform to help those teams automatically and continuously stress test their networks against potential attacks with simulations  and provide guidance on how to improve their systems to ward off real attacks — is announcing a significant round of growth funding after seeing strong demand for its tools.The startup — founded in Tel Aviv  with a second base in New York — has raised $70 million  a Series D that it will be using to continue expanding globally and investing in expanding its technology (both organically and potentially through acquisitions).Today  Cymulate’s platform covers both on-premise and cloud networks  providing breach and attack simulations for endpoints  email and web gateways and more; automated “red teaming”; and a “purple teaming” facility to create and launch different security breach scenarios for organizations that lack the resources to dedicate people to a live red team — in all  a “holistic” solution for companies looking to make sure they are getting the most out of the network security architecture that they already have in place  in the words of Eyal Wachsman  Cymulate’s CEO.“We are providing our customers with a different approach for how to do cybersecurity and get insights [on] all the products already implemented in a network ” he said in an interview. The resulting platform has found particular traction in the current market climate. Although companies continue to invest in their security architecture  security teams are also feeling the market squeeze  which is impacting IT budgets  and sometimes headcount in an industry that was already facing a shortage of expertise. (Cymulate cites figures from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology that estimate a shortfall of 2.72 million security professionals in the workforce globally.)The idea with Cymulate is that it’s built something that helps organizations get the most out of what they already have. “And at the end  we provide our customers the ability to prioritize where they need to invest  in terms of closing gaps in their environment ” Wachsman said.The round is being led by One Peak  with Susquehanna Growth Equity (SGE)  Vertex Ventures Israel  Vertex Growth and strategic backer Dell Technologies Capital also participating. (All five also backed Cymulate in its $45 million Series C last year.) Relatively speaking  this is a big round for Cymulate  doubling its total raised to $141 million  and while the startup is not disclosing its valuation  I understand from sources that it is around the $500 million mark.Wachsman noted that the funding is coming on the heels of a big year for the startup (the irony being that the constantly escalating issue of cybersecurity and growing threat landscape spells good news for companies built to combat that). Revenues have doubled  although it’s not disclosing any numbers today  and the company is now at more than 200 employees and works with some 500 paying customers across the enterprise and mid-market  including NTT  Telit and Euronext  up from 300 customers a year ago.Wachsman  who co-founded the company with Avihai Ben-Yossef and Eyal Gruner  said he first thought of the idea of building a platform to continuously test an organization’s threat posture in 2016  after years of working in cybersecurity consulting for other companies. He found that no matter how much effort his customers and outside consultants put into architecting security solutions annually or semi-annually  those gains were potentially lost each time a malicious hacker made an unexpected move.“If the bad guys decided to penetrate the organization  they could  so we needed to find a different approach ” he said. He looked to AI and machine learning for the solution  a complement to everything already in the organization  to build “a machine that allows you to test your security controls and security posture  continuously and on demand  and to get the results immediately… one step before the hackers.”Last year  Wachsman described Cymulate’s approach to me as “the largest cybersecurity consulting firm without consultants ” but in reality the company does have its own large in-house team of cybersecurity researchers  white-hat hackers who are trying to find new holes — new bugs  zero days and other vulnerabilities — to develop the intelligence that powers Cymulate’s platform.These insights are then combined with other assets  for example the MITRE ATT&CK framework  a knowledge base of threats  tactics and techniques used by a number of other cybersecurity services  including others building continuous validation services that compete with Cymulate. (Competitors include the likes of FireEye  Palo Alto Networks  Randori  AttackIQ and many more.)Cymulate’s work comes in the form of network maps that detail a company’s threat profile  with technical recommendations for remediation and mitigations  as well as an executive summary that can be presented to financial teams and management who might be auditing security spend. It also has built tools for running security checks when integrating any services or IT with third parties  for instance in the event of an M&A process or when working in a supply chain.Today the company focuses on network security  which is big enough in itself but also leaves the door open for Cymulate to acquire companies in other areas like application security — or to build that for itself. “This is something on our roadmap ” said Wachsman.If potential M&A leads to more fundraising for Cymulate  it helps that the startup is in one of the handful of categories that are going to continue to see a lot of attention from investors.“Cybersecurity is clearly an area that we think will benefit from the current macroeconomic environment  versus maybe some of the more capital-intensive businesses like consumer internet or food delivery ” said David Klein  a managing partner at One Peak. Within that  he added  “The best companies [are those] that are mission critical for their customers… Those will continue to attract very good multiples.”,neutral,0.03,0.89,0.08,mixed,0.18,0.12,0.7,True,English,"['cybersecurity teams', 'attack simulations', 'Cymulate', 'networks', 'U.S. National Institute', 'MITRE ATT&CK framework', 'largest cybersecurity consulting firm', 'different security breach scenarios', 'automated “red teaming', 'purple teaming” facility', 'Dell Technologies Capital', 'continuous validation services', 'existing security software', 'live red team', 'current market climate', 'Vertex Ventures Israel', 'Susquehanna Growth Equity', '2.72 million security professionals', '$45 million Series C', 'growing threat landscape', 'Palo Alto Networks', 'other cybersecurity services', 'network security architecture', 'Vertex Growth', '$500 million mark', 'growing range', 'Series D', 'market squeeze', 'threat posture', 'security solutions', 'security controls', 'security posture', 'house team', 'different approach', 'other vulnerabilities', 'other assets', 'security teams', 'cybersecurity researchers', 'alarming rate', 'potential attacks', 'real attacks', 'Tel Aviv', 'second base', 'New York', 'cloud networks', 'web gateways', 'particular traction', 'IT budgets', 'strategic backer', 'escalating issue', 'good news', 'Avihai Ben-Yossef', 'Eyal Gruner', 'malicious hacker', 'unexpected move', 'bad guys', 'new holes', 'new bugs', 'zero days', 'knowledge base', 'many mor', 'growth funding', 'significant round', 'big round', 'AI-powered tools', 'strong demand', 'holistic” solution', 'One Peak', 'big year', 'other companies', 'outside consultants', 'machine learning', 'white-hat hackers', 'Eyal Wachsman', 'resulting platform', '500 paying customers', '300 customers', 'cost', 'cybercrime', 'challenges', 'organizations', 'startup', 'simulations', 'guidance', 'systems', 'technology', 'acquisitions', 'Cymulate', 'premise', 'endpoints', 'email', 'resources', 'people', 'place', 'words', 'CEO', 'insights', 'products', 'interview', 'headcount', 'industry', 'shortage', 'expertise', 'figures', 'Standards', 'shortfall', 'workforce', 'idea', 'something', 'ability', 'terms', 'gaps', 'environment', 'SGE', 'total', 'valuation', 'heels', 'irony', 'constantly', 'Revenues', 'numbers', 'company', '200 employees', 'enterprise', 'mid-market', 'NTT', 'Telit', 'Euronext', 'years', 'effort', 'gains', 'complement', 'everything', 'results', 'reality', 'intelligence', 'example', 'threats', 'tactics', 'techniques', 'others', 'Competitors', 'likes', 'FireEye', 'Randori', 'AttackIQ']",2022-09-06,2022-09-07,techcrunch.com

Since then  streaming has taken the world by storm and established itself as a mainstream service  with 78% of U.S. households having some sort of streaming service.

Picture taken April 25 with a drone. REUTERS/Kevin CoombsSummarySummary Companies Banks  insurers scrutinise back-up plansDiesel generators on standbyLights  heating turned down as energy crisis loomsLONDON  Sept 7 (Reuters) - Some of Europe's biggest banks are preparing back-up generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the region's economy.As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that ATMs and online banking don't go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe's economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterWhile the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge.""The banking system is part of other systems "" said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages.""My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.""JPMorgan (JPM.N)  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank.Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit (CRDI.MI) has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said.Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank's two core data centres had power supply from two independent power stations. It's unclear how long its power would last.Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia's invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.HOT WATERBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year - enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour.The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight.The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off.Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their ""Important Business Services"" and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialise.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days.""This represents a serious gap in resilience planning "" said Avi Schnurr  CEO of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think-tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said.BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA)  France's biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices and data centres it operates across France  Belgium and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being ""closely monitored"" and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia's state-controlled Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine. Russia blames those sanctions for causing the gas supply problems  which it puts down to pipeline faults.In Britain  rising energy costs are squeezing businesses and consumers  who are facing runaway inflation.State-backed NatWest (NWG.L) said it had partially mitigated the financial hit by hedging future costs of its energy.Major insurers also said they were cutting their energy use. Switzerland's Zurich (ZURN.S) said it would darken offices at night and mothball ""decorative power consumers"" like fountains.Should the crisis worsen  the sources said companies will take more drastic steps. And while staff may notice  the firms are hoping that customers won't.""Additional measures that can be taken should the energy situation worsen include using only certain floors of the buildings  and the shutdown of certain services such as the employee gym "" the insurer said.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterAdditional reporting by Julien Ponthus in Paris and Carolyn Cohn in London; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi  John O'Donnell and David EvansOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.02,0.5,0.48,negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['winter blackout', 'Analysis', 'Europe', 'banks', 'lights', 'Reuters', 'major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline', 'Electric Infrastructure Security Council', 'latest disaster recovery test', 'Canary Wharf financial district', 'two independent power stations', 'two core data centres', 'remote working, power blackouts', 'biggest U.S. bank', 'FREE unlimited access', 'Italian stock exchanges', 'interior branch lighting', 'equivalent UK peer', 'Prudential Regulation Authority', 'European gas prices', 'gas supply problems', 'potential power cuts', 'power outage simulations', 'prolonged power outage', 'Important Business Services', 'Business Continuity Plan', 'key office locations', 'British consumer bank', 'energy saving measures', 'European Central Bank', 'electricity supply cuts', 'Reuters.com Register', 'rising energy costs', 'University College London', 'pipeline faults', 'power supply', 'gas supplies', 'Summary Companies Banks', 'lengthy blackouts', 'Major insurers', 'disaster resilience', 'European hubs', 'data processing', 'financial hit', 'biggest bank', 'power shortages', 'power outages', 'power consumption', 'operational continuity', 'other services', 'future costs', 'office space', 'head office', 'financial firms', 'Deutsche Bank', 'general view', 'Kevin Coombs', 'energy crisis', 'alternative sources', 'online banking', 'special urgency', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'different challenge', 'banking system', 'Gianluca Pescaroli', 'main concern', 'cascading effects', 'CRDI.MI', 'energy use', 'visible steps', '4.9 million kWh', '49,000 light bulbs', 'workplace temperatures', 'outdoor advertising', 'high alert', 'supervisory arm', 'serious gap', 'Avi Schnurr', 'BNP Paribas', 'state-controlled Gazprom', 'energy supplies', 'runaway inflation', 'State-backed NatWest', 'Diesel generators', 'back-up generators', 'operational resilience', 'resilience planning', 'standby Lights', 'energy rationing', 'money system', 'other systems', 'several days', 'fewer buildings', 'Western sanctions', 'back-up plans', 'cashless transactions', 'HOT WATER', 'French lender', '1,400 buildings', 'Britain', 'Picture', 'drone', 'heating', 'region', 'economy', 'Russia', 'continent', 'ATMs', 'importance', 'payments', 'fallout', 'war', 'sector', 'part', 'professor', 'authorities', 'society', 'failures', 'dependencies', 'internet', 'JPMorgan', 'JPM.', 'thousands', 'Frankfurt', 'matter', 'severity', 'person', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'addition', 'Italy', 'UniCredit', 'Euronext', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'staff', 'slew', 'Germany', 'hour', 'washrooms', 'fountain', 'front', 'Regulators', 'PRA', 'lenders', 'disruption', 'methods', 'vulnerabilities', 'threats', 'experts', 'CEO', 'think-tank', 'hazards', 'arrangements', 'agreements', 'BNPP', 'France', 'approximate', '2,750 branches', 'offices', 'Belgium', 'possibility', 'GAZP.', 'shutdown', 'retaliation', 'Moscow', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'businesses', 'consumers', 'NWG']",2022-09-07,2022-09-07,reuters.com

The 233 treated patients were 63 years old on average  64% of the patients were male  recruited in centers in Europe  the US and Brazil between Q3 2020 and Q1 2022  infected with the main SARS-Cov-2 variantsIn the primary analysis  Sarconeos (BIO101) reduced by 39% the risk of respiratory failure or early death at 28 days (primary endpoint) compared to placebo (15.8% vs 26.0%  adjusted difference 11.8% in favor of treatment  p=0.07). Sarconeos (BIO101) reduced both the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (12.7% vs 21.5%) and early death (0.8% vs 2.8%). Sarconeos (BIO101) also significantly (p=0.03) delayed the progression of respiratory failure or early death over 28 days maximum treatment period:fncls.ssp?fn=download2_file&code_str=ccc998314112b698411779f512133de3In addition  in this primary analysis  Sarconeos (BIO101) reduced the risk of death at 28 days compared to placebo  in similar proportion to the observed reduction in the risk of respiratory failure or early death and delayed its occurrence within 90 days. These effects are nonetheless not statistically significant.Sarconeos (BIO101) presents a good safety profile  with a similar proportion of adverse events compared to placebo  particularly severe adverse events (25% vs 31%). In addition  more patients in the placebo group experienced respiratory adverse events than patients in the Sarconeos (BIO101) group (32.7% vs 22.7%  respectively)  supporting the main efficacy results.Further data analysis is still ongoing. Results of which will be communicated to the market and presented in details during a major international scientific conference in the next months.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  said: ""The results obtained with Sarconeos (BIO101) in the fight against COVID-19 are very encouraging. It is the only innovative drug candidate in Europe or the United States directly targeting respiratory failure that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients with hypoxemia caused by COVID-19. It could be used in combination with certain anti-viral and/or anti-inflammatory drugs  which are now part of the medical practice. We will be sharing these results in the coming months with regulatory agencies  health authorities and our partners in Europe  the United States and Brazil to determine under what conditions we could pursue the development of Sarconeos (BIO101) in COVID-19. I would like to sincerely thank all the patients  caregivers  advisors  and finally the shareholders and employees of Biophytis for their hard work  trust and dedication throughout this study  the results of which come at a time when the fear of an epidemic rebound this winter is growing"".Dr Girish Balachandran Nair  Associate Professor of Medicine in Respiratory and Critical Care  Beaumont Hospital  Royal Oak  MI  USA and Principal Investigator of the COVA study in the USA  adds: ""These results are extremely exciting and of public interest. This is great news for the medical community and the general population at risk  especially elderly patients. Indeed  COVID-19 is becoming endemic and will persist for a long time. Sarconeos (BIO101) could provide a real therapeutic alternative for elderly patients  hospitalized with hypoxemia and at risk of respiratory failure.""Based on these very promising results  the Company intends to make this new therapeutic solution available to COVID-19 hospitalized patients at risk of respiratory failure and early death. Actually  according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center  during the last month in the US  Brazil and France  2.6 million  0.5 million and 0.6 million people respectively were infected by COVID-19 and 13.9 thousand  4.5 thousand and 1.7 thousand died from it. Beyond COVID-19 infection  other infections such as flu can also generate Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).Biophytis is currently evaluating the possibility of amending and continuing the Early Access Program (EAP) to make Sarconeos (BIO101) available as soon as this winter to COVID-19 hospitalized patients and at risk of respiratory failure and death. An EAP has already been authorized in Brazil to treat patients in intensive care and further EAP might be filed in other territories including the USA and Europe. This is a first step towards market authorization  the conditions of which will be discussed in the coming months with the relevant regulatory authorities (FDA  EMA and ANVISA).About the COVA studyAs a reminder  the COVA clinical programme (identifier clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04472728) is an international  multi-centre  double-blind  placebo-controlled  group-sequential and adaptive two-part study. It is a phase 2-3 study evaluating Sarconeos (BIO101) in patients aged 45 years and older  hospitalised with severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Part 1 of the COVA study is an exploratory Phase 2 proof-of-concept study designed to provide preliminary data on the safety  tolerability and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in 50 hospitalised patients with severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19. Part 2 of the COVA study is a randomised phase 3 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) on respiratory function in patients. Due to the evolution of the pandemia  the company decidedin April 2022 to stop enrolment at 237 patients.About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes for patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

To achieve this  Transgene has created two highly innovative technology platforms that have delivered multiple therapeutic vaccine and oncolytic drug candidates now being evaluated in clinical trials ” commented Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene.“We have made remarkable progress in the first half of 2022  with initial results in patients reinforcing my confidence that we are on track to progress through the clinic successfully. With several further important clinical milestones to be announced before the end of the year  we are approaching a critical moment to become a world leader in innovative cancer therapies.”Highlights and expected news flowTG4001 – Result of the Phase II interim analysis to be released in Q4 2022Just over 50 patients have been enrolled in the randomized Phase II trial evaluating the combination of TG4001 and avelumab in HPV-induced anogenital cancers. Transgene expects to report the results of the interim analysis in Q4 2022.The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the superiority of the combination of TG4001 + avelumab versus avelumab as a single agent to improve progression-free survival (primary endpoint of the trial) and  in the longer term  overall patient survival.In this Q4 2022 communication  Transgene will specify  based on the results of the interim analysis  the total number of patients that must be included in the trial to confirm the efficacy of the therapy and achieve statistically significant progression-free survival improvement. Indeed  the design of the trial allows for the total number of patients to be adjusted according to the results obtained in the interim analysis and based on the recommendations of the IDMC (independent data monitoring committee).TG4050 - Patients treated with our neoantigen vaccine show a robust  vaccine specific immune responseTransgene presented new positive preliminary data from TG4050  its proprietary cancer vaccine based on the myvac® platform  at the AACR (April 2022) and ASCO (June 2022) meetings. These data show good safety and robust immunogenicity. The induction of immune responses is particularly efficient (100% of patients evaluated at the data cut-off date showed a specific cellular response) and is associated with disease regression.Transgene has also produced data on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); signals of this increasingly validated surrogate marker of efficacy are particularly encouraging. Combined with the first signs of clinical activity  these results suggest that the individualized TG4050 vaccine has the potential to extend the period of remission  potentially offering a new treatment option for cancer patients.Additional data from the two ongoing Phase I trials (ovarian cancer and head and neck cancers) are expected in the second half of 2022. The information generated will be key to designing the Phase II trial of TG4050  which could start as early as 2023.In addition  Transgene has completed patient inclusion in the two Phase I trials. These patients are now being monitored until they become eligible for treatment per study protocol.An article on Transgene’s personalized vaccine technology was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Canceri. The publication demonstrated that Transgene successfully developed a patient specific vaccine within a few weeks for a study case patient with a low tumor mutational burden (TMB).TG6002 – Phase I trials completed – Confirms the strong potential of IV administration of the Invir.IO™ oncolytic virusesPatient enrollment has been completed in the Phase I trial evaluating the intravenous (IV) route of administration: 51 patients received TG6002 at different doses and with different schedules.This route of administration has considerable therapeutic and market potential as it allows targeting many types of internal lesions and metastases inaccessible by intratumoral injection (injection of the oncolytic virus directly into the tumor) which is currently the only approved route of administration for an oncolytic virus.New data from this trial will be presented in a poster at the ESMO Congress on September 11  2022 at 12:00 pm CET. The data confirm the safety and feasibility of the IV route for TG6002 and support the potential of IV administration of Invir.IO™-based oncolytic viruses  extending the use of these therapies to a broad range of solid tumors.In the TG6002 Phase I trial evaluating the intrahepatic artery route of administration (IHA)  enrollment has been completed. Data are currently being analyzed and will be presented at a conference in the first half of 2023.BT-001 – Good safety and first signs of antitumor activity as a monotherapyTransgene and BioInvent provided an update on the progress of the clinical trial of BT-001  an oncolytic Vaccinia virus encoding an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and GM-CSF  in June 2022. Initial data from Part A of the Phase I trial demonstrated that BT-001 as a single-agent is well tolerated  with first signs of anti-tumor activity observed in a hard-to-treat patient population. The mechanism of action for BT-001  as a single agent  was also confirmed: the virus replicates in the tumor and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody is expressed in the tumor.A clinical collaboration and supply agreement for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) was signed with MSD (Merck & Co) at the end of June 2022. The Phase Ib part of the clinical trial (combination with pembrolizumab) is expected to start in the second half of 2022.Promising preclinical data with BT-001 were presented at AACR 2022 and published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancerii demonstrating the broad and robust antitumor activity of this Invir.IO™ oncolytic virus.Change in governance and appointment within the executive committeeTransgene reinforced its corporate governance by separating the roles of Chairman and CEO.

Adjusted from this impact  the gross margin related to pure sales is of 2 244 k€  i.e. a rate of 72% at the end of June 2022  stable compared to the end of June 2021 (1 339 k€ and 71%). The margin on sales thus increased in value by 68%.The Board of Directors of Spineway  at a meeting held on September 7  2022  chaired by Stéphane Le Roux  approved the half-year results as of June 30  2022.In the context of a still fragile and non-homogenous recovery in its areas of operation  Spineway achieved revenues of €3.1 million in the first half of 2022  up 65% compared to the first half of 2021. This increase is driven by the strong performance of sales in Latin America (+72% to €1.5M)  the synergies implemented with Distimp  notably in France  which brought the turnover of the European zone to €0.9M (+106% compared to HF1 2021) and the solid results in the Middle East (€0.4M  up 96%)Story continuesImproved gross margin on sales by 68% and controlled expensesThis growth in activity is accompanied by a 68% increase in gross margin on sales** to €2.2 million at the end of June 2022 compared to €1.3 million last year.During the period  operating costs were kept under control despite the reinforcement of the teams necessary for the development and transformation of R&D projects and the growth of the Group. Thus  the number of employees has increased by 29% since June 2021. The management team has been reinforced by four new top-level experts: a Director of Sales for France and French-speaking Africa  a Scientific Director  an R&D Director and a Marketing and International Sales Director.Operating costs amounted to €1.3 million  i.e. 43% of sales compared to 53% last year  even though the Group continued to incur regulatory expenses  particularly in studies and clinical tests to prepare the changeover linked to the new CE/MDR regulations.The operating profit for the first half of 2022 is thus - 0.9 M€ compared to - 0.5 M€ at the end of June 2021.Also benefiting from the improvement in the financial profit (+ 78%) and the exceptional result (+72%)  the net result was -0.8 M€ versus -0.6 M€ last year. It now represents 26% of the turnover compared with 33% last year and has thus increased by 7 points.The Group remains committed to an objective of revenue growth and reorganization aimed at a return to operating profitability while going on with costs’ control.Strengthened equity and solid cash position of €15.3 million at the end of JuneIn the first half of 2022  the conversion of convertible or exchangeable bonds into new or existing ordinary shares linked to the contract with Negma GROUP LTD generated a capital increase of €0.6 million through the creation of 6 213 624 332 shares and an issue premium of €1.1 million. The purpose of this contract is to finance the Group's acquisition and partnership plan  to support its strategy and also to support cash requirements related to current operations  particularly in connection with the current pandemic. As of June 30  2022  €11.5 million of additional financing remained under this contract  which has provided €22.6 million in cash since its conclusion.With a strong cash position of more than €15 million as of June 30  2022  the Group has decided to suspend the issuance of new tranches of convertible bonds until the end of 20221. The Group's financial structure remains sound with a net cash position of €10.9 million and shareholders' equity of €21.5 million as of June 30  2022.The company is studying financing solutions that are more favorable to its development  its shareholders  and the support of its future projects.Shares Consolidating to reduce volatilityIn order to support its growth and value creation strategy  since August 16  Spineway has initiated a reverse stock split based on 1 new share for 40 000 shares. This consolidation  which will be effective on September 15  has the dual objective of limiting share price volatility and reducing speculation on the share price.Share exchange period 16 August 2022 Start of exchange operations 14 September 2022 End of exchange operations Consolidation operations 14 September 2022 Last listing of old shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR0011398874) 15 September 2022 First listing of the new shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) 19 September 2022 Allocation of new shares Breakage management 14 September 2022 Start of compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediaries 14 October 2022 Deadline for compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediariesAmbition confirmedThe strengthening of the Group's cash position and shareholders' equity will enable it to pursue its growth plan.As such  in July 2022  Spineway acquired Spine Innovations  a French company specializing in intervertebral disc prostheses for the cervical and lumbar spine. Spine Innovations has a team of 13 people and markets its products mainly in France  Europe  and Australia. For the fiscal year 2020/2021  the company generated sales of €4.2 million  76% of which were generated internationally. In line with its growth strategy  this new acquisition will enable Spineway to add a new segment to its product offering  strengthen its positions in France and internationally  and expand its teams. This acquisition will contribute to the Group's revenues from the second half of 2022.This new acquisition confirms the Group's strategy of positioning itself as a leading European player in the field of spinal implants  in particular by expanding its range of innovative Premium products  through targeted external growth.Upcoming:September 28  2022: Lyon Pôle Bourse Forum at the Palais du Commerce in LyonSeptember 20  2022: Closing of the Consolidation TransactionOctober 14  2022: Third quarter revenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

""The banking system is part of other systems "" said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages. ""My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet."" JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank. Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said. Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank's two core data centres had power supply from two independent power stations. It's unclear how long its power would last. Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia's invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.Story continuesHOT WATERBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year - enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour. The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight. The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off. Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their ""Important Business Services"" and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialise.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days.

As Russia throttles gas supplies to the …,Some of Europe’s biggest banks are preparing back-up generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the region’s economy.As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that ATMs and online banking don’t go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe’s economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.While the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge.“The banking system is part of other systems ” said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages.“My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.”JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank.Italy’s second-biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said.Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank’s two core data centers had power supply from two independent power stations. It’s unclear how long its power would last.Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.Hot WaterBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year – enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour.The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight.The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off.Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their “Important Business Services” and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialize.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days.“This represents a serious gap in resilience planning ” said Avi Schnurr  CEO of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think-tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said.BNP Paribas  France’s biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices and data centers it operates across France  Belgium and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being “closely monitored” and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponizing energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine.

Switzerland’s Zurich said it would darken offices at night and mothball “decorative power consumers” like fountains.Should the crisis worsen  the sources said companies will take more drastic steps. And while staff may notice  the firms are hoping that customers won’t.“Additional measures that can be taken should the energy situation worsen include using only certain floors of the buildings  and the shutdown of certain services such as the employee gym ” the insurer said.(Additional reporting by Julien Ponthus in Paris and Carolyn Cohn in London; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi  John O’Donnell and David Evans)Topics Carriers Europe,neutral,0.03,0.84,0.12,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['Potential Winter Power Cuts', 'Energy Rationing', 'Europe', 'Banks', 'Insurers', 'major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline', 'Electric Infrastructure Security Council', 'latest disaster recovery test', 'two independent power stations', 'two core data centers', 'remote working, power blackouts', 'biggest U.S. bank', 'Italian stock exchanges', 'interior branch lighting', 'equivalent UK peer', 'Prudential Regulation Authority', 'European gas prices', 'gas supply problems', 'potential power cuts', 'power outage simulations', 'prolonged power outage', 'Important Business Services', 'Business Continuity Plan', 'key office locations', 'British consumer bank', 'European Central Bank', 'University College London', 'electricity supply cuts', 'decorative power consumers', 'energy saving measures', 'rising energy costs', 'pipeline faults', 'Major insurers', 'power supply', 'gas supplies', 'lengthy blackouts', 'disaster resilience', 'European hubs', 'data processing', 'power shortages', 'power outages', 'power consumption', 'biggest bank', 'operational continuity', 'other services', 'future costs', 'Additional measures', 'office space', 'head office', 'Deutsche Bank', 'online banking', 'special urgency', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'different challenge', 'banking system', 'Gianluca Pescaroli', 'main concern', 'cascading effects', 'energy use', 'visible steps', '4.9 million kWh', '49,000 light bulbs', 'running water', 'workplace temperatures', 'outdoor advertising', 'high alert', 'supervisory arm', 'serious gap', 'Avi Schnurr', 'BNP Paribas', 'state-controlled Gazprom', 'energy supplies', 'runaway inflation', 'State-backed NatWest', 'financial hit', 'drastic steps', 'energy situation', 'back-up generators', 'diesel generators', 'operational resilience', 'resilience planning', 'energy rationing', 'money system', 'alternative sources', 'other systems', 'several days', 'Hot Water', 'energy crisis', 'fewer buildings', 'Western sanctions', 'financial firms', 'cashless transactions', 'French lender', '1,400 buildings', 'banks', 'lights', 'region', 'economy', 'Russia', 'continent', 'ATMs', 'importance', 'payments', 'fallout', 'war', 'sector', 'part', 'professor', 'authorities', 'society', 'failures', 'dependencies', 'internet', 'JPMorgan', 'thousands', 'Frankfurt', 'matter', 'Reuters', 'severity', 'person', 'companies', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'Italy', 'UniCredit', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'staff', 'slew', 'Germany', 'hour', 'washrooms', 'fountain', 'front', 'Regulators', 'PRA', 'lenders', 'disruption', 'Britain', 'methods', 'vulnerabilities', 'threats', 'experts', 'CEO', 'think-tank', 'hazards', 'arrangements', 'agreements', 'France', 'approximate', '2,750 branches', 'offices', 'Belgium', 'possibility', 'shutdown', 'retaliation', 'Moscow', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'businesses', 'Switzerland', 'Zurich', 'night', 'mothball', 'customers', 'floors']",2022-09-07,2022-09-07,insurancejournal.com

Bone Therapeutics publishes its interim financial report in English. A French translation of the report will also be made available. In the event of differences between the English and the French version of the report  the original English version will prevail.Bone Therapeutics acquires majority participation in Medsenic to derisk and broaden its therapeutic portfolio1Preparation of the Medsenic Phase III clinical trial with oral formulation following positive results from Phase II arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD (chronic GvH)Bone Therapeutics ALLOB’s Phase IIb interim results expected in H1 2023Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  7 September 2022  7am CEST – BONE THERAPEUTICS (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BOTHE)  the cell therapy company addressing unmet medical needs in orthopedics and other diseases  today announces its business update for the first half  ended 30 June 2022  prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union  and the outlook for the remainder of the year. The update also includes the Company’s reverse merger with Medsenic; a biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing therapies for autoimmune diseases.“Following the conclusion of activity in the first half of 2022  Bone Therapeutics has consolidated its successes and outlined its plans for the rest of the year. Having optimized the statistical analysis for the ongoing Phase IIb clinical study for our allogeneic cell therapy product  ALLOB  we are now of the view that ALLOB has the highest potential of near-term value creation. This is based on the successful completion of two clinical studies showing promising safety profile and efficacy signals in 66 patients ” said Jean Stéphenne  President of Bone Therapeutics. “Having built strong foundations  we now believe we will be able to maximize the productivity of the second half of the year. We are now looking forward to the continued development of our therapeutic pipeline  to bring these life-changing therapies to patients worldwide.”Story continuesOperational and Corporate highlightsIn March 2022  Bone Therapeutics realigned its strategic priorities to fully concentrate on the clinical development of its most advanced asset  ALLOB.In May 2022  Bone Therapeutics entered into a non-binding term sheet and exclusive discussions for a period of three months with the shareholders of Medsenic. Medsenic is a privately held  clinical stage biopharmaceutical company incorporated in France  specializing in the development of optimized formulations of arsenic salts and their application in inflammatory conditions and other potential new indications.In July 2022  Bone Therapeutics announced an optimized statistical analysis and the implementation of an interim analysis for the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial with its allogeneic bone cell therapy product  ALLOB. With the improved statistical analysis  the number of required patients could be reduced by 20%. The interim analysis will be added to the study providing an early assessment of ALLOB’s efficacy based on radiological data of the first 66 evaluable patients and more stringent efficacy end point criteria.In August 2022  Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic announced the signature of a binding contribution agreement to combine the operations of both companies by means of a share for share exchange  subject to the approval of the shareholders' meeting. The acquisition will result in the business combination of Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic to create BioSenic  a speciality biopharma company. 51% of Medsenic shares (valued at around EUR 40 million) will be contributed at a subscription price per share of EUR 0.45. In addition  each existing share will be entitled to subscribe to one additional share at EUR 0.45 in case of successful ALLOB interim results. Bone Therapeutics aims to acquire the remaining outstanding capital of Medsenic within 24 to 36 months. Following the completion of the Business Combination  it is anticipated that the executive leadership team will bring in François Rieger (CEO) and Véronique Pomi-Schneiter (Executive Director).(1) Subject to the approval of the shareholders’ meetingFinancial highlightsIn April 2022  Bone Therapeutics signed a binding term sheet for a EUR 5 million convertible bonds (CBs) facility arranged by ABO Securities. The proceeds of the financing will be particularly used to advance the clinical development of Bone Therapeutics’ lead asset  ALLOB. At the end of May 2022  Bone Therapeutics signed the definitive subscription agreement for a maximum EUR 5 million CBs facility with ABO Securities. The CBs will be issued and subscribed in ten tranches.During the first six months of 2022  total operating income amounted to EUR 0.40 million  a slight decrease compared to the same period in 2021 (EUR 0.77 million).Operating loss for the period amounted to EUR 3.96 million  compared to EUR 5.72 million in H1 2021.The Company ended the first six months of 2022 with EUR 3.96 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash used for the period amounted to EUR 5.55 million  compared to EUR 8.63 million over the same period of 2021.The combined group is expected to have a proforma cash position of at least EUR 5 million at closing. The Company plans to raise funds in the form of a private placement of new shares at the end of 2022 in order to finance the combined activities of Medsenic and the Company. In the meantime  the Company will make use of the existing EUR 5 million convertible facility obtained via ABO to finance its activities and to finance the convertible loan granted to Medsenic for of up to EUR 2 million  to secure their projects during this period.Disciplined cost and cash management will remain a key priority. The operating cash burn for the full year 2022 is expected to be in the range of EUR 8-10 million and a financing cash burn of approximately EUR 1.3 million  assuming normal operation as we continue to feel the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.Based on the completion of the current CB financing operation as mentioned above and the announced sole focus on the completion of the ALLOB TF2 study with related downsizing of the company  the Board is of the opinion that it is appropriate to prepare the 2022 interim financial statements of the Company under the assumption of going concern  considering a projected operational cash burn of €8 to 10 million for 2022 and a cash runway into Q1 2023.Outlook for the remainder of 2022 and 2023The transaction between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic is subject to the approval of the contribution by Bone Therapeutics' shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting (‘ESM’) to be convened by the Board of Bone Therapeutics in the course of September 2022. The transaction is also subject to certain other customary conditions including the confirmation that the proposed Business Combination would not lead to the necessity  for any subscriber involved to launch a mandatory takeover bid on Bone Therapeutics.The Phase IIb trial of Bone Therapeutics’ ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in the first half of 2023.The Medsenic Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD (chronic GvH) is complete and provided positive results. A phase IIa clinical trial for Lupus had previously established proof of concept of safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease: a Phase 2b clinical trial for severe Lupus is in the planning stage. A Phase III study of cGvHD is also currently anticipated to start in 2023. Also  positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis.The reverse merger between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic will soon lead to a new company  BioSenic. The new company plans to accelerate its development-mainly based upon clinical research  and will raise funds  in the form of a first private placement of new shares at the end of 2022  in order to finance its combined activities.Bone Therapeutics is a leading biotech company focused on the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and other diseases. Currently Bone Therapeutics is concentrating specifically on the development of its most advanced clinical asset  the allogeneic cell therapy platform  ALLOB.Bone Therapeutics’ core technology is based on its cutting-edge allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) which can be stored at the point of use in the hospital. Its leading investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to bone regeneration  which turns undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells. These cells are produced via the Bone Therapeutics’ scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental.Bone Therapeutics’ cell therapy products are manufactured to the highest GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards and are protected by a broad IP (Intellectual Property) portfolio covering ten patent families as well as knowhow. The Company is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium.

The study was initiated at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2021 and is currently ongoing in the US. The objective of the study is to document whether LTX-315 in combination with pembrolizumab is effective in inducing responses in patients who have failed prior anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy.The clinical trial application (CTA) has now been approved according to the European Clinical Trial Regulation  and the national authorities in Spain  France and Norway have commended the CTA for ATLAS-IT-05.The approval will enable the expansion of the site network and clinical impact field for LTX-315  mitigate recruitment challenges and drive enrollment in the ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II trial towards completion. The study will be performed at highly recognized sites with intratumoral immunotherapy expertise in the three European countries. It will be led by melanoma experts at each site and follow the same protocol as in the US.The regulatory application in Europe was submitted in Q2 2022 and six leading clinical sites in Europe are expected to open during the 4th quarter of 2022. Efforts to prepare the sites for initiation of the study and recruitment of patients is ongoing with the aim to complete enrollment in the study in early 2023.""We are very pleased to have received the regulatory approval to commence studies in three European countries. Lytix has mobilized internal resources and moved extraordinary fast in the face of the need to broaden the impact of this study among clinicians and key opinion leaders.

9625,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/analysis-europes-banks-dim-lights-as-they-brace-for-winter-blackout-1118821,Analysis-Europe’s banks dim lights as they brace for winter blackout,By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) -   Some of Europe&#039;s biggest banks are preparing back-up generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the regio…,As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that ATMs and online banking don’t go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe’s economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.While the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge. “The banking system is part of other systems ” said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages. “My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.” JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank. Italy’s second-biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said. Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank’s two core data centres had power supply from two independent power stations. It’s unclear how long its power would last. Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.Hot waterBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year – enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour. The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight. The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off. Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their “Important Business Services” and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialise.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days. “This represents a serious gap in resilience planning ” said Avi Schnurr  CEO of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think-tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said. BNP Paribas  France’s biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices and data centres it operates across France  Belgium and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being “closely monitored” and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine. Russia blames those sanctions for causing the gas supply problems  which it puts down to pipeline faults.In Britain  rising energy costs are squeezing businesses and consumers  who are facing runaway inflation.State-backed NatWest said it had partially mitigated the financial hit by hedging future costs of its energy.Major insurers also said they were cutting their energy use. Switzerland’s Zurich said it would darken offices at night and mothball “decorative power consumers” like fountains.Should the crisis worsen  the sources said companies will take more drastic steps. And while staff may notice  the firms are hoping that customers won’t.“Additional measures that can be taken should the energy situation worsen include using only certain floors of the buildings  and the shutdown of certain services such as the employee gym ” the insurer said.(Additional reporting by Julien Ponthus in Paris and Carolyn Cohn in London; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi  John O’Donnell and David Evans),negative,0.03,0.47,0.5,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['winter blackout', 'Analysis-Europe', 'banks', 'lights', 'major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline', 'Electric Infrastructure Security Council', 'latest disaster recovery test', 'two independent power stations', 'two core data centres', 'remote working, power blackouts', 'biggest U.S. bank', 'Italian stock exchanges', 'interior branch lighting', 'equivalent UK peer', 'Prudential Regulation Authority', 'John O’Donnell', 'European gas prices', 'gas supply problems', 'power outage simulations', 'prolonged power outage', 'Business Continuity Plan', 'key office locations', 'British consumer bank', 'Important Business Services', 'European Central Bank', 'electricity supply cuts', 'decorative power consumers', 'University College London', 'energy saving measures', 'rising energy costs', 'pipeline faults', 'Major insurers', 'power supply', 'gas supplies', 'lengthy blackouts', 'biggest bank', 'disaster resilience', 'European hubs', 'data processing', 'power shortages', 'power outages', 'power consumption', 'operational continuity', 'future costs', 'Additional measures', 'office space', 'head office', 'Deutsche Bank', 'online banking', 'special urgency', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'different challenge', 'banking system', 'Gianluca Pescaroli', 'main concern', 'cascading effects', 'other services', 'energy use', 'visible steps', '4.9 million kWh', '49,000 light bulbs', 'running water', 'workplace temperatures', 'outdoor advertising', 'high alert', 'supervisory arm', 'serious gap', 'Avi Schnurr', 'BNP Paribas', 'state-controlled Gazprom', 'energy supplies', 'runaway inflation', 'State-backed NatWest', 'financial hit', 'drastic steps', 'energy situation', 'employee gym', 'Additional reporting', 'Julien Ponthus', 'Carolyn Cohn', 'Elisa Martinuzzi', 'David Evans', 'operational resilience', 'resilience planning', 'diesel generators', 'back-up generators', 'alternative sources', 'other systems', 'several days', 'Hot water', 'energy crisis', 'Western sanctions', 'financial firms', 'cashless transactions', 'fewer buildings', 'French lender', '1,400 buildings', 'Russia', 'continent', 'banks', 'ATMs', 'importance', 'payments', 'economy', 'fallout', 'war', 'sector', 'rationing', 'part', 'professor', 'authorities', 'society', 'failures', 'dependencies', 'internet', 'JPMorgan', 'thousands', 'Frankfurt', 'matter', 'Reuters', 'severity', 'person', 'money', 'companies', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'Italy', 'UniCredit', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'staff', 'slew', 'Germany', 'hour', 'washrooms', 'fountain', 'front', 'Regulators', 'PRA', 'lenders', 'disruption', 'Britain', 'methods', 'vulnerabilities', 'threats', 'experts', 'CEO', 'think-tank', 'hazards', 'arrangements', 'agreements', 'France', 'approximate', '2,750 branches', 'offices', 'Belgium', 'possibility', 'shutdown', 'retaliation', 'Moscow', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'businesses', 'Switzerland', 'Zurich', 'night', 'customers', 'floors', 'Paris']",2022-09-07,2022-09-07,fxempire.com

UniCredit  one of Italy’s largest banks  has power supply from two independent power stations that could provide energy to two of its data centers  a source told Reuters  without disclosing how long the power would last. France’s largest bank  BNP Paribas  has also taken steps to protect itself from supply cuts  Reuters reported  citing a source close to the bank. Apart from JPMorgan and Zurich  the companies mentioned in this article didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider. It’s not just banks that are cracking down on power consumption this year. European governments have introduced measures ahead of winter to prevent energy shortages. Germany has barred “energy-intensive heating” of private swimming and bathing pools  while Finland has urged people to spend less time in saunas and showers.To: denniswQ.

Had existed for 94 years. So their problem went to two issues. One was rising natural gas which was used in processing paper products  and the second was logistics jams in the system (they could not deliver on a scheduled basis because of a lack of drivers....not trucks). A lot of German companies are bringing up the driver issue. I stood in a German butcher-grill shop yesterday  and customers lined up. No ketchup. He’d had a order with his normal distributor company for a month  and they could not make the delivery in the typical two weeks or even four weeks...because of a lack of drivers.To: denniswAnd they’re running those diesel generators on what?

A total of 11 abstracts highlighting data related to bimekizumab in psoriasis are being presented at the congress.Data presented from the BE BRIGHT OLE study showed that over eight out of 10 patients who achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) following 16 weeks of bimekizumab treatment maintained PASI 100 response and health-related quality of life outcomes through to three years with continuous maintenance dosing. In addition  approximately nine out of 10 patients who achieved absolute PASI (PASI ≤2) at week 16 maintained this response through to three years.1 Pooled data from up to three years of treatment in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials showed that bimekizumab was generally well-tolerated over this period with no safety signals identified.2 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S. and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).""These positive results highlight the deep and long-lasting skin clearance achieved with bimekizumab  along with a consistent safety and tolerability profile  and reinforce the positive relationship clearing skin has on patients' quality of life. These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting longer-term use of bimekizumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.""The findings presented today show that bimekizumab provided maintenance of completely clear skin and health-related quality of life outcomes in the majority of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over a three year period "" said Dr. Bruce Strober  Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Yale University  New Haven  Conn. ""The goal of psoriasis treatment often is complete clearance of skin symptoms  and the availability of long-term data across treatment options is important since it supports healthcare providers and patients to be more informed when making treatment decisions.""Three-year data from the BE BRIGHT OLE studyAll patients who had completed one of the pivotal Phase 3 studies (BE SURE  BE VIVID and BE READY) were eligible to enter the BE BRIGHT OLE study.1 On OLE entry  patients were assigned to bimekizumab 320 mg every four weeks (Q4W) or every eight weeks (Q8W) based on PASI 90 response at the end of the respective Phase 3 study.In all bimekizumab-randomized patients: 1¥Among week 16 PASI 100 responders (N=503)  89.3 percent achieved PASI 100 at year one (week 52) and 82.0 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI ≤2 responders (N=694)  96.5 percent achieved PASI ≤2 at year one (week 52) and 94.2 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI 100 responders in BE SURE and BE READY only (N=330)  92.0 percent achieved the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 at year one (week 56)  and 88.0 percent at year three (OLE week 96)In bimekizumab-randomized patients (320 mg Q4W for 16 weeks  and then every eight weeks [Q8W] through three years  BE SURE and BE READY only):1¥Among week 16 PASI 100 responders (N=147)  93.6 percent achieved PASI 100 at year one (week 52) and 84.4 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI ≤2 responders (N=189)  98.9 percent achieved PASI ≤2 at year one (week 52) and 96.8 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI 100 responders (N=147)  95.8 percent achieved DLQI 0/1 at year one (week 56) and 92.5 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Pooled safety data from up to three years of treatment in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trialsTotal bimekizumab exposure was 4245.3 patient-years (PY; N=1789) across the Phase 2 and 3 trials  and 3876.4 PY (N=1495; Q4W: 1965.6 PY; Q8W: 1914.5 PY) in the Phase 3 trials.2 Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred at an exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of 186.1 per 100 PY: serious TEAEs were seen at an EAIR of 5.6 new cases per 100 PY and TEAEs leading to discontinuation at 3.5 new cases per 100 PY.2The most common TEAEs in the Phase 2 and 3 trials with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis  oral candidiasis and upper respiratory tract infection at EAIRs of 15.3  10.2 and 7.1 new cases per 100 PY  respectively.2 The EAIR for oral candidiasis showed a decrease compared with two years of bimekizumab treatment (10.2 versus 12.6 new cases per 100 PY) and was lower with bimekizumab dosed Q8W compared with Q4W (7.1 and 15.9 per 100 PY  respectively).2 The vast majority of oral candidiasis events were mild to moderate (99.4 percent)  and none were serious.2 Serious infections occurred at a rate of 1.2/100 PY.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

The banking system is too important for Europe and its economy to be left affected by power outages.Banks are currently stress-testing alternative sources of energy  including backup generators  according to a Reuters source.JP Morgan  for example  has already had simulations of blackouts  the source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. Euronext has backup generators  the company operating the French and Italian stock markets said.Deutsche Bank has implemented a series of energy-saving measures  including shutting off hot water in office washrooms and switching off outdoor advertising during the night.Energy conservation is one of the measures European governments and local authorities have implemented to save gas and electricity amid low (or in Germany’s case now – non-existent) Russian pipeline gas supply and rallying gas and power prices.In July  Berlin and other cities in Germany started turning off the spotlights on historic monuments and municipal buildings in an effort to conserve energy ahead of what could be a winter of energy rationing.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,True,English,"['Energy Crisis', 'Europe', 'Banks', 'Blackouts', 'Russian pipeline gas supply', 'Italian stock markets', 'Russian gas giant', 'gas turbine repairs', 'testing alternative sources', 'possible power outages', 'Nord Stream pipeline', 'power prices', 'gas war', 'voluntary gas', 'backup generators', 'bank transactions', 'last week', 'three-day maintenance', 'operational defects', 'banking system', 'JP Morgan', 'Deutsche Bank', 'hot water', 'office washrooms', 'outdoor advertising', 'local authorities', 'other cities', 'historic monuments', 'municipal buildings', 'Tsvetana Paraskova', 'Top Reads', 'energy crisis', 'Energy conservation', 'Western sanctions', 'electricity conservation', 'difficult winter', 'energy-saving measures', 'European governments', 'energy rationing', 'Reuters source', 'Banks', 'ATMs', 'dark', 'plans', 'lights', 'analysis', 'turn', 'end', 'Gazprom', 'Friday', 'equipment', 'ante', 'Monday', 'Kremlin', 'shutdown', 'economy', 'example', 'simulations', 'blackouts', 'knowledge', 'situation', 'Euronext', 'company', 'French', 'series', 'night', 'low', 'Germany', 'case', 'July', 'Berlin', 'effort', 'Oilprice', 'More']",2022-09-07,2022-09-07,oilprice.com

See why I rate the stock a buy.,The new Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange Building in Amsterdam ivotheeditors/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesSince the end of 2022  Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF) (OTCPK:ERNXY) has underperformed its peers. This currently makes Euronext the most undervalued Exchange compared to its peers based on a couple different valuation metrics.The company has a strong moat combined with slow and steady growth for years to come.Investors should expect market beating returns in the years to come until Euronext has returned to its fair value.Based on my DCF calculation Euronext is currently undervalued while it offers a lower risk.Combined with a 10%+ free cashflow yield  an expected 10%+ IRR and a beta of 0.58 makes me initiate my buy rating on Euronext.EUXTF data by YChartsCompany overviewEuronext currently is the leading pan-European stock exchange. They have a great track record of organic growth in combination with growth from M&A. Example of this can be their most recent acquisition of Borsa Italiana.Euronext currently operates 7 local exchanges  one bond trading platform  one central counterparty clearing house and 2 central security depositories.Euronext Group Overview (Company Presentation) Euronext M&A (Company Presentation)Impact 2024In their current 2024 financial strategic plan  Euronext is targeting a slow and steady 3% to 4% CAGR on the revenue side. Ebitda should grow 5% to 6% CAGR. Capex will remain the same. The current dividend policy still applies  this means a growing dividend over time. Please note here that it is based on 50% of net income so there can be years where the dividend will go down  but I expect over the longer term that the dividend will grow at a slow and steady pace.The integration of Borsa Italiana continues going into 2023 and 2024. These are expected to further deliver synergies. The current synergies are already up +67% from 60M EUR to 100M EUR versus the targets set in October 2020.Currently two major projects remain. Bringing the Italian cash equities and derivatives markets to Euronext Optiq and Euronext Clearing to start offer clearing services to all Euronext markets.Source: Growth For Impact 2024 IR PageSource: Investor Day Presentation2024 Financial Targets (Company Presentation) Key projects (Company Presentation)UndervaluedCurrently Euronext appears to be undervalued based on a couple different valuation methods.The metrics I will use are:Earnings per shareEbitdaFree Cash FlowSalesBefore looking at the individual metrics I want to share this table that gives a quick overview of Euronext' valuations compared to its peers. You can see here that Euronext offers better valuations across the board.P/E Ratio FCF Yield EV/Ebitda Dividend Yield Euronext 17.9x 10.69% 11.4x 2.61% London Stock Exchange 29.3x 5.33% 14.4x 1.27% Deutsche Boerse 23.0x 5.80% 13.9x 1.88% Intercontinental Exchange 24.0x 6.52% 15.6x 1.40% Nasdaq (NDAQ) 25.5x 5.18% 17.7x 1.24% Click to enlargePrice-Earnings RatioFrom the P/E ratio perspective  Euronext is trading at 17.9x well below the average of 25.45x their peers are trading at.If the EPS keeps growing by ~6%  this would imply a fair value stock price of 100 EUR by the beginning of 2025. If Euronext reverts back to its fair value by 2025  this would imply a capital gain of 25.68 EUR/share or a CAGR 13.63% (excluding dividends).Price to Earnings Ratio Chart (Author's own software)Free Cash FlowEuronext currently is trading at a FCF Yield of 10%+. You don't come across many companies that offer this kind of yield. It is also significantly higher compared to the average of 5%-6% FCF Yield from its closest peers.If the FCF keeps growing by ~6%  this would imply a fair value stock price of 109 EUR by the beginning of 2025. If Euronext reverts back to its fair value by 2025  this would imply a capital gain of 34.68 EUR/share or a CAGR 17.92% (excluding dividends).Price to Free Cash Flow Chart (Author's own software)EbitdaIf the Ebitda keeps growing by ~6%  this would imply a fair value stock price of 95 EUR by the beginning of 2025. If Euronext reverts back to its fair value by 2025  this would imply a capital gain of 20.68 EUR/share or a CAGR 11.15% (excluding dividends).Price to EBITDA chart (Author's own software)Price-SalesIf the EPS keeps growing by ~6%  this would imply a fair value stock price of 100 EUR by the beginning of 2024. If Euronext reverts back to its fair value by 2024  this would imply a capital gain of 20.68 EUR/share or a CAGR 20.43% (excluding dividends).Price to sales chart (Author's own software)Discounted Cash FlowFrom a DCF perspective Euronext currently is a buy. The suggested buy price from the DCF calculation is 98.88 EUR while the stock price currently is 74.32 EUR. This combined with a FCF yield of 10% suggest a big discount to fair value.For the inputs I used the following:Growth rate: 6%Discount: 10%Margin of safety: 10%Discounted Free Cashflow Calculation (Author's own software)Internal Rate of ReturnUsing a modified IRR where I will model a 10-year investment period  I can find out how good or bad an investment in Euronext would be right now. Please note here that I'm using dividends as cashflows here.Firstly I need to know what my terminal value would be in 10 years time.To find this out I projected 4 different metrics into the future. The weighted result of this gives me my terminal value of 142.83 EUR.Metric Growth Terminal Multiple/Yield Weighting Terminal Value Total 100% 142.83 EUR FCF 6% 6% FCF Yield 25% 173.94 EUR EBITDA 6% 13x EV/EBITDA2x DEBT/EBITDA 25% 104.90 EUR EPS 6% 5% Earnings Yield 25% 141.31 EUR Dividend 6% 2.40% Dividend Yield 25% 109.69 EUR Click to enlargeThe inputs I used for the IRR calculation are the following:Terminal Value of 142.83 EURBuying Price of 74.32 EURDividend growth of 6%Using these inputs the expected IRR is 9.91%. This is in line with what I expect my investments to make.I also included a IRR distribution for future readers.Internal Rate of Return calculation (Author's own software) Internal Rate of Return Distribution Model (Author's own software)RisksI believe regulatory risks are the main concern at this point. Euronext is currently the biggest pan-European stock exchange by market cap. Employing their current M&A strategy will become increasingly more difficult going into the future.The dividend policy is not the best and could be a bit volatile on the short term if net income would drop. If you really want a reliable growing dividend year after year  Euronext might not be for you until they improve the policy. However I still expect a growing dividend by 5%-6% CAGR over the longer term (10+ years).ConclusionLong-term investors should consider buying Euronext while its valuations are suppressed. Please keep in mind that Euronext is based in France  where the standard dividend withholding tax rate is 30%.Euronext currently has an expected IRR of almost 10%+ at the time of writing this. All metrics that I discussed in this article are suggesting Euronext is trading below its implied fair value. The IRR is nothing too crazy but considering that the beta of this stock is only 0.586  I would argue it is pretty good from a risk/reward perspective.Looking at the DCF calculation we have a suggested buy price of 98.88 EUR. Currently you can buy Euronext for 74.32 EUR.The stock is trading at very high free cash flow yield of 10%+.Given all of this  I am initiating a buy rating on Euronext and plan on adding to my position below 70 EUR.,negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,mixed,0.17,0.19,0.64,True,English,"['Euronext Stock', 'OTCMKTS', 'ERNXY', 'P/E Ratio FCF Yield EV/Ebitda Dividend Yield Euronext', 'new Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange Building', 'one central counterparty clearing house', 'one bond trading platform', 'couple different valuation methods', 'leading pan-European stock exchange', '10%+ free cashflow yield', 'couple different valuation metrics', 'current 2024 financial strategic plan', 'Discounted Free Cashflow Calculation', 'Free Cash Flow Sales', 'Free Cash Flow Chart', 'Impact 2024 IR Page Source', 'P/E ratio perspective', 'fair value stock price', 'Discounted Cash Flow', 'London Stock Exchange', '2 central security depositories', 'Italian cash equities', 'market beating returns', 'great track record', 'current dividend policy', 'Earnings Ratio Chart', 'two major projects', 'Investor Day Presentation', 'YCharts Company overview', 'Euronext Group Overview', '5%-6% FCF Yield', 'Euronext M&A', 'steady 3% to 4% CAGR', 'Amsterdam ivotheeditors', 'Price-Earnings Ratio', 'sales chart', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'M&A.', 'growing dividend', 'clearing services', 'Euronext Clearing', 'DCF calculation', 'quick overview', '10%+ IRR', 'current synergies', '2024 Financial Targets', 'Key projects', 'DCF perspective', 'steady pace', 'individual metrics', 'Company Presentation', 'buy price', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'strong moat', 'lower risk', 'recent acquisition', 'Borsa Italiana', '7 local exchanges', 'revenue side', 'net income', 'longer term', 'derivatives markets', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'capital gain', 'many companies', 'Internal Rate', '10-year inves', 'EBITDA chart', 'steady growth', 'Euronext Optiq', 'Euronext markets', 'buy rating', 'organic growth', 'Growth rate', 'EUXTF data', 'big discount', ""Euronext' valuations"", 'closest peers', '6% CAGR', 'OTCPK', 'ERNXY', 'slow', 'years', 'Investors', 'beta', 'combination', 'Example', 'Capex', 'time', 'integration', 'deliver', '60M', '100M', 'October', 'share', 'table', 'board', 'Nasdaq', 'NDAQ', 'average', 'EPS', 'beginning', '68 EUR', 'dividends', 'Author', 'software', 'kind', 'Price-Sales', 'inputs', 'Margin', 'safety', 'modified', '2023']",2022-09-07,2022-09-07,seekingalpha.com
