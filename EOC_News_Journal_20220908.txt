Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.Netflix launched its streaming program in 2007  at the time a DVD-by-mail service only. Since then  streaming has taken the world by storm and established itself as a mainstream service  with 78% of U.S. households having some sort of streaming service. The rise in streaming  like the rise of DVD before it  was largely thanks to its convenience. Unlike brick-and-mortar rental storefronts such as Blockbuster  users have access to countless videos without leaving the comfort of their homes. It’s also cheaper than previous services as consumers don’t have to pay for individual movies or an entire cable package  but rather a bundle of entertainment at a fraction of the price.There’s a lot more where this came from. Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our reviews  expert advice  deals and more.However  streaming is becoming more and more expensive. With the number of competing platforms on the market  many people subscribe to multiple streaming services to have access to all their favorite shows across various networks. In fact  the number of households with four or more streaming services doubled from 2020 to 2021. What’s more  the streaming services themselves are becoming more costly—Hulu  Disney Plus and ESPN+ will each see price hikes in the coming months.With inflation on the rise  it's understandable to think that streaming might have to be one of the things you give up. Fortunately  there's still hope and there are less expensive ways to enjoy online entertainment. We'll walk you through all the ways you can save money on streaming services.►Disney+ Day is tomorrow: What to know and what's streamingG et an antenna to access dozens of free channelsDid you know that there are dozens of free channels just waiting to be watched on your television? Channels such as NBC  ABC  Fox  PBS and the CW are available to watch with an antenna. You'll be able to watch a variety of programs with just a one-time payment for the cost of the antenna itself.The best HDTV antenna we've tested is the ClearStream Eclipse TV Antenna. With a range of 35 miles  ClearStream offers many different channels with crystal-clear picture quality. It comes with a wall mount that attaches without the need for screws or pins. Beyond being practical  this antenna is beautiful. Its elegant  halo-like design gives it a cool  futuristic look—it's certainly an upgrade from the old bunny ears design that used to be ubiquitous with antennas. Plus  it has a black side and a white side so that it's guaranteed to fit your home’s style  no matter the color tones.$39.99 from AmazonUse a free streaming serviceIf you prefer streaming entertainment to using an antenna  there are still ways to save money. In fact  there are streaming services you can enjoy without paying so much as a penny.Tubi is one of the most popular streaming services around  which is a testament to the quality and quantity of its offerings. It also gives you the option of tuning into live programming.Amazon Freevee   previously known as IMDb TV and IMDb Freedive  is the free alternative to Amazon Prime Video. Freevee is notable for its high-quality original shows and movies. You can also watch high-profile movies like ""The Invisible Man"" and ""F9"" using the service.Pluto TV serves as Paramount's free alternative to their Paramount+. Pluto TV is unique in that it has hundreds of cable-like channels where you can tune in to various movies and shows  completely free of charge.Sony's Crackle rotates its offerings often  so you should check the site periodically to see if it has something you like.If you're a fan of anime  RetroCrush is a streaming service that should be on your radar. It offers over 200 retro-styled anime  both subbed and dubbed  as well as live-action Japanese movies. Many of RetroCrush's titles can't be found on Crunchyroll or other popular anime streaming services.If you have a library card  then you'll likely have access to Hoopla   which is a library-partnered application that allows you to stream countless audio books  movies  shows and albums.Binge with a free trialIf there's a show or movie you want to watch on a paid streaming service  then you might want to make use of a free trial (especially if you want to quickly binge a single show). Not all major streaming services offer free trials  but many do. What’s more  the free trials tend to be generous with the amount of time they give you. Popular services that provide free trials include Hulu  Showtime and Prime Video  which each offer 30-day free trials. YouTube TV offers a 14-day free trial and Paramount+ offers a 7-day trial.If you don’t plan on subscribing to a streaming platform after your trial is up  make sure to set a reminder to cancel your subscription before the trial period ends or you’ll get charged for a membership.Choose a lower-tier streaming serviceMany streaming services allow you to purchase a specific tier  with more expensive tiers having premium features such as HD or advertisement-free streaming. If you're willing to deal with ads  consider purchasing the lowest tier of a service. That way  you can still enjoy the excellent programs it has to offer while saving a bit of money.For $6.99  you can watch Hulu with ad breaks compared to $12.99 for Hulu without ads. In addition to a free tier with fewer movies and shows  Peacock offers an ad tier for $4.99 and an ad-free tier for $9.99. In the coming months  both Disney+ and Netflix will launch a basic  ad-supported tier that is slated to be cheaper than their current lowest tiers.Take advantage of streaming bundlesStreaming services offer many bundles and deals that can help you save money while giving you access to additional subscriptions.For $13.99 a month  you can purchase a bundle of Disney+  Hulu and ESPN+  which gives you access to countless shows and movies for way less than you'd pay for each service individually. Certain phone providers  such as Verizon  offer free streaming bundles with the purchase of certain plans. Namely  Verizon users can get a free bundle of Disney+  Hulu and ESPN+. Verizon also offers up to 6 months of discovery+ with select plans.An Amazon Prime subscription gives you access to Amazon Prime Video  making one of the most convenient shopping platforms even more appealing. If you have a Walmart+ membership  then you'll soon have access to a Paramount+ subscription.Lastly  if you have an internet provider such as Xfinity  many channels will allow you to stream their shows free of charge if you log in with your internet provider information.Streaming deals happening right nowThere are a few ways to save money on some of the biggest streaming platforms through price cuts offered through signup.Apple TV is offering 3 months free when you buy an eligible Apple device.Get deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone.

Picture taken April 25 with a drone. REUTERS/Kevin CoombsSummarySummary Companies Banks  insurers scrutinise back-up plansDiesel generators on standbyLights  heating turned down as energy crisis loomsLONDON  Sept 7 (Reuters) - Some of Europe's biggest banks are preparing back-up generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the region's economy.As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that ATMs and online banking don't go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe's economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterWhile the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge.""The banking system is part of other systems "" said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages.""My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.""JPMorgan (JPM.N)  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank.Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit (CRDI.MI) has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said.Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank's two core data centres had power supply from two independent power stations. It's unclear how long its power would last.Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia's invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.HOT WATERBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year - enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour.The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight.The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off.Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their ""Important Business Services"" and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialise.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days.""This represents a serious gap in resilience planning "" said Avi Schnurr  CEO of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think-tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said.BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA)  France's biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices and data centres it operates across France  Belgium and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being ""closely monitored"" and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia's state-controlled Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine.

The proportion and time to onset of these negative events were studied for 28 days in the primary analysis  with follow-up of mortality and safety until 90 days after start of treatment. The 233 treated patients were 63 years old on average  64% of the patients were male  recruited in centers in Europe  the US and Brazil between Q3 2020 and Q1 2022  infected with the main SARS-Cov-2 variantsIn the primary analysis  Sarconeos (BIO101) reduced by 39% the risk of respiratory failure or early death at 28 days (primary endpoint) compared to placebo (15.8% vs 26.0%  adjusted difference 11.8% in favor of treatment  p=0.07). Sarconeos (BIO101) reduced both the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (12.7% vs 21.5%) and early death (0.8% vs 2.8%). Sarconeos (BIO101) also significantly (p=0.03) delayed the progression of respiratory failure or early death over 28 days maximum treatment period:fncls.ssp?fn=download2_file&code_str=ccc998314112b698411779f512133de3In addition  in this primary analysis  Sarconeos (BIO101) reduced the risk of death at 28 days compared to placebo  in similar proportion to the observed reduction in the risk of respiratory failure or early death and delayed its occurrence within 90 days. These effects are nonetheless not statistically significant.Sarconeos (BIO101) presents a good safety profile  with a similar proportion of adverse events compared to placebo  particularly severe adverse events (25% vs 31%). In addition  more patients in the placebo group experienced respiratory adverse events than patients in the Sarconeos (BIO101) group (32.7% vs 22.7%  respectively)  supporting the main efficacy results.Further data analysis is still ongoing. Results of which will be communicated to the market and presented in details during a major international scientific conference in the next months.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  said: ""The results obtained with Sarconeos (BIO101) in the fight against COVID-19 are very encouraging. It is the only innovative drug candidate in Europe or the United States directly targeting respiratory failure that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients with hypoxemia caused by COVID-19. It could be used in combination with certain anti-viral and/or anti-inflammatory drugs  which are now part of the medical practice. We will be sharing these results in the coming months with regulatory agencies  health authorities and our partners in Europe  the United States and Brazil to determine under what conditions we could pursue the development of Sarconeos (BIO101) in COVID-19. I would like to sincerely thank all the patients  caregivers  advisors  and finally the shareholders and employees of Biophytis for their hard work  trust and dedication throughout this study  the results of which come at a time when the fear of an epidemic rebound this winter is growing"".Dr Girish Balachandran Nair  Associate Professor of Medicine in Respiratory and Critical Care  Beaumont Hospital  Royal Oak  MI  USA and Principal Investigator of the COVA study in the USA  adds: ""These results are extremely exciting and of public interest. This is great news for the medical community and the general population at risk  especially elderly patients. Indeed  COVID-19 is becoming endemic and will persist for a long time. Sarconeos (BIO101) could provide a real therapeutic alternative for elderly patients  hospitalized with hypoxemia and at risk of respiratory failure.""Based on these very promising results  the Company intends to make this new therapeutic solution available to COVID-19 hospitalized patients at risk of respiratory failure and early death. Actually  according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center  during the last month in the US  Brazil and France  2.6 million  0.5 million and 0.6 million people respectively were infected by COVID-19 and 13.9 thousand  4.5 thousand and 1.7 thousand died from it. Beyond COVID-19 infection  other infections such as flu can also generate Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).Biophytis is currently evaluating the possibility of amending and continuing the Early Access Program (EAP) to make Sarconeos (BIO101) available as soon as this winter to COVID-19 hospitalized patients and at risk of respiratory failure and death. An EAP has already been authorized in Brazil to treat patients in intensive care and further EAP might be filed in other territories including the USA and Europe. This is a first step towards market authorization  the conditions of which will be discussed in the coming months with the relevant regulatory authorities (FDA  EMA and ANVISA).About the COVA studyAs a reminder  the COVA clinical programme (identifier clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04472728) is an international  multi-centre  double-blind  placebo-controlled  group-sequential and adaptive two-part study. It is a phase 2-3 study evaluating Sarconeos (BIO101) in patients aged 45 years and older  hospitalised with severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Part 1 of the COVA study is an exploratory Phase 2 proof-of-concept study designed to provide preliminary data on the safety  tolerability and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in 50 hospitalised patients with severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19. Part 2 of the COVA study is a randomised phase 3 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) on respiratory function in patients. Due to the evolution of the pandemia  the company decidedin April 2022 to stop enrolment at 237 patients.About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes for patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

Transgene expects to report the results of the interim analysis in Q4 2022.The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the superiority of the combination of TG4001 + avelumab versus avelumab as a single agent to improve progression-free survival (primary endpoint of the trial) and  in the longer term  overall patient survival.In this Q4 2022 communication  Transgene will specify  based on the results of the interim analysis  the total number of patients that must be included in the trial to confirm the efficacy of the therapy and achieve statistically significant progression-free survival improvement. Indeed  the design of the trial allows for the total number of patients to be adjusted according to the results obtained in the interim analysis and based on the recommendations of the IDMC (independent data monitoring committee).TG4050 - Patients treated with our neoantigen vaccine show a robust  vaccine specific immune responseTransgene presented new positive preliminary data from TG4050  its proprietary cancer vaccine based on the myvac® platform  at the AACR (April 2022) and ASCO (June 2022) meetings. These data show good safety and robust immunogenicity. The induction of immune responses is particularly efficient (100% of patients evaluated at the data cut-off date showed a specific cellular response) and is associated with disease regression.Transgene has also produced data on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); signals of this increasingly validated surrogate marker of efficacy are particularly encouraging. Combined with the first signs of clinical activity  these results suggest that the individualized TG4050 vaccine has the potential to extend the period of remission  potentially offering a new treatment option for cancer patients.Additional data from the two ongoing Phase I trials (ovarian cancer and head and neck cancers) are expected in the second half of 2022. The information generated will be key to designing the Phase II trial of TG4050  which could start as early as 2023.In addition  Transgene has completed patient inclusion in the two Phase I trials. These patients are now being monitored until they become eligible for treatment per study protocol.An article on Transgene’s personalized vaccine technology was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Canceri. The publication demonstrated that Transgene successfully developed a patient specific vaccine within a few weeks for a study case patient with a low tumor mutational burden (TMB).TG6002 – Phase I trials completed – Confirms the strong potential of IV administration of the Invir.IO™ oncolytic virusesPatient enrollment has been completed in the Phase I trial evaluating the intravenous (IV) route of administration: 51 patients received TG6002 at different doses and with different schedules.This route of administration has considerable therapeutic and market potential as it allows targeting many types of internal lesions and metastases inaccessible by intratumoral injection (injection of the oncolytic virus directly into the tumor) which is currently the only approved route of administration for an oncolytic virus.New data from this trial will be presented in a poster at the ESMO Congress on September 11  2022 at 12:00 pm CET. The data confirm the safety and feasibility of the IV route for TG6002 and support the potential of IV administration of Invir.IO™-based oncolytic viruses  extending the use of these therapies to a broad range of solid tumors.In the TG6002 Phase I trial evaluating the intrahepatic artery route of administration (IHA)  enrollment has been completed. Data are currently being analyzed and will be presented at a conference in the first half of 2023.BT-001 – Good safety and first signs of antitumor activity as a monotherapyTransgene and BioInvent provided an update on the progress of the clinical trial of BT-001  an oncolytic Vaccinia virus encoding an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and GM-CSF  in June 2022. Initial data from Part A of the Phase I trial demonstrated that BT-001 as a single-agent is well tolerated  with first signs of anti-tumor activity observed in a hard-to-treat patient population. The mechanism of action for BT-001  as a single agent  was also confirmed: the virus replicates in the tumor and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody is expressed in the tumor.A clinical collaboration and supply agreement for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) was signed with MSD (Merck & Co) at the end of June 2022. The Phase Ib part of the clinical trial (combination with pembrolizumab) is expected to start in the second half of 2022.Promising preclinical data with BT-001 were presented at AACR 2022 and published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancerii demonstrating the broad and robust antitumor activity of this Invir.IO™ oncolytic virus.Change in governance and appointment within the executive committeeTransgene reinforced its corporate governance by separating the roles of Chairman and CEO.

Adjusted from this impact  the gross margin related to pure sales is of 2 244 k€  i.e. a rate of 72% at the end of June 2022  stable compared to the end of June 2021 (1 339 k€ and 71%). The margin on sales thus increased in value by 68%.The Board of Directors of Spineway  at a meeting held on September 7  2022  chaired by Stéphane Le Roux  approved the half-year results as of June 30  2022.In the context of a still fragile and non-homogenous recovery in its areas of operation  Spineway achieved revenues of €3.1 million in the first half of 2022  up 65% compared to the first half of 2021. This increase is driven by the strong performance of sales in Latin America (+72% to €1.5M)  the synergies implemented with Distimp  notably in France  which brought the turnover of the European zone to €0.9M (+106% compared to HF1 2021) and the solid results in the Middle East (€0.4M  up 96%)Story continuesImproved gross margin on sales by 68% and controlled expensesThis growth in activity is accompanied by a 68% increase in gross margin on sales** to €2.2 million at the end of June 2022 compared to €1.3 million last year.During the period  operating costs were kept under control despite the reinforcement of the teams necessary for the development and transformation of R&D projects and the growth of the Group. Thus  the number of employees has increased by 29% since June 2021. The management team has been reinforced by four new top-level experts: a Director of Sales for France and French-speaking Africa  a Scientific Director  an R&D Director and a Marketing and International Sales Director.Operating costs amounted to €1.3 million  i.e. 43% of sales compared to 53% last year  even though the Group continued to incur regulatory expenses  particularly in studies and clinical tests to prepare the changeover linked to the new CE/MDR regulations.The operating profit for the first half of 2022 is thus - 0.9 M€ compared to - 0.5 M€ at the end of June 2021.Also benefiting from the improvement in the financial profit (+ 78%) and the exceptional result (+72%)  the net result was -0.8 M€ versus -0.6 M€ last year. It now represents 26% of the turnover compared with 33% last year and has thus increased by 7 points.The Group remains committed to an objective of revenue growth and reorganization aimed at a return to operating profitability while going on with costs’ control.Strengthened equity and solid cash position of €15.3 million at the end of JuneIn the first half of 2022  the conversion of convertible or exchangeable bonds into new or existing ordinary shares linked to the contract with Negma GROUP LTD generated a capital increase of €0.6 million through the creation of 6 213 624 332 shares and an issue premium of €1.1 million. The purpose of this contract is to finance the Group's acquisition and partnership plan  to support its strategy and also to support cash requirements related to current operations  particularly in connection with the current pandemic. As of June 30  2022  €11.5 million of additional financing remained under this contract  which has provided €22.6 million in cash since its conclusion.With a strong cash position of more than €15 million as of June 30  2022  the Group has decided to suspend the issuance of new tranches of convertible bonds until the end of 20221. The Group's financial structure remains sound with a net cash position of €10.9 million and shareholders' equity of €21.5 million as of June 30  2022.The company is studying financing solutions that are more favorable to its development  its shareholders  and the support of its future projects.Shares Consolidating to reduce volatilityIn order to support its growth and value creation strategy  since August 16  Spineway has initiated a reverse stock split based on 1 new share for 40 000 shares. This consolidation  which will be effective on September 15  has the dual objective of limiting share price volatility and reducing speculation on the share price.Share exchange period 16 August 2022 Start of exchange operations 14 September 2022 End of exchange operations Consolidation operations 14 September 2022 Last listing of old shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR0011398874) 15 September 2022 First listing of the new shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) 19 September 2022 Allocation of new shares Breakage management 14 September 2022 Start of compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediaries 14 October 2022 Deadline for compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediariesAmbition confirmedThe strengthening of the Group's cash position and shareholders' equity will enable it to pursue its growth plan.As such  in July 2022  Spineway acquired Spine Innovations  a French company specializing in intervertebral disc prostheses for the cervical and lumbar spine. Spine Innovations has a team of 13 people and markets its products mainly in France  Europe  and Australia. For the fiscal year 2020/2021  the company generated sales of €4.2 million  76% of which were generated internationally. In line with its growth strategy  this new acquisition will enable Spineway to add a new segment to its product offering  strengthen its positions in France and internationally  and expand its teams. This acquisition will contribute to the Group's revenues from the second half of 2022.This new acquisition confirms the Group's strategy of positioning itself as a leading European player in the field of spinal implants  in particular by expanding its range of innovative Premium products  through targeted external growth.Upcoming:September 28  2022: Lyon Pôle Bourse Forum at the Palais du Commerce in LyonSeptember 20  2022: Closing of the Consolidation TransactionOctober 14  2022: Third quarter revenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

""The banking system is part of other systems "" said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages. ""My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet."" JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank. Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said. Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank's two core data centres had power supply from two independent power stations. It's unclear how long its power would last. Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia's invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.Story continuesHOT WATERBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year - enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour. The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight. The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off. Regulators are on high alert.

As Russia throttles gas supplies to the …,Some of Europe’s biggest banks are preparing back-up generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the region’s economy.As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that ATMs and online banking don’t go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe’s economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.While the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge.“The banking system is part of other systems ” said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages.“My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.”JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank.Italy’s second-biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said.Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank’s two core data centers had power supply from two independent power stations. It’s unclear how long its power would last.Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.Hot WaterBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year – enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour.The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight.The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off.Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their “Important Business Services” and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialize.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days.“This represents a serious gap in resilience planning ” said Avi Schnurr  CEO of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think-tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said.BNP Paribas  France’s biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices and data centers it operates across France  Belgium and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being “closely monitored” and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponizing energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine.

Bone Therapeutics publishes its interim financial report in English. A French translation of the report will also be made available. In the event of differences between the English and the French version of the report  the original English version will prevail.Bone Therapeutics acquires majority participation in Medsenic to derisk and broaden its therapeutic portfolio1Preparation of the Medsenic Phase III clinical trial with oral formulation following positive results from Phase II arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD (chronic GvH)Bone Therapeutics ALLOB’s Phase IIb interim results expected in H1 2023Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  7 September 2022  7am CEST – BONE THERAPEUTICS (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BOTHE)  the cell therapy company addressing unmet medical needs in orthopedics and other diseases  today announces its business update for the first half  ended 30 June 2022  prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union  and the outlook for the remainder of the year. The update also includes the Company’s reverse merger with Medsenic; a biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing therapies for autoimmune diseases.“Following the conclusion of activity in the first half of 2022  Bone Therapeutics has consolidated its successes and outlined its plans for the rest of the year. Having optimized the statistical analysis for the ongoing Phase IIb clinical study for our allogeneic cell therapy product  ALLOB  we are now of the view that ALLOB has the highest potential of near-term value creation. This is based on the successful completion of two clinical studies showing promising safety profile and efficacy signals in 66 patients ” said Jean Stéphenne  President of Bone Therapeutics. “Having built strong foundations  we now believe we will be able to maximize the productivity of the second half of the year. We are now looking forward to the continued development of our therapeutic pipeline  to bring these life-changing therapies to patients worldwide.”Story continuesOperational and Corporate highlightsIn March 2022  Bone Therapeutics realigned its strategic priorities to fully concentrate on the clinical development of its most advanced asset  ALLOB.In May 2022  Bone Therapeutics entered into a non-binding term sheet and exclusive discussions for a period of three months with the shareholders of Medsenic. Medsenic is a privately held  clinical stage biopharmaceutical company incorporated in France  specializing in the development of optimized formulations of arsenic salts and their application in inflammatory conditions and other potential new indications.In July 2022  Bone Therapeutics announced an optimized statistical analysis and the implementation of an interim analysis for the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial with its allogeneic bone cell therapy product  ALLOB. With the improved statistical analysis  the number of required patients could be reduced by 20%. The interim analysis will be added to the study providing an early assessment of ALLOB’s efficacy based on radiological data of the first 66 evaluable patients and more stringent efficacy end point criteria.In August 2022  Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic announced the signature of a binding contribution agreement to combine the operations of both companies by means of a share for share exchange  subject to the approval of the shareholders' meeting. The acquisition will result in the business combination of Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic to create BioSenic  a speciality biopharma company. 51% of Medsenic shares (valued at around EUR 40 million) will be contributed at a subscription price per share of EUR 0.45. In addition  each existing share will be entitled to subscribe to one additional share at EUR 0.45 in case of successful ALLOB interim results. Bone Therapeutics aims to acquire the remaining outstanding capital of Medsenic within 24 to 36 months. Following the completion of the Business Combination  it is anticipated that the executive leadership team will bring in François Rieger (CEO) and Véronique Pomi-Schneiter (Executive Director).(1) Subject to the approval of the shareholders’ meetingFinancial highlightsIn April 2022  Bone Therapeutics signed a binding term sheet for a EUR 5 million convertible bonds (CBs) facility arranged by ABO Securities. The proceeds of the financing will be particularly used to advance the clinical development of Bone Therapeutics’ lead asset  ALLOB. At the end of May 2022  Bone Therapeutics signed the definitive subscription agreement for a maximum EUR 5 million CBs facility with ABO Securities. The CBs will be issued and subscribed in ten tranches.During the first six months of 2022  total operating income amounted to EUR 0.40 million  a slight decrease compared to the same period in 2021 (EUR 0.77 million).Operating loss for the period amounted to EUR 3.96 million  compared to EUR 5.72 million in H1 2021.The Company ended the first six months of 2022 with EUR 3.96 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash used for the period amounted to EUR 5.55 million  compared to EUR 8.63 million over the same period of 2021.The combined group is expected to have a proforma cash position of at least EUR 5 million at closing. The Company plans to raise funds in the form of a private placement of new shares at the end of 2022 in order to finance the combined activities of Medsenic and the Company. In the meantime  the Company will make use of the existing EUR 5 million convertible facility obtained via ABO to finance its activities and to finance the convertible loan granted to Medsenic for of up to EUR 2 million  to secure their projects during this period.Disciplined cost and cash management will remain a key priority. The operating cash burn for the full year 2022 is expected to be in the range of EUR 8-10 million and a financing cash burn of approximately EUR 1.3 million  assuming normal operation as we continue to feel the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.Based on the completion of the current CB financing operation as mentioned above and the announced sole focus on the completion of the ALLOB TF2 study with related downsizing of the company  the Board is of the opinion that it is appropriate to prepare the 2022 interim financial statements of the Company under the assumption of going concern  considering a projected operational cash burn of €8 to 10 million for 2022 and a cash runway into Q1 2023.Outlook for the remainder of 2022 and 2023The transaction between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic is subject to the approval of the contribution by Bone Therapeutics' shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting (‘ESM’) to be convened by the Board of Bone Therapeutics in the course of September 2022. The transaction is also subject to certain other customary conditions including the confirmation that the proposed Business Combination would not lead to the necessity  for any subscriber involved to launch a mandatory takeover bid on Bone Therapeutics.The Phase IIb trial of Bone Therapeutics’ ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in the first half of 2023.The Medsenic Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD (chronic GvH) is complete and provided positive results. A phase IIa clinical trial for Lupus had previously established proof of concept of safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease: a Phase 2b clinical trial for severe Lupus is in the planning stage. A Phase III study of cGvHD is also currently anticipated to start in 2023. Also  positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis.The reverse merger between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic will soon lead to a new company  BioSenic. The new company plans to accelerate its development-mainly based upon clinical research  and will raise funds  in the form of a first private placement of new shares at the end of 2022  in order to finance its combined activities.Bone Therapeutics is a leading biotech company focused on the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and other diseases. Currently Bone Therapeutics is concentrating specifically on the development of its most advanced clinical asset  the allogeneic cell therapy platform  ALLOB.Bone Therapeutics’ core technology is based on its cutting-edge allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) which can be stored at the point of use in the hospital. Its leading investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to bone regeneration  which turns undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells. These cells are produced via the Bone Therapeutics’ scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental.Bone Therapeutics’ cell therapy products are manufactured to the highest GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards and are protected by a broad IP (Intellectual Property) portfolio covering ten patent families as well as knowhow. The Company is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium.

The study was initiated at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2021 and is currently ongoing in the US. The objective of the study is to document whether LTX-315 in combination with pembrolizumab is effective in inducing responses in patients who have failed prior anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy.The clinical trial application (CTA) has now been approved according to the European Clinical Trial Regulation  and the national authorities in Spain  France and Norway have commended the CTA for ATLAS-IT-05.The approval will enable the expansion of the site network and clinical impact field for LTX-315  mitigate recruitment challenges and drive enrollment in the ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II trial towards completion. The study will be performed at highly recognized sites with intratumoral immunotherapy expertise in the three European countries. It will be led by melanoma experts at each site and follow the same protocol as in the US.The regulatory application in Europe was submitted in Q2 2022 and six leading clinical sites in Europe are expected to open during the 4th quarter of 2022. Efforts to prepare the sites for initiation of the study and recruitment of patients is ongoing with the aim to complete enrollment in the study in early 2023.""We are very pleased to have received the regulatory approval to commence studies in three European countries. Lytix has mobilized internal resources and moved extraordinary fast in the face of the need to broaden the impact of this study among clinicians and key opinion leaders.

9625,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/analysis-europes-banks-dim-lights-as-they-brace-for-winter-blackout-1118821,Analysis-Europe’s banks dim lights as they brace for winter blackout,By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) -   Some of Europe&#039;s biggest banks are preparing back-up generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the regio…,As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that ATMs and online banking don’t go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe’s economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.While the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge. “The banking system is part of other systems ” said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages. “My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.” JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest U.S. bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank. Italy’s second-biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said. Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank’s two core data centres had power supply from two independent power stations. It’s unclear how long its power would last. Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  adding it had back-up generators  without elaborating.Hot waterBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kWh of electricity each year – enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour. The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight. The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off. Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their “Important Business Services” and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialise.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days. “This represents a serious gap in resilience planning ” said Avi Schnurr  CEO of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think-tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said. BNP Paribas  France’s biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices and data centres it operates across France  Belgium and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being “closely monitored” and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine. Russia blames those sanctions for causing the gas supply problems  which it puts down to pipeline faults.In Britain  rising energy costs are squeezing businesses and consumers  who are facing runaway inflation.State-backed NatWest said it had partially mitigated the financial hit by hedging future costs of its energy.Major insurers also said they were cutting their energy use. Switzerland’s Zurich said it would darken offices at night and mothball “decorative power consumers” like fountains.Should the crisis worsen  the sources said companies will take more drastic steps. And while staff may notice  the firms are hoping that customers won’t.“Additional measures that can be taken should the energy situation worsen include using only certain floors of the buildings  and the shutdown of certain services such as the employee gym ” the insurer said.(Additional reporting by Julien Ponthus in Paris and Carolyn Cohn in London; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi  John O’Donnell and David Evans),negative,0.03,0.47,0.5,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['winter blackout', 'Analysis-Europe', 'banks', 'lights', 'major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline', 'Electric Infrastructure Security Council', 'latest disaster recovery test', 'two independent power stations', 'two core data centres', 'remote working, power blackouts', 'biggest U.S. bank', 'Italian stock exchanges', 'interior branch lighting', 'equivalent UK peer', 'Prudential Regulation Authority', 'John O’Donnell', 'European gas prices', 'gas supply problems', 'power outage simulations', 'prolonged power outage', 'Business Continuity Plan', 'key office locations', 'British consumer bank', 'Important Business Services', 'European Central Bank', 'electricity supply cuts', 'decorative power consumers', 'University College London', 'energy saving measures', 'rising energy costs', 'pipeline faults', 'Major insurers', 'power supply', 'gas supplies', 'lengthy blackouts', 'biggest bank', 'disaster resilience', 'European hubs', 'data processing', 'power shortages', 'power outages', 'power consumption', 'operational continuity', 'future costs', 'Additional measures', 'office space', 'head office', 'Deutsche Bank', 'online banking', 'special urgency', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'different challenge', 'banking system', 'Gianluca Pescaroli', 'main concern', 'cascading effects', 'other services', 'energy use', 'visible steps', '4.9 million kWh', '49,000 light bulbs', 'running water', 'workplace temperatures', 'outdoor advertising', 'high alert', 'supervisory arm', 'serious gap', 'Avi Schnurr', 'BNP Paribas', 'state-controlled Gazprom', 'energy supplies', 'runaway inflation', 'State-backed NatWest', 'financial hit', 'drastic steps', 'energy situation', 'employee gym', 'Additional reporting', 'Julien Ponthus', 'Carolyn Cohn', 'Elisa Martinuzzi', 'David Evans', 'operational resilience', 'resilience planning', 'diesel generators', 'back-up generators', 'alternative sources', 'other systems', 'several days', 'Hot water', 'energy crisis', 'Western sanctions', 'financial firms', 'cashless transactions', 'fewer buildings', 'French lender', '1,400 buildings', 'Russia', 'continent', 'banks', 'ATMs', 'importance', 'payments', 'economy', 'fallout', 'war', 'sector', 'rationing', 'part', 'professor', 'authorities', 'society', 'failures', 'dependencies', 'internet', 'JPMorgan', 'thousands', 'Frankfurt', 'matter', 'Reuters', 'severity', 'person', 'money', 'companies', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'Italy', 'UniCredit', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'staff', 'slew', 'Germany', 'hour', 'washrooms', 'fountain', 'front', 'Regulators', 'PRA', 'lenders', 'disruption', 'Britain', 'methods', 'vulnerabilities', 'threats', 'experts', 'CEO', 'think-tank', 'hazards', 'arrangements', 'agreements', 'France', 'approximate', '2,750 branches', 'offices', 'Belgium', 'possibility', 'shutdown', 'retaliation', 'Moscow', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'businesses', 'Switzerland', 'Zurich', 'night', 'customers', 'floors', 'Paris']",2022-09-07,2022-09-08,fxempire.com

UniCredit  one of Italy’s largest banks  has power supply from two independent power stations that could provide energy to two of its data centers  a source told Reuters  without disclosing how long the power would last. France’s largest bank  BNP Paribas  has also taken steps to protect itself from supply cuts  Reuters reported  citing a source close to the bank. Apart from JPMorgan and Zurich  the companies mentioned in this article didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider. It’s not just banks that are cracking down on power consumption this year. European governments have introduced measures ahead of winter to prevent energy shortages. Germany has barred “energy-intensive heating” of private swimming and bathing pools  while Finland has urged people to spend less time in saunas and showers.To: denniswQ.

Had existed for 94 years. So their problem went to two issues. One was rising natural gas which was used in processing paper products  and the second was logistics jams in the system (they could not deliver on a scheduled basis because of a lack of drivers....not trucks). A lot of German companies are bringing up the driver issue. I stood in a German butcher-grill shop yesterday  and customers lined up. No ketchup.

A total of 11 abstracts highlighting data related to bimekizumab in psoriasis are being presented at the congress.Data presented from the BE BRIGHT OLE study showed that over eight out of 10 patients who achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) following 16 weeks of bimekizumab treatment maintained PASI 100 response and health-related quality of life outcomes through to three years with continuous maintenance dosing. In addition  approximately nine out of 10 patients who achieved absolute PASI (PASI ≤2) at week 16 maintained this response through to three years.1 Pooled data from up to three years of treatment in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials showed that bimekizumab was generally well-tolerated over this period with no safety signals identified.2 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S. and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).""These positive results highlight the deep and long-lasting skin clearance achieved with bimekizumab  along with a consistent safety and tolerability profile  and reinforce the positive relationship clearing skin has on patients' quality of life. These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting longer-term use of bimekizumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.""The findings presented today show that bimekizumab provided maintenance of completely clear skin and health-related quality of life outcomes in the majority of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over a three year period "" said Dr. Bruce Strober  Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Yale University  New Haven  Conn. ""The goal of psoriasis treatment often is complete clearance of skin symptoms  and the availability of long-term data across treatment options is important since it supports healthcare providers and patients to be more informed when making treatment decisions.""Three-year data from the BE BRIGHT OLE studyAll patients who had completed one of the pivotal Phase 3 studies (BE SURE  BE VIVID and BE READY) were eligible to enter the BE BRIGHT OLE study.1 On OLE entry  patients were assigned to bimekizumab 320 mg every four weeks (Q4W) or every eight weeks (Q8W) based on PASI 90 response at the end of the respective Phase 3 study.In all bimekizumab-randomized patients: 1¥Among week 16 PASI 100 responders (N=503)  89.3 percent achieved PASI 100 at year one (week 52) and 82.0 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI ≤2 responders (N=694)  96.5 percent achieved PASI ≤2 at year one (week 52) and 94.2 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI 100 responders in BE SURE and BE READY only (N=330)  92.0 percent achieved the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 at year one (week 56)  and 88.0 percent at year three (OLE week 96)In bimekizumab-randomized patients (320 mg Q4W for 16 weeks  and then every eight weeks [Q8W] through three years  BE SURE and BE READY only):1¥Among week 16 PASI 100 responders (N=147)  93.6 percent achieved PASI 100 at year one (week 52) and 84.4 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI ≤2 responders (N=189)  98.9 percent achieved PASI ≤2 at year one (week 52) and 96.8 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Among week 16 PASI 100 responders (N=147)  95.8 percent achieved DLQI 0/1 at year one (week 56) and 92.5 percent at year three (OLE week 96)Pooled safety data from up to three years of treatment in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trialsTotal bimekizumab exposure was 4245.3 patient-years (PY; N=1789) across the Phase 2 and 3 trials  and 3876.4 PY (N=1495; Q4W: 1965.6 PY; Q8W: 1914.5 PY) in the Phase 3 trials.2 Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred at an exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of 186.1 per 100 PY: serious TEAEs were seen at an EAIR of 5.6 new cases per 100 PY and TEAEs leading to discontinuation at 3.5 new cases per 100 PY.2The most common TEAEs in the Phase 2 and 3 trials with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis  oral candidiasis and upper respiratory tract infection at EAIRs of 15.3  10.2 and 7.1 new cases per 100 PY  respectively.2 The EAIR for oral candidiasis showed a decrease compared with two years of bimekizumab treatment (10.2 versus 12.6 new cases per 100 PY) and was lower with bimekizumab dosed Q8W compared with Q4W (7.1 and 15.9 per 100 PY  respectively).2 The vast majority of oral candidiasis events were mild to moderate (99.4 percent)  and none were serious.2 Serious infections occurred at a rate of 1.2/100 PY.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

With this achievement  Teleperformance increases its number of certified countries two years in a row  and confirms over 97% of its 420 000 global employees are working in a Great Place to Work® location. The sheer scale and magnitude of this global people initiative sets a very high standard in employee care for large global companies in all industry sectors.More than 200 000 Teleperformance employees participated in the annual survey  directly rating their employer on fairness  credibility  pride  respect  innovation  integrity  leadership behavior and support. Teleperformance employees overwhelmingly commended the company’s diversity  equity and inclusion efforts  its caring and welcoming company culture  and the sense of pride it fostered in employee professional accomplishments.“Managing 420 000 people in 88 countries is not always easy and we all share a common global commitment to be a great and welcoming worldwide employer.

The inventory of all the actions undertaken by the Group in favor of sustainable development is being finalized  and the independent third-party body responsible for monitoring the Committee's action will be appointed at its next meeting.Operations to protect water resources have been given a particular boost this year with the summer drought that hit the vineyards of Champagne  Provence and the Camargue. These exceptional climatic conditions reinforce our convictions on the necessity of preserving this vital resource so that the ""Truth of the Land"" can continue to express itself for future generations.ForecastIn Champagne  quantity and quality are on the agenda for the harvest and the yield in the appellation set at 12 000 kg/ha will be reached. In addition  interprofessional decisions have been taken in order to be able to reconstitute the quality reserves after the years 2020 and 2021 marked by low harvests.In Provence  the harvest of Château La Gordonne is excellent with an agronomic yield covering the maximum yield in AOP Côtes de Provence of 55 hl/ha.In Camargue  after a very poor year of 53 hl/ha in 2021  the yield for the 2022 harvest is 65 hl/ha  the first step in a progression that should lead to normative yields of 70 hl/ha in the future.In the Douro Valley  the harvest has only just begun.For 2022  the Group maintains its revenue growth forecast of +5%.This forecast is based on:Continued development of market share both in France and abroadThe evolution of the product mix towards the premium brands Vranken and Pommery & GrenoNext communicationPublication of 2021 annual turnover: 26 January 2023 after stock exchange closingAbout Vranken-Pommery MonopoleVranken-Pommery Monopole manages 2 600 hectares of land  owned outright or under lease and spread over four vineyards in Champagne  Provence  Camargue and Douro.

(NYSE: VOYA)  a leading health  wealth and investment company  announced today findings from a new consumer survey revealing that inflationary pressures have American employees increasingly focused on their e…,MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Voya Financial  Inc. (NYSE: VOYA)  a leading health  wealth and investment company  announced today findings from a new consumer survey revealing that inflationary pressures have American employees increasingly focused on their employer-provided benefits to help optimize their workplace benefits and savings needs.Specifically  due to inflation  Voya’s survey found that the majority of employed individuals (70%) agree they plan to spend more time reviewing their benefit selections during open enrollment to help make the most of their benefit dollars.1 However  to help employees make more informed benefit decisions for their unique personal circumstances  most will likely need some help. Interestingly  the new survey also revealed that 7 in 10 employed Americans (70%) are interested in receiving support to help optimize their benefits dollars across retirement savings  health-care insurance  health savings accounts (HSAs) and voluntary benefits like critical illness  hospital indemnity  disability income or accident insurance.1“ With inflation at record levels not experienced in decades  the financial stress caused by increasing prices is taking a toll on American workers. Voya’s new survey reveals that nearly three-quarters of Americans (74%) agree that inflation has made them more stressed about their personal financial situation  which is up from 66% in March of this year 1” explained Rob Grubka  CEO of Health Solutions  Voya Financial. “ If we look at lessons learned from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  it’s not surprising that American workers are once again turning to a trusted source for guidance and support — their employers. And  with the fall open enrollment season approaching for millions of Americans  it’s encouraging to see that workers intend to carve out more time to focus on reviewing all the workplace benefits offered by their employers to help optimize every hard-earned dollar.”The challenge for many individuals in the current landscape is understanding how to balance their short-term needs with their long-term financial goals. For example  when asked what concerned them the most  almost 9 in 10 surveyed Americans (88%) said it was the various impacts of inflation — such as the rising cost of food and groceries (38%)  rising gas prices (35%) and the rising cost of housing (15%). Interestingly  the rising cost of health care ranked fourth on this list of top concerns (9%)  followed by the rising cost of streaming and TV services (3%).1“ In our experience  typically when you ask workers what concerns them most when it comes to their health and wealth needs  the rising cost of health care would top the list. While still important  Voya’s latest survey highlights the impact of daily pressures and competing financial priorities that many are trying to navigate in today’s high-inflation environment ” said Andrew Frend  SVP of Strategy and Product  Voya Health Solutions. “ At Voya  we recognize that making informed decisions about your workplace benefits and savings needs can leave many employees feeling unsure as to whether they’re making the right choices. Now  add record inflation to the equation  and it’s clear that Americans need help.”“ For employers and benefits providers  this presents a tremendous opportunity to work together to help simplify and personalize the annual enrollment experience so employees can act with confidence in how they allocate their next dollar ” explained Frend. “ In addition to year-round education and communications efforts  innovative solutions and technology can be a game-changer. For example  earlier this year  Voya launched myHealth&Wealth — an integrated digital guidance tool that helps employees optimize their household spending across health insurance benefits  emergency savings and saving for retirement. This technology-enabled  interactive experience helps employees think about their benefits contributions and savings as a total ‘benefits budget ’ while providing a personalized action plan. Since Voya’s national launch in the spring  feedback from employer clients on myHealth&Wealth has been extremely positive  and Voya has plans to continue enhancing our solutions and capabilities to help individuals optimize their decision-making — which  ultimately  can help lead to improved outcomes.”In addition to myHealth&Wealth  Voya has launched several innovative solutions to help Americans holistically plan for their health and wealth needs  with more integrated experiences scheduled to launch this year. These resources include Voya’s: Emergency Savings fund solutions; budget calculator; Spanish-language experience; and the Voya Learn digital educational platform  which offers live and on-demand sessions on a variety of topics  including saving for emergencies  investing concepts and market volatility  retirement income planning  debt management and more.As an industry leader focused on the delivery of health  wealth and investment solutions to and through the workplace  Voya Financial is committed to delivering on its mission to make a secure financial future possible for all Americans — one person  one family  one institution at a time.1) Based on the results of a Voya Financial survey conducted June 17-21  2022  on the Ipsos eNation omnibus online platform among 1 005 adults  featuring 495 working Americans aged 18+ in the U.S.About Voya Financial®Voya Financial  Inc.

Our POSEIDON study for the alfapump in patients with liver disease continues to report strong interim results  including 70% 12 month survival for the Roll-In cohort  and we look forward to reporting primary endpoint data for the Pivotal cohort by year end. We are excited to see the continued strong clinical evidence of a disease-modifying profile for our DSR program for diuretic-resistant heart failure patients. In addition to no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during their study follow-up  which is remarkable given that typically one in four of these patients is re-admitted within a month of discharge  the 75% reduction in predicted 12 month mortality is highly promising for this patient group in need of improved clinical options. The evidence from our proof-of-concept studies show the long-term clinical benefits delivered by Short Term DSR therapy and we look forward to further demonstrating DSR’s potential in MOJAVE  our upcoming US phase 1b/2a multi-centred  randomized  controlled study with DSR 2.0  our second-generation DSR product.Story continues“Finally  the two highly experienced US medtech executives that we have added to our Board bring important expertise as we prepare for US commercialization of the alfapump  and we are well capitalised into Q3 2023 having successfully raised additional finance.”Operational Highlights – 2022 year to datePOSEIDON – North American pivotal study of alfa pump in patients with recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis on track to report top-line data in Q4 2022 Completion of alfa pump implantations in Roll-In and Pivotal cohorts. A preliminary interim analysis 1 of patient survival in the Roll-In cohort reported 70% survival at one year post-implantation  comparing favorably to published literature of only 50% survival for refractory ascites patients after one year. 2SAHARA – Phase 2a study of DSR therapy in decompensated heart failure patients reports strong interim data Interim results from 10 patients treated with our first-generation DSR product (“DSR 1.0”) show safe  rapid and effective decongestion  clear improvements in cardio-renal health and a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for loop diuretic drugs. Enrollment in SAHARA I 3 with DSR 1.0 completed. Study to be extended to treat a small number of patients with our second-generation DSR product (“DSR 2.0”) to support US IND 4 filing.Strong clinical observations from RED DESERT and SAHARA studies in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients support heart failure disease-modifying profile of DSR therapy No heart failure congestion-related re-hospitalizations during study follow-up. Clinical benefits result in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model 5 . An intensive treatment period of three to four weeks of DSR therapy delivers six to twelve months of important clinical benefits.Focus on Short Term DSR therapy with proprietary DSR 2.0 As a result of the strong  durable clinical signals observed  the Company will focus the heart failure development program on Short Term DSR with its proprietary DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter. DSR 2.0 is expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile. Preparations for US IND filing continue  including good progress in product development and GLP 6 animal studies.European MDR certification Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification received  confirming that the Company’s quality management system (QMS) and alfa pump are compliant with the latest regulatory standards required for medical devices in Europe. a lfa pump was one of the first novel Class III active implantable medical devices to be certified. In 2021  the Company also received Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) certification  thereby expanding its QMS towards the US and Canada.Expanding the Board of Directors with seasoned US medtech executives The Company appointed two highly experienced medtech leaders from the US as independent Non-Executive Directors. Doug Kohrs brings more than 40 years’ experience from his many roles as a founder and executive of leading medical technology companies. Alexandra Clyde brings more than 30 years’ experience and has an exceptional understanding and track record of successfully navigating health economics and reimbursement in the medical device industry.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented detailed positive results from the second of two Phase 3 trials (PRIME) evaluating ...,"Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced clinically meaningful reductions in itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks compared to placeboThere are currently no approved medicines specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis; regulatory submissions for Dupixent are under Priority Review in the U.S. and under review in the European Union22 Dupixent abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress across four dermatological diseases with underlying type 2 inflammationTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  Sept. 8  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented detailed positive results from the second of two Phase 3 trials (PRIME) evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data  which were consistent with the detailed data from the first Phase 3 trial (PRIME2) in prurigo nodularis  show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.""These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.""Story continuesThe late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

September 8  2022. Detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME trial evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis were presented today in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data from one of two pivotal trials in prurigo nodularis show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.Professor of Dermatology  Miller School of Medicine  University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center  and principal investigator of the trial“These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life. In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.”Story continuesThe late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupilumab in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

This launch is the result of the work of our technical and marketing teams. It marks the launch of a new phase of open collaboration and exchange with users  intending to open up all the AlphaVerse universes and become one of the most widely used metaverses in the world.”CBI: Strategy for the development of a connected and open metaverseThe core of CBI's activity is now focused on the development of AlphaVerse  a digital world (metaverse)  developed on the blockchain. CBI's metaverse intends to offer richer and more varied experiences than traditional video games. AlphaVerse aims to become THE gateway to the worlds of metaverses  hence its name in reference to ""Alpha"" (""One"" in Greek).A true platform for exchange and sharing  AlphaVerse is designed around a central place  the ""Hub""  which connects many universes in the field of games and entertainment. Some universes are developed by CBI for its own account  others are developed by CBI in association with partners  and others by third parties to be linked to AlphaVerse through the Hub. CBI has now focused its content on gaming and entertainment  including music and digital arts  interests that have broad community appeal  and has also developed a unique model for funding charitable initiatives.The universes offer experiences of play and interaction  sharing and creation of content and exchange. Visitors and players will be able to create  share and trade content inside AlphaVerse through NFTs and crypto-currencies  but also outside on various blockchain platforms.CBI's projects include  in addition to the metaverse  the development and commercialization of non-fungible tokens (""NFTs"") and crypto-currencies  notably Crystal  AlphaVerse's crypto-currency  of which 600 million units have been created with the first private sales already completed  and more generally the investment in projects related to blockchain technologies.Objectives of the AlphaVerse opening on September 20  2022With this first phase  accessible only by invitation  AlphaVerse intends to present to its community  its partners  and the press a brightly colored universe whose graphics and artistic direction are intended to be eminently more advanced than those of the currently accessible metaverses.This first phase will also be the occasion to unveil to the general public the features and innovations brought by AlphaVerse. Rather than forcing the user to live a predefined experience  AlphaVerse chooses to propose tools and functionalities to users so that they can design their own experience. The two major tools will be community houses and billboards. Community houses are digital real estate represented as NFTs that allow a user to recreate a community within the metaverse. Community houses include multiple floors and apartments the owner will be able to sell to members of his community. Furthermore  the community houses also include billboards that will be controlled by the user-owner and on which images  videos  or websites can be presented.Main features of AlphaVerseA universe of universes : AlphaVerse is designed to provide a unique and immersive experience for users. It combines many different universes  some developed by AlphaVerse and others by third parties. Players can easily switch from one universe to another using the same username and wallet (see the initial list of universes below).: AlphaVerse is designed to provide a unique and immersive experience for users.

AlphaVerse is an ever-evolving metaverse that will offer new features and content as it develops.Development of AlphaVerse-related universes and timelineFor FY 2022-2023 and beyond  the goal is to continue to develop AlphaVerse to become one of the major players in the metaverse universe globally.There are currently many metaverse projects in development. Each one is different and offers a partitioned user experience and specific tools. For each of these metaverses  the user must launch a different program  and with so many metaverses under construction  it will certainly become complicated to access them in a simple manner.In the AlphaVerse  the user can access multiple metaverses from one location: the Hub.MetaCoaster: a theme park simulation game on the blockchain.

Xave World: Xave AlphaVerse immerses the user in an ever-expanding and evolving open virtual world  where music fans discover a new world filled with music  incredible shows  festivals  and events. This metaverse is being acquired by CBI. The transaction initially called for the purchase of the business and IT development activities for $2 000 000 of which $1 500 000 was paid in CBI shares  with two earn-outs: $1 000 000 in CBI shares delivered upon delivery of additional features in the Xave universe  and a maximum of $2 000 000 in cash and the equivalent of $5 000 000 in CBI shares conditional on the future profitability level of the Xave universe. After analysis  as the IT developments are now handled by CBI  the parties decided to terminate the initial transaction. The transaction would now only concern the purchase of the business activities for a reduced price  and only the second earn-out conditional on the future profitability level of the Xave universe would be retained  with a modified formula to take into account the investments to be made by CBI. CBI will communicate as soon as possible on the transaction once the contract is renegotiated and signed.Xave AlphaVerse immerses the user in an ever-expanding and evolving open virtual world  where music fans discover a new world filled with music  incredible shows  festivals  and events.

This test  launching September 20  2022  will be open to 500 invitees only and will focus on letting them explore the AlphaVerse hub  visiting the various connected Metaverses and unique Community Houses within the AlphaVerse.CBI: Strategy and development of a connected and open metaverseCrypto Blockchain Industries (CBI) is a French company that is developing a portfolio of blockchain products with a view to capitalizing on this technology  both directly and through partnerships.CBI’s current focus is on the AlphaVerse  a digital world (metaverse) developed via blockchain technology. The AlphaVerse aims to offer richer and more varied experiences than those available in traditional video games. It aims to become *the* gateway to the worlds of metaverses  hence its name in reference to ""Alpha"" (""One"" in Greek).A platform built around interaction and sharing  the AlphaVerse features a central ""Hub "" which connects many worlds in the field of games and entertainment. Some universes are developed by CBI  others are created by CBI in association with partners  and others by third parties in order to be linked to AlphaVerse through the Hub. Current universes are focusing on music  digital arts  social good  and community building — and each connected metaverse allows users to enjoy games  social interaction  discovery  and philanthropy. Visitors and players will also be able to create  share  and market content inside AlphaVerse through NFTs and crypto-currencies  but also on various external blockchain platforms.As part of AlphaVerse development  CBI is creating Crystal  the AlphaVerse cryptocurrency  with 600 million units having been created on the blockchain with the first private sales already completed.Objectives of the Closed AlphaWith its first invite-only alpha test phase  AlphaVerse intends to present to its community  potential partners  and the press a bright and energetic universe whose graphics and artistic direction are eminently more advanced than other currently active metaverses.This first phase will be an opportunity to demonstrate some of the functionalities and innovations that are core to the AlphaVerse. Two major innovations will be Community Houses and Billboards.Community Houses are digital real estate represented as NFTs that allow a user to recreate a community within the metaverse. They include several floors and apartments that can be sold by the owner to their community. In addition  Community Houses also include display panels that will be controlled by the house’s owner(s) and on which images  videos  and websites can be presented.Main features of AlphaVerse• A Universe of Universes: The AlphaVerse combines many different universes  some developed by AlphaVerse and some by third parties. Players can seamlessly switch between universes using the same username and wallet. (See our initial list of universes below)• A Content Sharing System: Thanks to the system of billboards inside and outside the buildings  users can post static or video content to promote their project  their brand  and their community.• A Community World: The Hub and its affiliated universes are the building blocks of all communities. Users can meet up in their favorite places to chat  trade  discover  learn  and even participate in activities like concerts or movie screenings.• A Gaming Platform: All universes affiliated with AlphaVerse include playful interactions or are built around play-to-earn and learn-to-earn concepts.• Real-world Interactions: The metaverse should be a place for real-world interactions and applications.

Within the metaverse this allows users to buy  rent or build a house in the Hub and choose to make it private or public. All real estate is NFT that can be sold on the AlphaVerse Marketplace.…And more! AlphaVerse is an ever-evolving metaverse  so be sure to always come back for new features and content!Development plansFor the 2022-2023 fiscal year and beyond  the goal is to continue to build the AlphaVerse to become one of the main players in the metaverse universe on a global level.The current marketplace outside the AlphaVerse focuses on siloed metaverses that require special applications and have no connections to one another. In the AlphaVerse  the user can access multiple metaverses from a single location: the Hub.• Hub: Alpha Test Opening: September 20  2022• MetaCoaster: A blockchain-powered rollercoaster park management game where one can play alone or take part in the global park building competition and win cryptos.• Beat AlphaVerse: A universe dedicated to electronic music and charity.

Visitors to the Rave-age AlphaVerse will be able to watch videos  collect NFTs  and share experiences and content related to rave culture and electronic music. Users will be able to organize artistic events  such as festivals  concerts  and exhibitions around rave culture and the electronic music community.• Apex Islands: This AlphaVerse is a metaverse-powered digital animal sanctuary where the public can purchase digital artwork (NFT) based on powerful animals  both living and extinct.

The banking system is too important for Europe and its economy to be left affected by power outages.Banks are currently stress-testing alternative sources of energy  including backup generators  according to a Reuters source.JP Morgan  for example  has already had simulations of blackouts  the source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. Euronext has backup generators  the company operating the French and Italian stock markets said.Deutsche Bank has implemented a series of energy-saving measures  including shutting off hot water in office washrooms and switching off outdoor advertising during the night.Energy conservation is one of the measures European governments and local authorities have implemented to save gas and electricity amid low (or in Germany’s case now – non-existent) Russian pipeline gas supply and rallying gas and power prices.In July  Berlin and other cities in Germany started turning off the spotlights on historic monuments and municipal buildings in an effort to conserve energy ahead of what could be a winter of energy rationing.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,True,English,"['Energy Crisis', 'Europe', 'Banks', 'Blackouts', 'Russian pipeline gas supply', 'Italian stock markets', 'Russian gas giant', 'gas turbine repairs', 'testing alternative sources', 'possible power outages', 'Nord Stream pipeline', 'power prices', 'gas war', 'voluntary gas', 'backup generators', 'bank transactions', 'last week', 'three-day maintenance', 'operational defects', 'banking system', 'JP Morgan', 'Deutsche Bank', 'hot water', 'office washrooms', 'outdoor advertising', 'local authorities', 'other cities', 'historic monuments', 'municipal buildings', 'Tsvetana Paraskova', 'Top Reads', 'energy crisis', 'Energy conservation', 'Western sanctions', 'electricity conservation', 'difficult winter', 'energy-saving measures', 'European governments', 'energy rationing', 'Reuters source', 'Banks', 'ATMs', 'dark', 'plans', 'lights', 'analysis', 'turn', 'end', 'Gazprom', 'Friday', 'equipment', 'ante', 'Monday', 'Kremlin', 'shutdown', 'economy', 'example', 'simulations', 'blackouts', 'knowledge', 'situation', 'Euronext', 'company', 'French', 'series', 'night', 'low', 'Germany', 'case', 'July', 'Berlin', 'effort', 'Oilprice', 'More']",2022-09-07,2022-09-08,oilprice.com

9697,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4539625-bill-ackmans-pershing-square-hedge-fund-looks-compelling-discount,Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings Looks Compelling At A 35% Discount (OTCMKTS:PSHZF),"Pershing Square CEF can be a good long-term ""core"" holding in your portfolio  but it can also be a good holding for more active traders. Read more to know why.","Bryan BedderWritten by George Spritzer  co-produced by Alpha Gen CapitalAuthor's note: This article was released to Yield Hunting members on August 23rd  2022. Please check latest data before investing.Back in 2017  I last wrote an article on Pershing Square Holdings  the Bill Ackman hedge fund. The fund trades under the ticker PSH on the London exchange and the Euronext Amsterdam exchange. But it is also available as an ADR in the US under the ticker (OTCPK:PSHZF).In 2017  the price was around $13 with a 23% discount and Bill Ackman's fund was having a few rough years. In 2018  the fund was roughly flat  in line with the overall markets  but it came roaring back with very strong performance in 2019  2020 and 2021. In 2021  the fund traded above $40 although the discount never narrowed much. The NAV rose above $57 which is the new high water mark.In 2022  there is now another opportunity to buy PSHZF at a good price and I thought I would re-visit this fund. The price has dipped below $32 and the discount has widened out to an incredible 35% on August 16.Fund PerformanceThe Pershing Square Capital L.P. produced outstanding returns from 2004 through 2011. Since PSH was publicly traded in 2014  it has lagged the S&P 500 benchmark because of three bad years from 2015 to 2017 when the fund lost money on some short sales  and was using more of an ""activist"" approach.But based on Bloomberg data over the last five years  PSH has the best five-year NAV return of the 100 largest closed-end equity funds in the world since adopting its new strategy. This list includes funds ranging from $776 million to $16.6 billion in net asset value. You can see this table of the 100 largest closed-end equity funds as Appendix A in the PSH semi-annual shareholder report.Here are the annual returns for Pershing Square LP  the Pershing Square fund with the longest track record  along with PSH  for the years 2004-2022:PSH Historical Returns (Pershing Square Web site) PSH Performance Graph (Pershing Square web site)(Source: 2022 Pershing Square Holdings Semi-Annual Report)Portfolio ReviewPershing currently runs a highly concentrated portfolio. Their objective is to invest in durable  well-capitalized  high quality growth businesses with limited downside and which generate recurring and predictable cash flows. They also look for opportunities to enhance profit from carefully selected hedging transactions.Here are some excerpts about the current portfolio holdings from the semi-annual shareholder report.1) Universal Music Group (OTCPK:UMGNF)We believe that UMG's decades-long runway for growth remains underappreciated by investors. With increasing streaming penetration combined with the development of new services  platforms  and business models  UMG can grow revenues at an annual rate of 10% or so for more than a decade. High absolute levels of revenue growth coupled with UMG's fixed cost base should allow UMG to significantly expand its operating margins over time  generating highly attractive earnings growth for the foreseeable future. UMG's recent results support our longer-term view  as year-to-date  revenues and profits both increased at a mid-teens growth rate  well above analyst expectations and the company's guidance during last year's Capital Markets day. When viewed on a multi-year basis  UMG's revenue growth has both been higher and more consistent than Warner Music Group  its most closely followed peer.[...] Bill recently joined the UMG board and we look forward to working even more closely with the company as an engaged long-term shareholder. Given its long runway for sustained earnings growth  we believe that UMG's current valuation represents a significant discount to intrinsic value.2) Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR)QSR's franchised business model is a high-quality  capital-light  growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees from its four leading brands: Burger King  Tim Hortons  Popeyes  and Firehouse Subs.[...] QSR continues to trade at a discount to its peers and its intrinsic value. The company has repurchased more than 3% of its shares outstanding over the last twelve months  which when coupled with its 4% dividend yield  enables QSR to return approximately 7% of its market capitalization to shareholders on an annual basis.3) Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc. (CMG)Chipotle continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales  price increases to cover cost inflation  and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter  Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (""SSS"") and new restaurants  with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines  while digital sales declined only 3%  continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction  permitting  and supplies ease.[...] Chipotle's economic model remains firmly intact  with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter  up 0.8% year-over-year  and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S.  insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies.4) Hilton (HLT)Hilton is a high-quality  asset-light  high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential  led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel  with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.[...] Despite Hilton's accelerated near-term growth prospects and attractive long-term earnings algorithm  the stock is attractively priced at a low-20s multiple of 2023 earnings. We find Hilton's valuation to be compelling given its industry-leading competitive position  superb management team  attractive long-term net unit growth algorithm  pricing power  and best-in-class capital return policy.Lowe's is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.[...] Lowe's operational transformation is further magnified by its aggressive share repurchase program  which is likely to see the company acquire a high-single-digit percentage of its market capitalization in this year alone. The materiality of Lowe's Perpetual Productivity Initiative was on full display in their most recent quarter  whereby the company leveraged fixed expenses by 80 basis points  driving 10% earnings-per-share growth notwithstanding flat top line growth. The successful execution of Lowe's continued business transformation should allow the company to generate accelerated earnings growth for the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding our view on Lowe's attractive long-term earnings outlook  Lowe's currently trades at only 15 times forward earnings  a low valuation for a business of this quality  and a substantial discount to its direct competitor. We believe the current valuation reflects investors negative sentiment regarding the US housing market and incorporates the possibility of a greater than expected revenue decline. We believe the current valuation is highly attractive and anticipate Lowe's will generate high rates of returns from current levels if as we expect it continues to successfully execute the company's transformation.6) Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)CP is a high-quality  inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (""KCS"")  we believe that CP's prospects are bright.[...] CP's pending acquisition of KCS remains on track as the Surface Transportation Board's likely approval approaches. Based on the Board's updated procedural schedule  if all goes as expected  CP will gain operational control of KCS by the first quarter of 2023 at the latest. In the meantime  CP and KCS are preparing for synergies by holding productive discussions with potential customers  running proof of concept trains  and making capacity investments. By creating the only direct route from Canada to Mexico  the procompetitive merger offers shippers the unrivaled speed and service that is sorely needed to help ease supply chain congestion. We are confident in management's ability to achieve its revenue and cost synergy targets and create value for all stakeholders. While CP's year-to-date results reflect its strong business performance and favorable outlook  we believe CP's current valuation represents a meaningful discount to intrinsic value in light of the company's high-quality business model and long-term growth potential.7) The Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC)HHC's portfolio of well-located residential land and income-producing commercial assets continues to demonstrate resilient performance despite recent macro concerns of a slowdown in the housing market. The company's advantaged business model of owning master planned communities (""MPCs"") provides HHC substantial control over the planning and release of land for sale and development  enabling it to take a long-term approach to maximizing the value of its portfolio. As a result of its outright ownership of thousands of acres of conservatively financed land and a management team that combines superb capital allocation and development skills  the company is much less exposed to the cyclicality of standalone  smaller-scale real estate development companies.[...] While the company has made significant progress in simplifying its business and has a substantial runway for long-term value creation  we continue to believe its current share price is at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. The company has been able to capitalize on this discounted valuation by aggressively repurchasing its shares. Year to date  HHC has repurchased approximately 8% of its outstanding share count  funded by cash flow from operations and non-core asset sales. We believe HHC is extremely well positioned for the current inflationary environment due to its combination of high quality real estate assets and a largely fixed-rate liability structure. We expect the company to benefit from substantial land price appreciation and rental income growth in the coming years.8) Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) / Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC)There have been no material updates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2022. Both entities continue to build capital through retained earnings and now hold combined capital of $91 billion  up from nearly zero. As we have stated previously  as principally common shareholders (we own a small amount of preferred stock)  we own valuable perpetual options on both entities that over the long term we believe will be worth many multiples of today's prices once re-privatization occurs.Investment Management Fees - High Water MarkThe terms of the investment management agreement are lower than the usual 2%/20% charged by many other hedge funds. Pershing charges a 1.5% management fee and a 16% performance fee.The terms of the fund's management agreement with Pershing Square Capital Management have a ""high water mark"" feature such that investors only pay performance fees on increases in NAV above the highest NAV at which a performance fee has previously been charged.As a result  investors in the fund now will not incur any performance fees until the NAV of the fund exceeds the high water mark which is currently around $57 per share. Note that the current NAV on August 16 was reported at $50.90. The high water mark is adjusted for distributions  so the value dropped slightly because of the recent $0.125 quarterly dividend.Pershing Square BondsThe fund has access to low-cost unsecured investment-grade fixed rate leverage without mark-to-mark covenants.About 19% of PSH total assets is funded by long-term bonds with laddered maturities from 2027 through 2039. The weighted-average interest rate is 3.1%. The leverage is conservative given the fact that the PSHZF portfolio is highly liquid and easy to value.PSHZF Bonds (Pershing Square web site)Recent Share Buyback ActivityIn May 2022  PSHZF determined that it was appropriate to initiate a share buyback program. The initial $100 million program has since been extended by an additional $200 million. PSH completed the $100 million program having repurchased 3 245 831 PSH Public Shares at an average discount of 31.7%. In 2022 alone  the share buyback accretion has added about 60 basis points to the NAV performance.PSHZF reports its share buyback activity on a regular basis. Here is a chart showing the share buyback activity for the last two days expressed in US dollar terms:Date London Shares London Average Price Euronext Amsterdam Shares Euronext Amsterdam Average price NAV 08/23/2022 41 374 $31.73 13 165 $31.64 $50.90 08/22/2022 41 591 $31.86 13 489 $31.86 $50.90 Click to enlargePSH has repurchased 22.5% of its shares outstanding since its IPO  a total of 54 million shares at a price of $17.32 and at an average discount of 27.1%.Pershing Square Holdings (OTCPK:PSHZF):Launch Date: Jan 1  2013Total Assets = $ 11.8 BillionTotal Liabilities = $ 3.5 BillionTotal Equity = $ 8.3 BillionLast Dividend = $0.125 (quarterly)Management Fee= 1.50%Baseline Expense Ratio= 1.59%Discount to NAV= -35%Average 6 Month Discount= -29.7%NAV Update Frequency: WeeklyAverage Daily Volume of PSHZF= 28 266Average Dollar Volume of PSHZF= $900 000Leverage: 19%For most US investors  it is easier to buy the PSHZF ADR than to buy the PSH shares that trade on the London or Euronext Amsterdam exchanges. But the PSHZF ADR is not as liquid as the shares trading in Europe  and the bid-asked spread can be quite wide at times. It is best to be patient and use multiple smaller limit orders when buying the shares.While PSHZF looks quite attractive here for a purchase  it may be prudent to dollar cost average in because of the overall market conditions. PSHZF can be a good long term ""core"" holding in your portfolio  but it can also be a good holding for more active traders  especially if you own it in an IRA.For more active traders  I would use the following signals to trim the position:- The NAV reaches/exceeds the high water mark. At this point  performance fees kick in  and the shares are not as attractive.- The fund stops doing share buy backs. This happens periodically and usually signals a good time to trim the position.- The weekly discount to NAV drops below 23%.",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.02,mixed,0.37,0.19,0.44,True,English,"['Pershing Square Holdings', 'Bill Ackman', '35% Discount', 'OTCMKTS', 'PSHZF', 'The Pershing Square Capital L.P.', 'capitalized, high quality growth businesses', 'high-quality, capital-light, growing annuity', 'high-margin brand royalty fees', 'Pershing Square Web site', 'best five-year NAV return', '100 largest closed-end equity funds', 'new high water mark', 'Restaurant Brands International Inc.', 'PSH semi-annual shareholder report', 'Bill Ackman hedge fund', 'longer-term annual store growth', 'S&P 500 benchmark', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'Pershing Square LP', 'Alpha Gen Capital', 'High absolute levels', 'Capital Markets day', 'four leading brands', 'predictable cash flows', '1) Universal Music Group', 'increasing streaming penetration', 'Warner Music Group', 'successful menu innovation', 'Pershing Square fund', 'last twelve months', 'Yield Hunting members', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'attractive earnings growth', 'sustained earnings growth', 'franchised business model', 'net asset value', 'three-year cumulative basis', 'three bad years', 'longest track record', 'fixed cost base', 'mid-teens growth rate', 'last five years', 'current portfolio holdings', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill', 'PSH Historical Returns', 'PSH Performance Graph', 'The NAV', 'Semi-Annual Report', 'store base', 'annual rate', 'longer-term view', 'long-term shareholder', 'annual returns', 'annual basis', 'restaurant sales', 'restaurant industry', 'London exchange', 'overall markets', 'new strategy', 'new services', 'business models', 'revenue growth', 'current valuation', '4% dividend yield', 'cost inflation', 'new restaurants', 'outstanding returns', 'Portfolio Review', 'concentrated portfolio', 'multi-year basis', 'intrinsic value', 'rough years', 'strong performance', 'impressive performance', 'last year', 'Bryan Bedder', 'George Spritzer', 'latest data', 'short sales', 'activist"" approach', 'Bloomberg data', 'Appendix A', 'durable, well', 'limited downside', 'hedging transactions', 'decades-long runway', 'a decade', 'operating margins', 'foreseeable future', 'recent results', 'analyst expectations', 'Burger King', 'Tim Hortons', 'Firehouse Subs', 'market capitalization', 'ongoing recovery', 'pollo asado', 'second quarter', 'same-store sales', 'premise sales', 'pre-pandemic routines', 'digital sales', 'conventional sales', 'Fund Performance', 'ticker PSH', 'August 23rd', 'good price', 'price increases', 'significant discount', 'UMG board', 'OTCPK:PSHZF', '23% discount', 'Author', 'note', 'article', 'ADR', 'line', 'opportunity', 'money', 'world', 'list', 'Source', 'objective', 'recurring', 'opportunities', 'profit', 'excerpts', 'UMGNF', 'investors', 'development', 'platforms', 'revenues', 'time', 'company', 'guidance', 'peer', 'QSR', 'Popeyes', 'shares', 'shareholders', 'CMG', 'SSS', 'consumers', 'persistence']",2022-09-08,2022-09-08,seekingalpha.com

September 8  2022. Detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME trial evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis were presented today in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data from one of two pivotal trials in prurigo nodularis show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.Professor of Dermatology  Miller School of Medicine  University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center  and principal investigator of the trial“These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life. In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.”The late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupilumab in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented detailed positive results from the second of two Phase 3 trials (PRIME) evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data  which were consistent with the detailed data from the first Phase 3 trial (PRIME2) in prurigo nodularis  show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.""These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.""The late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Office lights are on in banks as dawn breaks behind the financial district of Canary Wharf  in London  Britain  June 24  2016.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe's economy  already fragile due to the fallout of warLONDON  United Kingdom – Some of Europe’s biggest banks are preparing backup generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the region’s economy.As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that automated teller machines and online banking don’t go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe’s economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.While the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge.“The banking system is part of other systems ” said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages.“My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.”JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest US bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank.Italy’s second biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said.Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank’s two core data centers had power supply from two independent power stations. It’s unclear how long its power would last.Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  adding it had backup generators  without elaborating.Hot waterBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year – enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour.The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  and switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight.The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off.Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their “Important Business Services” and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialize.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days.“This represents a serious gap in resilience planning ” said Avi Schnurr  chief executive officer of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said.BNP Paribas  France’s biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices  and data centers it operates across France  Belgium  and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being “closely monitored” and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponizing energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine. Russia blames those sanctions for causing the gas supply problems  which it puts down to pipeline faults.In Britain  rising energy costs are squeezing businesses and consumers  who are facing runaway inflation.State-backed NatWest said it had partially mitigated the financial hit by hedging future costs of its energy.Major insurers also said they were cutting their energy use. Switzerland’s Zurich said it would darken offices at night and mothball “decorative power consumers” like fountains.Should the crisis worsen  the sources said companies will take more drastic steps.

With this achievement  Teleperformance increases its number of certified countries two years in a row  and confirms over 97% of its 420 000 global employees are working in a Great Place to Work® location. The sheer scale and magnitude of this global people initiative sets a very high standard in employee care for large global companies in all industry sectors.More than 200 000 Teleperformance employees participated in the annual survey  directly rating their employer on fairness  credibility  pride  respect  innovation  integrity  leadership behavior and support. Teleperformance employees overwhelmingly commended the company’s diversity  equity and inclusion efforts  its caring and welcoming company culture  and the sense of pride it fostered in employee professional accomplishments.""Managing 420 000 people in 88 countries is not always easy and we all share a common global commitment to be a great and welcoming worldwide employer. As the workplace evolves and employee expectations shift  the Great Place to Work evaluation is a comprehensive and critical independent benchmark for how our employees feel we are living up to our values and guiding principles  said Teleperformance Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Daniel Julien. We know we have to earn our employees’ trust and loyalty every day and we are committed to continuing our efforts to improve even when every single employee is working in a Great Place to Work certified location.""""We recognize that the Great Place to Work Certification is not something that comes easily – it takes ongoing dedication to building a strong workplace culture and employee experience  said Michael C. Bush  CEO of Great Place to Work. Our most recent global survey showed that only about half of employees are experiencing a great workplace  so Teleperformance achieving 97% with such a huge number of employees is very impressive. It illustrates the company’s unwavering commitment to creating and exceeding its own standard of excellence year after year.""Story continuesGreat Place to Work is the global authority on workplace culture and employee experience  and the only certification program based on rigorous methodology and validated employee feedback. Contributing to the overwhelming response and employee satisfaction include the effective scaling of several Teleperformance workplace and culture initiatives:United colors of Teleperformance: Teleperformance continues to implement and scale its unique diversity  equity and inclusivity framework to build a healthy work environment that is welcoming and safe for all of its employees  and ensure they can thrive and be their authentic selves Return to office flexibility: the TP Cloud Campus initiative to support work-from-home flexibility – already in progress in 2020 – was accelerated during the pandemic  allowing employees to work and collaborate seamlessly from wherever they are. The campus enabled more than 80% of employees to work from home during the pandemic and continues to give its employees more options and fewer disruptions to their workdays  even as employees head back to the physical workplace Family first mentality: Teleperformance takes seriously its role in the lives of its 420 000 employees across the globe and ramped up its efforts during the pandemic to support its employees and their families  even continuously working with governments in each country to adapt benefits plans to support its employee health needs.""Taking care of our people is always our number one priority  which has guided every decision we’ve made during the past two years  said Alan Winters  Chief People Officer and Chief Diversity Officer at Teleperformance Group. We’re living in a new world that demands flexibility  thinking outside the box and open  honest and transparent communication. It is a tremendous vote of confidence that our employees recognize and appreciate our efforts to create an inclusive and caring workplace.""Among the 64 countries that recently received certification  Teleperformance added four new countries: Croatia  Belgium  Kazakhstan and Serbia. Teleperformance’s Core Services & Digital Integrated Business Services (D.I.B.S.) were certified in every major geography: nine countries in the English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)  13 countries in Ibero-LATAM  27 countries in Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)  and in India.
