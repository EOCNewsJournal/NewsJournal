With this achievement  Teleperformance increases its number of certified countries two years in a row  and confirms over 97% of its 420 000 global employees are working in a Great Place to Work® location. The sheer scale and magnitude of this global people initiative sets a very high standard in employee care for large global companies in all industry sectors.More than 200 000 Teleperformance employees participated in the annual survey  directly rating their employer on fairness  credibility  pride  respect  innovation  integrity  leadership behavior and support. Teleperformance employees overwhelmingly commended the company’s diversity  equity and inclusion efforts  its caring and welcoming company culture  and the sense of pride it fostered in employee professional accomplishments.“Managing 420 000 people in 88 countries is not always easy and we all share a common global commitment to be a great and welcoming worldwide employer.

The inventory of all the actions undertaken by the Group in favor of sustainable development is being finalized  and the independent third-party body responsible for monitoring the Committee's action will be appointed at its next meeting.Operations to protect water resources have been given a particular boost this year with the summer drought that hit the vineyards of Champagne  Provence and the Camargue. These exceptional climatic conditions reinforce our convictions on the necessity of preserving this vital resource so that the ""Truth of the Land"" can continue to express itself for future generations.ForecastIn Champagne  quantity and quality are on the agenda for the harvest and the yield in the appellation set at 12 000 kg/ha will be reached. In addition  interprofessional decisions have been taken in order to be able to reconstitute the quality reserves after the years 2020 and 2021 marked by low harvests.In Provence  the harvest of Château La Gordonne is excellent with an agronomic yield covering the maximum yield in AOP Côtes de Provence of 55 hl/ha.In Camargue  after a very poor year of 53 hl/ha in 2021  the yield for the 2022 harvest is 65 hl/ha  the first step in a progression that should lead to normative yields of 70 hl/ha in the future.In the Douro Valley  the harvest has only just begun.For 2022  the Group maintains its revenue growth forecast of +5%.This forecast is based on:Continued development of market share both in France and abroadThe evolution of the product mix towards the premium brands Vranken and Pommery & GrenoNext communicationPublication of 2021 annual turnover: 26 January 2023 after stock exchange closingAbout Vranken-Pommery MonopoleVranken-Pommery Monopole manages 2 600 hectares of land  owned outright or under lease and spread over four vineyards in Champagne  Provence  Camargue and Douro.

(NYSE: VOYA)  a leading health  wealth and investment company  announced today findings from a new consumer survey revealing that inflationary pressures have American employees increasingly focused on their e…,MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Voya Financial  Inc. (NYSE: VOYA)  a leading health  wealth and investment company  announced today findings from a new consumer survey revealing that inflationary pressures have American employees increasingly focused on their employer-provided benefits to help optimize their workplace benefits and savings needs.Specifically  due to inflation  Voya’s survey found that the majority of employed individuals (70%) agree they plan to spend more time reviewing their benefit selections during open enrollment to help make the most of their benefit dollars.1 However  to help employees make more informed benefit decisions for their unique personal circumstances  most will likely need some help. Interestingly  the new survey also revealed that 7 in 10 employed Americans (70%) are interested in receiving support to help optimize their benefits dollars across retirement savings  health-care insurance  health savings accounts (HSAs) and voluntary benefits like critical illness  hospital indemnity  disability income or accident insurance.1“ With inflation at record levels not experienced in decades  the financial stress caused by increasing prices is taking a toll on American workers. Voya’s new survey reveals that nearly three-quarters of Americans (74%) agree that inflation has made them more stressed about their personal financial situation  which is up from 66% in March of this year 1” explained Rob Grubka  CEO of Health Solutions  Voya Financial. “ If we look at lessons learned from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  it’s not surprising that American workers are once again turning to a trusted source for guidance and support — their employers. And  with the fall open enrollment season approaching for millions of Americans  it’s encouraging to see that workers intend to carve out more time to focus on reviewing all the workplace benefits offered by their employers to help optimize every hard-earned dollar.”The challenge for many individuals in the current landscape is understanding how to balance their short-term needs with their long-term financial goals. For example  when asked what concerned them the most  almost 9 in 10 surveyed Americans (88%) said it was the various impacts of inflation — such as the rising cost of food and groceries (38%)  rising gas prices (35%) and the rising cost of housing (15%). Interestingly  the rising cost of health care ranked fourth on this list of top concerns (9%)  followed by the rising cost of streaming and TV services (3%).1“ In our experience  typically when you ask workers what concerns them most when it comes to their health and wealth needs  the rising cost of health care would top the list. While still important  Voya’s latest survey highlights the impact of daily pressures and competing financial priorities that many are trying to navigate in today’s high-inflation environment ” said Andrew Frend  SVP of Strategy and Product  Voya Health Solutions. “ At Voya  we recognize that making informed decisions about your workplace benefits and savings needs can leave many employees feeling unsure as to whether they’re making the right choices. Now  add record inflation to the equation  and it’s clear that Americans need help.”“ For employers and benefits providers  this presents a tremendous opportunity to work together to help simplify and personalize the annual enrollment experience so employees can act with confidence in how they allocate their next dollar ” explained Frend. “ In addition to year-round education and communications efforts  innovative solutions and technology can be a game-changer. For example  earlier this year  Voya launched myHealth&Wealth — an integrated digital guidance tool that helps employees optimize their household spending across health insurance benefits  emergency savings and saving for retirement. This technology-enabled  interactive experience helps employees think about their benefits contributions and savings as a total ‘benefits budget ’ while providing a personalized action plan. Since Voya’s national launch in the spring  feedback from employer clients on myHealth&Wealth has been extremely positive  and Voya has plans to continue enhancing our solutions and capabilities to help individuals optimize their decision-making — which  ultimately  can help lead to improved outcomes.”In addition to myHealth&Wealth  Voya has launched several innovative solutions to help Americans holistically plan for their health and wealth needs  with more integrated experiences scheduled to launch this year. These resources include Voya’s: Emergency Savings fund solutions; budget calculator; Spanish-language experience; and the Voya Learn digital educational platform  which offers live and on-demand sessions on a variety of topics  including saving for emergencies  investing concepts and market volatility  retirement income planning  debt management and more.As an industry leader focused on the delivery of health  wealth and investment solutions to and through the workplace  Voya Financial is committed to delivering on its mission to make a secure financial future possible for all Americans — one person  one family  one institution at a time.1) Based on the results of a Voya Financial survey conducted June 17-21  2022  on the Ipsos eNation omnibus online platform among 1 005 adults  featuring 495 working Americans aged 18+ in the U.S.About Voya Financial®Voya Financial  Inc.

Our POSEIDON study for the alfapump in patients with liver disease continues to report strong interim results  including 70% 12 month survival for the Roll-In cohort  and we look forward to reporting primary endpoint data for the Pivotal cohort by year end. We are excited to see the continued strong clinical evidence of a disease-modifying profile for our DSR program for diuretic-resistant heart failure patients. In addition to no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during their study follow-up  which is remarkable given that typically one in four of these patients is re-admitted within a month of discharge  the 75% reduction in predicted 12 month mortality is highly promising for this patient group in need of improved clinical options. The evidence from our proof-of-concept studies show the long-term clinical benefits delivered by Short Term DSR therapy and we look forward to further demonstrating DSR’s potential in MOJAVE  our upcoming US phase 1b/2a multi-centred  randomized  controlled study with DSR 2.0  our second-generation DSR product.Story continues“Finally  the two highly experienced US medtech executives that we have added to our Board bring important expertise as we prepare for US commercialization of the alfapump  and we are well capitalised into Q3 2023 having successfully raised additional finance.”Operational Highlights – 2022 year to datePOSEIDON – North American pivotal study of alfa pump in patients with recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis on track to report top-line data in Q4 2022 Completion of alfa pump implantations in Roll-In and Pivotal cohorts. A preliminary interim analysis 1 of patient survival in the Roll-In cohort reported 70% survival at one year post-implantation  comparing favorably to published literature of only 50% survival for refractory ascites patients after one year. 2SAHARA – Phase 2a study of DSR therapy in decompensated heart failure patients reports strong interim data Interim results from 10 patients treated with our first-generation DSR product (“DSR 1.0”) show safe  rapid and effective decongestion  clear improvements in cardio-renal health and a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for loop diuretic drugs. Enrollment in SAHARA I 3 with DSR 1.0 completed. Study to be extended to treat a small number of patients with our second-generation DSR product (“DSR 2.0”) to support US IND 4 filing.Strong clinical observations from RED DESERT and SAHARA studies in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients support heart failure disease-modifying profile of DSR therapy No heart failure congestion-related re-hospitalizations during study follow-up. Clinical benefits result in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model 5 . An intensive treatment period of three to four weeks of DSR therapy delivers six to twelve months of important clinical benefits.Focus on Short Term DSR therapy with proprietary DSR 2.0 As a result of the strong  durable clinical signals observed  the Company will focus the heart failure development program on Short Term DSR with its proprietary DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter. DSR 2.0 is expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile. Preparations for US IND filing continue  including good progress in product development and GLP 6 animal studies.European MDR certification Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification received  confirming that the Company’s quality management system (QMS) and alfa pump are compliant with the latest regulatory standards required for medical devices in Europe. a lfa pump was one of the first novel Class III active implantable medical devices to be certified. In 2021  the Company also received Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) certification  thereby expanding its QMS towards the US and Canada.Expanding the Board of Directors with seasoned US medtech executives The Company appointed two highly experienced medtech leaders from the US as independent Non-Executive Directors. Doug Kohrs brings more than 40 years’ experience from his many roles as a founder and executive of leading medical technology companies. Alexandra Clyde brings more than 30 years’ experience and has an exceptional understanding and track record of successfully navigating health economics and reimbursement in the medical device industry.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented detailed positive results from the second of two Phase 3 trials (PRIME) evaluating ...,"Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced clinically meaningful reductions in itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks compared to placeboThere are currently no approved medicines specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis; regulatory submissions for Dupixent are under Priority Review in the U.S. and under review in the European Union22 Dupixent abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress across four dermatological diseases with underlying type 2 inflammationTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  Sept. 8  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented detailed positive results from the second of two Phase 3 trials (PRIME) evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data  which were consistent with the detailed data from the first Phase 3 trial (PRIME2) in prurigo nodularis  show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.""These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.""Story continuesThe late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

September 8  2022. Detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME trial evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis were presented today in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data from one of two pivotal trials in prurigo nodularis show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.Professor of Dermatology  Miller School of Medicine  University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center  and principal investigator of the trial“These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life. In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.”Story continuesThe late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupilumab in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

This launch is the result of the work of our technical and marketing teams. It marks the launch of a new phase of open collaboration and exchange with users  intending to open up all the AlphaVerse universes and become one of the most widely used metaverses in the world.”CBI: Strategy for the development of a connected and open metaverseThe core of CBI's activity is now focused on the development of AlphaVerse  a digital world (metaverse)  developed on the blockchain. CBI's metaverse intends to offer richer and more varied experiences than traditional video games. AlphaVerse aims to become THE gateway to the worlds of metaverses  hence its name in reference to ""Alpha"" (""One"" in Greek).A true platform for exchange and sharing  AlphaVerse is designed around a central place  the ""Hub""  which connects many universes in the field of games and entertainment. Some universes are developed by CBI for its own account  others are developed by CBI in association with partners  and others by third parties to be linked to AlphaVerse through the Hub. CBI has now focused its content on gaming and entertainment  including music and digital arts  interests that have broad community appeal  and has also developed a unique model for funding charitable initiatives.The universes offer experiences of play and interaction  sharing and creation of content and exchange. Visitors and players will be able to create  share and trade content inside AlphaVerse through NFTs and crypto-currencies  but also outside on various blockchain platforms.CBI's projects include  in addition to the metaverse  the development and commercialization of non-fungible tokens (""NFTs"") and crypto-currencies  notably Crystal  AlphaVerse's crypto-currency  of which 600 million units have been created with the first private sales already completed  and more generally the investment in projects related to blockchain technologies.Objectives of the AlphaVerse opening on September 20  2022With this first phase  accessible only by invitation  AlphaVerse intends to present to its community  its partners  and the press a brightly colored universe whose graphics and artistic direction are intended to be eminently more advanced than those of the currently accessible metaverses.This first phase will also be the occasion to unveil to the general public the features and innovations brought by AlphaVerse. Rather than forcing the user to live a predefined experience  AlphaVerse chooses to propose tools and functionalities to users so that they can design their own experience. The two major tools will be community houses and billboards. Community houses are digital real estate represented as NFTs that allow a user to recreate a community within the metaverse. Community houses include multiple floors and apartments the owner will be able to sell to members of his community. Furthermore  the community houses also include billboards that will be controlled by the user-owner and on which images  videos  or websites can be presented.Main features of AlphaVerseA universe of universes : AlphaVerse is designed to provide a unique and immersive experience for users. It combines many different universes  some developed by AlphaVerse and others by third parties. Players can easily switch from one universe to another using the same username and wallet (see the initial list of universes below).: AlphaVerse is designed to provide a unique and immersive experience for users.

AlphaVerse is an ever-evolving metaverse that will offer new features and content as it develops.Development of AlphaVerse-related universes and timelineFor FY 2022-2023 and beyond  the goal is to continue to develop AlphaVerse to become one of the major players in the metaverse universe globally.There are currently many metaverse projects in development. Each one is different and offers a partitioned user experience and specific tools. For each of these metaverses  the user must launch a different program  and with so many metaverses under construction  it will certainly become complicated to access them in a simple manner.In the AlphaVerse  the user can access multiple metaverses from one location: the Hub.MetaCoaster: a theme park simulation game on the blockchain.

Xave World: Xave AlphaVerse immerses the user in an ever-expanding and evolving open virtual world  where music fans discover a new world filled with music  incredible shows  festivals  and events. This metaverse is being acquired by CBI. The transaction initially called for the purchase of the business and IT development activities for $2 000 000 of which $1 500 000 was paid in CBI shares  with two earn-outs: $1 000 000 in CBI shares delivered upon delivery of additional features in the Xave universe  and a maximum of $2 000 000 in cash and the equivalent of $5 000 000 in CBI shares conditional on the future profitability level of the Xave universe. After analysis  as the IT developments are now handled by CBI  the parties decided to terminate the initial transaction. The transaction would now only concern the purchase of the business activities for a reduced price  and only the second earn-out conditional on the future profitability level of the Xave universe would be retained  with a modified formula to take into account the investments to be made by CBI. CBI will communicate as soon as possible on the transaction once the contract is renegotiated and signed.Xave AlphaVerse immerses the user in an ever-expanding and evolving open virtual world  where music fans discover a new world filled with music  incredible shows  festivals  and events.

This test  launching September 20  2022  will be open to 500 invitees only and will focus on letting them explore the AlphaVerse hub  visiting the various connected Metaverses and unique Community Houses within the AlphaVerse.CBI: Strategy and development of a connected and open metaverseCrypto Blockchain Industries (CBI) is a French company that is developing a portfolio of blockchain products with a view to capitalizing on this technology  both directly and through partnerships.CBI’s current focus is on the AlphaVerse  a digital world (metaverse) developed via blockchain technology. The AlphaVerse aims to offer richer and more varied experiences than those available in traditional video games. It aims to become *the* gateway to the worlds of metaverses  hence its name in reference to ""Alpha"" (""One"" in Greek).A platform built around interaction and sharing  the AlphaVerse features a central ""Hub "" which connects many worlds in the field of games and entertainment. Some universes are developed by CBI  others are created by CBI in association with partners  and others by third parties in order to be linked to AlphaVerse through the Hub. Current universes are focusing on music  digital arts  social good  and community building — and each connected metaverse allows users to enjoy games  social interaction  discovery  and philanthropy. Visitors and players will also be able to create  share  and market content inside AlphaVerse through NFTs and crypto-currencies  but also on various external blockchain platforms.As part of AlphaVerse development  CBI is creating Crystal  the AlphaVerse cryptocurrency  with 600 million units having been created on the blockchain with the first private sales already completed.Objectives of the Closed AlphaWith its first invite-only alpha test phase  AlphaVerse intends to present to its community  potential partners  and the press a bright and energetic universe whose graphics and artistic direction are eminently more advanced than other currently active metaverses.This first phase will be an opportunity to demonstrate some of the functionalities and innovations that are core to the AlphaVerse. Two major innovations will be Community Houses and Billboards.Community Houses are digital real estate represented as NFTs that allow a user to recreate a community within the metaverse. They include several floors and apartments that can be sold by the owner to their community. In addition  Community Houses also include display panels that will be controlled by the house’s owner(s) and on which images  videos  and websites can be presented.Main features of AlphaVerse• A Universe of Universes: The AlphaVerse combines many different universes  some developed by AlphaVerse and some by third parties. Players can seamlessly switch between universes using the same username and wallet. (See our initial list of universes below)• A Content Sharing System: Thanks to the system of billboards inside and outside the buildings  users can post static or video content to promote their project  their brand  and their community.• A Community World: The Hub and its affiliated universes are the building blocks of all communities. Users can meet up in their favorite places to chat  trade  discover  learn  and even participate in activities like concerts or movie screenings.• A Gaming Platform: All universes affiliated with AlphaVerse include playful interactions or are built around play-to-earn and learn-to-earn concepts.• Real-world Interactions: The metaverse should be a place for real-world interactions and applications.

Within the metaverse this allows users to buy  rent or build a house in the Hub and choose to make it private or public. All real estate is NFT that can be sold on the AlphaVerse Marketplace.…And more! AlphaVerse is an ever-evolving metaverse  so be sure to always come back for new features and content!Development plansFor the 2022-2023 fiscal year and beyond  the goal is to continue to build the AlphaVerse to become one of the main players in the metaverse universe on a global level.The current marketplace outside the AlphaVerse focuses on siloed metaverses that require special applications and have no connections to one another. In the AlphaVerse  the user can access multiple metaverses from a single location: the Hub.• Hub: Alpha Test Opening: September 20  2022• MetaCoaster: A blockchain-powered rollercoaster park management game where one can play alone or take part in the global park building competition and win cryptos.• Beat AlphaVerse: A universe dedicated to electronic music and charity.

Visitors to the Rave-age AlphaVerse will be able to watch videos  collect NFTs  and share experiences and content related to rave culture and electronic music. Users will be able to organize artistic events  such as festivals  concerts  and exhibitions around rave culture and the electronic music community.• Apex Islands: This AlphaVerse is a metaverse-powered digital animal sanctuary where the public can purchase digital artwork (NFT) based on powerful animals  both living and extinct.

9697,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4539625-bill-ackmans-pershing-square-hedge-fund-looks-compelling-discount,Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings Looks Compelling At A 35% Discount (OTCMKTS:PSHZF),"Pershing Square CEF can be a good long-term ""core"" holding in your portfolio  but it can also be a good holding for more active traders. Read more to know why.","Bryan BedderWritten by George Spritzer  co-produced by Alpha Gen CapitalAuthor's note: This article was released to Yield Hunting members on August 23rd  2022. Please check latest data before investing.Back in 2017  I last wrote an article on Pershing Square Holdings  the Bill Ackman hedge fund. The fund trades under the ticker PSH on the London exchange and the Euronext Amsterdam exchange. But it is also available as an ADR in the US under the ticker (OTCPK:PSHZF).In 2017  the price was around $13 with a 23% discount and Bill Ackman's fund was having a few rough years. In 2018  the fund was roughly flat  in line with the overall markets  but it came roaring back with very strong performance in 2019  2020 and 2021. In 2021  the fund traded above $40 although the discount never narrowed much. The NAV rose above $57 which is the new high water mark.In 2022  there is now another opportunity to buy PSHZF at a good price and I thought I would re-visit this fund. The price has dipped below $32 and the discount has widened out to an incredible 35% on August 16.Fund PerformanceThe Pershing Square Capital L.P. produced outstanding returns from 2004 through 2011. Since PSH was publicly traded in 2014  it has lagged the S&P 500 benchmark because of three bad years from 2015 to 2017 when the fund lost money on some short sales  and was using more of an ""activist"" approach.But based on Bloomberg data over the last five years  PSH has the best five-year NAV return of the 100 largest closed-end equity funds in the world since adopting its new strategy. This list includes funds ranging from $776 million to $16.6 billion in net asset value. You can see this table of the 100 largest closed-end equity funds as Appendix A in the PSH semi-annual shareholder report.Here are the annual returns for Pershing Square LP  the Pershing Square fund with the longest track record  along with PSH  for the years 2004-2022:PSH Historical Returns (Pershing Square Web site) PSH Performance Graph (Pershing Square web site)(Source: 2022 Pershing Square Holdings Semi-Annual Report)Portfolio ReviewPershing currently runs a highly concentrated portfolio. Their objective is to invest in durable  well-capitalized  high quality growth businesses with limited downside and which generate recurring and predictable cash flows. They also look for opportunities to enhance profit from carefully selected hedging transactions.Here are some excerpts about the current portfolio holdings from the semi-annual shareholder report.1) Universal Music Group (OTCPK:UMGNF)We believe that UMG's decades-long runway for growth remains underappreciated by investors. With increasing streaming penetration combined with the development of new services  platforms  and business models  UMG can grow revenues at an annual rate of 10% or so for more than a decade. High absolute levels of revenue growth coupled with UMG's fixed cost base should allow UMG to significantly expand its operating margins over time  generating highly attractive earnings growth for the foreseeable future. UMG's recent results support our longer-term view  as year-to-date  revenues and profits both increased at a mid-teens growth rate  well above analyst expectations and the company's guidance during last year's Capital Markets day. When viewed on a multi-year basis  UMG's revenue growth has both been higher and more consistent than Warner Music Group  its most closely followed peer.[...] Bill recently joined the UMG board and we look forward to working even more closely with the company as an engaged long-term shareholder. Given its long runway for sustained earnings growth  we believe that UMG's current valuation represents a significant discount to intrinsic value.2) Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR)QSR's franchised business model is a high-quality  capital-light  growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees from its four leading brands: Burger King  Tim Hortons  Popeyes  and Firehouse Subs.[...] QSR continues to trade at a discount to its peers and its intrinsic value. The company has repurchased more than 3% of its shares outstanding over the last twelve months  which when coupled with its 4% dividend yield  enables QSR to return approximately 7% of its market capitalization to shareholders on an annual basis.3) Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc. (CMG)Chipotle continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales  price increases to cover cost inflation  and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter  Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (""SSS"") and new restaurants  with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines  while digital sales declined only 3%  continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction  permitting  and supplies ease.[...] Chipotle's economic model remains firmly intact  with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter  up 0.8% year-over-year  and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S.  insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies.4) Hilton (HLT)Hilton is a high-quality  asset-light  high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential  led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel  with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.[...] Despite Hilton's accelerated near-term growth prospects and attractive long-term earnings algorithm  the stock is attractively priced at a low-20s multiple of 2023 earnings. We find Hilton's valuation to be compelling given its industry-leading competitive position  superb management team  attractive long-term net unit growth algorithm  pricing power  and best-in-class capital return policy.Lowe's is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.[...] Lowe's operational transformation is further magnified by its aggressive share repurchase program  which is likely to see the company acquire a high-single-digit percentage of its market capitalization in this year alone. The materiality of Lowe's Perpetual Productivity Initiative was on full display in their most recent quarter  whereby the company leveraged fixed expenses by 80 basis points  driving 10% earnings-per-share growth notwithstanding flat top line growth. The successful execution of Lowe's continued business transformation should allow the company to generate accelerated earnings growth for the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding our view on Lowe's attractive long-term earnings outlook  Lowe's currently trades at only 15 times forward earnings  a low valuation for a business of this quality  and a substantial discount to its direct competitor. We believe the current valuation reflects investors negative sentiment regarding the US housing market and incorporates the possibility of a greater than expected revenue decline. We believe the current valuation is highly attractive and anticipate Lowe's will generate high rates of returns from current levels if as we expect it continues to successfully execute the company's transformation.6) Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)CP is a high-quality  inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (""KCS"")  we believe that CP's prospects are bright.[...] CP's pending acquisition of KCS remains on track as the Surface Transportation Board's likely approval approaches. Based on the Board's updated procedural schedule  if all goes as expected  CP will gain operational control of KCS by the first quarter of 2023 at the latest. In the meantime  CP and KCS are preparing for synergies by holding productive discussions with potential customers  running proof of concept trains  and making capacity investments. By creating the only direct route from Canada to Mexico  the procompetitive merger offers shippers the unrivaled speed and service that is sorely needed to help ease supply chain congestion. We are confident in management's ability to achieve its revenue and cost synergy targets and create value for all stakeholders. While CP's year-to-date results reflect its strong business performance and favorable outlook  we believe CP's current valuation represents a meaningful discount to intrinsic value in light of the company's high-quality business model and long-term growth potential.7) The Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC)HHC's portfolio of well-located residential land and income-producing commercial assets continues to demonstrate resilient performance despite recent macro concerns of a slowdown in the housing market. The company's advantaged business model of owning master planned communities (""MPCs"") provides HHC substantial control over the planning and release of land for sale and development  enabling it to take a long-term approach to maximizing the value of its portfolio. As a result of its outright ownership of thousands of acres of conservatively financed land and a management team that combines superb capital allocation and development skills  the company is much less exposed to the cyclicality of standalone  smaller-scale real estate development companies.[...] While the company has made significant progress in simplifying its business and has a substantial runway for long-term value creation  we continue to believe its current share price is at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. The company has been able to capitalize on this discounted valuation by aggressively repurchasing its shares. Year to date  HHC has repurchased approximately 8% of its outstanding share count  funded by cash flow from operations and non-core asset sales. We believe HHC is extremely well positioned for the current inflationary environment due to its combination of high quality real estate assets and a largely fixed-rate liability structure. We expect the company to benefit from substantial land price appreciation and rental income growth in the coming years.8) Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) / Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC)There have been no material updates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2022. Both entities continue to build capital through retained earnings and now hold combined capital of $91 billion  up from nearly zero. As we have stated previously  as principally common shareholders (we own a small amount of preferred stock)  we own valuable perpetual options on both entities that over the long term we believe will be worth many multiples of today's prices once re-privatization occurs.Investment Management Fees - High Water MarkThe terms of the investment management agreement are lower than the usual 2%/20% charged by many other hedge funds. Pershing charges a 1.5% management fee and a 16% performance fee.The terms of the fund's management agreement with Pershing Square Capital Management have a ""high water mark"" feature such that investors only pay performance fees on increases in NAV above the highest NAV at which a performance fee has previously been charged.As a result  investors in the fund now will not incur any performance fees until the NAV of the fund exceeds the high water mark which is currently around $57 per share. Note that the current NAV on August 16 was reported at $50.90. The high water mark is adjusted for distributions  so the value dropped slightly because of the recent $0.125 quarterly dividend.Pershing Square BondsThe fund has access to low-cost unsecured investment-grade fixed rate leverage without mark-to-mark covenants.About 19% of PSH total assets is funded by long-term bonds with laddered maturities from 2027 through 2039. The weighted-average interest rate is 3.1%. The leverage is conservative given the fact that the PSHZF portfolio is highly liquid and easy to value.PSHZF Bonds (Pershing Square web site)Recent Share Buyback ActivityIn May 2022  PSHZF determined that it was appropriate to initiate a share buyback program. The initial $100 million program has since been extended by an additional $200 million. PSH completed the $100 million program having repurchased 3 245 831 PSH Public Shares at an average discount of 31.7%. In 2022 alone  the share buyback accretion has added about 60 basis points to the NAV performance.PSHZF reports its share buyback activity on a regular basis. Here is a chart showing the share buyback activity for the last two days expressed in US dollar terms:Date London Shares London Average Price Euronext Amsterdam Shares Euronext Amsterdam Average price NAV 08/23/2022 41 374 $31.73 13 165 $31.64 $50.90 08/22/2022 41 591 $31.86 13 489 $31.86 $50.90 Click to enlargePSH has repurchased 22.5% of its shares outstanding since its IPO  a total of 54 million shares at a price of $17.32 and at an average discount of 27.1%.Pershing Square Holdings (OTCPK:PSHZF):Launch Date: Jan 1  2013Total Assets = $ 11.8 BillionTotal Liabilities = $ 3.5 BillionTotal Equity = $ 8.3 BillionLast Dividend = $0.125 (quarterly)Management Fee= 1.50%Baseline Expense Ratio= 1.59%Discount to NAV= -35%Average 6 Month Discount= -29.7%NAV Update Frequency: WeeklyAverage Daily Volume of PSHZF= 28 266Average Dollar Volume of PSHZF= $900 000Leverage: 19%For most US investors  it is easier to buy the PSHZF ADR than to buy the PSH shares that trade on the London or Euronext Amsterdam exchanges. But the PSHZF ADR is not as liquid as the shares trading in Europe  and the bid-asked spread can be quite wide at times. It is best to be patient and use multiple smaller limit orders when buying the shares.While PSHZF looks quite attractive here for a purchase  it may be prudent to dollar cost average in because of the overall market conditions. PSHZF can be a good long term ""core"" holding in your portfolio  but it can also be a good holding for more active traders  especially if you own it in an IRA.For more active traders  I would use the following signals to trim the position:- The NAV reaches/exceeds the high water mark. At this point  performance fees kick in  and the shares are not as attractive.- The fund stops doing share buy backs. This happens periodically and usually signals a good time to trim the position.- The weekly discount to NAV drops below 23%.",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.02,mixed,0.37,0.19,0.44,True,English,"['Pershing Square Holdings', 'Bill Ackman', '35% Discount', 'OTCMKTS', 'PSHZF', 'The Pershing Square Capital L.P.', 'capitalized, high quality growth businesses', 'high-quality, capital-light, growing annuity', 'high-margin brand royalty fees', 'Pershing Square Web site', 'best five-year NAV return', '100 largest closed-end equity funds', 'new high water mark', 'Restaurant Brands International Inc.', 'PSH semi-annual shareholder report', 'Bill Ackman hedge fund', 'longer-term annual store growth', 'S&P 500 benchmark', 'Pershing Square Holdings', 'Pershing Square LP', 'Alpha Gen Capital', 'High absolute levels', 'Capital Markets day', 'four leading brands', 'predictable cash flows', '1) Universal Music Group', 'increasing streaming penetration', 'Warner Music Group', 'successful menu innovation', 'Pershing Square fund', 'last twelve months', 'Yield Hunting members', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'attractive earnings growth', 'sustained earnings growth', 'franchised business model', 'net asset value', 'three-year cumulative basis', 'three bad years', 'longest track record', 'fixed cost base', 'mid-teens growth rate', 'last five years', 'current portfolio holdings', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill', 'PSH Historical Returns', 'PSH Performance Graph', 'The NAV', 'Semi-Annual Report', 'store base', 'annual rate', 'longer-term view', 'long-term shareholder', 'annual returns', 'annual basis', 'restaurant sales', 'restaurant industry', 'London exchange', 'overall markets', 'new strategy', 'new services', 'business models', 'revenue growth', 'current valuation', '4% dividend yield', 'cost inflation', 'new restaurants', 'outstanding returns', 'Portfolio Review', 'concentrated portfolio', 'multi-year basis', 'intrinsic value', 'rough years', 'strong performance', 'impressive performance', 'last year', 'Bryan Bedder', 'George Spritzer', 'latest data', 'short sales', 'activist"" approach', 'Bloomberg data', 'Appendix A', 'durable, well', 'limited downside', 'hedging transactions', 'decades-long runway', 'a decade', 'operating margins', 'foreseeable future', 'recent results', 'analyst expectations', 'Burger King', 'Tim Hortons', 'Firehouse Subs', 'market capitalization', 'ongoing recovery', 'pollo asado', 'second quarter', 'same-store sales', 'premise sales', 'pre-pandemic routines', 'digital sales', 'conventional sales', 'Fund Performance', 'ticker PSH', 'August 23rd', 'good price', 'price increases', 'significant discount', 'UMG board', 'OTCPK:PSHZF', '23% discount', 'Author', 'note', 'article', 'ADR', 'line', 'opportunity', 'money', 'world', 'list', 'Source', 'objective', 'recurring', 'opportunities', 'profit', 'excerpts', 'UMGNF', 'investors', 'development', 'platforms', 'revenues', 'time', 'company', 'guidance', 'peer', 'QSR', 'Popeyes', 'shares', 'shareholders', 'CMG', 'SSS', 'consumers', 'persistence']",2022-09-08,2022-09-09,seekingalpha.com

September 8  2022. Detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME trial evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis were presented today in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data from one of two pivotal trials in prurigo nodularis show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.Professor of Dermatology  Miller School of Medicine  University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center  and principal investigator of the trial“These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life. In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.”The late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupilumab in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented detailed positive results from the second of two Phase 3 trials (PRIME) evaluating Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis in a late-breaking session at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 2022 Congress. These data  which were consistent with the detailed data from the first Phase 3 trial (PRIME2) in prurigo nodularis  show Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions at 24 weeks.In total  22 scientific abstracts are being presented at the EADV 2022 Congress discussing Dupixent in atopic dermatitis in patients as young as six months  and its investigational use in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid  in addition to prurigo nodularis.""These positive results from the second of two dupilumab Phase 3 trials in prurigo nodularis confirm inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 can significantly reduce the unrelenting itch and extensive severe skin lesions that often impair patient quality of life "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""In my practice  relieving itch and clearing skin are often the top priorities for my patients across a range of chronic skin diseases. These data demonstrate dupilumab has the potential to address and manage these debilitating symptoms in another chronic skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation.""The late-breaking data presented at the EADV 2022 Congress are from the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 PRIME trial  which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks  among patients treated with Dupixent in the trial:More than three times as many (60%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline  the primary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many (48%) achieved clear or almost clear skin  a key secondary endpoint  compared to placebo patients (18%; p=0.0004).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indication. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 71% for Dupixent and 63% for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  4% placebo) and headache (5% Dupixent  5% placebo). The rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 24 was 0% for Dupixent compared to 4% for placebo. A numerically lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (4% Dupixent  9% placebo).Results from this and an earlier Phase 3 trial  PRIME2  will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis this year. Regulatory submissions are already under review by the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  with the FDA granting Priority Review in May 2022 and a target action date of September 30  2022.The potential uses of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid are currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.About the TrialPRIME  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  was a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 151 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. These included patients who were inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or for whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at 24 weeks (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

9704,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.rappler.com/business/europe-banks-dim-lights-brace-winter-blackout-energy-crisis/,Europe’s banks dim lights as they brace for winter blackout,There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe's economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war,BANKS. Office lights are on in banks as dawn breaks behind the financial district of Canary Wharf  in London  Britain  June 24  2016.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe's economy  already fragile due to the fallout of warLONDON  United Kingdom – Some of Europe’s biggest banks are preparing backup generators and to dim the lights as they brace for potential power cuts and energy rationing that threaten the money system underpinning the region’s economy.As Russia throttles gas supplies to the continent  banks are stress-testing how they can cope with power shortages and lining up alternative sources of energy  such as generators  so that automated teller machines and online banking don’t go dark.There is a special urgency for financial firms to act because of the importance of payments and transactions to Europe’s economy  already fragile due to the fallout of war.While the sector adapted to COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working  power blackouts or rationing present a very different challenge.“The banking system is part of other systems ” said Gianluca Pescaroli  professor in operational continuity and disaster resilience at University College London  who has advised authorities in London on power outages.“My main concern is the cascading effects on society of failures to ATMs or cashless transactions. Similarly  the dependencies banks have on other services such as the internet.”JPMorgan  which employs thousands across European hubs in London and Frankfurt  has conducted power outage simulations  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Depending on the severity  the bank could switch to diesel generators that could keep key office locations up and running for several days  the person said.The biggest US bank lends money to companies in Europe and trades stocks and bonds in addition to running a British consumer bank.Italy’s second biggest bank UniCredit has tested its operational resilience this summer  a source familiar with the plans said.Its latest disaster recovery test focused on the resilience of data processing  the source said  adding the bank’s two core data centers had power supply from two independent power stations. It’s unclear how long its power would last.Euronext  which runs the French and Italian stock exchanges  said it had reassessed its energy use since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  adding it had backup generators  without elaborating.Hot waterBanks are also taking visible steps to acknowledge the energy crisis  such as paring office space and consolidating staff in fewer buildings.Deutsche Bank said it was rolling out a slew of energy saving measures across its 1 400 buildings in Germany  to save 4.9 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year – enough to power roughly 49 000 light bulbs for an hour.The lender is shutting off hot running water in washrooms  adjusting workplace temperatures  and switching off all interior branch lighting and illuminated outdoor advertising overnight.The fountain in front of its head office in Frankfurt will also be turned off.Regulators are on high alert. The supervisory arm of the European Central Bank and its equivalent UK peer  the Prudential Regulation Authority  both require lenders to have plans to cope with disruption.Firms in Britain are required to identify their “Important Business Services” and the methods of resolving vulnerabilities should threats materialize.Nonetheless  experts fear that few companies are prepared for lengthy blackouts of more than a few days.“This represents a serious gap in resilience planning ” said Avi Schnurr  chief executive officer of the Electric Infrastructure Security Council  a think tank that advises on preparing for such hazards.Banks should already be making arrangements to ensure that they can cope even in a prolonged power outage  with agreements for transactions to be logged retroactively once systems are back online  he said.BNP Paribas  France’s biggest bank  is addressing power consumption across the approximate 2 750 branches  offices  and data centers it operates across France  Belgium  and Italy  a source close to the French lender said.The possibility of electricity supply cuts was being “closely monitored” and covered by the Business Continuity Plan in place at the bank.European gas prices have surged after Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom said it would indefinitely extend a shutdown to the major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Europe has accused Russia of weaponizing energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow since the outbreak of hostilities with Ukraine. Russia blames those sanctions for causing the gas supply problems  which it puts down to pipeline faults.In Britain  rising energy costs are squeezing businesses and consumers  who are facing runaway inflation.State-backed NatWest said it had partially mitigated the financial hit by hedging future costs of its energy.Major insurers also said they were cutting their energy use. Switzerland’s Zurich said it would darken offices at night and mothball “decorative power consumers” like fountains.Should the crisis worsen  the sources said companies will take more drastic steps. And while staff may notice  the firms are hoping that customers won’t.“Additional measures that can be taken should the energy situation worsen include using only certain floors of the buildings  and the shutdown of certain services such as the employee gym ” the insurer said. – Rappler.com,neutral,0.03,0.49,0.48,negative,0.02,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['winter blackout', 'Europe', 'banks', 'lights', 'major Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline', 'Electric Infrastructure Security Council', 'latest disaster recovery test', 'two independent power stations', 'two core data centers', 'remote working, power blackouts', 'automated teller machines', 'Italian stock exchanges', 'interior branch lighting', 'equivalent UK peer', 'Prudential Regulation Authority', 'chief executive officer', 'European gas prices', 'gas supply problems', 'potential power cuts', 'power outage simulations', 'prolonged power outage', 'Important Business Services', 'Business Continuity Plan', 'key office locations', 'British consumer bank', 'energy saving measures', 'European Central Bank', 'electricity supply cuts', 'biggest US bank', 'second biggest bank', 'rising energy costs', 'University College London', 'pipeline faults', 'Major insurers', 'power supply', 'gas supplies', 'lengthy blackouts', 'disaster resilience', 'European hubs', 'data processing', 'power shortages', 'power outages', 'power consumption', 'operational continuity', 'other services', 'future costs', 'office space', 'head office', 'Deutsche Bank', 'dawn breaks', 'financial district', 'Canary Wharf', 'special urgency', 'United Kingdom', 'alternative sources', 'online banking', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'different challenge', 'banking system', 'Gianluca Pescaroli', 'main concern', 'cascading effects', 'energy use', 'visible steps', 'energy crisis', '4.9 million kilowatt-hours', '49,000 light bulbs', 'running water', 'workplace temperatures', 'outdoor advertising', 'high alert', 'supervisory arm', 'serious gap', 'Avi Schnurr', 'think tank', 'BNP Paribas', 'state-controlled Gazprom', 'energy supplies', 'runaway inflation', 'State-backed NatWest', 'financial hit', 'Office lights', 'backup generators', 'diesel generators', 'operational resilience', 'resilience planning', 'financial firms', 'biggest banks', 'energy rationing', 'money system', 'other systems', 'several days', 'Hot water', 'fewer buildings', 'Western sanctions', 'cashless transactions', 'French lender', '1,400 buildings', 'Britain', 'importance', 'payments', 'economy', 'fallout', 'war', 'region', 'Russia', 'continent', 'sector', 'part', 'professor', 'authorities', 'society', 'failures', 'ATMs', 'dependencies', 'internet', 'JPMorgan', 'thousands', 'Frankfurt', 'matter', 'Reuters', 'severity', 'person', 'companies', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'addition', 'Italy', 'UniCredit', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'staff', 'slew', 'Germany', 'washrooms', 'fountain', 'front', 'Regulators', 'lenders', 'disruption', 'methods', 'vulnerabilities', 'threats', 'experts', 'hazards', 'arrangements', 'agreements', 'France', 'approximate', '2,750 branches', 'offices', 'Belgium', 'possibility', 'shutdown', 'retaliation', 'Moscow', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'businesses', 'consumers', 'Switzerland']",2022-09-08,2022-09-09,rappler.com
9721,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-exclusion-may-pave-way-233000768.html,Russia’s Exclusion May Pave Way for India into Global Bond Index,(Bloomberg) -- India has the biggest bond market among emerging economies that’s not covered by global indexes  but bankers say that may change soon...,(Bloomberg) -- India has the biggest bond market among emerging economies that’s not covered by global indexes  but bankers say that may change soon  potentially drawing in billions of dollars in inflows. Russia’s recent exclusion is one reason why.Most Read from BloombergMorgan Stanley expects an announcement that India will be included in JPMorgan & Chase Co.’s emerging markets bond index as early as mid-September with the actual entry in the third quarter next year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees that announcement coming in the fourth quarter this year and inclusion in the second or third quarter in 2023. Both expect India’s weight at 10%  the maximum for a country in the index  and potential inflows of $30 billion from the move.Getting high-yielding Indian sovereign bonds into global indexes would make it easier for overseas investors to put their money into Asia’s third-biggest economy with its $1 trillion debt market. It would follow many false starts over the years that resulted from wariness about debt inflows and disagreements including one on tax breaks for foreigners. Russia’s exclusion from the JPMorgan gauges after it invaded Ukraine may have added to incentives for the index compilers to fill the hole with Indian debt.JPMorgan  one of the major index providers  has been collecting feedback from investors over including India in its Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified  or GBI-EM. More than 60% of real money investors are ready or almost ready for India’s inclusion  a Morgan Stanley survey showed. A spokesperson for JPMorgan in India declined to comment.“India would offer much needed diversification to the GBI-EM index given the different structure of its economy  and so would be a strong addition to the index from a long-term perspective ” said Nivedita Sunil  portfolio manager for Asia and EM debt at Lombard Odier (Singapore) Ltd. “We have held consultations with the index provider and we are broadly supportive of it.”Story continuesBond traders in India have had their hopes dashed in the past on index inclusion. There were widespread expectations in February that the government would announce a tax break for foreign investors in the budget that would facilitate trading of the nation’s debt on platforms such as Euroclear.Dashed ExpectationsInstead  the budget was silent on the issue. Officials have said they decided not to exempt international bond transactions from taxes  and they would like settlement of bonds to be done locally.“India has its own size and heft to act on its own ” said Aninda Mitra  head of Asia macro and investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “But it is important to make a strategic decision and stick with it  rather than send out conflicting signals.”Meanwhile  in the GBI-EM index Russia had a weight of about 8% before it was removed  and now there are seven countries with a weight of 10% each and 13 countries sharing the remaining 30%  according to the Morgan Stanley note.“The exclusion of Russia has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced ” Morgan Stanley strategists Min Dai  Madan Reddy and Gek Teng Khoo wrote in a note early September. “Hence JPMorgan has more incentive to include India even without Euroclear  as long as GBI-EM investors don’t object to that.”India is currently ‘on track’ to be placed on index watch for inclusion in JPMorgan’s bond index  according to the bank. It’s also on the FTSE Russell watch list to get into its emerging market debt index.Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd  which administers indexes that compete with those from other service providers.Renewed market talk on index inclusion helped revive flows into rupee-denominated bonds last month after six continuous months of outflows. Foreign inflows will be crucial to meet the nation’s ever-growing bond supply as its funding needs expand. Yields are headed for a third month of decline with the benchmark 10-year bond yield down about 35 basis points since June. It rose four basis points to 7.11% on Friday.Authorities have taken some steps to ease rules for foreigners.

Russia’s recent exclusion is one reason why.Morgan Stanley expects an announcement that India will be included in JPMorgan & Chase Co.’s emerging markets bond index as early as mid-September with the actual entry in the third quarter next year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees that announcement coming in the fourth quarter this year and inclusion in the second or third quarter in 2023. Both expect India’s weight at 10%  the maximum for a country in the index  and potential inflows of $30 billion from the move.Getting high-yielding Indian sovereign bonds into global indexes would make it easier for overseas investors to put their money into Asia’s third-biggest economy with its $1 trillion debt market. It would follow many false starts over the years that resulted from wariness about debt inflows and disagreements including one on tax breaks for foreigners. Russia’s exclusion from the JPMorgan gauges after it invaded Ukraine may have added to incentives for the index compilers to fill the hole with Indian debt.JPMorgan  one of the major index providers  has been collecting feedback from investors over including India in its Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified  or GBI-EM. More than 60% of real money investors are ready or almost ready for India’s inclusion  a Morgan Stanley survey showed. A spokesperson for JPMorgan in India declined to comment.“India would offer much needed diversification to the GBI-EM index given the different structure of its economy  and so would be a strong addition to the index from a long-term perspective ” said Nivedita Sunil  portfolio manager for Asia and EM debt at Lombard Odier (Singapore) Ltd. “We have held consultations with the index provider and we are broadly supportive of it.”Bond traders in India have had their hopes dashed in the past on index inclusion. There were widespread expectations in February that the government would announce a tax break for foreign investors in the budget that would facilitate trading of the nation’s debt on platforms such as Euroclear.Dashed ExpectationsInstead  the budget was silent on the issue. Officials have said they decided not to exempt international bond transactions from taxes  and they would like settlement of bonds to be done locally.“India has its own size and heft to act on its own ” said Aninda Mitra  head of Asia macro and investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “But it is important to make a strategic decision and stick with it  rather than send out conflicting signals.”Meanwhile  in the GBI-EM index Russia had a weight of about 8% before it was removed  and now there are seven countries with a weight of 10% each and 13 countries sharing the remaining 30%  according to the Morgan Stanley note.“The exclusion of Russia has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced ” Morgan Stanley strategists Min Dai  Madan Reddy and Gek Teng Khoo wrote in a note early September. “Hence JPMorgan has more incentive to include India even without Euroclear  as long as GBI-EM investors don’t object to that.”India is currently ‘on track’ to be placed on index watch for inclusion in JPMorgan’s bond index  according to the bank. It’s also on the FTSE Russell watch list to get into its emerging market debt index.Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd  which administers indexes that compete from those by other service providers.Renewed market talk on index inclusion helped revive flows into rupee-denominated bonds last month after six continuous months of outflows. Foreign inflows will be crucial to meet the nation’s ever-growing bond supply as its funding needs expand.Authorities have taken some steps to ease rules for foreigners.

9730,Euroclear,Bing API,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/russias-exclusion-may-pave-way-for-india-into-global-bond-index/articleshow/94094508.cms,Russia’s exclusion may pave way for India into global bond index,Morgan Stanley expects an announcement that India will be included in JPMorgan & Chase Co.s emerging markets bond index as early as mid-September with the actual entry in the third quarter next year.,BloombergBloombergIndia has the biggest bond market among emerging economies that’s not covered by global indexes  but bankers say that may change soon  potentially drawing in billions of dollars in inflows. Russia ’s recent exclusion is one reason why. Morgan Stanley expects an announcement that India will be included in JPMorgan & Chase Co.’s emerging markets bond index as early as mid-September with the actual entry in the third quarter next year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees that announcement coming in the fourth quarter this year and inclusion in the second or third quarter in 2023. Both expect India’s weight at 10%  the maximum for a country in the index  and potential inflows of $30 billion from the move.Getting high-yielding Indian sovereign bonds into global indexes would make it easier for overseas investors to put their money into Asia’s third-biggest economy with its $1 trillion debt market. It would follow many false starts over the years that resulted from wariness about debt inflows and disagreements including one on tax breaks for foreigners. Russia’s exclusion from the JPMorgan gauges after it invaded Ukraine may have added to incentives for the index compilers to fill the hole with Indian debt.JPMorgan  one of the major index providers  has been collecting feedback from investors over including India in its Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified  or GBI-EM. More than 60% of real money investors are ready or almost ready for India’s inclusion  a Morgan Stanley survey showed. A spokesperson for JPMorgan in India declined to comment.“India would offer much needed diversification to the GBI-EM index given the different structure of its economy  and so would be a strong addition to the index from a long-term perspective ” said Nivedita Sunil  portfolio manager for Asia and EM debt at Lombard Odier (Singapore) Ltd. “We have held consultations with the index provider and we are broadly supportive of it.”Bond traders in India have had their hopes dashed in the past on index inclusion. There were widespread expectations in February that the government would announce a tax break for foreign investors in the budget that would facilitate trading of the nation’s debt on platforms such as Euroclear.Instead  the budget was silent on the issue. Officials have said they decided not to exempt international bond transactions from taxes  and they would like settlement of bonds to be done locally.“India has its own size and heft to act on its own ” said Aninda Mitra  head of Asia macro and investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “But it is important to make a strategic decision and stick with it  rather than send out conflicting signals.”Meanwhile  in the GBI-EM index Russia had a weight of about 8% before it was removed  and now there are seven countries with a weight of 10% each and 13 countries sharing the remaining 30%  according to the Morgan Stanley note.“The exclusion of Russia has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced ” Morgan Stanley strategists Min Dai  Madan Reddy and Gek Teng Khoo wrote in a note early September. “Hence JPMorgan has more incentive to include India even without Euroclear  as long as GBI-EM investors don’t object to that.”India is currently ‘on track’ to be placed on index watch for inclusion in JPMorgan’s bond index  according to the bank. It’s also on the FTSE Russell watch list to get into its emerging market debt index.Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd  which administers indexes that compete from those by other service providers.Renewed market talk on index inclusion helped revive flows into rupee-denominated bonds last month after six continuous months of outflows. Foreign inflows will be crucial to meet the nation’s ever-growing bond supply as its funding needs expand. Yields are headed for a third month of decline with the benchmark 10-year bond yield down more than 30 basis points since June.Authorities have taken some steps to ease rules for foreigners. Recent regulations like allowing custodian banks to pre-fund trades on behalf of foreign investors and extended settlement timings are examples  according to Goldman Sachs. Still  key issues remain.“We think the two biggest operational challenges are account opening time and the burdensome trading requirements ” said Eric Lo  a fixed-income fund manager at Manulife Investment Management. He said it can take up to nine months to open a local India bond trading account  but operational constraints like those aren’t a “show stopper” for the firm to invest in the market.,neutral,0.03,0.73,0.25,mixed,0.11,0.15,0.74,True,English,"['global bond index', 'Russia', 'exclusion', 'way', 'India', 'local India bond trading account', 'benchmark 10-year bond yield', 'FTSE Russell watch list', 'BNY Mellon Investment Management', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc.', 'two biggest operational challenges', 'high-yielding Indian sovereign bonds', 'emerging markets bond index', 'Bloomberg Index Services Ltd', 'emerging market debt index', 'account opening time', 'Manulife Investment Management', 'international bond transactions', 'growing bond supply', 'biggest bond market', 'many false starts', 'Gek Teng Khoo', 'other service providers', 'burdensome trading requirements', 'Renewed market talk', 'Morgan Stanley survey', 'Morgan Stanley strategists', 'six continuous months', 'major index providers', '$1 trillion debt market', 'extended settlement timings', 'fixed-income fund manager', 'Government Bond Index', 'Morgan Stanley note', 'real money investors', 'Indian debt', 'index watch', 'Bond traders', 'emerging economies', 'investment strategy', 'operational constraints', 'biggest economy', 'portfolio manager', 'fund trades', 'nine months', 'rupee-denominated bonds', 'index compilers', 'GBI-EM index', 'debt inflows', 'one reason', 'Chase Co.', 'actual entry', 'fourth quarter', 'overseas investors', 'tax breaks', 'different structure', 'strong addition', 'long-term perspective', 'Nivedita Sunil', 'Lombard Odier', 'widespread expectations', 'foreign investors', 'Aninda Mitra', 'strategic decision', 'conflicting signals', 'Min Dai', 'Madan Reddy', 'GBI-EM investors', 'Bloomberg LP', 'parent company', 'funding needs', 'Recent regulations', 'custodian banks', 'key issues', 'Eric Lo', 'show stopper', 'EM debt', 'third quarter', 'potential inflows', 'Foreign inflows', 'third month', 'index inclusion', 'global indexes', 'seven countries', 'recent exclusion', 'Asia macro', 'JPMorgan gauges', '13 countries', 'bankers', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Russia', 'announcement', 'mid-September', 'second', 'weight', 'country', 'move', 'years', 'wariness', 'disagreements', 'foreigners', 'Ukraine', 'incentives', 'hole', 'feedback', 'More', 'spokesperson', 'diversification', 'Singapore', 'consultations', 'hopes', 'past', 'February', 'budget', 'platforms', 'Euroclear', 'Officials', 'taxes', 'size', 'heft', 'head', 'track', 'outflows', 'Yields', 'decline', '30 basis', 'June', 'Authorities', 'steps', 'rules', 'behalf', 'examples', 'firm']",2022-09-09,2022-09-09,economictimes.indiatimes.com

The index groups the French companies among those figuring in the CAC Large 60 that demonstrate best practices in environmental  social and governance (ESG) issues.Inclusion in this index is a recognition of Rexel's longstanding commitment to sustainable development  which is at the heart of its strategy.

More particularly  in close relationship with suppliers  Rexel brings expertise and solutions to its customers in markets such as HVAC  solar energy  electric vehicles and industrial automation to lower energy costs and reduce CO 2 emissions.For more than 15 years  Rexel has been committed to a sustainable approach in ESG. On the environmental front  this has resulted in ambitious objectives  presented at our last Capital Markets Day in June. Rexel set itself the target of reducing its absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 60% for scopes 1 and 2 and 45% for scope 3 by 2030.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.
