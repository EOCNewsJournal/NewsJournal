In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Story continuesForward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  September 12  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.comThe Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs. Not averse to speculation and risk-taking  they never consider for a moment abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.And it is precisely this community of young collectors and enthusiasts who are the new clients of Artmarket.com and who frequently rely on our services. Today  their primary practical request is that art prices be quoted in both ETH and BTC in all of Artprice's databases  and so that is what we have done.This huge global community could not understand that Artprice's reference databases only include the world's primary fiat currencies  without quoting the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams have therefore mobilized at breakneck speed on this ambitious project in order to 'capture' the 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs  responding positively to their requests.After studying the question at great length and then committing to a huge volume of work  Artmarket.com has once again taken a significant step  by offering  as of today  8 828 384 auction results for artworks quoted in Bitcoin  going back to 1 February 2011 (with 1 Bitcoin at $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707)  and  then 5 814 866 auction results in Ethereum  starting on 7 August 2015 (with 1 Ethereum at $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  these tens of millions of calculations were made using the values of the cryptocurrencies on the day of each sale  with the historical indexing performed by Artmarket.com's extremely powerful computing facilities.Exemple:ETH => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?eth=1BTC => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?btc=1It is very interesting to see that  despite the recent value contraction of cryptocurrencies  purchases made in cryptocurrencies remain  extremely profitable in currency conversion terms  despite the necessary purge of 2022.Thanks to the addition of the two reference cryptocurrencies in the currency table (Dollar  Euro  Pounds Sterling  Yen) and the pedagogical tools developed by Artmarket.com in Artprice's databases  customers can finally get the necessary perspective to understand the value formation of cryptocurrencies over more than a decade against the world's major currencies  and therefore better understand the value of art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0  which are essentially based on Ethereum or Bitcoin.Artprice by Artmarket's phenomenal work on this project allows market participants to view the heated and often erroneous debates on cryptocurrencies with much greater serenity. Protagonists often argue the pros and cons of crypto using extremely short-term reasoning.

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)The Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs. Not averse to speculation and risk-taking  they never consider for a moment abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.And it is precisely this community of young collectors and enthusiasts who are the new clients of Artmarket.com and who frequently rely on our services. Today  their primary practical request is that art prices be quoted in both ETH and BTC in all of Artprice's databases  and so that is what we have done.This huge global community could not understand that Artprice's reference databases only include the world's primary fiat currencies  without quoting the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams have therefore mobilized at breakneck speed on this ambitious project in order to 'capture' the 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs  responding positively to their requests.After studying the question at great length and then committing to a huge volume of work  Artmarket.com has once again taken a significant step  by offering  as of today  8 828 384 auction results for artworks quoted in Bitcoin  going back to 1 February 2011 (with 1 Bitcoin at $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707)  and  then 5 814 866 auction results in Ethereum  starting on 7 August 2015 (with 1 Ethereum at $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  these tens of millions of calculations were made using the values of the cryptocurrencies on the day of each sale  with the historical indexing performed by Artmarket.com's extremely powerful computing facilities.Exemple:ETH => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?eth=1BTC => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?btc=1It is very interesting to see that  despite the recent value contraction of cryptocurrencies  purchases made in cryptocurrencies remain  extremely profitable in currency conversion terms  despite the necessary purge of 2022.Thanks to the addition of the two reference cryptocurrencies in the currency table (Dollar  Euro  Pounds Sterling  Yen) and the pedagogical tools developed by Artmarket.com in Artprice's databases  customers can finally get the necessary perspective to understand the value formation of cryptocurrencies over more than a decade against the world's major currencies  and therefore better understand the value of art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0  which are essentially based on Ethereum or Bitcoin.Artprice by Artmarket's phenomenal work on this project allows market participants to view the heated and often erroneous debates on cryptocurrencies with much greater serenity. Protagonists often argue the pros and cons of crypto using extremely short-term reasoning. In finance  the real value of an asset or a currency is always apprehended through a decennial lens  rather than from a weekly or monthly perspective!This is the first stage of an inexorable process that will bring tremendous benefits  despite the recurrent crises of a Western world whose obsession with geoeconomics seems to have overshadowed a healthy concern with geopolitics.Like global banking institutions during the switch to the Euro  Artmarket.com offers a multi-display of art prices and conversions in historical currencies to give everyone time to familiarize themselves with the value equivalences in cryptocurrencies.Naturally  Artmarket has already programmed the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) such as the ECB's digital euro  the Fed's digital dollar and China's e-CNY (digital yuan)  which is already in circulation.Artprice by Artmarket has always been true to a key axiom: ""We don't fight against progress  whatever the circumstances"".With this major and historic breakthrough  Artmarket.com is consolidating its position as World Leader in Art Market Information and will be extremely attentive to ""The Merge"" switchover at the end of the TTD (Total Terminal Difficulty)  which will correspond to the last block mined in proof-of-work.""September 15  2022 will be a founding and irrevocable date of Web 3.0 in the history of cryptocurrencies  NFTs and Artprice by Artmarket "" according to its Founder & President thierry Ehrmann.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/09/image1-ethereum_themerge-artprice-by-artmarket-com.jpg][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/09/image2-bitcoin-artprice-by-artmarket-com.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Restructuring existing debt obligations to extend the maturity date of the loan will enable Nanobiotix to drive priority development programs in 2023 by extending operating runway an additional quarter. Combined with the committed access to capital available through our existing equity line  this provides Nanobiotix with the ability to extend its operating runway into the first quarter of 2024.”The finance contract and royalty agreement established with the EIB in July 2018 consisted of an initial tranche of €16.0 million drawn in October 2018 and repayable in a single installment at maturity in 2023 and a second tranche of €14.0 million granted in March 2019 and repayable in semi-annual installments of principal and interest after a two-year grace period. The 2018 agreement also included a commitment to pay low single-digit royalties annually over a six-year period beginning in January 2021.The agreement in principle is structured around Nanobiotix expected cash inflow from future non-dilutive value drivers including planned commercialization1 of NBTXR3 and potential partnerships. The agreement in principle allows for deferment of approximately €25.3 million in principal repayments up to June 2029 and approximately €5.4 million in payment-in-kind (PIK) interest payments up to October 2024. It also includes an additional €20.0 million payment with a due date in 2029 which could be accelerated based on potential cash inflow. The outstanding debt obligations will continue to accrue interest until the new maturity dates. The six-year royalty period included in the 2018 agreement is also being revised to commence upon commercialization.Execution by the Company and EIB of a definitive amendment  expected in Q4 2022  is subject to finalization of the necessary documents and agreements.**About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

They were presented on September 11  2022  in a poster presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting taking place in Paris (France) from September 9-13  2022.The findings are as follows:TG6002 demonstrated good tolerability when administered weekly or on days 1 3 and 5. No major toxicities limiting the dose escalation process or the intensification of the schedule of administration were observed. Transient fever is the most common adverse event.when administered weekly or on days 1 3 and 5. No major toxicities limiting the dose escalation process or the intensification of the schedule of administration were observed. Transient fever is the most common adverse event. TG6002 is able to reach the tumor  replicate  and express its payload after IV administration.Onset of a neutralizing antibody response is not associated with a decreased biological activity of the product.These data further confirm the mechanism of action of the Invir.IO™-based oncolytic viruses in humans.The two IV administration schedules display different characteristics  that can both be leveraged in upcoming clinical trials. Three doses given once a week resulted in higher levels of expression of the payload than the more intensive schedule (3 injections within 5 days). The intensive schedule allowed for a longer lasting expression of the payload.These findings support the potential of IV administration of Invir.IO™-based oncolytic viruses  extending the use of these therapies to a broad range of solid tumors.The overall Phase I program with TG6002 was aimed at establishing the tolerability and the potential different doses and administration schedules for further development. Additional data will be produced from the Phase I program and will be presented at a scientific congress in H1 2023.Title of the poster: “Updated data of biodistribution and activity of oncolytic virus TG6002 after intravenous administration in patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinomas”“Updated data of biodistribution and activity of oncolytic virus TG6002 after intravenous administration in patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinomas” Authors : Victor Moreno  Philippe Cassier  Bernard Doger  Emiliano Calvo  Maria De Miguel  Rocio Garcia-Carbonero  Carlos Gomez-Roca  Christiane Jungels  Sophie Sainte-Croix  Philippe Erbs  Alain Sadoun and Kaïdre Bendjama: Victor Moreno  Philippe Cassier  Bernard Doger  Emiliano Calvo  Maria De Miguel  Rocio Garcia-Carbonero  Carlos Gomez-Roca  Christiane Jungels  Sophie Sainte-Croix  Philippe Erbs  Alain Sadoun and Kaïdre Bendjama Abstract Number: #4886#4886 Poster Number: 392PThe abstract and the e-poster are available on the ESMO congress website here and the e-poster can be downloaded on the Transgene website here as well.***About the trial (NCT03724071)This trial is a single-arm open-label Phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of TG6002 administered intravenously in combination with oral 5-FC  a non-cytotoxic pro-drug that can be converted in 5-FU  its active metabolite. Based on the safety profile of TG6002  several dose levels and administration schedules have been added to the initial Phase I clinical protocol. The trial has safety as primary endpoint for the Phase I. The trial also evaluates pharmacokinetic properties and biodistribution of TG6002  along with immune modulation of the tumor micro-environment. This European study enrolled patients suffering from advanced gastrointestinal carcinomas who have failed and/or are intolerant to standard therapeutic options in the Phase I part.Dr. Philippe Cassier  M.D.  Ph.D.  head of the early-phase trials unit at Centre Léon Bérard (Lyon  France)  is the principal investigator of the trial.About TG6002TG6002 has been engineered to directly kill cancer cells (oncolysis)  to enable the production of a chemotherapy agent (5-FU) within the tumor  and to elicit an immune response by the body against the tumor cells. Its satisfactory safety profile after intravenous administration and its mechanism of action has been shown in human in a Phase I trial.In preclinical experiments  TG6002 has been shown to induce the shrinkage of the primary tumor as well as the regression of distant metastases (Foloppe  et al.  Molecular Therapy Oncolytics  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omto.2019.03.005).The production of 5-FU directly in the tumor aims to achieve a better anti-tumoral effect with limited chemotherapy-induced side effects.TG6002 induces the production of 5-FU in the cancer cells it has infected  by enabling the local conversion of the pro-drug 5-FC (administered orally) into 5-FU. 5-FU is a common chemotherapy agent for patients with gastrointestinal cancers. This mechanism of action is based on the in-tumor expression of the proprietary FCU1 gene that has been encoded in the genome of TG6002  taking advantage of the virus selective replication in the tumor cells.When administered systemically  5-FU is associated with side effects that can lead to treatment discontinuation. With TG6002  5-FU is produced within the tumor where it is expected to be present at a high concentration level in contrast to the very low levels anticipated in the rest of the patient’s body.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Transgene’s programs utilize viral vector technology with the goal of indirectly or directly killing cancer cells.The Company’s clinical-stage programs consist of two therapeutic vaccines (TG4001 for the treatment of HPV-positive cancers  and TG4050  the first individualized therapeutic vaccine based on the myvac® platform) as well as two oncolytic viruses (TG6002 for the treatment of solid tumors  and BT-001  the first oncolytic virus based on the Invir.IO™ platform).With Transgene’s myvac® platform  therapeutic vaccination enters the field of precision medicine with a novel immunotherapy that is fully tailored to each individual. The myvac® approach allows the generation of a virus-based immunotherapy that encodes patient-specific mutations identified and selected by Artificial Intelligence capabilities provided by its partner NEC.With its proprietary platform Invir.IO™  Transgene is building on its viral vector engineering expertise to design a new generation of multifunctional oncolytic viruses. Transgene has an ongoing Invir.IO™ collaboration with AstraZeneca.Additional information about Transgene is available at: www.transgene.fr.

This patient  who has completed the double-blind  placebo-controlled PREMIER trial  was enrolled in May 2021. All patients who complete the PREMIER trial will be eligible to join the PREMIER-OLE study and will receive the high dose (‘HD') of PXT3003 until the treatment is commercially available  should PXT3003 be approved in the US and Europe  respectively by the FDA and the EMA. PXT3003 is the Company's lead program to treat CMT1A  a debilitating disease with currently no existing approved therapies.The PREMIER trial  which recently completed enrollment with a total of 387 patients  is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  where the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the HD tested in the prior Phase III clinical study  the PLEO-CMT trial  and the ongoing open-label extension Phase III study  the PLEOCMT-FU trial. As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability.Recent data from the ongoing PLEOCMT-FU trial (open-label follow-up extension study of the first phase III study  the PLEO-CMT trial) announced in May 2022 has shown a good safety profile and continuous treatment effect of PXT3003 measured on the ONLS after 5 years of total treatment time. 123 Patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A are still on treatment with PXT3003 High Dose in the PLEOCMT-FU trial.Story continuesDr. Burkhard Blank  Chief Medical Officer at Pharnext commented: ""The decision to conduct a second open label extension study  after the PREMIER trial  was triggered by the encouraging data from our first  and ongoing  open-label extension study of the first PXT3003 Phase III  which has shown a sustained treatment benefit for patients with CMT1A treated with PXT3003 High Dose after 5 years. We look forward to generating additional long-term data to confirm the potential safety and efficacy of PXT3003 for these patients who currently have no treatment options.""Xavier Paoli  Chief Operating Officer at Pharnext  commented: ""The PREMIER-OLE study provides patients who have completed our second pivotal Phase III trial with the option to continue receiving treatment - all with PXT3003 HD -for this debilitating and progressive disease. We are committed to ensuring patients with CMT1A have continued access to PXT3003 High Dose  until the potential marketing authorization and subsequent commercialization.""About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/disease/charcot-marie-tooth .About PXT3003PXT3003 is a novel fixed-dose synergistic combination of baclofen  naltrexone and sorbitol formulated as an oral solution given twice a day. The three individual components of PXT3003 were selected to downregulate the overexpression of PMP22 protein  leading to improvement of neuronal signaling in dysfunctional peripheral nerves that are an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disease. PXT3003 could also have a positive effect on other cellular types of the motor unit such as the axon (direct protection)  neuromuscular junctions or muscle cells. PXT3003 has shown promising and consistent results across preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II and Phase III (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU). More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/pipeline/pxt3003 .About the PREMIER TrialThe PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (‘HD') tested in the prior Phase III trial (‘PLEO-CMT'). As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. The secondary endpoints include the following outcome measures: 1) 10-Meter Walk Test (‘10mWT')  2) Quantified Muscular Testing (bilateral foot dorsiflexion dynamometry)  3) Patient Global Impression of Severity (‘PGI-S')  4) Patient Global Impression of Change (‘PGI-C')  5) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score  version 2 (‘CMTNS-v2')  and 6) Quantified Muscular Testing (hand grip). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Further information on the PREMIER trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT04762758) here .About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments.

Taps Global Launch Vehicle Portfolio to Take Fast-Growing Astrocast IoT Constellation to Orbit - Business Wire,Spaceflight  the leading global launch services provider  today announced it will launch four Astrocast 3U spacecraft aboard India’s Polar Satellite L,SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spaceflight  the leading global launch services provider  today announced it will launch four Astrocast 3U spacecraft aboard India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) mission under a commercial arrangement with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL). This mission  scheduled for October 2022  will launch from Sriharikota  India’s Satish Dhawan Space Center  carrying the Astrocast spacecraft as a co-passenger to sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) along with the Indian national primary satellite.This launch represents Spaceflight’s eighth launch on a PSLV and its fourth supporting Astrocast’s nanosatellite Internet of Things (IoT) network and constellation. Once this mission is complete  Spaceflight will have launched 16 spacecraft in the Astrocast constellation  which enables companies to track and monitor assets in some of the world’s most remote regions.“ PSLV has long been a reliable and valuable launch partner to Spaceflight and we’re excited to work with NSIL again after the COVID-19 restrictions of the last few years ” said Curt Blake  CEO of Spaceflight. “ By having experience working with many different launch providers around the world  we are able to identify missions that meet our customer's exact needs – whether that’s driven by schedule  cost or destination. As Astrocast builds its network and constellation  we can offer them a range of launch options  flexibility and customization to support their long-term plans.”Astrocast is a long-time Spaceflight customer.

The recent decision to halt the submission process of our BLA dossier for eryaspase in hypersensitive ALL leads us now to focus on strategic alternatives for ERYTECH. We have prioritized our resources on our most promising preclinical programs  and we are making good progress on partnering discussions  for which we expect to report updates in the last quarter of this year.”Business HighlightsU.S. cell therapy manufacturing facility sold to Catalent for a total consideration of USD 44.5 millionIn April 2022  ERYTECH sold its commercial-scale cell therapy manufacturing facility in Princeton  New Jersey  to Catalent  for a total consideration of $44.5 million. ERYTECH’s staff at the site of 40 people has been fully transferred to Catalent.ERYTECH maintained its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France and its core expertise to continue innovating in cell therapy.Good progress on strategic review and partnering alternativesAs announced on October 25th 2021  the Company has appointed a specialized advisor to evaluate its strategic and partnering options. After the transaction with Catalent  the Company has continued to evaluate further valuable strategic options to potentially leverage its assets and capabilities in a business combination with a strategic partner. Valuable options are under discussion and the Company expects to give further updates on these strategic initiatives in the 4th quarter of this year.Plans to pursue a BLA submission for Graspa® in hypersensitive ALL stopped following recent feedbacks and new additional requests from the FDAFollowing positive results of a Phase 2 trial  sponsored by the Nordic Organization for Peadiatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)  ERYTECH had been in an extended dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the possibility for an approval of Graspa in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who had previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase therapy.A pre-BLA meeting to discuss the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) took place in June 2021 after which the Company confirmed its intention to submit a BLA  subject to successful completion of remaining activities  which included the submission of additional information to the FDA  responses to additional data requests  and the submission of the Initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP).The Company submitted its iPSP in July 2022 and received feedback from the FDA in August 2022. After thorough evaluation of this feedback  which included a new request for additional data  and taking into account the changing competitive landscape  the Company decided to halt the BLA process of seeking approval.Results of patients enrolled in TRYbeCA-2  Phase 2 clinical trial in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)  reviewedThe TRYbeCA-2 trial evaluated eryaspase in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy  compared to chemotherapy alone  in metastatic TNBC (first and second lines)  with disease control rate as the primary end point of the trial.Initial target enrollment was approximately 64 evaluable patients but following the disappointing results of eryaspase in the TRYbeCA-1 trial in second-line pancreatic cancer  the Company had decided  in consultation with the trial’s Steering Committee  to stop further enrollment in the trial. A total of 27 patients 11 and 14 evaluable patients in the eryaspase and control arms  respectively  have been finally enrolled.The trial’s Steering Committee met in September 2022 to review the results of the 25 evaluable patients. No clinical benefit was demonstrated  which could be attributed to the immature closure of the trial and the small number of patients. The treatment was well tolerated.Promising preclinical development with ERYCEVTM  novel red blood cell vesiculation technologyIn April 2022  ERYTECH announced the presentation of its novel red blood cell vesiculation technology  ERYCEV  at the 24th Meeting of the European Red Cell Society (ERCS).RBC-derived extracellular vesicles are formed naturally during senescence and storage of mature RBCs and are a potentially attractive drug delivery system. Vesiculation of RBCs that have already been loaded with active therapeutic compounds utilizing the ERYCAPS® process  entails the potential of producing cargo-loaded RBC-derived extracellular vesicles for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.ERYCEV results to date illustrate the versatility of ERYTECH’s encapsulation science in RBCs and its potential for leverage in further partnered developments.1H 2022 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below:In thousands of euros 1H 2022(6 months) 1H 2021(6 months) Revenues — — Other income 954 2 270 Net gain on asset sale 24 351 — Operating income 25 304 2 270 Research and development (17 300) (23 208) General and administrative (7 911) (8 027) Operating expenses (25 211) (31 235) Operating income (loss) 93 (28 966) Financial income 3 370 2 807 Financial expenses (750) (1 791) Financial income (loss) 2 620 1 016 Income tax (3 737) (2) Net loss (1 024) (27 952)Net loss for the first half of 2022 was €1.0 million  a €27.0 million improvement over the same period of last year  related mostly to the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility  while operating expenses of €25.2 million were also showing a €6.0 million decrease (-19%) year-over-year  with a €5.9 million decrease in R&D expenses and a €0.1 million decrease in G&A.Total operating expenses of €25.2 million included an impairment provision of €2.5 million on the Lyon production facility  related to the end of eryaspase operations  and a €1.9 million provision for restructuring  related to the resizing of French operations and staff.Income tax included in 2022 a provision of €3.7 million ($4.1 million)  reflecting the best estimate to date of the tax impacts of the capital gain from the sale of the Princeton facility.As of June 30  2022  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €53.3 million (approximately $55.8 million)  compared with €33.7 million as of December 31  2021. The €19.6 million increase in cash position during the first half of 2022 was the result of the net cash of €37.6 million received from the sale of the Princeton facility  a €20.4 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities (excluding the sale of the Princeton facility) and €2.0 million generated in financing activities  including €3.0 million in pre-funding of the expected 2021 R&D tax credit  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.4 million positive currency exchange impact.The Company has not drawn any tranche on the convertible loan facility (OCABSA) since 2021 and there are no outstanding and unconverted notes. The OCABSA financing line has expired in June 2022.Earlier this year  the company initiated a deep restructuring and cost reduction program  now further intensified with the halt of the BLA process. Considering this ongoing reduction in operating expenses  the Company believes that its current cash position can fund its current programs and planned operating expenses to mid-2024.Key News Flow and Milestones Expected Over the Next 6 MonthsResults from the Phase 1 rESPECT Trial of eryaspase in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in first-line pancreatic cancer (2H 2022)Update on partnering discussions (Q4 2022)First Half 2022 Conference Call DetailsERYTECH management will hold a conference call and webcast on Tuesday  September 13  2022  at 8:30am ET / 2:30 pm CEST on the business highlights and financial results for the first half 2022.

The company was founded by Aidan Heavey in 1985 in Tullow  Co Carlow.READ MORE“Any delisting of Tullow’s ordinary shares from the Irish market is subject to the approval of Euronext Dublin ” the company said  referring to the operator of the Irish market. “It is anticipated that the delisting will take effect on or around 10 October  2022.”The move comes 2½ years after the company decided to close its Dublin office  which had 55 staff mostly working as geologists  as part of a round of corporate restructuring. It had moved its domicile to the UK two decades ago.Tullow announced in June that it planned to merge with cash-rich  Edinburgh-based Capricorn Energy in a deal that would see Tullow shareholders take 53 per cent of the larger entity. The tie-up would combine Capricorn’s $700 million-plus net cash position with Tullow’s $2.1 billion net debt  speeding up a decline in the latter’s borrowings  which stood at more than $3 billion in the middle of 2020.Still  Tullow  led by chief executive Rahul Dhir  is set to be the main driver of oil production  earnings and organic free cash flow for the foreseeable future  according to the analysts. This is mainly down to the Jubilee and TEN fields.Documentation on the planned merger is expected to be posted to shareholders in both companies in the coming months.Meanwhile  Tullow last month said it would abandon its drilling operations at an exploration well in offshore Guyana after results showed it bore water  marking another disappointment for companies drilling offshore the Caribbean nation.,neutral,0.04,0.68,0.28,negative,0.02,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'Tullow Oil', 'merger', 'chief executive Rahul Dhir', 'organic free cash flow', 'plus net cash position', 'cash-rich, Edinburgh-based Capricorn Energy', 'regulatory red tape', '$2.1 billion net debt', 'Irish stock market', 'Dublin stock market', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Tullow Oil shares', 'Irish market', 'regulatory obligations', 'oil production', 'three decades', 'Irish-founded group', 'primary quotation', 'TEN oilfields', 'careful review', 'overall objective', 'Aidan Heavey', 'Co Carlow', 'ordinary shares', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Dublin office', 'corporate restructuring', '53 per cent', 'larger entity', 'main driver', 'foreseeable future', 'TEN fields', 'coming months', 'drilling operations', 'exploration well', 'offshore Guyana', 'Caribbean nation', 'offshore Jubilee', 'central costs', 'Africa-focused company', 'Tullow shareholders', '1.4 billion', '33 years', 'merger', 'Ghana', 'flagship', 'move', 'board', 'compliance', 'line', 'purpose', 'statement', 'Monday', 'spokesman', 'trading', 'time', 'activity', 'READ', 'delisting', 'approval', 'operator', 'effect', '10 October', '55 staff', 'geologists', 'part', 'round', 'domicile', 'UK', 'June', 'deal', 'tie-up', '$700 million', 'latter', 'borrowings', 'middle', 'earnings', 'analysts', 'Documentation', 'companies', 'results', 'water', 'disappointment']",2022-09-12,2022-09-12,irishtimes.com

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.comThe Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs. Not averse to speculation and risk-taking  they never consider for a moment abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.And it is precisely this community of young collectors and enthusiasts who are the new clients of Artmarket.com and who frequently rely on our services. Today  their primary practical request is that art prices be quoted in both ETH and BTC in all of Artprice's databases  and so that is what we have done.This huge global community could not understand that Artprice's reference databases only include the world's primary fiat currencies  without quoting the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams have therefore mobilized at breakneck speed on this ambitious project in order to 'capture' the 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs  responding positively to their requests.After studying the question at great length and then committing to a huge volume of work  Artmarket.com has once again taken a significant step  by offering  as of today  8 828 384 auction results for artworks quoted in Bitcoin  going back to 1 February 2011 (with 1 Bitcoin at $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707)  and  then 5 814 866 auction results in Ethereum  starting on 7 August 2015 (with 1 Ethereum at $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  these tens of millions of calculations were made using the values of the cryptocurrencies on the day of each sale  with the historical indexing performed by Artmarket.com's extremely powerful computing facilities.Exemple:ETH => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?eth=1BTC => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?btc=1It is very interesting to see that  despite the recent value contraction of cryptocurrencies  purchases made in cryptocurrencies remain  extremely profitable in currency conversion terms  despite the necessary purge of 2022.Thanks to the addition of the two reference cryptocurrencies in the currency table (Dollar  Euro  Pounds Sterling  Yen) and the pedagogical tools developed by Artmarket.com in Artprice's databases  customers can finally get the necessary perspective to understand the value formation of cryptocurrencies over more than a decade against the world's major currencies  and therefore better understand the value of art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0  which are essentially based on Ethereum or Bitcoin.Artprice by Artmarket's phenomenal work on this project allows market participants to view the heated and often erroneous debates on cryptocurrencies with much greater serenity. Protagonists often argue the pros and cons of crypto using extremely short-term reasoning.

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)The Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs. Not averse to speculation and risk-taking  they never consider for a moment abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.And it is precisely this community of young collectors and enthusiasts who are the new clients of Artmarket.com and who frequently rely on our services. Today  their primary practical request is that art prices be quoted in both ETH and BTC in all of Artprice's databases  and so that is what we have done.This huge global community could not understand that Artprice's reference databases only include the world's primary fiat currencies  without quoting the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams have therefore mobilized at breakneck speed on this ambitious project in order to 'capture' the 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs  responding positively to their requests.After studying the question at great length and then committing to a huge volume of work  Artmarket.com has once again taken a significant step  by offering  as of today  8 828 384 auction results for artworks quoted in Bitcoin  going back to 1 February 2011 (with 1 Bitcoin at $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707)  and  then 5 814 866 auction results in Ethereum  starting on 7 August 2015 (with 1 Ethereum at $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  these tens of millions of calculations were made using the values of the cryptocurrencies on the day of each sale  with the historical indexing performed by Artmarket.com's extremely powerful computing facilities.Exemple:ETH => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?eth=1BTC => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?btc=1It is very interesting to see that  despite the recent value contraction of cryptocurrencies  purchases made in cryptocurrencies remain  extremely profitable in currency conversion terms  despite the necessary purge of 2022.Thanks to the addition of the two reference cryptocurrencies in the currency table (Dollar  Euro  Pounds Sterling  Yen) and the pedagogical tools developed by Artmarket.com in Artprice's databases  customers can finally get the necessary perspective to understand the value formation of cryptocurrencies over more than a decade against the world's major currencies  and therefore better understand the value of art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0  which are essentially based on Ethereum or Bitcoin.Artprice by Artmarket's phenomenal work on this project allows market participants to view the heated and often erroneous debates on cryptocurrencies with much greater serenity. Protagonists often argue the pros and cons of crypto using extremely short-term reasoning.

""Earlier this year and as a first result of the strategic review initiated last Fall after the disappointment of our Phase 3 trial in pancreatic cancer  we made a first important step with the saleof our U.S. production facility in Princeton  which significantly improved ERYTECH's financial prospects and gave us the latitude to continue the transformation of the Company.The recent decision to halt the submission process of our BLA dossier for eryaspase in hypersensitive ALLleads us now to focus on strategic alternatives for ERYTECH. We have prioritized our resources on our most promising preclinical programs  and we are making good progress on partnering discussions  for which we expect to report updates in the last quarter of this year.""Business HighlightsU.S. cell therapy manufacturing facility sold to Catalent for a total consideration of USD 44.5 millionIn April 2022  ERYTECH sold its commercial-scale cell therapy manufacturing facility in Princeton  New Jersey  to Catalent  for a total consideration of $44.5 million. ERYTECH's staff at the site of 40 people has been fully transferred to Catalent.ERYTECH maintained its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France and its core expertise to continue innovating in cell therapy.Good progress on strategic review and partnering alternativesAs announced on October 25th 2021  the Company has appointed a specialized advisor to evaluate its strategic and partnering options. After the transaction with Catalent  the Company has continued to evaluate further valuable strategic options to potentially leverage its assets and capabilities in a business combination with a strategic partner. Valuable options are under discussion and the Company expects to give further updates on these strategic initiatives in the 4th quarter of this year.Plans to pursue a BLA submission for Graspa in hypersensitive ALL stoppedfollowing recent feedbacks and new additional requests from the FDAFollowing positive results of a Phase 2 trial  sponsored by the Nordic Organization for Peadiatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)  ERYTECH had been in an extended dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the possibility for an approval of Graspa in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who had previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase therapy.A pre-BLA meeting to discuss the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) took place in June 2021 after which the Company confirmed its intention to submit a BLA  subject to successful completion of remaining activities  which included the submission of additional information to the FDA  responses to additional data requests  and the submission of the Initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP).The Company submitted its iPSP in July 2022 and received feedback from the FDA in August 2022. After thorough evaluation of this feedback  which included a new request for additional data  and taking into account the changing competitive landscape  the Company decided to halt the BLA process of seeking approval.Results of patients enrolled in TRYbeCA-2  Phase 2 clinical trial in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)  reviewedThe TRYbeCA-2 trial evaluated eryaspase in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy  compared to chemotherapy alone  in metastatic TNBC (first and second lines)  with disease control rate as the primary end point of the trial.Initial target enrollment was approximately 64 evaluable patients but following the disappointing results of eryaspase in the TRYbeCA-1 trial in second-line pancreatic cancer  the Company had decided  in consultation with the trial's Steering Committee  to stop further enrollment in the trial. A total of 27 patients 11 and 14 evaluable patients in the eryaspase and control arms  respectively  have been finally enrolled.The trial's Steering Committee met in September 2022 to review the results of the 25 evaluable patients. No clinical benefit was demonstrated  which could be attributed to the immature closure of the trial and the small number of patients. The treatment was well tolerated.Promising preclinical development with ERYCEVTM  novel red blood cell vesiculation technologyIn April 2022  ERYTECH announced the presentation of its novel red blood cell vesiculation technology  ERYCEV  at the 24th Meeting of the European Red Cell Society (ERCS).RBC-derived extracellular vesicles are formed naturally during senescence and storage of mature RBCs and are a potentially attractive drug delivery system. Vesiculation of RBCs that have already been loaded with active therapeutic compounds utilizing the ERYCAPS process  entails the potential of producing cargo-loaded RBC-derived extracellular vesicles for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.ERYCEV results to date illustrate the versatility of ERYTECH's encapsulation science in RBCs and its potential for leverage in further partnered developments.1H 2022 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below:In thousands of euros 1H 2022(6 months) 1H 2021(6 months) Revenues - - Other income 954 2 270 Net gain on asset sale 24 351 - Operating income 25 304 2 270 Research and development (17 300) (23 208) General and administrative (7 911) (8 027) Operating expenses (25 211) (31 235) Operating income (loss) 93 (28 966) Financial income 3 370 2 807 Financial expenses (750) (1 791) Financial income (loss) 2 620 1 016 Income tax (3 737) (2) Net loss (1 024) (27 952)Net loss for the first half of 2022 was €1.0 million  a €27.0 million improvement over the same period of last year  related mostly to the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility  while operating expenses of €25.2 million were also showing a €6.0 million decrease (-19%) year-over-year  with a €5.9 million decrease in R&D expenses and a €0.1 million decrease in G&A.Total operating expenses of €25.2 million included an impairment provision of €2.5 million on the Lyon production facility  related to the end of eryaspase operations  and a €1.9 million provision for restructuring  related to the resizing of French operations and staff.Income tax included in 2022 a provision of €3.7 million ($4.1 million)  reflecting the best estimate to date of the tax impacts of the capital gain from the sale of the Princeton facility.As of June 30  2022  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €53.3 million (approximately $55.8 million)  compared with €33.7 million as of December 31  2021. The €19.6 million increase in cash position during the first half of 2022 was the result of the net cash of €37.6 million received from the sale of the Princeton facility  a €20.4 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities (excluding the sale of the Princeton facility) and €2.0 million generated in financing activities  including €3.0 million in pre-funding of the expected 2021 R&D tax credit  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.4 million positive currency exchange impact.The Company has not drawn any tranche on the convertible loan facility (OCABSA) since 2021 and there are no outstanding and unconverted notes. The OCABSA financing line has expired in June 2022.Earlier this year  the company initiated a deep restructuring and cost reduction program  now further intensified with the halt of the BLA process. Considering this ongoing reduction in operating expenses  the Company believes that its current cash position can fund its current programs and planned operating expenses to mid-2024.Key News Flow and Milestones Expected Over the Next 6 MonthsResults from the Phase 1 rESPECT Trial of eryaspase in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in first-line pancreatic cancer (2H 2022)Update on partnering discussions (Q4 2022)First Half 2022 Conference Call DetailsERYTECH management will hold a conference call and webcast on Tuesday  September 13  2022  at 8:30am ET / 2:30 pm CEST on the business highlights and financial results for the first half 2022.

9855,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/thought-leadership/euronext-confirms-superior-market-quality-for-equity-trading/,Euronext confirms superior market quality for equity trading,Home to seven national exchanges  Euronext is further integrating its capital markets value chain whilst maintaining superior market quality for equity trading  to the benefit of a wide variety of market participants.,Euronext is leading the way in the evolution of the financial markets. Built into its DNA is the project to create the launchpad for integrated European capital markets. As the leading pan-European market infrastructure  Euronext today operates seven national exchanges (Belgium  France  Ireland  Italy  the Netherlands  Norway and Portugal)  one international fixed income trading platform  four CSDs  one clearing house in Europe  and its own trading technology and core data centre – covering the full capital markets value chain.A primary exchange representing over 25% of European Lit Equity trading with superior market qualityEuronext is the largest European cash equity trading venue across both primary exchanges and MTFs. It saw over €12 billion in average daily value traded in the first half of 2022  representing a quarter of European on-book lit turnover  and in Q2 2022 reached 67.1 % market share (continuous and auctions market share  including Borsa Italiana Group). As a primary exchange whose purpose is to shape capital markets for future generations  Euronext strives to help innovative companies grow by raising capital  and improve trading for clients of all sizes  geographies and categories – from institutional and retail investors to international brokers  local boutiques  and liquidity providers.As a primary exchange  Euronext plays a vital role in guaranteeing fair  orderly and efficient price formation  which is reflected in superior market quality. For almost a decade  Euronext has consistently offered the best market quality in Europe based on a wide range of key metrics.Euronext offers the tightest spreads on blue chips  approximately 40% tighter than the leading MTF in Europe. It displays an average Liquidity at Touch of above €20 000 on blue chips  twice as high as the best-performing MTFs. It is present at the European Best Bid & Offer (EBBO) on blue chips more than 77% of the time  and sets the EBBO four times more frequently than the leading MTFs.(Data as of H1 2022 – source: BMLL Technologies)Resilient market quality and better markouts  even in times of volatilitySince early 2020  volatility has skyrocketed in financial markets worldwide. In H1 2022  Euronext demonstrated its position as the leading European equity venue by maintaining stronger metrics than MTFs in terms of average spreads  presence at EBBO and EBBO setting  even when volatility hit. This enabled Euronext to guarantee execution to market participants with the most limited market impact  testifying to Euronext’s resilient markets  which showed the best performance – including better than MTFs – even in times of unprecedented levels of volatility. This resiliency  along with Euronext’s efficient liquidity programmes  was crucial in maintaining the efficient functioning of European marketplaces during the recent crises.Read more: Euronext Equity Market Quality Analysis(Studies published in December 2021 and May 2022 – source: BMLL Technologies)Recent figures from independent data provider QuantHouse (IRESS) based on public market data on Markouts (which are indicators of elementary market impact)  reveal that Markouts at +1 second after an aggressive buy trade are lower  and therefore better  on Euronext markets than on MTFs with comparable market models. This is thanks to the broad distribution of users on Euronext markets  which provide a diversity of flow that is not present on MTFs. For the benefit of investors  the better Markouts available on Euronext should be reflected in overall passive trade allocations.Read more: Euronext Quant Research(Quantitative studies based on data as of June-August 2021 and February-June 2022 – source: QuantHouse)Data centre move paving the way for further transformation in European financial marketsIn June this year  Euronext successfully completed one of the most ambitious projects in its history: the migration of its core data centre and related colocation services from Basildon  UK  to the Aruba Global Cloud Data Centre IT3 in Bergamo  Italy. Given that the data centre is one of the most important systems for an exchange  it was key for Euronext to host its trading activity in a first-rate and sustainable data centre facility  with control over its colocation infrastructure. This means that over a quarter of European lit equity trading is now powered by the greenest data centre in Europe  enabling its market participants to lower their environmental impact.Euronext’s core data centre move was completed in just 14 months  with a smooth migration process for market participants and no significant shifts in the liquidity landscape or the trading behaviour of direct members. Resilient market quality metrics on the Euronext equity markets testify to this beneficial move: average spreads for blue chips on Euronext were still lower than MTFs after the data centre migration  and Liquidity at Touch was above €22 000 on average.(Data in June 2022 – source: BMLL Technologies)The core data centre move has paved the way for further transformational migrations at Euronext. In 2023  Borsa Italiana cash and derivatives markets will join the Euronext single order book powered by Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary state-of-the-art trading platform. The migration to Optiq (pending regulatory approval) will foster investor activity on Borsa Italiana markets and provide one single access point for investors across seven markets. On the post-trade side  Euronext will migrate clearing services for all its markets to its own multi-asset clearing house Euronext Clearing (previously CC&G)  while its four CSD brands have been combined into Euronext Securities.As the European trading venue of reference for price formation and discovery  Euronext wants to consolidate its European scale  be innovative in terms of market model and be present on the entire value chain. Behind these transformations is one of Euronext’s basic principles: providing a simpler set-up for clients across its markets  harmonising the flows and the trading infrastructure in Europe.,neutral,0.18,0.77,0.05,mixed,0.59,0.2,0.2,True,English,"['superior market quality', 'equity trading', 'Euronext', 'one international fixed income trading platform', 'largest European cash equity trading venue', 'Aruba Global Cloud Data Centre', 'full capital markets value chain', 'Euronext Equity Market Quality Analysis', 'leading European equity venue', 'overall passive trade allocations', 'European lit equity trading', 'sustainable data centre facility', 'integrated European capital markets', 'leading pan-European market infrastructure', 'core data centre move', 'Resilient market quality metrics', 'one clearing house', 'superior market quality', 'aggressive buy trade', 'book lit turnover', 'average daily value', 'best market quality', 'greenest data centre', 'Borsa Italiana Group', 'European Best Bid', 'comparable market models', 'independent data provider', 'public market data', 'efficient price formation', 'limited market impact', 'elementary market impact', 'seven national exchanges', 'auctions market share', 'related colocation services', 'data centre migration', 'European financial markets', 'smooth migration process', 'Euronext equity markets', 'efficient liquidity programmes', 'Euronext Quant Research', 'international brokers', 'resilient markets', '67.1 % market share', 'colocation infrastructure', 'European marketplaces', 'beneficial move', 'trading technology', 'trading activity', 'trading behaviour', 'leading MTF', 'market participants', 'key metrics', 'stronger metrics', 'best performance', 'efficient functioning', 'environmental impact', 'primary exchanges', 'average Liquidity', 'average spreads', 'Euronext markets', 'four CSDs', 'first half', 'future generations', 'innovative companies', 'local boutiques', 'liquidity providers', 'vital role', 'fair, orderly', 'wide range', 'tightest spreads', 'blue chips', 'BMLL Technologies', 'unprecedented levels', 'recent crises', 'Recent figures', 'broad distribution', 'ambitious projects', 'important systems', 'significant shifts', 'liquidity landscape', 'direct members', 'transformational migrations', 'retail investors', 'Quantitative studies', 'a quarter', 'performing MTFs.', 'EBBO setting', 'way', 'evolution', 'DNA', 'launchpad', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Ireland', 'Italy', 'Netherlands', 'Portugal', 'Q2', 'continuous', 'purpose', 'clients', 'sizes', 'geographies', 'categories', 'institutional', 'decade', 'Touch', 'Offer', 'time', 'H1', 'source', 'markouts', 'volatility', 'early', 'position', 'terms', 'presence', 'execution', 'resiliency', 'December', 'May', 'QuantHouse', 'IRESS', 'indicators', 'users', 'diversity', 'flow', 'benefit', 'June-August', 'February-June', 'history', 'Basildon', 'UK', 'Bergamo', 'first-rate', 'control', '14 months']",2022-09-12,2022-09-12,thetradenews.com
