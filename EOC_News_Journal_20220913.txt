In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Story continuesForward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  September 12  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.comThe Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs.

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)The Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs. Not averse to speculation and risk-taking  they never consider for a moment abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.And it is precisely this community of young collectors and enthusiasts who are the new clients of Artmarket.com and who frequently rely on our services.

Restructuring existing debt obligations to extend the maturity date of the loan will enable Nanobiotix to drive priority development programs in 2023 by extending operating runway an additional quarter. Combined with the committed access to capital available through our existing equity line  this provides Nanobiotix with the ability to extend its operating runway into the first quarter of 2024.”The finance contract and royalty agreement established with the EIB in July 2018 consisted of an initial tranche of €16.0 million drawn in October 2018 and repayable in a single installment at maturity in 2023 and a second tranche of €14.0 million granted in March 2019 and repayable in semi-annual installments of principal and interest after a two-year grace period. The 2018 agreement also included a commitment to pay low single-digit royalties annually over a six-year period beginning in January 2021.The agreement in principle is structured around Nanobiotix expected cash inflow from future non-dilutive value drivers including planned commercialization1 of NBTXR3 and potential partnerships. The agreement in principle allows for deferment of approximately €25.3 million in principal repayments up to June 2029 and approximately €5.4 million in payment-in-kind (PIK) interest payments up to October 2024. It also includes an additional €20.0 million payment with a due date in 2029 which could be accelerated based on potential cash inflow. The outstanding debt obligations will continue to accrue interest until the new maturity dates. The six-year royalty period included in the 2018 agreement is also being revised to commence upon commercialization.Execution by the Company and EIB of a definitive amendment  expected in Q4 2022  is subject to finalization of the necessary documents and agreements.**About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

They were presented on September 11  2022  in a poster presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting taking place in Paris (France) from September 9-13  2022.The findings are as follows:TG6002 demonstrated good tolerability when administered weekly or on days 1 3 and 5. No major toxicities limiting the dose escalation process or the intensification of the schedule of administration were observed. Transient fever is the most common adverse event.when administered weekly or on days 1 3 and 5. No major toxicities limiting the dose escalation process or the intensification of the schedule of administration were observed. Transient fever is the most common adverse event. TG6002 is able to reach the tumor  replicate  and express its payload after IV administration.Onset of a neutralizing antibody response is not associated with a decreased biological activity of the product.These data further confirm the mechanism of action of the Invir.IO™-based oncolytic viruses in humans.The two IV administration schedules display different characteristics  that can both be leveraged in upcoming clinical trials. Three doses given once a week resulted in higher levels of expression of the payload than the more intensive schedule (3 injections within 5 days). The intensive schedule allowed for a longer lasting expression of the payload.These findings support the potential of IV administration of Invir.IO™-based oncolytic viruses  extending the use of these therapies to a broad range of solid tumors.The overall Phase I program with TG6002 was aimed at establishing the tolerability and the potential different doses and administration schedules for further development. Additional data will be produced from the Phase I program and will be presented at a scientific congress in H1 2023.Title of the poster: “Updated data of biodistribution and activity of oncolytic virus TG6002 after intravenous administration in patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinomas”“Updated data of biodistribution and activity of oncolytic virus TG6002 after intravenous administration in patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinomas” Authors : Victor Moreno  Philippe Cassier  Bernard Doger  Emiliano Calvo  Maria De Miguel  Rocio Garcia-Carbonero  Carlos Gomez-Roca  Christiane Jungels  Sophie Sainte-Croix  Philippe Erbs  Alain Sadoun and Kaïdre Bendjama: Victor Moreno  Philippe Cassier  Bernard Doger  Emiliano Calvo  Maria De Miguel  Rocio Garcia-Carbonero  Carlos Gomez-Roca  Christiane Jungels  Sophie Sainte-Croix  Philippe Erbs  Alain Sadoun and Kaïdre Bendjama Abstract Number: #4886#4886 Poster Number: 392PThe abstract and the e-poster are available on the ESMO congress website here and the e-poster can be downloaded on the Transgene website here as well.***About the trial (NCT03724071)This trial is a single-arm open-label Phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of TG6002 administered intravenously in combination with oral 5-FC  a non-cytotoxic pro-drug that can be converted in 5-FU  its active metabolite. Based on the safety profile of TG6002  several dose levels and administration schedules have been added to the initial Phase I clinical protocol. The trial has safety as primary endpoint for the Phase I. The trial also evaluates pharmacokinetic properties and biodistribution of TG6002  along with immune modulation of the tumor micro-environment. This European study enrolled patients suffering from advanced gastrointestinal carcinomas who have failed and/or are intolerant to standard therapeutic options in the Phase I part.Dr. Philippe Cassier  M.D.  Ph.D.  head of the early-phase trials unit at Centre Léon Bérard (Lyon  France)  is the principal investigator of the trial.About TG6002TG6002 has been engineered to directly kill cancer cells (oncolysis)  to enable the production of a chemotherapy agent (5-FU) within the tumor  and to elicit an immune response by the body against the tumor cells. Its satisfactory safety profile after intravenous administration and its mechanism of action has been shown in human in a Phase I trial.In preclinical experiments  TG6002 has been shown to induce the shrinkage of the primary tumor as well as the regression of distant metastases (Foloppe  et al.  Molecular Therapy Oncolytics  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omto.2019.03.005).The production of 5-FU directly in the tumor aims to achieve a better anti-tumoral effect with limited chemotherapy-induced side effects.TG6002 induces the production of 5-FU in the cancer cells it has infected  by enabling the local conversion of the pro-drug 5-FC (administered orally) into 5-FU. 5-FU is a common chemotherapy agent for patients with gastrointestinal cancers. This mechanism of action is based on the in-tumor expression of the proprietary FCU1 gene that has been encoded in the genome of TG6002  taking advantage of the virus selective replication in the tumor cells.When administered systemically  5-FU is associated with side effects that can lead to treatment discontinuation. With TG6002  5-FU is produced within the tumor where it is expected to be present at a high concentration level in contrast to the very low levels anticipated in the rest of the patient’s body.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Transgene’s programs utilize viral vector technology with the goal of indirectly or directly killing cancer cells.The Company’s clinical-stage programs consist of two therapeutic vaccines (TG4001 for the treatment of HPV-positive cancers  and TG4050  the first individualized therapeutic vaccine based on the myvac® platform) as well as two oncolytic viruses (TG6002 for the treatment of solid tumors  and BT-001  the first oncolytic virus based on the Invir.IO™ platform).With Transgene’s myvac® platform  therapeutic vaccination enters the field of precision medicine with a novel immunotherapy that is fully tailored to each individual. The myvac® approach allows the generation of a virus-based immunotherapy that encodes patient-specific mutations identified and selected by Artificial Intelligence capabilities provided by its partner NEC.With its proprietary platform Invir.IO™  Transgene is building on its viral vector engineering expertise to design a new generation of multifunctional oncolytic viruses. Transgene has an ongoing Invir.IO™ collaboration with AstraZeneca.Additional information about Transgene is available at: www.transgene.fr.

This patient  who has completed the double-blind  placebo-controlled PREMIER trial  was enrolled in May 2021. All patients who complete the PREMIER trial will be eligible to join the PREMIER-OLE study and will receive the high dose (‘HD') of PXT3003 until the treatment is commercially available  should PXT3003 be approved in the US and Europe  respectively by the FDA and the EMA. PXT3003 is the Company's lead program to treat CMT1A  a debilitating disease with currently no existing approved therapies.The PREMIER trial  which recently completed enrollment with a total of 387 patients  is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  where the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the HD tested in the prior Phase III clinical study  the PLEO-CMT trial  and the ongoing open-label extension Phase III study  the PLEOCMT-FU trial. As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability.Recent data from the ongoing PLEOCMT-FU trial (open-label follow-up extension study of the first phase III study  the PLEO-CMT trial) announced in May 2022 has shown a good safety profile and continuous treatment effect of PXT3003 measured on the ONLS after 5 years of total treatment time. 123 Patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A are still on treatment with PXT3003 High Dose in the PLEOCMT-FU trial.Story continuesDr. Burkhard Blank  Chief Medical Officer at Pharnext commented: ""The decision to conduct a second open label extension study  after the PREMIER trial  was triggered by the encouraging data from our first  and ongoing  open-label extension study of the first PXT3003 Phase III  which has shown a sustained treatment benefit for patients with CMT1A treated with PXT3003 High Dose after 5 years. We look forward to generating additional long-term data to confirm the potential safety and efficacy of PXT3003 for these patients who currently have no treatment options.""Xavier Paoli  Chief Operating Officer at Pharnext  commented: ""The PREMIER-OLE study provides patients who have completed our second pivotal Phase III trial with the option to continue receiving treatment - all with PXT3003 HD -for this debilitating and progressive disease. We are committed to ensuring patients with CMT1A have continued access to PXT3003 High Dose  until the potential marketing authorization and subsequent commercialization.""About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/disease/charcot-marie-tooth .About PXT3003PXT3003 is a novel fixed-dose synergistic combination of baclofen  naltrexone and sorbitol formulated as an oral solution given twice a day. The three individual components of PXT3003 were selected to downregulate the overexpression of PMP22 protein  leading to improvement of neuronal signaling in dysfunctional peripheral nerves that are an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disease. PXT3003 could also have a positive effect on other cellular types of the motor unit such as the axon (direct protection)  neuromuscular junctions or muscle cells. PXT3003 has shown promising and consistent results across preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II and Phase III (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU). More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/pipeline/pxt3003 .About the PREMIER TrialThe PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (‘HD') tested in the prior Phase III trial (‘PLEO-CMT'). As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. The secondary endpoints include the following outcome measures: 1) 10-Meter Walk Test (‘10mWT')  2) Quantified Muscular Testing (bilateral foot dorsiflexion dynamometry)  3) Patient Global Impression of Severity (‘PGI-S')  4) Patient Global Impression of Change (‘PGI-C')  5) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score  version 2 (‘CMTNS-v2')  and 6) Quantified Muscular Testing (hand grip). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Further information on the PREMIER trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT04762758) here .About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments.

Taps Global Launch Vehicle Portfolio to Take Fast-Growing Astrocast IoT Constellation to Orbit - Business Wire,Spaceflight  the leading global launch services provider  today announced it will launch four Astrocast 3U spacecraft aboard India’s Polar Satellite L,SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spaceflight  the leading global launch services provider  today announced it will launch four Astrocast 3U spacecraft aboard India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) mission under a commercial arrangement with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL). This mission  scheduled for October 2022  will launch from Sriharikota  India’s Satish Dhawan Space Center  carrying the Astrocast spacecraft as a co-passenger to sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) along with the Indian national primary satellite.This launch represents Spaceflight’s eighth launch on a PSLV and its fourth supporting Astrocast’s nanosatellite Internet of Things (IoT) network and constellation. Once this mission is complete  Spaceflight will have launched 16 spacecraft in the Astrocast constellation  which enables companies to track and monitor assets in some of the world’s most remote regions.“ PSLV has long been a reliable and valuable launch partner to Spaceflight and we’re excited to work with NSIL again after the COVID-19 restrictions of the last few years ” said Curt Blake  CEO of Spaceflight. “ By having experience working with many different launch providers around the world  we are able to identify missions that meet our customer's exact needs – whether that’s driven by schedule  cost or destination. As Astrocast builds its network and constellation  we can offer them a range of launch options  flexibility and customization to support their long-term plans.”Astrocast is a long-time Spaceflight customer.

The recent decision to halt the submission process of our BLA dossier for eryaspase in hypersensitive ALL leads us now to focus on strategic alternatives for ERYTECH. We have prioritized our resources on our most promising preclinical programs  and we are making good progress on partnering discussions  for which we expect to report updates in the last quarter of this year.”Business HighlightsU.S. cell therapy manufacturing facility sold to Catalent for a total consideration of USD 44.5 millionIn April 2022  ERYTECH sold its commercial-scale cell therapy manufacturing facility in Princeton  New Jersey  to Catalent  for a total consideration of $44.5 million. ERYTECH’s staff at the site of 40 people has been fully transferred to Catalent.ERYTECH maintained its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France and its core expertise to continue innovating in cell therapy.Good progress on strategic review and partnering alternativesAs announced on October 25th 2021  the Company has appointed a specialized advisor to evaluate its strategic and partnering options. After the transaction with Catalent  the Company has continued to evaluate further valuable strategic options to potentially leverage its assets and capabilities in a business combination with a strategic partner. Valuable options are under discussion and the Company expects to give further updates on these strategic initiatives in the 4th quarter of this year.Plans to pursue a BLA submission for Graspa® in hypersensitive ALL stopped following recent feedbacks and new additional requests from the FDAFollowing positive results of a Phase 2 trial  sponsored by the Nordic Organization for Peadiatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)  ERYTECH had been in an extended dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the possibility for an approval of Graspa in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who had previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase therapy.A pre-BLA meeting to discuss the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) took place in June 2021 after which the Company confirmed its intention to submit a BLA  subject to successful completion of remaining activities  which included the submission of additional information to the FDA  responses to additional data requests  and the submission of the Initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP).The Company submitted its iPSP in July 2022 and received feedback from the FDA in August 2022. After thorough evaluation of this feedback  which included a new request for additional data  and taking into account the changing competitive landscape  the Company decided to halt the BLA process of seeking approval.Results of patients enrolled in TRYbeCA-2  Phase 2 clinical trial in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)  reviewedThe TRYbeCA-2 trial evaluated eryaspase in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy  compared to chemotherapy alone  in metastatic TNBC (first and second lines)  with disease control rate as the primary end point of the trial.Initial target enrollment was approximately 64 evaluable patients but following the disappointing results of eryaspase in the TRYbeCA-1 trial in second-line pancreatic cancer  the Company had decided  in consultation with the trial’s Steering Committee  to stop further enrollment in the trial. A total of 27 patients 11 and 14 evaluable patients in the eryaspase and control arms  respectively  have been finally enrolled.The trial’s Steering Committee met in September 2022 to review the results of the 25 evaluable patients. No clinical benefit was demonstrated  which could be attributed to the immature closure of the trial and the small number of patients. The treatment was well tolerated.Promising preclinical development with ERYCEVTM  novel red blood cell vesiculation technologyIn April 2022  ERYTECH announced the presentation of its novel red blood cell vesiculation technology  ERYCEV  at the 24th Meeting of the European Red Cell Society (ERCS).RBC-derived extracellular vesicles are formed naturally during senescence and storage of mature RBCs and are a potentially attractive drug delivery system. Vesiculation of RBCs that have already been loaded with active therapeutic compounds utilizing the ERYCAPS® process  entails the potential of producing cargo-loaded RBC-derived extracellular vesicles for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.ERYCEV results to date illustrate the versatility of ERYTECH’s encapsulation science in RBCs and its potential for leverage in further partnered developments.1H 2022 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below:In thousands of euros 1H 2022(6 months) 1H 2021(6 months) Revenues — — Other income 954 2 270 Net gain on asset sale 24 351 — Operating income 25 304 2 270 Research and development (17 300) (23 208) General and administrative (7 911) (8 027) Operating expenses (25 211) (31 235) Operating income (loss) 93 (28 966) Financial income 3 370 2 807 Financial expenses (750) (1 791) Financial income (loss) 2 620 1 016 Income tax (3 737) (2) Net loss (1 024) (27 952)Net loss for the first half of 2022 was €1.0 million  a €27.0 million improvement over the same period of last year  related mostly to the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility  while operating expenses of €25.2 million were also showing a €6.0 million decrease (-19%) year-over-year  with a €5.9 million decrease in R&D expenses and a €0.1 million decrease in G&A.Total operating expenses of €25.2 million included an impairment provision of €2.5 million on the Lyon production facility  related to the end of eryaspase operations  and a €1.9 million provision for restructuring  related to the resizing of French operations and staff.Income tax included in 2022 a provision of €3.7 million ($4.1 million)  reflecting the best estimate to date of the tax impacts of the capital gain from the sale of the Princeton facility.As of June 30  2022  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €53.3 million (approximately $55.8 million)  compared with €33.7 million as of December 31  2021. The €19.6 million increase in cash position during the first half of 2022 was the result of the net cash of €37.6 million received from the sale of the Princeton facility  a €20.4 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities (excluding the sale of the Princeton facility) and €2.0 million generated in financing activities  including €3.0 million in pre-funding of the expected 2021 R&D tax credit  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.4 million positive currency exchange impact.The Company has not drawn any tranche on the convertible loan facility (OCABSA) since 2021 and there are no outstanding and unconverted notes. The OCABSA financing line has expired in June 2022.Earlier this year  the company initiated a deep restructuring and cost reduction program  now further intensified with the halt of the BLA process. Considering this ongoing reduction in operating expenses  the Company believes that its current cash position can fund its current programs and planned operating expenses to mid-2024.Key News Flow and Milestones Expected Over the Next 6 MonthsResults from the Phase 1 rESPECT Trial of eryaspase in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in first-line pancreatic cancer (2H 2022)Update on partnering discussions (Q4 2022)First Half 2022 Conference Call DetailsERYTECH management will hold a conference call and webcast on Tuesday  September 13  2022  at 8:30am ET / 2:30 pm CEST on the business highlights and financial results for the first half 2022.

The company was founded by Aidan Heavey in 1985 in Tullow  Co Carlow.READ MORE“Any delisting of Tullow’s ordinary shares from the Irish market is subject to the approval of Euronext Dublin ” the company said  referring to the operator of the Irish market. “It is anticipated that the delisting will take effect on or around 10 October  2022.”The move comes 2½ years after the company decided to close its Dublin office  which had 55 staff mostly working as geologists  as part of a round of corporate restructuring. It had moved its domicile to the UK two decades ago.Tullow announced in June that it planned to merge with cash-rich  Edinburgh-based Capricorn Energy in a deal that would see Tullow shareholders take 53 per cent of the larger entity. The tie-up would combine Capricorn’s $700 million-plus net cash position with Tullow’s $2.1 billion net debt  speeding up a decline in the latter’s borrowings  which stood at more than $3 billion in the middle of 2020.Still  Tullow  led by chief executive Rahul Dhir  is set to be the main driver of oil production  earnings and organic free cash flow for the foreseeable future  according to the analysts. This is mainly down to the Jubilee and TEN fields.Documentation on the planned merger is expected to be posted to shareholders in both companies in the coming months.Meanwhile  Tullow last month said it would abandon its drilling operations at an exploration well in offshore Guyana after results showed it bore water  marking another disappointment for companies drilling offshore the Caribbean nation.,neutral,0.04,0.68,0.28,negative,0.02,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'Tullow Oil', 'merger', 'chief executive Rahul Dhir', 'organic free cash flow', 'plus net cash position', 'cash-rich, Edinburgh-based Capricorn Energy', 'regulatory red tape', '$2.1 billion net debt', 'Irish stock market', 'Dublin stock market', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Tullow Oil shares', 'Irish market', 'regulatory obligations', 'oil production', 'three decades', 'Irish-founded group', 'primary quotation', 'TEN oilfields', 'careful review', 'overall objective', 'Aidan Heavey', 'Co Carlow', 'ordinary shares', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Dublin office', 'corporate restructuring', '53 per cent', 'larger entity', 'main driver', 'foreseeable future', 'TEN fields', 'coming months', 'drilling operations', 'exploration well', 'offshore Guyana', 'Caribbean nation', 'offshore Jubilee', 'central costs', 'Africa-focused company', 'Tullow shareholders', '1.4 billion', '33 years', 'merger', 'Ghana', 'flagship', 'move', 'board', 'compliance', 'line', 'purpose', 'statement', 'Monday', 'spokesman', 'trading', 'time', 'activity', 'READ', 'delisting', 'approval', 'operator', 'effect', '10 October', '55 staff', 'geologists', 'part', 'round', 'domicile', 'UK', 'June', 'deal', 'tie-up', '$700 million', 'latter', 'borrowings', 'middle', 'earnings', 'analysts', 'Documentation', 'companies', 'results', 'water', 'disappointment']",2022-09-12,2022-09-13,irishtimes.com

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.comThe Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs. Not averse to speculation and risk-taking  they never consider for a moment abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.And it is precisely this community of young collectors and enthusiasts who are the new clients of Artmarket.com and who frequently rely on our services. Today  their primary practical request is that art prices be quoted in both ETH and BTC in all of Artprice's databases  and so that is what we have done.This huge global community could not understand that Artprice's reference databases only include the world's primary fiat currencies  without quoting the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams have therefore mobilized at breakneck speed on this ambitious project in order to 'capture' the 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs  responding positively to their requests.After studying the question at great length and then committing to a huge volume of work  Artmarket.com has once again taken a significant step  by offering  as of today  8 828 384 auction results for artworks quoted in Bitcoin  going back to 1 February 2011 (with 1 Bitcoin at $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707)  and  then 5 814 866 auction results in Ethereum  starting on 7 August 2015 (with 1 Ethereum at $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  these tens of millions of calculations were made using the values of the cryptocurrencies on the day of each sale  with the historical indexing performed by Artmarket.com's extremely powerful computing facilities.Exemple:ETH => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?eth=1BTC => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?btc=1It is very interesting to see that  despite the recent value contraction of cryptocurrencies  purchases made in cryptocurrencies remain  extremely profitable in currency conversion terms  despite the necessary purge of 2022.Thanks to the addition of the two reference cryptocurrencies in the currency table (Dollar  Euro  Pounds Sterling  Yen) and the pedagogical tools developed by Artmarket.com in Artprice's databases  customers can finally get the necessary perspective to understand the value formation of cryptocurrencies over more than a decade against the world's major currencies  and therefore better understand the value of art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0  which are essentially based on Ethereum or Bitcoin.Artprice by Artmarket's phenomenal work on this project allows market participants to view the heated and often erroneous debates on cryptocurrencies with much greater serenity. Protagonists often argue the pros and cons of crypto using extremely short-term reasoning.

Indeed  over the years  Artprice has been a primary mover in shaping today's Art Market and was way ahead of anyone else in predicting its dematerialisation.Ethereum 2.0  The Merge. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) Bitcoin. Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)The Internet was of course the biggest game changer  particularly the advent of high-speed internet  fiber connections  5G+  and  very soon  satellite constellations in low orbits such as Starlink. Alongside these technological advancements  we have seen the development of Big Data processing of art market information and artificial intelligence (AI). Ahead of each of these evolutions  Artprice by Artmarket has been able to anticipate and integrate these new technologies internally with its ultra sophisticated R&D capacity.The 6 300 global auction houses affiliated with Artprice (for more than two decades now) conduct 98% of their sales online  and nowadays no-one bats an eyelid about this reality. This dematerialization was made possible by the complete trust that Artprice by Artmarket.com was able to generate  by standardizing all art market data for all transactions  whether physical or online.This explains Artprice by Artmarket's position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years  backed by the largest proprietary collection of manuscripts and original sales catalogs printed in the world since 1700  which in return legitimize our digital standardization of the global art market.But no sooner had the art market accepted its digital destiny than along came NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and the Metaverse  pushing this dematerialization even further  and creating a bridge with another world of cryptocurrencies (notably Ethereum  the reference cryptocurrency for transactions on Art NFTs)  which with the ""Smart Contract"" (including copyrights and successive deeds of transfer) and its secure Blockchain  is an absolutely vital tool for a dematerialised art market.Artmarket.com is focusing particularly on Ethereum (ETH)  the benchmark cryptocurrency (capitalization of $220bn) in this new art market  without neglecting Bitcoin (BTC)  which remains the largest historic crypto-asset in terms of market capitalization ($412bn).For the last 3 years  Artmarket.com has been closely following the transition to ""The Merge"" for the completely decarbonized of the Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain  in the context of the global energy crisis which is only just beginning. Indeed  according to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  whose release is scheduled for 15 September 2022 (after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH will shrink by 99 95% after the move from ""Proof-of-Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof-of-Stake"" (PoS)  source: https://ethereum.foundation/Sotheby's recently decided to make a stronger commitment to Web 3.0 by strengthening its team dedicated to art NFTs and projecting exponential growth in the sector over the next five years. Christie's  not to be outdone and having led the way with the historic sale of Beeple's The First 5 000 Days for a record amount of $69.3 million  has recently launched ""Christie's Ventures""  its investment fund dedicated to Web 3.0 and digital art.Art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0 are far from being an epi-phenomenon. They represent a real paradigm shift in the art market  a fact that has been amply reflected by the strategic adjustments of the world's major auction houses  art professionals and payment leaders like Mastercard which is joining forces with Binance to 'democratize' payment in cryptocurrencies.The same is true for Visa and its crypto-card. Almost all players in global finance have integrated cryptocurrencies and NFTs into their strategies. Similarly  95% of the multinationals listed in the Global 500 Fortune (a ranking of the top 500 global groups) have all integrated crypto-assets and the Metaverse to be able to access Web 3.0.According to a long article entitled ""NFTs ignite the art market"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro (5 August 2022): ""The global NFT market already generated 44 billion dollars in 2021"". Bearing in mind that online auction turnover is now way ahead of live auction turnover  this is not surprising.Cryptocurrencies and Art NFTs and the Metaverse have brought thousands of new art collectors and enthusiasts to the art market  most of them substantially younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs. Not averse to speculation and risk-taking  they never consider for a moment abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.And it is precisely this community of young collectors and enthusiasts who are the new clients of Artmarket.com and who frequently rely on our services. Today  their primary practical request is that art prices be quoted in both ETH and BTC in all of Artprice's databases  and so that is what we have done.This huge global community could not understand that Artprice's reference databases only include the world's primary fiat currencies  without quoting the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC) which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams have therefore mobilized at breakneck speed on this ambitious project in order to 'capture' the 450 million potential buyers of art NFTs  responding positively to their requests.After studying the question at great length and then committing to a huge volume of work  Artmarket.com has once again taken a significant step  by offering  as of today  8 828 384 auction results for artworks quoted in Bitcoin  going back to 1 February 2011 (with 1 Bitcoin at $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707)  and  then 5 814 866 auction results in Ethereum  starting on 7 August 2015 (with 1 Ethereum at $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  these tens of millions of calculations were made using the values of the cryptocurrencies on the day of each sale  with the historical indexing performed by Artmarket.com's extremely powerful computing facilities.Exemple:ETH => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?eth=1BTC => https://www.artprice.com/artiste/15079/wassily-kandinsky/lots/passes?btc=1It is very interesting to see that  despite the recent value contraction of cryptocurrencies  purchases made in cryptocurrencies remain  extremely profitable in currency conversion terms  despite the necessary purge of 2022.Thanks to the addition of the two reference cryptocurrencies in the currency table (Dollar  Euro  Pounds Sterling  Yen) and the pedagogical tools developed by Artmarket.com in Artprice's databases  customers can finally get the necessary perspective to understand the value formation of cryptocurrencies over more than a decade against the world's major currencies  and therefore better understand the value of art NFTs and the Metaverse forming Web 3.0  which are essentially based on Ethereum or Bitcoin.Artprice by Artmarket's phenomenal work on this project allows market participants to view the heated and often erroneous debates on cryptocurrencies with much greater serenity. Protagonists often argue the pros and cons of crypto using extremely short-term reasoning.

He serves as a Research Assistant under Dr. Aniruddha Rajput  Member  UN International Law Commission.]IntroductionThe conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine increases day by day in intensity and  with it  the already heavy toll in terms of victims  missing persons and displaced persons seeking refuge in neighboring countries grows. This piecewill not deal with humanitarian issues or the qualification of the Russian military intervention in the light of international law  so please refer to the contributions of other scholars published (for example  Gadkari  Spagnolo  Favuzza  or Fasciglione)  but rather the negative implications of same on financial markets and the world economy. War  geopolitical instability  the risk of a nuclear escalationhave in fact introduced numerous unknowns for global trade  for multinational companies  for capital markets and for national economies themselves.Economically  the first and perhaps most obvious effect of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was a general increase in the prices of raw materials and food. The Russian Federation is among the main exporters of hydrocarbons  as well as of numerous metal alloys (such as aluminum  titanium  nickel and palladium) essential for the steel  chemical and petrochemical  pharmaceutical and major engineering sectors. The instability generated by the conflict and the consequent trade restrictions have caused a very strong rise in energy prices  as evidenced by the current price of natural gas  which has practically doubled compared to a year ago. Taken together  moreover  the Russian Federation and Ukraine account for over a quarter of the world trade in wheat: tensions in Eastern Europe threaten to curb grain shipments around the world  increasing the costs of producing bread and pasta. The gravity of the situation was underlined by the Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala  in a recent statement.The effects of the conflict are also having significant impacts on global supply chains: commercial companies are struggling to find easy merchant routes  with the closure of Ukrainian ports  the risks for navigationin the Black and Azov seas  theaters of the conflict  and restrictions on transit in the Bosphorus  where Turkey has already announced its intention to implement the provisions of the Montreaux Convention that allow it to restrict navigation  in particular warships  through the Dardanelles. Following the decisions of the European Union  the United States and other countries to close their airspace to aircraft flying the Russian flag – and the reciprocal measures adopted by the Russian government – trade is further restricted also by air.If the effects of the conflict have and will have global repercussions  the “price” that the Russian Federation risks paying could be very high. The condemnation of the conflict  in the foregone paralysis of the United Nations Security Council  came almost unanimously from the United Nations General Assembly which  with a resolution adopted on 2 March last  requested the Russian Federation to “immediately  completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders”. Several like-minded states(including Australia  Canada  South Korea  Japan  United Kingdom  Singapore  United States of America  Switzerland  among others) and the European Union have responded to the heavy mobilization of troops with employment of all its economic strength  implementing numerous unilateral measures – but certainly “agreed” – in reaction to the blatant violation of Art. 2.4 of the United Nations Charter  and the previous Soviet recognition of the separatist republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. Many of these coercive measures(commonly – and improperly – known as “sanctions”) have also been extended to subjects and entities of Belarusian nationality  due to the complicity of the Lukashenko regime in military intervention alongside the Russian Federation. Clearly  these measures are aimed at isolating the Russian state and evaporating the economic resources necessary for the conduct of the war.Economic Coercive Measures in QuestionThe measures adopted include the freezing of assets of individuals and commercial companies  the limit on bank deposits and access to bank credit  the prohibition of bargaining for industries operating in the defense sector  the imposition of duties  restrictions on the access to the market and commercial measures such as the withdrawal of concessions and the blocking of exports (of arms  first of all  together with products  systems and technologies susceptible of so-called dual use). The assets of the Russian central bank in the territory of the EU and the United States have been blocked  as have those of the main Russian and Belarusian banks  whose “operation” was severely limited by disconnection from the SWIFT system (acronym for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)  which made payments of a transnational nature connected to trade and financial activities substantially more complex  articulated and lengthy. In total  some 700 people and 60 entities are now subject to sanctions  including President Putin  ministers and senior officials of the Russian administrative apparatus  351 deputies of the Duma and well-known personalities of the Russian financial elite  including billionaires Alexei Mordashov  Vladimir Lisin and Alisher Usmanov  considered to be very close to the Russian President  whose assets have also been subject to seizure orders in Italy. These measures  which are already quite incisive in themselves  have been accompanied by provisions that impose a ban on the stay and movement of affected individuals on the territory of the states that impose the sanction (travel ban) and blockades of air and naval traffic. In addition  the main international clearing systems  Euroclear and Clearstream  have decided to refuse transactions in rubles  as well as several commercial banks have temporarily suspended the sale and purchase of the currency  the value of which has fallen by more than 40%. Other global financial players  such as major payment and credit card networks  have suspended their operations in Russia and Belarus. Many multinational companies  including the so-called big-tech  have suspended sales of their products and services in Russia.International InstrumentsAll the instruments listed (without any claim to be exhaustive) have been adopted unilaterally by the States and by the European Union or voluntarily by private subjects. As regards the measures adopted by the States and the Union  it should be emphasized that these coercive measures were implemented in the absence of a decision by the United Nations Security Council pursuant to art. 41 of the United Nations Charter which  as is well known  allows for the adoption of measures not involving the use of force when one of the situations envisaged by art. 39 of the United Nations Charter. The legitimacyof the countermeasures adopted by States not particularly harmed by an international offense is still today the subject of a wide debate on the level of general international law (on this point  it is permissible to refer to the considerations of Gadkari and Chowksey regarding the sanctions on Russia’s sovereign debt market; De Sena and Gradoni regarding the measures adopted in 2014 in the to the Russian Federation and  more generally  to the studies of Asada; Dawidowicz; Hofer; Silingardi; Sossai; Tzanakopoulos; and Ronzitti). However  it is clear that some measures can be framed in specific regulatory regimes: in particular  this practice appears questionable in the light of international trade law.The tools most often used by governments for sanctions include embargoes  boycotts or the imposition of quantitative restrictions on trade  as well as the creation of non-tariff barriers  such as prescribing specific licensing or packaging requirements. Such measures could violate various clauses of the WTO agreements  in particular the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services(GATS)  whose founding principles are reciprocity and non-discrimination in commercial relations  the latter expressed by the well-known standardsof national treatment and most favoured nation(MFN). In particular  Article I  paragraph 1  of the GATT (as well as Article II of the GATS) provides for equal treatment with respect to similar products originating in or destined for the territories of all the other Contracting Parties: some countries  such as Canada  have already withdrawn this privilege with regard to goods from the Russian Federation and Belarus  while legislative proposals to this effect have been introduced at the US Congress. On 15 March 2022  the President of the European Commission announced that this measure will also be implemented by the European Union and its Members within the framework of the World Trade Organization.As a result of these decisions  goods and services from the Russian Federation could incur much higher tariffs. Furthermore  the unilateral measures implemented so far have established quantitative restrictions on the export of various categories of goods  which could constitute a violation of art. IX of the GATT  which prescribes the elimination of the so-called quotas  as well as the limitations imposed on air  sea and land transport could result in a violation of the rule that requires the free transit of goods and services in the territories of the Contracting Parties (art. V GATT). In addition  it should be noted that art. 23 of the Understanding on Dispute Settlement (DSU) prohibits the use of unilateral self-helpmeasures  establishing the obligation to resort to the dispute resolution system provided for by the Agreement: this interpretation has been confirmed by various panels  including those set up in cases US-Shrimp (par. 7.43) and Canada – Aircraft Credits and Guarantees (par. 7.170)  which have clearly identified as “prohibited” the measures taken individually by States outside the procedural framework managed by the Dispute Settlement Body. These and other provisions  therefore  would render illegitimate any unilateral coercive measure of a commercial nature adopted by one Member State against another.However  the WTO agreements also include clauses of exception to the general regime of trade liberalization  allowing that – in the presence of specific requirements – Member States can adopt measures that have the effect of restricting commercial traffic in order to protect values and non-economic needs. Specifically  while art. XX of the GATT (and art. XIV of the GATS) outline a series of general exceptions (see Espa  pp. 193-228; Mauro  pp. 159-162)  art. XXI of the GATT and XIVbis of the GATS (as well as Article 73 of the agreement relating to the Trade Related Aspects of International Property Rights – TRIPS) instead offer the opportunity to use measures based on essential security needs. Such clauses have very rarely been invoked in WTO practice (see Mavroidis  Bermann  Wu  pp. 684-786).As dictated by the letter of art. XXI of the GATT  however  this security exception is directly linked to the objectives of peace protection and maintenance of international security professed by the United Nations Charter  as well as letter (b) of the same provision prescribes that such measures can be decided in period of war or emergency in international relations. By invoking this provision  Ukraine has decided to apply a full embargo to products originating from the Russian Federation and not to apply the WTO agreements with the same state  as summarized in a letter addressed to the Chairmanof the General Council of the WTO. It is questionable  however  whether the coercive measures adopted by Ukraine and other states against the Russian Federation and Belarus are legitimate and therefore can fall within the exception clause.WTO JurisprudenceTwo recent cases in the WTO may come in support  as the use of unilateral economic measures was specifically considered in them. In 2017  Qatar had resorted to the WTO dispute settlement body because of the actions of four states – Bahrain  Egypt  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – arguing that the coercive economic measures taken by those states constituted a violation of the Organization’s rules  impeding the freedom of transit of goods and frustrating most of the commercial exchanges between the two countries. However  although the panelestablished in the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia had recognized the existence of a state of “tension” and the breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two countries  in the decision only some measures adopted by the Saudi government had been deemed justified by security reasons: rather surprisingly  however  there was no elaboration or analysis in the report about the nature of the emergency situationthat would have justified trade restrictive measures (see Saudi Arabia – Measures Concerning The Protection Of Intellectual Property Rights  par. 7.257; on the subject  see Glöckle). A previous case between Ukraine and Russia  opened in 2016  instead resulted in a decision in 2019 that provides a more complete interpretation of the security exception under Article XXI (see Russia – Measures Concerning Traffic In Transit; in subject  see Adinolfi and Marotti; Voon). As is well known  the dispute arose following the serious deterioration of relations between the two countries in February 2014  a situation that had led the Russian Federation to limit the transit through its territory of Ukrainian goods destined for Central Asian markets. Ukraine had challenged these restrictions before the WTO bodies as contrary to Article V of the GATT as well as to various trade commitments under the Protocol of Accession of the Russian Federation to the Organization. Russia replied by invoking Article XXI (b) (iii) of the GATT  which as mentioned provides that a member of the WTO can take any action “which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations”. The panelthen considered that Russia had satisfied the requirements to invoke the exception and had interpreted the requirement of emergency in international relations as a “situation of armed conflict  or of latent armed conflict  or of heightened tension or crisis  or of general instability engulfing or surrounding a state” (par. 7.75-7.76). Consequently  the situation between these two states could well be considered an emergency in international relations  justifying the restrictive measures adopted against Ukrainian goods pursuant to article XXI (b) (iii) of the GATT (par. 7.5.7; on the subject  see Neuwirth and Svetlicinii). According to the panelists  in fact  there was evidence that relations between Ukraine and the Russian Federation had deteriorated to the point of causing concern for the entire international community  in light of the recognition of the situation by the United Nations General Assembly and the protests and unilateral measures adopted by numerous governments.In light of the previous – albeit sparse – case law related to the security exception  a first assessment of the coercive measures implemented against the Russian Federation and Belarus in February / March 2022 can therefore be proposed. First of all  there seems to be no doubt about the fact that the current conflict can be considered a situation of “war or emergency in international relations” which makes art. XXI – and the relevant provisions contained in the other agreements – and consequently possible the non -applicationof the WTO rules by Ukraine vis-à-vis the Russian Federation. However  it has to be ascertained whether the Ukrainian state can also disregard the obligations arising from agreements that are not strictly “commercial”: the Ukrainian diplomatic note  in fact  speaks in a generic way of “WTO Agreements”  also including other annexes to the WTO Agreement  such as the DSU and the Agreement relating to periodic review of commercial policies. The exception clauses for security reasons  on the other hand  refer exclusively to the obligations present in the agreements in which they are contained and could therefore be invoked only in reference to obligations under the GATT  GATS and TRIPS. This circumstance was underlined by the Russian Federation itself in its diplomatic reply note.Secondly  in relation to the measures implemented by third countries  such as Canada  and by the European Union  it seems that the exception clause can still apply: the text of art. XXI of the GATT  in fact  does not contain any reference to emergency situations that directly involve the State invoking the exception  but refers to generic “essential interests” of security  which  in the opinion of the writer  may well include compliance the principle of the prohibition of using force in international relations  the safeguarding of the territorial integrity and political independence of other States and the obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Nor do the cited clauses limit their scope of application to purely national situations: for example  letter (c) of art. XXI of the GATT makes a clear reference to the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations related to the maintenance of international peace and security  allowing WTO Members to disregard ex GATT obligations in order to implement the coercive measures decided by the Security Council on the basis of articles 39 and 41 of the Charter (pp. 622-623). Based on these considerations  the suspension of commercial obligations would also be allowed by countries not directly involved in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.Finally  however  it should be remembered that the predominant interpretation of the exceptions in question recognizes the power of states to self-determine  in a completely subjective way  which situations jeopardize their national security and what actions are necessary to deal with this emergency. Consequently  this assessment is beyond the control of any bodies responsible for establishing the legitimacy of such measures in the framework of the WTO dispute settlement system (see the aforementioned Russian – Measures Concerning Traffic in Transit decision  para. 7.102-7.103). However  the invocation of art. XXI (b) of the GATT is not completely non-justiciable: the paneland the eventual WTO Appellate Body will in any case have to assess that the appeal to the exception is made in good faith (more fully  see Schill and Briese  pp. 106-110).The art. XXI of the GATT and the “sister” provisions contained in the other WTO agreements  therefore  could offer a certain margin of maneuver to justifycoercive measures of a unilateral nature which in principle would be prohibited by the DSU and contrary to various provisions of the WTO agreements: it will be It is clearly necessary to objectively demonstrate the existence of an exceptional situation for international relations and  furthermore  that the measure was undertaken reasonably and without abuses. If not  there appears to be no justification in the WTO special regime for such measures. Certainly  the Organization’s dispute resolution system may soon have to confront this issue again  by virtue of the many measures adopted against the Russian Federation and  to a lesser extent  Belarus  by other states in response to the conflict.,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,negative,0.01,0.09,0.9,True,English,"['Extraterritorial Coercive Economic Measures', 'International Trade Law', 'Legality', 'Russia', 'Lens', 'final year BA LLB candidate', 'Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommuni', 'United Nations Security Council', 'UN International Law Commission', 'Jindal Global Law School', 'United Nations General Assembly', 'United Nations Charter', 'Dr. Aniruddha Rajput', 'major engineering sectors', 'easy merchant routes', 'previous Soviet recognition', 'global supply chains', 'numerous metal alloys', 'numerous unilateral measures', 'Russian central bank', 'The Russian Federation', 'World Trade Organization', 'Russian military intervention', 'consequent trade restrictions', 'Economic Coercive Measures', 'financial markets', 'global trade', 'global repercussions', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'numerous unknowns', 'general increase', 'Director General', 'military forces', 'economic strength', 'economic resources', 'bank deposits', 'bank credit', 'Russian flag', 'Russian government', 'Russian state', 'main Russian', 'Research Assistant', 'heavy toll', 'missing persons', 'displaced persons', 'neighboring countries', 'humanitarian issues', 'other scholars', 'negative implications', 'world economy', 'nuclear escalationhave', 'multinational companies', 'capital markets', 'national economies', 'obvious effect', 'raw materials', 'main exporters', 'strong rise', 'natural gas', 'Eastern Europe', 'grain shipments', 'Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala', 'recent statement', 'significant impacts', 'commercial companies', 'Ukrainian ports', 'Azov seas', 'Montreaux Convention', 'particular warships', 'European Union', 'other countries', 'reciprocal measures', 'foregone paralysis', 'minded states', 'South Korea', 'heavy mobilization', 'blatant violation', 'separatist republics', 'Belarusian nationality', 'Lukashenko regime', 'defense sector', 'commercial measures', 'dual use', 'Belarusian banks', 'SWIFT system', 'Ahan Gadkari', 'geopolitical instability', 'energy prices', 'current price', 'Russian-Ukrainian conflict', 'Member', 'Introduction', 'Ukraine', 'day', 'intensity', 'terms', 'victims', 'refuge', 'piecewill', 'qualification', 'light', 'contributions', 'example', 'Spagnolo', 'Favuzza', 'Fasciglione', 'risk', 'fact', 'first', 'food', 'hydrocarbons', 'aluminum', 'titanium', 'nickel', 'palladium', 'chemical', 'pharmaceutical', 'quarter', 'wheat', 'tensions', 'costs', 'bread', 'pasta', 'gravity', 'situation', 'WTO', 'effects', 'closure', 'navigationin', 'Black', 'theaters', 'transit', 'Bosphorus', 'Turkey', 'intention', 'provisions', 'Dardanelles', 'decisions', 'airspace', 'aircraft', 'condemnation', 'resolution', '2 March', 'territory', 'borders', 'Several', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'Singapore', 'America', 'Switzerland', 'others', 'troops', 'employment', 'reaction', 'Art.', 'Luhansk', 'Donetsk', 'sanctions', 'subjects', 'entities', 'complicity', 'conduct', 'Question', 'freezing', 'assets', 'individuals', 'limit', 'access', 'prohibition', 'bargaining', 'industries', 'imposition', 'duties', 'withdrawal', 'concessions', 'blocking', 'exports', 'arms', 'products', 'systems', 'technologies', 'operation', 'disconnection', 'acronym', 'Society']",2022-09-13,2022-09-13,opiniojuris.org

War  geopolitical instability  the risk of a nuclear escalationhave in fact introduced numerous unknowns for global trade  for multinational companies  for capital markets and for national economies themselves.Economically  the first and perhaps most obvious effect of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was a general increase in the prices of raw materials and food. The Russian Federation is among the main exporters of hydrocarbons  as well as of numerous metal alloys (such as aluminum  titanium  nickel and palladium) essential for the steel  chemical and petrochemical  pharmaceutical and major engineering sectors. The instability generated by the conflict and the consequent trade restrictions have caused a very strong rise in energy prices  as evidenced by the current price of natural gas  which has practically doubled compared to a year ago. Taken together  moreover  the Russian Federation and Ukraine account for over a quarter of the world trade in wheat: tensions in Eastern Europe threaten to curb grain shipments around the world  increasing the costs of producing bread and pasta. The gravity of the situation was underlined by the Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala  in a recent statement.The effects of the conflict are also having significant impacts on global supply chains: commercial companies are struggling to find easy merchant routes  with the closure of Ukrainian ports  the risks for navigationin the Black and Azov seas  theaters of the conflict  and restrictions on transit in the Bosphorus  where Turkey has already announced its intention to implement the provisions of the Montreaux Convention that allow it to restrict navigation  in particular warships  through the Dardanelles. Following the decisions of the European Union  the United States and other countries to close their airspace to aircraft flying the Russian flag – and the reciprocal measures adopted by the Russian government – trade is further restricted also by air.If the effects of the conflict have and will have global repercussions  the “price” that the Russian Federation risks paying could be very high. The condemnation of the conflict  in the foregone paralysis of the United Nations Security Council  came almost unanimously from the United Nations General Assembly which  with a resolution adopted on 2 March last  requested the Russian Federation to “immediately  completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders”. Several like-minded states(including Australia  Canada  South Korea  Japan  United Kingdom  Singapore  United States of America  Switzerland  among others) and the European Union have responded to the heavy mobilization of troops with employment of all its economic strength  implementing numerous unilateral measures – but certainly “agreed” – in reaction to the blatant violation of Art. 2.4 of the United Nations Charter  and the previous Soviet recognition of the separatist republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. Many of these coercive measures(commonly – and improperly – known as “sanctions”) have also been extended to subjects and entities of Belarusian nationality  due to the complicity of the Lukashenko regime in military intervention alongside the Russian Federation. Clearly  these measures are aimed at isolating the Russian state and evaporating the economic resources necessary for the conduct of the war.Economic Coercive Measures in QuestionThe measures adopted include the freezing of assets of individuals and commercial companies  the limit on bank deposits and access to bank credit  the prohibition of bargaining for industries operating in the defense sector  the imposition of duties  restrictions on the access to the market and commercial measures such as the withdrawal of concessions and the blocking of exports (of arms  first of all  together with products  systems and technologies susceptible of so-called dual use). The assets of the Russian central bank in the territory of the EU and the United States have been blocked  as have those of the main Russian and Belarusian banks  whose “operation” was severely limited by disconnection from the SWIFT system (acronym for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)  which made payments of a transnational nature connected to trade and financial activities substantially more complex  articulated and lengthy. In total  some 700 people and 60 entities are now subject to sanctions  including President Putin  ministers and senior officials of the Russian administrative apparatus  351 deputies of the Duma and well-known personalities of the Russian financial elite  including billionaires Alexei Mordashov  Vladimir Lisin and Alisher Usmanov  considered to be very close to the Russian President  whose assets have also been subject to seizure orders in Italy. These measures  which are already quite incisive in themselves  have been accompanied by provisions that impose a ban on the stay and movement of affected individuals on the territory of the states that impose the sanction (travel ban) and blockades of air and naval traffic. In addition  the main international clearing systems  Euroclear and Clearstream  have decided to refuse transactions in rubles  as well as several commercial banks have temporarily suspended the sale and purchase of the currency  the value of which has fallen by more than 40%. Other global financial players  such as major payment and credit card networks  have suspended their operations in Russia and Belarus. Many multinational companies  including the so-called big-tech  have suspended sales of their products and services in Russia.International InstrumentsAll the instruments listed (without any claim to be exhaustive) have been adopted unilaterally by the States and by the European Union or voluntarily by private subjects. As regards the measures adopted by the States and the Union  it should be emphasized that these coercive measures were implemented in the absence of a decision by the United Nations Security Council pursuant to art. 41 of the United Nations Charter which  as is well known  allows for the adoption of measures not involving the use of force when one of the situations envisaged by art. 39 of the United Nations Charter. The legitimacyof the countermeasures adopted by States not particularly harmed by an international offense is still today the subject of a wide debate on the level of general international law (on this point  it is permissible to refer to the considerations of Gadkari and Chowksey regarding the sanctions on Russia’s sovereign debt market; De Sena and Gradoni regarding the measures adopted in 2014 in the to the Russian Federation and  more generally  to the studies of Asada; Dawidowicz; Hofer; Silingardi; Sossai; Tzanakopoulos; and Ronzitti). However  it is clear that some measures can be framed in specific regulatory regimes: in particular  this practice appears questionable in the light of international trade law.The tools most often used by governments for sanctions include embargoes  boycotts or the imposition of quantitative restrictions on trade  as well as the creation of non-tariff barriers  such as prescribing specific licensing or packaging requirements. Such measures could violate various clauses of the WTO agreements  in particular the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services(GATS)  whose founding principles are reciprocity and non-discrimination in commercial relations  the latter expressed by the well-known standardsof national treatment and most favoured nation(MFN). In particular  Article I  paragraph 1  of the GATT (as well as Article II of the GATS) provides for equal treatment with respect to similar products originating in or destined for the territories of all the other Contracting Parties: some countries  such as Canada  have already withdrawn this privilege with regard to goods from the Russian Federation and Belarus  while legislative proposals to this effect have been introduced at the US Congress. On 15 March 2022  the President of the European Commission announced that this measure will also be implemented by the European Union and its Members within the framework of the World Trade Organization.As a result of these decisions  goods and services from the Russian Federation could incur much higher tariffs. Furthermore  the unilateral measures implemented so far have established quantitative restrictions on the export of various categories of goods  which could constitute a violation of art. IX of the GATT  which prescribes the elimination of the so-called quotas  as well as the limitations imposed on air  sea and land transport could result in a violation of the rule that requires the free transit of goods and services in the territories of the Contracting Parties (art. V GATT). In addition  it should be noted that art. 23 of the Understanding on Dispute Settlement (DSU) prohibits the use of unilateral self-helpmeasures  establishing the obligation to resort to the dispute resolution system provided for by the Agreement: this interpretation has been confirmed by various panels  including those set up in cases US-Shrimp (par. 7.43) and Canada – Aircraft Credits and Guarantees (par. 7.170)  which have clearly identified as “prohibited” the measures taken individually by States outside the procedural framework managed by the Dispute Settlement Body. These and other provisions  therefore  would render illegitimate any unilateral coercive measure of a commercial nature adopted by one Member State against another.However  the WTO agreements also include clauses of exception to the general regime of trade liberalization  allowing that – in the presence of specific requirements – Member States can adopt measures that have the effect of restricting commercial traffic in order to protect values and non-economic needs. Specifically  while art. XX of the GATT (and art. XIV of the GATS) outline a series of general exceptions (see Espa  pp. 193-228; Mauro  pp. 159-162)  art. XXI of the GATT and XIVbis of the GATS (as well as Article 73 of the agreement relating to the Trade Related Aspects of International Property Rights – TRIPS) instead offer the opportunity to use measures based on essential security needs. Such clauses have very rarely been invoked in WTO practice (see Mavroidis  Bermann  Wu  pp. 684-786).As dictated by the letter of art. XXI of the GATT  however  this security exception is directly linked to the objectives of peace protection and maintenance of international security professed by the United Nations Charter  as well as letter (b) of the same provision prescribes that such measures can be decided in period of war or emergency in international relations. By invoking this provision  Ukraine has decided to apply a full embargo to products originating from the Russian Federation and not to apply the WTO agreements with the same state  as summarized in a letter addressed to the Chairmanof the General Council of the WTO. It is questionable  however  whether the coercive measures adopted by Ukraine and other states against the Russian Federation and Belarus are legitimate and therefore can fall within the exception clause.WTO JurisprudenceTwo recent cases in the WTO may come in support  as the use of unilateral economic measures was specifically considered in them. In 2017  Qatar had resorted to the WTO dispute settlement body because of the actions of four states – Bahrain  Egypt  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – arguing that the coercive economic measures taken by those states constituted a violation of the Organization’s rules  impeding the freedom of transit of goods and frustrating most of the commercial exchanges between the two countries. However  although the panelestablished in the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia had recognized the existence of a state of “tension” and the breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two countries  in the decision only some measures adopted by the Saudi government had been deemed justified by security reasons: rather surprisingly  however  there was no elaboration or analysis in the report about the nature of the emergency situationthat would have justified trade restrictive measures (see Saudi Arabia – Measures Concerning The Protection Of Intellectual Property Rights  par. 7.257; on the subject  see Glöckle). A previous case between Ukraine and Russia  opened in 2016  instead resulted in a decision in 2019 that provides a more complete interpretation of the security exception under Article XXI (see Russia – Measures Concerning Traffic In Transit; in subject  see Adinolfi and Marotti; Voon). As is well known  the dispute arose following the serious deterioration of relations between the two countries in February 2014  a situation that had led the Russian Federation to limit the transit through its territory of Ukrainian goods destined for Central Asian markets. Ukraine had challenged these restrictions before the WTO bodies as contrary to Article V of the GATT as well as to various trade commitments under the Protocol of Accession of the Russian Federation to the Organization. Russia replied by invoking Article XXI (b) (iii) of the GATT  which as mentioned provides that a member of the WTO can take any action “which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations”. The panelthen considered that Russia had satisfied the requirements to invoke the exception and had interpreted the requirement of emergency in international relations as a “situation of armed conflict  or of latent armed conflict  or of heightened tension or crisis  or of general instability engulfing or surrounding a state” (par. 7.75-7.76). Consequently  the situation between these two states could well be considered an emergency in international relations  justifying the restrictive measures adopted against Ukrainian goods pursuant to article XXI (b) (iii) of the GATT (par. 7.5.7; on the subject  see Neuwirth and Svetlicinii). According to the panelists  in fact  there was evidence that relations between Ukraine and the Russian Federation had deteriorated to the point of causing concern for the entire international community  in light of the recognition of the situation by the United Nations General Assembly and the protests and unilateral measures adopted by numerous governments.In light of the previous – albeit sparse – case law related to the security exception  a first assessment of the coercive measures implemented against the Russian Federation and Belarus in February / March 2022 can therefore be proposed. First of all  there seems to be no doubt about the fact that the current conflict can be considered a situation of “war or emergency in international relations” which makes art. XXI – and the relevant provisions contained in the other agreements – and consequently possible the non -applicationof the WTO rules by Ukraine vis-à-vis the Russian Federation. However  it has to be ascertained whether the Ukrainian state can also disregard the obligations arising from agreements that are not strictly “commercial”: the Ukrainian diplomatic note  in fact  speaks in a generic way of “WTO Agreements”  also including other annexes to the WTO Agreement  such as the DSU and the Agreement relating to periodic review of commercial policies. The exception clauses for security reasons  on the other hand  refer exclusively to the obligations present in the agreements in which they are contained and could therefore be invoked only in reference to obligations under the GATT  GATS and TRIPS. This circumstance was underlined by the Russian Federation itself in its diplomatic reply note.Secondly  in relation to the measures implemented by third countries  such as Canada  and by the European Union  it seems that the exception clause can still apply: the text of art. XXI of the GATT  in fact  does not contain any reference to emergency situations that directly involve the State invoking the exception  but refers to generic “essential interests” of security  which  in the opinion of the writer  may well include compliance the principle of the prohibition of using force in international relations  the safeguarding of the territorial integrity and political independence of other States and the obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Nor do the cited clauses limit their scope of application to purely national situations: for example  letter (c) of art. XXI of the GATT makes a clear reference to the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations related to the maintenance of international peace and security  allowing WTO Members to disregard ex GATT obligations in order to implement the coercive measures decided by the Security Council on the basis of articles 39 and 41 of the Charter (pp. 622-623). Based on these considerations  the suspension of commercial obligations would also be allowed by countries not directly involved in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.Finally  however  it should be remembered that the predominant interpretation of the exceptions in question recognizes the power of states to self-determine  in a completely subjective way  which situations jeopardize their national security and what actions are necessary to deal with this emergency. Consequently  this assessment is beyond the control of any bodies responsible for establishing the legitimacy of such measures in the framework of the WTO dispute settlement system (see the aforementioned Russian – Measures Concerning Traffic in Transit decision  para. 7.102-7.103). However  the invocation of art. XXI (b) of the GATT is not completely non-justiciable: the paneland the eventual WTO Appellate Body will in any case have to assess that the appeal to the exception is made in good faith (more fully  see Schill and Briese  pp. 106-110).The art. XXI of the GATT and the “sister” provisions contained in the other WTO agreements  therefore  could offer a certain margin of maneuver to justifycoercive measures of a unilateral nature which in principle would be prohibited by the DSU and contrary to various provisions of the WTO agreements: it will be It is clearly necessary to objectively demonstrate the existence of an exceptional situation for international relations and  furthermore  that the measure was undertaken reasonably and without abuses. If not  there appears to be no justification in the WTO special regime for such measures. Certainly  the Organization’s dispute resolution system may soon have to confront this issue again  by virtue of the many measures adopted against the Russian Federation and  to a lesser extent  Belarus  by other states in response to the conflict.,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,negative,0.01,0.09,0.9,True,English,"['Extraterritorial Coercive Economic Measures', 'International Trade Law', 'Legality', 'Russia', 'Lens', 'final year BA LLB candidate', 'Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommuni', 'United Nations Security Council', 'UN International Law Commission', 'Jindal Global Law School', 'United Nations General Assembly', 'United Nations Charter', 'Dr. Aniruddha Rajput', 'major engineering sectors', 'easy merchant routes', 'previous Soviet recognition', 'global supply chains', 'numerous metal alloys', 'numerous unilateral measures', 'Russian central bank', 'The Russian Federation', 'World Trade Organization', 'Russian military intervention', 'consequent trade restrictions', 'Economic Coercive Measures', 'financial markets', 'global trade', 'global repercussions', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'numerous unknowns', 'general increase', 'Director General', 'military forces', 'economic strength', 'economic resources', 'bank deposits', 'bank credit', 'Russian flag', 'Russian government', 'Russian state', 'main Russian', 'Research Assistant', 'heavy toll', 'missing persons', 'displaced persons', 'neighboring countries', 'humanitarian issues', 'other scholars', 'negative implications', 'world economy', 'nuclear escalationhave', 'multinational companies', 'capital markets', 'national economies', 'obvious effect', 'raw materials', 'main exporters', 'strong rise', 'natural gas', 'Eastern Europe', 'grain shipments', 'Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala', 'recent statement', 'significant impacts', 'commercial companies', 'Ukrainian ports', 'Azov seas', 'Montreaux Convention', 'particular warships', 'European Union', 'other countries', 'reciprocal measures', 'foregone paralysis', 'minded states', 'South Korea', 'heavy mobilization', 'blatant violation', 'separatist republics', 'Belarusian nationality', 'Lukashenko regime', 'defense sector', 'commercial measures', 'dual use', 'Belarusian banks', 'SWIFT system', 'Ahan Gadkari', 'geopolitical instability', 'energy prices', 'current price', 'Russian-Ukrainian conflict', 'Member', 'Introduction', 'Ukraine', 'day', 'intensity', 'terms', 'victims', 'refuge', 'piecewill', 'qualification', 'light', 'contributions', 'example', 'Spagnolo', 'Favuzza', 'Fasciglione', 'risk', 'fact', 'first', 'food', 'hydrocarbons', 'aluminum', 'titanium', 'nickel', 'palladium', 'chemical', 'pharmaceutical', 'quarter', 'wheat', 'tensions', 'costs', 'bread', 'pasta', 'gravity', 'situation', 'WTO', 'effects', 'closure', 'navigationin', 'Black', 'theaters', 'transit', 'Bosphorus', 'Turkey', 'intention', 'provisions', 'Dardanelles', 'decisions', 'airspace', 'aircraft', 'condemnation', 'resolution', '2 March', 'territory', 'borders', 'Several', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'Singapore', 'America', 'Switzerland', 'others', 'troops', 'employment', 'reaction', 'Art.', 'Luhansk', 'Donetsk', 'sanctions', 'subjects', 'entities', 'complicity', 'conduct', 'Question', 'freezing', 'assets', 'individuals', 'limit', 'access', 'prohibition', 'bargaining', 'industries', 'imposition', 'duties', 'withdrawal', 'concessions', 'blocking', 'exports', 'arms', 'products', 'systems', 'technologies', 'operation', 'disconnection', 'acronym', 'Society']",2022-09-13,2022-09-13,opiniojuris.org

In an updated analysis the outlook has been augmented to ‘Positive’ from ‘Stable’ “SCOPE’s renewed rating results mirror our solid business model  our profound risk management activities and our consistent financing policy  which we have pursued since 2016 with a clear focus on stable long-term balance sheet ratios”  welcomes Dr Christoph Husmann  CFO of Encavis AG  the upgraded outlook from ‘Stable’ to ‘Positive’. “Encavis’ excellent credit metrics derive from the very good financial performance of the Group and provides us with an increasing range of finance options to secure continuously reduced financing costs”  Husmann added. The European Rating agency SCOPE has affirmed the long-term ratings for senior unsecured debt at BBB-  subordinated (hybrid) debt at BB and short-term debt at S-2. Significant strengthening in credit metrics paired with the company’s gradually improving geographical diversification and granularity of the own portfolio drive the outlook change to Positive from Stable. Encavis BBB- rating primarily reflects the company’s largely protected position as an independent power producer (IPP) with own generation portfolio that comprises about 2.0 GW in more than 200 renewable power plants. SCOPE believes that Encavis will be able to retain a strong margin  e.g. an EBITDA margin of above 70%  and solid cash flow conversion. SCOPE believes that Encavis’ business model is broadly protected from the exposure to low power prices through prioritised feed-in of generated electricity under availability-based remuneration schemes and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with creditworthy counterparties. At the same time  it benefits from very high power prices through subsidised projects in Germany and the Netherlands  where feed-in tariff represents a floor price with upside potential  should market prices exceed subsidised prices as well as through exposure to merchant volumes (max. 5% of total). SCOPE has the opinion that the current high inflation in Europe does not have a significant impact on Encavis’ business activities at present. As Encavis has avoided best-effort supply agreements  the disruption of global supply chains has not yet affected the operation or completion of wind and solar parks. Despite recent interest rate increases and further potential interest rate hikes  market rates remain below average of the Encavis’ debt portfolio  which enables the Company to refinance its existing debt at improved conditions. The credit metrics are further supported by the conversion of the EUR 150m hybrid convertible into equity in October 2021 and the subsequent issuance of the new EUR 250m hybrid convertible in November 2021 (SCOPE accounts for 50% of this exposure as debt). Liquidity ratios are expected to stand comfortably above 110% in the foreseeable future  supported by a large unrestricted cash cushion of EUR 264m at the end of June 2022 and committed long-term credit lines of EUR 145m. SCOPE assumes that amortising loans on the project level (EUR 120-130m p.a.) can sufficiently be covered by operating cash flow of the project companies. This is also backed by a significant amount of cash reserves at the project SPVs. SCOPE maintains its neutral view of Encavis’ financial policy  which the agency believes will help the company to balance expansion with maintaining the quality of its financial risk profile. This is evidenced by the company’s funding measures  such as the use of equity-like financing instruments  the flexible dividend policy going forward  the wide use of financial covenants and cash reserves at project level as well as a minimum equity ratio of 24% (31.2% on June 30st  2022). A rating upgrade could be warranted if Encavis maintained EBITDA interest coverage above 4.0x on a sustained basis  together with further improvements in the geographical diversification with focus on jurisdictions with relatively stable regulatory environments and granularity of the own portfolio.

It occurs mostly in people over the age of 50.GNS561 (ezurpimtrostat) is a PPT-1 (Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase-1) inhibitor that blocks autophagy. Autophagy is activated in tumor cells in response to certain conditions  due to a tumor cell growth in advanced cancers. GNS561 has completed pre-clinical studies and a Phase 1b trial confirming the rationale for targeting cholangiocarcinoma. A Phase 2 trial is expected to start in the fourth quarter 2022  with a first patient visit expected in the first quarter 2023.Dr Mark Yarchoan  Associate Professor of Oncology at John Hopkins Medicine (Baltimore  MD) commented: “Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer with a high mortality rate. Patients have limited treatment options  particularly following first line therapy. This is why new therapies are urgently needed and is one of the reasons that GNS561 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. There is a real path forward for new options for second line treatment in cholangiocarcinoma  and GNS561 represents a strong second-line therapy candidate and hope to patients.”ABOUT GNS561GNS561 is a PPT-1 (Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase-1) inhibitor that blocks autophagy. Autophagy is activated in tumor cells in response to certain conditions  due to a tumor cell growth in advanced cancers. One of the key cellular organs implicated in the autophagy process is the lysosome. By entering the lysosomes and binding to its target  GNS561 has an important inhibiting activity on late-stage autophagy  which leads to tumor cell death.Story continuesABOUT CHOLANGIOCARCINOMACholangiocarcinoma is a type of cancer that forms in the slender tubes (bile ducts) that carry the digestive fluid bile. Cholangiocarcinoma occurs mostly in people over the age of 50. Cholangiocarcinoma is divided into intrahepatic and extrahepatic types based on where the disease occurs in the bile ducts. Cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed when it is advanced  making successful treatment difficult to achieve. Several risk factors of chronic inflammatory damage and increased cellular turnover have been established  such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (a cholestatic liver disease)  liver flukes  biliary tract cysts  hepatolithiasis and toxins. Treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma are limited and associated with high rates of tumor recurrence  and short survival times.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with severe chronic liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs. GENFIT is a pioneer in liver disease research and development with a rich history and strong scientific heritage spanning more than two decades.

In its cholestatic diseases franchise  ELATIVE™  a Phase 3 global trial evaluating elafibranor1 in patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is well underway following a successful Phase 2 clinical trial. Topline data is expected to be announced in the second quarter 2023. In 2021  GENFIT signed an exclusive licensing agreement with IPSEN to develop  manufacture and commercialize elafibranor in PBC and other indications. 2 GENFIT is also developing GNS5611 in cholangiocarcinoma following the acquisition of exclusive rights in this indication from Genoscience Pharma in 20213. In ACLF  a Phase 1 clinical program with nitazoxanide has been initiated with data expected as early as the third quarter 2022. As part of its diagnostic solutions franchise  the Company entered into an agreement with Labcorp in 2021 to commercialize NASHnext®  powered by GENFIT’s proprietary diagnostic technology NIS4® in identifying at-risk NASH.GENFIT has facilities in Lille and Paris  France  and Cambridge  MA  USA.

The Reeve Foundation looks forward to this technology advancing and  we hope  becoming widely available to our community.”“Our vision is to empower people with spinal cord injury to enjoy life in every way that matters to them. Today’s excellent results from the Up-LIFT study will help us transform that vision into reality”  said Dave Marver  ONWARD CEO. “Our team is working hard to prepare regulatory submissions and to get ready for launch in the U.S. and Europe. We are hopeful we can begin to positively impact the lives of people with spinal cord injury sometime during the second half of 2023.”“Restoring hand and arm function after spinal cord injury is life-changing  freeing people with paralysis to feed and care for themselves and be more independent in everyday activities ” said Chet Moritz  Ph.D.  study co-Principal Investigator (co-PI) and Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington.“We are grateful to the many therapists  clinicians  and people with SCI who participated in this landmark study. There was very low attrition over thousands of clinic visits  a testament to the collective enthusiasm for this compelling therapy and for everyone’s determination to find new treatment options for people with SCI ” added Edelle Field-Fote  PT  Ph.D.  FAPTA  FASIA  study co-PI  Director of SCI Research at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta  GA  and Professor at Emory University School of Medicine in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine.The Up-LIFT study is a prospective  single-arm pivotal study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of non-invasive electrical spinal cord stimulation (ARC-EX Therapy) to treat upper extremity functional deficits in people with chronic tetraplegia (paralysis of all four limbs). The study enrolled 65 people at 14 leading SCI centers in the U.S.  Europe  and Canada. Time since injury averaged 5.9 years (range 1 to 34 years) with an average subject age of 46.5 years. Detailed results will be made available after review by the FDA. The company plans to submit for regulatory approval in both the US and Europe within the next 6 months.Participants completed an average of 50 training sessions over a period of about 4 months. A series of comprehensive assessments were performed at baseline and monthly thereafter to detect changes in sensory and motor function of upper extremities that directly translate into improved functional performance in activities of daily living. Rigorous measures such as CUE-T  GRASSP  ISNCSCI iii and pinch and grasp force were used to detect clinically meaningful changes resulting from the combination of ONWARD ARC-EX Therapy with a standard of care rehabilitation. An independent data safety monitoring board adjudicated the safe conduct of the study.About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for a paraplegic (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for a tetraplegic (paralysis of all four limbs). Treatments are urgently needed to restore movement and improve quality of life.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries. ONWARD’s work builds on more than a decade of basic science and preclinical research conducted at the world’s leading neuroscience laboratories. ONWARD’s ARC Therapy  which can be delivered by implantable (ARC-IM) or external (ARC-EX) systems  is designed to deliver targeted  programmed spinal-cord stimulation to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury  ultimately improving their quality of life.ONWARD has received three Breakthrough Device Designations from the U.S. FDA encompassing both ARC-IM and ARC-EX.

The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety and the benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe. The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France. Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in Germany  the UK and the Netherlands.""We are very pleased to have successfully implanted the first patient in Italy with the Prima System as part of the expanding PRIMAvera pivotal study "" said Prof. Andrea Cusumano  co-investigator of the PRIMAvera study for Italy. ""We have been following the development of the Prima System since its inception and we have seen the significant promise it shows for those suffering from dry AMD  a disease for which we struggle to provide acceptable solution and hope to patients and their families. PRIMA's small size and wireless design means the implantation is a straightforward procedure which can be completed with minimal surgery. We will move ahead now with further implantations and we look forward to adding our efforts to the clinical assessment of this innovative technology.""Story continuesThe PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System.A total of 38 patients will be implanted in the PRIMAvera study  an open-label  baseline-controlled  non-randomized  multi-center  prospective  single-arm pivotal trial. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline to 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.The implantation of patients has been performed at five sites in France  four in Germany as well as the Moorfields Eye Hospital in the UK  the Rotterdam Eye Hospital in the Netherlands and Complesso Ospedaliero San Giovanni Addolorata in Italy. Pixium Vision anticipates recruitment will be completed by the end of 2022 leading to a read-out of the PRIMAvera study around the end of 2023.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

It occurs mostly in people over the age of 50.GNS561 (ezurpimtrostat) is a PPT-1 (Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase-1) inhibitor that blocks autophagy. Autophagy is activated in tumor cells in response to certain conditions  due to a tumor cell growth in advanced cancers. GNS561 has completed pre-clinical studies and a Phase 1b trial confirming the rationale for targeting cholangiocarcinoma. A Phase 2 trial is expected to start in the fourth quarter 2022  with a first patient visit expected in the first quarter 2023.Dr Mark Yarchoan  Associate Professor of Oncology at John Hopkins Medicine (Baltimore  MD) commented: “Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer with a high mortality rate. Patients have limited treatment options  particularly following first line therapy. This is why new therapies are urgently needed and is one of the reasons that GNS561 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. There is a real path forward for new options for second line treatment in cholangiocarcinoma  and GNS561 represents a strong second-line therapy candidate and hope to patients.”ABOUT GNS561GNS561 is a PPT-1 (Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase-1) inhibitor that blocks autophagy. Autophagy is activated in tumor cells in response to certain conditions  due to a tumor cell growth in advanced cancers. One of the key cellular organs implicated in the autophagy process is the lysosome. By entering the lysosomes and binding to its target  GNS561 has an important inhibiting activity on late-stage autophagy  which leads to tumor cell death.ABOUT CHOLANGIOCARCINOMACholangiocarcinoma is a type of cancer that forms in the slender tubes (bile ducts) that carry the digestive fluid bile. Cholangiocarcinoma occurs mostly in people over the age of 50. Cholangiocarcinoma is divided into intrahepatic and extrahepatic types based on where the disease occurs in the bile ducts. Cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed when it is advanced  making successful treatment difficult to achieve. Several risk factors of chronic inflammatory damage and increased cellular turnover have been established  such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (a cholestatic liver disease)  liver flukes  biliary tract cysts  hepatolithiasis and toxins.

For the record  during the 3rd quarter of the previous financial year  activity was still largely impacted in all geographies (reception gauges  curfew then health pass in France  closure in Belgium until 9th June  etc.) with the exception of Switzerland.At the same time  turnover for the 3rd quarter 2022 is impacted by significant scope effects representing - € 28.1 M in aggregate GGR compared to Q3 2021 (and - € 14.2 M versus 2019). They concern:the sale of the stake held in the Crans-Montana casino on 31 st January 2022 (GGR of € 2.2 M in the 3 rd quarter 2021 and € 3.0 M in the 3 rd quarter 2019);the cessation of the operation of online games and bets in Belgium and of the management of the Ostend casino since 29 th July 2021 (GGR of € 26.1 M in the 3 rd quarter 2021 and € 11.2 M in 3 rd quarter 2019);the entry into the Group of the casino of Middelkerke (Belgium) from 1st July 2022  with an opening on 8th July 2022 after some works (GGR of € 0.2 M in the 3rd quarter 2022).Despite these scope effects  Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) increases by +10.8% to € 167.9 M in the 3rd quarter  compared to € 151.5 M a year earlier. At constant scope  it increases by +36.1% compared to the 3rd quarter 2021 to € 167.6 M and by +11.9% compared to the 3rd quarter 2019.In France  GGR amounts to € 152.9 M  up +36.2% compared to N-1  with slot machines and traditional games growing by +29.8% and +67.3% respectively. The GGR of electronic games follows the same trend at +36.1%.Abroad  on a like-for-like basis  GGR rebounds by +35.2% compared to N-1  driven by the ramping up of Swiss online games  whose GGR came to € 2.9 M compared to € 1.6 M € in the 3rd quarter 2021.Story continuesAfter levies with a very strong increase of +75.3% compared to the 3rd quarter 2021 mainly due to the progressive scale in France (where the lower tax brackets applied)  the Net Gaming Revenue (NGR) is down at € 75.0 M (-23.8%).Turnover excluding games totals € 26.9 M over the period  compared to € 16.3 M for the previous year  up by +64.7%.Globally  3rd quarter turnover stands at € 100.9 M (-11.6% compared to 2021 and -3.8% compared to 2019). At constant scope  it increases by + 12.7 % versus 2021 and by +9.3% versus 2019.Return to 2019 level of activity over 9 months at constant scope and dynamic activityAt the end of July  aggregate income of the 9-month totals € 288.1 M (+78.6% compared to 2021)  with Net Gaming Revenue at € 228.4 M (+60.0%). Overall  at a constant scope  aggregate revenue for the first 9 months of 2022 financial year returns to its pre-Covid 2019 level (-0.4%).

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYFor the second consecutive month  August saw a recovery from the losses faced in Q2 2022 with the Ukrainian crisis. The fund gained +3.0%  mainly driven by CLO equity holdings.Through asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +1.5% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +4.6% for CLO equity tranches; +3.3% for CLO debt; -0.9% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.3% of NAV).In the footsteps of most markets the loan markets rallied again in August and therefore CLOs followed.In August  CLO trustee reports are showing again that CLO managers are  on average  able to build some par  reinvesting the few prepayments in loans at discounts. – true for CLOs in RP. When considering risk measures  August was relatively stable but when considering broader credit markets we started seeing more upgrades than downgrades. Some deterioration may come regarding CLO risk metrics in the coming months (higher CCC bucket for example) but we still expect such deterioration to be smooth.Very near the end of August we saw a few defaults materializing in the US loan market so that last-12-month default rate went from 0.3% at the end of July to 0.6% at the end of August. Knowing that the average annual historical default rate is in the area of 2.8%  we are still  for the time being  in a low default rate environment. At the end of August  the same measure was at 0.7% for European loans.Our view is still that we may see more defaults materializing next year and we expect a default rates for 2023 to reach something in the area of 2% for the US  3% for Europe. With this kind of default expectation the projected yield for Volta’s CLO book is slightly above 24% (based on the NAV; from the current share price we have a projected yield above 30%).Story continuesThe kind of deterioration we expect should not cause any meaningful diversion of cash flows: we expect Volta to receive full coupons from all its positions for the second half of 2022 and for 2023.In August  Volta received the equivalent of €1.5m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended July 2022  Volta received €24.8m interest and coupons representing a 21.1% annualized cash flow to NAV.During the month  Volta invested in a new CLO Equity in USD and participated in the warehouse attached to this position for a total of €2.7m equivalent. The projected IRR for this CLO Equity  incorporating the associated gain from the warehouse  is in the area of 17% IRR.For the coming weeks  Volta will participate in one European CLO warehouse with the intention to roll into the CLO equity at issuance. Our investment thesis is to be able to buy European loans at a discount in Q4 2022 at a point in time when we expect to see some pressure on European Loans: we may see some warehouse liquidations at this point (some of the warehouses opened in Q4 2021  that have been unable to transform into a CLO in due time) while the loan market will have to face a poor Q3 earning season.As at the end of August 2022  Volta’s NAV was €233.9m or €6.39 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.8% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 6.4% as at 30 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The KKR-led consortium is being advised by Barrenjoey and Credit Suisse.Ramsay  which is being advised by UBS and Goldman Sachs  said on Tuesday: “The correspondence also states that whilst the consortium recognises that further engagement and access to further due diligence may provide some positive visibility  the information provided in the FY22 results implies that there is meaningful downward pressure on the valuation proposed under the alternative proposal.”Ramsay said the board had not considered the latest letter  and there is no certainty that any further proposal will be forthcoming or that any proposal would result in a transaction.“Ramsay remains focused on its business  driving its strategy to be a leading integrated healthcare provider of the future and the creation of long-term value for shareholders ” it said in a statement.Sources said KKR’s decision was due ultimately to the full-year 2022 results and soft outlook. Due diligence was finalised some months ago except on the French assets.AdvertisementThe COVID-19 impacts on activity levels  costs  and profitability was apparent in the second half of fiscal 2022  and disruptions remain into the new year  mostly in the Australia/UK divisions.Wilsons analyst Shane Storey is expecting Ramsay to return to pre-COVID growth as the environment normalises in fiscal 2024  and Ramsay will continue to invest in brownfields and M & A across all three of its markets.One investment banker who is not involved noted that in such a transaction of this scale  the movement in interest rates and cap rates on the sale and lease back of the property portfolio would have had a material impact on the free cash flow  and hence the returns for KKR.Given the bankers involved have worked on this transaction for over a year  it would be difficult to believe a $30 billion deal hinges on one last quarter results of a prior financial year which was known to be heavily disrupted.Uniform decisionBut it is understood the decision from the consortium was uniform  all agreed it was not possible to increase the cash price of the amended offer to get it closer all cash indicative bid of $88 per share.AdvertisementUnder the cash/scrip offer  Ramsay investors would keep shares in the Euronext-listed French assets Ramsay Sante  of which Ramsay owns about 53 per cent. For each Ramsay share  investors with more than 5000 shares would receive $78.20 in cash and 0.22 Ramsay Sante shares.For the past six months  KKR has been unable to conduct due diligence on the French hospitals. This forced the consortium  which includes sovereign wealth and superannuation funds including HESTA  to pursue a new path.The other major shareholder in Sante is Predica  part of Credit Agricole  the second-biggest life insurer in France. KKR  along with co-investor Ardian  bought rival French hospital group Elsan from private equity company CVC Capital Partners in 2020.This was a big sticking point for the independent directors of Ramsay Sante  which operates 132 acute care and mental health facilities in France.The collapse of this KKR deal comes right after Ramsay called time on the possible sale of its joint venture in Asia to IHH Healthcare Berhad  on Friday walking from an indicative proposal that valued the group at $US1.35 billion ($1.83 billion).,neutral,0.03,0.57,0.41,mixed,0.07,0.14,0.79,True,English,"['The Australian Financial Review', 'cash increase', 'takeover talks', 'KKR', 'Ramsay', 'door', 'rival French hospital group Elsan', 'Wilsons analyst Shane Storey', 'leading integrated healthcare provider', 'one last quarter results', 'One investment banker', 'IHH Healthcare Berhad', 'brief trading halt', 'global PE firm', 'meaningful downward pressure', 'The COVID-19 impacts', 'past six months', 'other major shareholder', 'biggest life insurer', 'big sticking point', 'mental health facilities', 'Euronext-listed French assets', 'CVC Capital Partners', '$30 billion deal hinges', 'free cash flow', 'prior financial year', 'cash indicative bid', 'private equity company', 'The KKR-led consortium', 'first cash offer', 'French hospitals', '0.22 Ramsay Sante shares', 'FY22 results', 'full-year 2022 results', 'Adara Partners', 'revised deal', 'cash price', 'indicative proposal', 'two parties', 'Street Talk', '12 per cent', 'cash/scrip offer', 'Michael Siddle', 'Monday evening', 'Credit Suisse', 'Goldman Sachs', 'due diligence', 'positive visibility', 'long-term value', 'soft outlook', 'activity levels', 'second half', 'new year', 'Australia/UK divisions', 'pre-COVID growth', 'interest rates', 'cap rates', 'property portfolio', 'material impact', '53 per cent', 'sovereign wealth', 'superannuation funds', 'new path', 'Credit Agricole', 'investor Ardian', 'independent directors', '132 acute care', 'joint venture', 'alternative proposal', 'second proposal', 'Tuesday morning', 'latest letter', 'KKR deal', 'possible sale', 'Uniform decision', 'acceptable transaction', 'Ramsay investors', 'Ramsay share', 'Ramsay board', '5000 shares', 'Foundation', 'shareholders', 'agreement', 'announcement', 'talks', 'September', 'stake', 'market', 'discussions', 'mid-March', 'news', 'target', 'detail', 'Advertisement', '9pm', 'terms', 'position', 'valuation', 'Barrenjoey', 'UBS', 'correspondence', 'engagement', 'access', 'information', 'certainty', 'business', 'strategy', 'future', 'creation', 'statement', 'Sources', 'costs', 'profitability', 'fiscal 2022', 'disruptions', 'environment', 'brownfields', 'scale', 'movement', 'lease', 'returns', 'bankers', 'HESTA', 'Predica', 'France', 'collapse', 'time', 'Asia', 'Friday', '$88']",2022-09-13,2022-09-13,afr.com

Continued strength in leisure travel  the revival of business travel and an increase in international ...,"Western Australia’s largest hotel group  Accor  is experiencing sustained recovery in its Western Australia hotel  apartments and resorts network.Continued strength in leisure travel  the revival of business travel and an increase in international flights have prompted the resurgence of tourism  with positive forecasts for the remainder of the year.Accor operates 25 hotels and resorts across the state  employing more than 900 people.While the city hotels experienced a downturn during the two years of pandemic and border closures  the Group’s regional hotels in Western Australia bucked the trend  with their popularity continuing to rise.Accor’s Perth hotels had recovered to 66% occupancy by the end of June 2022  just five percentage points behind the corresponding month in 2019  while average rate exceeded the pre-pandemic level. It is forecast that Perth hotels could return to pre-pandemic levels by March 2023.Regional Western Australia attracted even higher average rates and an occupancy level of 65% in June 2022. The standout hotel was Pullman Bunker Bay Resort in the Margaret River region  which performed over 29% higher in June 2022 compared to June 2019.The continued strength of Accor hotels in regional resort destinations was complemented by sustained strength in mining areas  and forecasts remained positive for the 2022-23 year.“Our regional network was relatively well insulated during the pandemic because closed borders created high levels of intrastate demand  and now it is time for our city hotels to rebuild their market base ” said Sarah Derry  CEO of Accor Pacific.“The tourism industry will require government support for tourism generation and the establishment of new markets such as India  as it is unlikely that overseas markets like China are going to recover in the short-term. It is encouraging to see that Western Australia is outperforming other states in terms of rebuilding international demand  but the forecasts indicate that arrivals will still only be 59% (SOURCE: Tourism Australia) of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.""“We are encouraged by the initiatives of Federal and State governments to address skilled worker shortages by cutting red tape and making it easier for international workers to enter Australia and work for extended periods. AHA WA has estimated that the state has a shortage of some 15 000 positions in the hospitality sector and that has been impacted by the slow recovery of the foreign student sector.""“Addressing the skills and employment shortage in the tourism and hospitality sector has to be a key priority for government at all levels. We welcome the WA Government’s announcement of a $3.9 million campaign to train more local hospitality workers because while an immediate increase in skilled migration is required in the short term  a ‘grow your own’ strategy is to address the shortage in the longer term.""“Regional WA will continue to flourish  but as we reopen rooms in Perth  it will be important for the State Government to actively drive growth for its CBD businesses through attracting more major events and conferences to the city. Cities around Australia and the world are seeking major events because of their revenue generating potential and Perth will need to ensure it has a high visibility amongst potential events and conference organisers.""“We are fortunate that Perth and Western Australia offers such outstanding tourism and economic potential. It is a state of opportunity in every way  but with competition in the sector at its most fierce we are going to require a comprehensive and collaborative response if we are to rebuild the sector fully to pre-pandemic levels.”“We believe tourism in Western Australia has a strong future.”Since 2019  Accor has opened four new hotels (1 060 rooms) in Western Australia  including Mercure Perth on Hay (2022)  Novotel Perth Murray Street (2019)  The Adnate Perth – Art Series (2019) and ibis Styles East Perth (2019)  creating hundreds of new career opportunities in the state.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The main attraction for Tullow is Capricorn’s cash pile of more than $700 million (€691 million)  which would accelerate its own debt reduction  after seeing its net borrowings fall to $2.1 billion from $3 billion just over two years ago.Meanwhile  although global oil prices have been trending lower over the past three months amid concerns about the global economy  Brent crude oil  trading at about $93.50 a barrel  remains almost 20 per cent up so far this year.READ MORETullow’s departure from Euronext Dublin  however  has been a long time coming. The exit of Tullow’s founder Aidan Heavey four years ago and closure of the Dublin office in 2020 have followed a steady decline in trading in the stock here ever since Tullow moved its main stock market listing and domicile to London two decades ago.Now the only Irish thing that’s essentially left of the Africa-focused explorer is its name  taken from the Co Carlow town where it was founded in 1985.But even that’s on track to be ditched as soon as the Capricorn deal is cemented.,negative,0.35,0.18,0.47,negative,0.02,0.23,0.75,True,English,"['Tullow Oil', 'inevitable, goodbye', 'fellow London-listed Capricorn Energy', 'main stock market listing', 'other main exits', 'Co Carlow town', 'stock market investors', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'Brent crude oil', 'Irish stock market', 'global oil prices', 'past three months', 'past two years', 'founder Aidan Heavey', 'main attraction', 'three decades', 'Hibernia Reit', 'global economy', 'Irish thing', 'Capricorn deal', 'steady decline', 'Cyril Byrne', 'ongoing exodus', 'next month', 'recruitment firm', 'CPL Resources', 'major restructuring', 'cash pile', 'debt reduction', 'net borrowings', 'long time', 'Africa-focused explorer', 'Dublin office', 'Euronext Dublin', 'Tullow Oil', 'closure', 'trading', 'domicile', 'Photograph', 'companies', 'Monday', 'end', 'middle', 'Applegreen', 'departure', 'business', 'uncertainty', 'future', 'cusp', 'concerns', 'READ', 'name', 'track']",2022-09-13,2022-09-13,irishtimes.com

The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety and the benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe. The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France. Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in Germany  the UK and the Netherlands.""We are very pleased to have successfully implanted the first patient in Italy with the Prima System as part of the expanding PRIMAvera pivotal study "" said Prof. Andrea Cusumano  co-investigator of the PRIMAvera study for Italy. ""We have been following the development of the Prima System since its inception and we have seen the significant promise it shows for those suffering from dry AMD  a disease for which we struggle to provide acceptable solution and hope to patients and their families. PRIMA's small size and wireless design means the implantation is a straightforward procedure which can be completed with minimal surgery. We will move ahead now with further implantations and we look forward to adding our efforts to the clinical assessment of this innovative technology.""The PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System.A total of 38 patients will be implanted in the PRIMAvera study  an open-label  baseline-controlled  non-randomized  multi-center  prospective  single-arm pivotal trial. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline to 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.The implantation of patients has been performed at five sites in France  four in Germany as well as the Moorfields Eye Hospital in the UK  the Rotterdam Eye Hospital in the Netherlands and Complesso Ospedaliero San Giovanni Addolorata in Italy. Pixium Vision anticipates recruitment will be completed by the end of 2022 leading to a read-out of the PRIMAvera study around the end of 2023.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYFor the second consecutive month  August saw a recovery from the losses faced in Q2 2022 with the Ukrainian crisis. The fund gained +3.0%  mainly driven by CLO equity holdings.Through asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +1.5% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +4.6% for CLO equity tranches; +3.3% for CLO debt; -0.9% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.3% of NAV).In the footsteps of most markets the loan markets rallied again in August and therefore CLOs followed.In August  CLO trustee reports are showing again that CLO managers are  on average  able to build some par  reinvesting the few prepayments in loans at discounts. – true for CLOs in RP. When considering risk measures  August was relatively stable but when considering broader credit markets we started seeing more upgrades than downgrades. Some deterioration may come regarding CLO risk metrics in the coming months (higher CCC bucket for example) but we still expect such deterioration to be smooth.Very near the end of August we saw a few defaults materializing in the US loan market so that last-12-month default rate went from 0.3% at the end of July to 0.6% at the end of August. Knowing that the average annual historical default rate is in the area of 2.8%  we are still  for the time being  in a low default rate environment. At the end of August  the same measure was at 0.7% for European loans.Our view is still that we may see more defaults materializing next year and we expect a default rates for 2023 to reach something in the area of 2% for the US  3% for Europe. With this kind of default expectation the projected yield for Volta’s CLO book is slightly above 24% (based on the NAV; from the current share price we have a projected yield above 30%).The kind of deterioration we expect should not cause any meaningful diversion of cash flows: we expect Volta to receive full coupons from all its positions for the second half of 2022 and for 2023.In August  Volta received the equivalent of €1.5m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended July 2022  Volta received €24.8m interest and coupons representing a 21.1% annualized cash flow to NAV.During the month  Volta invested in a new CLO Equity in USD and participated in the warehouse attached to this position for a total of €2.7m equivalent. The projected IRR for this CLO Equity  incorporating the associated gain from the warehouse  is in the area of 17% IRR.For the coming weeks  Volta will participate in one European CLO warehouse with the intention to roll into the CLO equity at issuance. Our investment thesis is to be able to buy European loans at a discount in Q4 2022 at a point in time when we expect to see some pressure on European Loans: we may see some warehouse liquidations at this point (some of the warehouses opened in Q4 2021  that have been unable to transform into a CLO in due time) while the loan market will have to face a poor Q3 earning season.As at the end of August 2022  Volta’s NAV was €233.9m or €6.39 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.8% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 6.4% as at 30 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.
