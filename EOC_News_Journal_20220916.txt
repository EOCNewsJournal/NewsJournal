If the chairman of the Board of Directors is the CEO or another member of the Company's management  he or she may not be a part of the nomination committee. In such cases  another director shall replace the chairman of the Board of Directors in the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall meet the requirements of composition set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the ""Code""). If the larger shareholders who have the right to appoint members of the nomination committee wish to appoint persons with the consequence that the requirements of composition provided in the Code are not met  the first choice of the larger shareholder shall have precedence over a smaller shareholder. When appointing a new member  the shareholder who shall appoint the new member shall consider the composition of the current nomination committee in terms of the Code.Should any of the three largest shareholders abstain from their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the right to appoint a member shall pass to the next shareholder in line that does not already have the right to appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  the procedure shall only continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.The names of the members of the nomination committee and of the shareholders they represent shall normally be made public on the Company's website at the latest six months prior to the annual general meeting. At this convening  the nomination committee shall appoint a chair amongst its members. The mandate period of the nomination committee shall extend until the next nomination committee is appointed. Changes in the composition of the nomination committee shall be made public on the website of the Company as soon as they have occurred.If a change in the Company's ownership structure occurs after the last trading day in August but before the date which occurs six months ahead of the forthcoming annual general meeting  and if a shareholder  due to or after this change  becomes one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register of the Company or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the nomination committee  makes a request to the chair of the nomination committee to be part of the nomination committee  the shareholder shall have the right  in the discretion of the nomination committee  either to appoint an additional member of the nomination committee or to appoint a member who shall replace the member appointed by the shareholder representing the least number of votes in the nomination committee following the changes in the Company's ownership structure.A shareholder who has appointed a member of the nomination committee has the right to dismiss the member and appoint a new member. If such an exchange takes place  the shareholder shall without delay give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who shall be exchanged  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). The notification shall contain the name of the dismissed member and the person who shall replace him as member of the nomination committee.A member who prematurely resigns from his task shall give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who resigns  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). In such case  the nomination committee shall without delay call upon the shareholder who has appointed the member to appoint a new member. If a new member is not appointed by the shareholder  the nomination committee shall offer other larger shareholders with respect to votes  to appoint members of the nomination committee. Such offer shall be made in order of priority to the largest shareholders with respect to voting rights (that is  first to the largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so  thereafter to the second largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so etc.). The procedure shall continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.No remuneration is to be paid to members of the nomination committee. The company shall  however  defray all reasonable expenses that are required for the work of the nomination committee.ii) Instructions for the nomination committeeThe members of the nomination committee are to promote the common interests of all the shareholders of the Company and are not to reveal the content or details of any discussion held during the nomination committee meetings unduly. Each member of the nomination committee is to consider carefully whether there are any conflicts of interest or other circumstances that make their service on the nomination committee inappropriate before accepting the assignment to form part of the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Code and shall  when applicable  present proposals to an upcoming general meeting for:(a) the election of the chairman of the meeting;(b) the number of directors elected by the general meeting;(c) the election of the chairman and members of the Board of Directors;(d) the fees and other remuneration of elected members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the committees of the Board of Directors;(e) the election of the auditor(s);(f) the remuneration of the auditor(s); and(g) principles for the composition of the nomination committee including any changes to the instructions to the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall apply item 4.1 in the Code regarding the diversity policy  whereby the nomination committee shall take into account that the Board of Directors  with regard to the Company's operations  development stage and other conditions  shall have an appropriate composition  characterised by versatility in respect to the competence  experience  geographic coverage and background of the members elected a general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee shall work with the goal of achieving an even gender distribution on the Board of Directors.The nomination committee has the right  at the Company's reasonable expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task.Agenda item 8 : Resolution on the ESOPThe ESOP program in shortMGI has  through resolutions by the Board of Directors  in April 2020  January 2021 and February 2022 adopted an employee stock option program directed to approximately 50 key employees of MGI ("" ESOP ""). In order to facilitate the ESOP  MGI has resolved to grant to Bodhivas GmbH  which is owned by the largest shareholder of MGI ("" Bodhivas "") the right to subscribe for up to 15 million Ordinary A Shares. Under the ESOP  Bodhivas has corresponding obligations towards the participants to deliver Ordinary A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESOP (the right to receive Ordinary A Shares from Bodhivas is referred to as ""phantom stock""). Bodhivas has further (i) undertaken towards the participants to pay out the upside value between strike price and exercise value at the moment of exercise and to deliver this value either in Ordinary A Shares or in cash and (ii) undertaken towards MGI to manage the ESOP program and (iii) formally agreed that in relation to this ESOP program  any profit by Bodhivas is for the benefit of MGI and any loss incurred by Bodhivas is to be borne by MGI (i.e.  Bodhivas only facilitates the implementation of the ESOP program but does not have any economic interest in the ESOP program).Options under the ESOP can be exercised from May 1  2024  at the earliest  until December 31  2030. There are currently two different programs which differ primarily in terms of start date and strike price. The first started on May 1  2020 and has a strike price of EUR 1.30 (in total approx. 9.2m options). The second started on January 2021 and has a strike price of minimally EUR 2.60 (approx. 3.3m options). For employees participating in the second program but starting at a later date  the strike price is at a premium of 20% above the average share price of 10 trading days prior to the grant date  however always with a minimum of EUR 2.60. Both programs under the ESOP have an end date of December 31  2030.No employee has been granted more than 2 550 000 options under the ESOP. The options under the ESOP are subject to vesting periods  meaning that participants who leave their employment during the programs will lose any unvested shares. The vesting period to become entitled to 100% of the options is 60 months in total and occurs in several partial steps over the entire vesting period.If a participant in the program leaves the Company (voluntarily or due to termination by employer for breach by employee) within two years after the start date of the phantom stock program for this respective participant  all phantom stock is lost. If a participant in the program leaves after more than two years after the start of the phantom stock program the participant loses 50% of the two most recent years of vested phantom stock.The ESOP does not contain any performance criteria in addition to the strike price  due to MGI wanting to incentivize participants  encourage long-term shareholding in the company and local market practice in Malta and the jurisdictions where the group is active.The maximum cumulative amount of options which can be granted under the ESOP to existing and future participants (and consequently the maximum number of Ordinary A Shares which can be issued under the ESOP  except in the event of recalculation) is 15 000 000  of which approx. 12.5 million options have been granted. If all granted options under the ESOP were to be exercised  the dilution would be 7.28 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares) and if all options were to be granted and exercised  the dilution would be 8.61 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares).MGI has not had  and is not expected to have  any material (cash relevant) costs for the ESOP programs. For additional information on the ESOP  please also refer to MGI's annual reports.Following the relocation to Sweden  due to differences between Swedish and Maltese corporate law  the board of directors intends to exercise its authorization (as proposed under item 12 below) to issue warrants to Bodhivas  MGI or a group company in order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the ESOP. MGI may also require that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a MGI group company.The board of directors therefore proposes that the Meeting approves (i) the continuation of current ESOP after the relocation to Sweden  (ii) that MGI shall be entitled to grant Bodhivas or MGI or a group company of MGI the right to subscribe for warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares)  to (iii) entitle MGI to ensure that warrants or shares or the cash value can be delivered to the participants in the ESOP program on the same terms and conditions that now apply for the ESOP contracts with Bodhivas  (iv) entitle MGI to request that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a group company  and (v) entitle the Board of MGI to take all steps required to execute measures (i) - (iv).Approval of transfer of shares to participants in the ESOP programThe board of director proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the intended exercise of the authorisation to issue Ordinary A shares or warrants and that not more than 15 000 000 Ordinary A Shares or warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares) are transferred to existing and future participants in the ESOP program in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESOP.Agenda item 9: Approve the appointment of Deloitte Sweden AB as Auditors of the Company for FY 2023  effective from the date the Company's registration as a Swedish company (pursuant to agenda item 11 below)  and to authorize the Board of Directors to fix their remuneration.It is proposed that the registered accounting firm Deloitte Sweden AB is elected as Auditors of the Company for the period from the date of the Company's registration as a Swedish company (pursuant to agenda item 11 below) until the end of the 2023 annual general meeting. Deloitte Sweden AB has informed the Company that Deloitte Sweden AB will be the auditor in charge if the proposal is approved.It is proposed that auditor's fees shall be payable upon approval of their invoice.Agenda item 10: Extraordinary Resolution to approve the change in name of the Company from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE and to approve the new Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to effect this change.While preparing the relocation from Malta to Sweden the Company was notified that the relevant Swedish rules do not permit the registration of Media and Games Invest under its current name in Sweden due to the name being too generic.Based on that requirement  the Company wishes to change its name from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE in advance of the Proposed Transfer (as defined and described below in under item 11)  which name will also be retained after completion of the Proposed Transfer.The change in the name of the Company will require an amendment to the current memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the "" Current M&A "") to include the new name  which change will become effective once the amended memorandum and articles of association with the new name (the "" Interim M&A "") are filed with and registered by the Malta Business Registry following the Meeting.The Interim M&A (reflecting the limited amendments to the Current M&A for the purpose of the name change) are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's name be changed from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE; that the Current M&A be replaced by the Interim M&A to be adopted following this Meeting; and to authorize the Company Secretary and/or any one (1) Director of the Company to register a copy of the Interim M&A with the Malta Business Registry (the "" MBR "").Agenda item 11: Extraordinary resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon registration as a Swedish company.Following an evaluation by the Board of Directors and management of the Company  in light of Malta's grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in mid-2021  the Company believes that having the Company's registered office in Malta may result in an increased risk premium on the Company's shares and may preclude further investment from prospective investors.Given that the Company's core business is in North America and Continental Europe  and that its operations are not tied to Malta  the Board of Directors has chosen Sweden as the new registered office and headquarter of the Company. The Board of Director's decision was motivated by the fact that the Company; (i) has been listed in Sweden since 2020  (ii) is already familiar with the local capital markets  and (iii) has a very strong local network on the ground  as well as several operating subsidiaries and employees in Stockholm. Furthermore  a large part of the Company's shareholders hail from the Nordics and the Swedish regulatory framework is globally recognized. While MGI's listing structure currently covers three jurisdictions - Malta (registered office)  Germany (listing) and Sweden (listing) - the administrative complexity will be significantly reduced as a result of the relocation.Due to the above  the Board of Directors is proposing that the general meeting resolves that the Company transfers its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden (the "" Proposed Transfer "") pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (the ""SE Regulation"") and in terms of Article 6 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 386.17 - Transfer of Registered Office of a European Company (SE) Regulations (the "" Subsidiary Legislation "").To this end and in connection with the obligation set out under Article 8 of the SE Regulation  the Board of Directors has prepared and submitted a transfer proposal ("" Transfer Proposal "") and a transfer report (""Transfer Report"") to the MBR  which provide explanations of the legal and economic aspects of the Proposed Transfer  including a description of any implications for the Company's shareholders  creditors and employees as a result of the Proposed Transfer.Shareholders are hereby being notified of their right to examine the Transfer Proposal and the Transfer Report  copies of which are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/The Proposed Transfer will also require the substitution of the Interim M&A with new statutes of the Company (the "" New Statutes ""). The New Statutes are to enter into force following the Proposed Transfer and upon registration of MGI as a Swedish company.The New Statutes are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposed that the Meeting resolves on the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's transfer of its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden in terms of the SE Regulation and the Subsidiary Legislation be  and hereby is  approved; that the Transfer Proposal and Transfer Report be  and hereby are  approved; that the Interim M&A be replaced by the New Statutes upon the Company's registration as a Swedish company; and That the Board of MGI is entitled to do all that is required to execute the above measures and actions.Agenda item 12: Extraordinary Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to issue shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company.With reference to the proposal under item 11 for the re-domiciliation of the Company's registered office from Malta to Sweden. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that it would be beneficial for the Company for the Board of Directors to be authorised to (a) issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions and (b) restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue.The purpose of this authorization would be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolution:Without prejudice to the existing authorisation to the Board of Directors  in terms of article 3 of the Company's articles of association  to issue shares of any class  options which may be convertible into shares  and other rights and/or securities (by whatever name referred to) which may entitle the holder thereof to subscribe to shares in the Company  in each case up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company  which authorisation shall remain valid and in effect  to authorize the Board of Directors to - at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting of the Company - issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions  and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (i.e. have the right to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue) and in each case within the limits of the company's articles of association. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to enable the use of securities as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses (including for payments of earn-outs and other deferred payments)  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).(Swedish translation: […] att bemyndiga styrelsen att efter bytet av bolagets registrerade säte - vid ett eller flera tillfällen intill slutet av nästkommande årsstämma - emittera nya aktier  optioner  teckningsoptioner och konvertibler i bolaget  med eller utan bestämmelser om apport  kvittning eller andra villkor  och med eller utan avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt (dvs. en rättighet att inskränka eller begränsa företrädesrätten hos befintliga aktieägare med avseende på sådana emissioner) inom ramen för de gränser som sätts av bolagets bolagsordning.

Excerpts from the discussion:Do you think JPMorgan can include India's bond market in its global bond index this financial year? And  if it happens  do you think it will translate into a higher FII inflow?JPMorgan now looks more open to the possibility of including Indian government securities in its global bond index  given the fact that it has recently approached market participants and is seeking their opinion in this matter. There is a good possibility that if the market feedback on the inclusion of Indian bonds happens to be positive  JPMorgan may come up with an announcement in the next few months.What does that mean for the Indian g-sec yields? Well  the markets are somewhat already celebrating the possible inclusion (although this is not confirmed yet)  as g-secs have rallied ever since the news on this topic started flowing. The actual inclusion will certainly be a positive development  as it will widen the global investor participation over a period of time  especially from passive funds.Also read - This veteran wealth manager sees worst for banking sector over  expansion led by economic revival  rise in capex  retail credit push likelyHowever  there are some challenges too. The Indian debt market is comparatively less liquid than other global debt markets  and this may therefore limit the extent of participation by global investors. Also  it remains to be seen what allocation is assigned to Indian bonds in the JPMorgan global index. Besides  even the existing limits are not currently fully utilized  as global investors generally have a preference for Indian bonds that are listed on overseas clearing platforms (such as Euroclear)  where they do not have to worry about paying capital gains in India.But on the whole  the inclusion would be a positive  as it could change the perception of global investors towards the Indian bond markets over a period of time  besides providing some relief to bond yields.If Indian government bonds are eventually included in global bond index  what will be your strategy with the rupee against other currencies?A possible inclusion of Indian bonds in the JPMorgan global bond index could  to some extent  soften the blow that the strong US Dollar is having on Emerging Market currencies (including INR)  especially with the hawkish Fed looking set to hike the key policy rate further more aggressively.Over the past one year  India has lost $80 billion of forex reserves and the INR has depreciated 8 percent to the US Dollar. FPIs have been net sellers in both the Indian Equity and Debt markets in CY22. While the FPI flows into Indian equities appear to be turning the corner  the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JPMorgan global bond index could just be the trigger to reverse the FPI flow situation in the debt markets.The INR would certainly be a beneficiary of any such positive inflows  given the fact that it has borne the brunt of the FPI selling over the past one year. However  one cannot view this in isolation; a lot would depend on the strength of the US Dollar  the inflation roadmap in the US as well as in India  the Fed rate hikes  the RBI's rate hike stance and consequently the interest rate differential that India offers  as this would partly decide the sentiment of foreign investors towards Indian fixed income.Also read - This economist explains 3 reasons that may drive RBI to pause rate hikes after September meetHave you started taking positions in the IT space as it is 30 percent down from its record high levels?On a selective basis  we like a few IT companies  primarily the larger ones. On the other hand  among midcap IT  despite the correction  valuations still seem to be on the higher side vis-à-vis historical averages.On the positive side  the current deal flow seems alright  and the managements of IT companies remain optimistic on deal pipeline. The spending on cloud migration and digital adoption is expected to continue  as this is a longer cycle. Margins also have the potential to pick up as supply-side pressures have started easing and pricing environment also has the scope to improve.However  the expected economic slowdown will weigh on the pipeline as well as the deal flow  possibly with a lag of 3-6 months  which will reflect in management commentaries post Q2/Q3 results.Overall  we are therefore neutral on the IT sector. IT stocks have corrected  but from slightly euphoric valuations  which may not be the right benchmark to judge whether the sector has turned attractive from valuation perspective.After the recent run-up  do you see the Indian markets valuations as expensive? Also  why is India enjoying a premium compared to other emerging markets?The Indian equity market valuations are slightly on the higher side vis-à-vis the historical averages  with the Nifty one-year forward P/E at about 20x  which opens up the possibility of a correction – price correction or time correction – until earnings catch up with the valuations.However  the overall premium valuations of Indian markets versus other emerging markets are likely to sustain  owing to the superior earnings growth profile of Indian companies and the relatively faster economic growth of the country. Besides  domestic flows have been resilient  and from the FPI perspective  India remains an attractive destination  especially if some flows were to be get redirected from China.Are you gung-ho on the real estate space and cement sector?The Indian real estate sector has gone through a structural change over the past few years. The sector is better regulated today  and many large developers have climbed up the governance ladder  having learnt lessons from the previous real estate cycle. Financially  the sector is looking healthier  with no major balance sheet concerns among the large developers. The demand-supply dynamics have also improved with a steady pick-up in demand (on better affordability and benign interest rates) and a reduction in unsold inventories  especially for large developers. We are therefore constructive on Real Estate and ancillary sectors.Cement companies were impacted by higher energy and freight costs which led to pressure on margins  despite a gradual improvement in realisations. In the very near-term  margin pressures could continue while the full impact of cost inflation plays out.Cement prices have started trending up in September after a sharp correction in July/August  which coupled with a decline in petcoke prices over the past few months  should help margins recover. Demand is expected to be resilient post monsoon  although we need to watch for the effect of inflation on rural demand  while the overall thrust on infrastructure spending should also spur demand over the medium term. Supply side should also see better discipline with some more consolidation expected in the industry. The overall outlook on this sector is looking positive.Do you think profit-to-GDP ratio has further scope to expand faster in coming quarters?Historically  Nifty’s profit-to-GDP ratio has averaged around 4.5 percent – 5 percent  with highs of around 8 percent  and this came down to sub 3 percent in recent years due to weak corporate performance. Since the past couple of years  however  the ratio has been trending up (moving closer to 4.5 percent)  with corporate profitability growing faster than nominal GDP growth.There is room for this ratio to inch up a bit further on expectations of the corporate profit growth to continue to outpace the nominal GDP growth. The key drivers for the improvement of the ratio are (i) the shift from unorganised to organised  and larger companies getting incremental market share  (ii) the overall expected improvement in operating leverage (and consequently profitability) and (iii) improving prospects for exports  especially with manufacturing activity in Europe seeing some challenges on account of rising energy costs  apart from the China+1 opportunity.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Artprice by Artmarket.comIn the context of a serious global energy crisis (probably only just beginning)  Artmarket.com has been closely watching the transition to a totally carbon-free blockchain. This is now a reality with Ethereum 2.0 after its ""The Merge"" operation. Indeed  according to its founder  Vitalik Buterin  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests  ""The Merge"" – a switch from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS) – will reduce the energy consumption of the ETH Blockchain by over 99.95%  (source: https://ethereum.foundation/).Before the transition had even been rolled out  Ethereum (ETH) managed to capture the interest of web 2 giant  Google  whose web 3 team  motivated by Ethereum's initiative  rushed to post a doodle displaying a countdown to the ""The Merge"" transition. Google's move represents a superb victory for the cryptocurrency and an extremely advantageous consecration for Ethereum 2.0.In a global context where concerns about what may be called ""the energy war"" and about global warming are reaching paroxysmal levels  this news is absolutely vital. As a result of this initiative  the Central Bank of Norway – a country where ecological issues are given top priority – has announced it will build its MNBC (central bank digital currency) on Ethereum. Meanwhile  the Bank of America now sees Ethereum as a virtuous investment by referring to it as ""green giant"".The art market can only benefit from ""The Merge"". The French newspaper Le Parisien reports Joe Lubin  Ethereum's co-creator  as saying ""many digital artists and art collectors were reluctant to acquire digital works that involved burning so much fossil fuel to produce them… With this transition  these concerns are receding and interesting projects are going to start right from the production of the very first chain blocks after ""the merge"". It's going to liberate a tremendous amount of creative energy.""Lubin adds  ""It won't directly affect Russian gas or gasoline prices  but it will be a powerful message sent to the world when we replace highly energy-consuming mining by a structure that consumes the electricity needed to produce a cup of coffee. It's a profound change that will happen just like an automatic smartphone update.""Artmarket.com therefore expects to see an exponential growth in artistic creation  and that of the art-NFT market in particular. A number of famous artists have already turned towards art-NFTs  as have a number of major art museums. Over the past year  Artmarket.com has expressed its preference for the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain  particularly during its AGM and in its various financial press releases  and it has put all its IT and human resources into confirming its success with NFTs and the Metaverse which represents the backbone of web 3.0.

9975,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.business-standard.com/podcast/markets/what-is-holding-india-back-from-joining-global-bond-indices-122091500075_1.html,What is holding India back from joining global bond indices?,Despite being a big bond market  India has been struggling to get its bonds listed on global indexes. But it may change soon  as Russia's exclusion has set the ball rolling for India's inclusion,India recently overtook the UK to become the fifth largest economy of the world. And it is on track to clinch the third spot by 2030. The recent global headwinds failed to dent its economy even as several big powers are staring at recession.India is now the fifth biggest equity market as well. The country’s $1 trillion sovereign bond market is one of the largest among emerging-market economies. But  notwithstanding all these achievements  the country is still out of global bond indexes.The talks between the Central government and index holders have been on for long  but without a result. But  now  there is a renewed push from global investors for India’s inclusion.Like equities  which have several global indices like MSCI index  bonds too have global indices that track the bond in multiple countries. These indices serve as key indicators to global investors for making investment decisions.JP Morgan and Bloomberg-Barclay’s are some of the major indices in debt that provide a wide range of indices from emerging to country specific to world indices. However  getting included in these indices that are managed by financial firms or index holders is not easy. There is a strict criteria that has to be met.Several factors hindered India’s inclusion so far. One of the biggest concerns among investors over the years was accessibility. To allay such concerns  the Reserve Bank of India introduced a fully accessible route (FAR) in 2020  under which foreign investors and institutions can invest in Indian bonds without any restrictions and investment caps. There were also concerns around settlement  where bond indices insist on Euroclear option.Ajay Manglunia  MD and head of Investment Grade Group  JM Financial says tech concessions to global investors and global settlement were some of the major hurdles. There is a push from the global investors for India's inclusion.There were expectations from the Budget this year that the government would announce tax breaks for foreign investors  but that didn't happen. In last year’s index review  India was also put on watch list for JP Morgan’s emerging market index  but the global house had said India needs to improve market access  trading and settlement to achieve index inclusion.Global index provider FTSE Russell too placed Indian bonds on a watchlist for possible inclusion in its emerging market debt index in 2021 but later said the status remained unchanged.There was always a market consensus that India’s inclusion would happen given the scale of India’s debt market and growing economic clout. But  for long  the question of when remained.The chorus of India's inclusion in global bond indices has only grown stronger recently. In a shift from earlier stance  global providers have been reaching out to India for the inclusion on their platforms  according to a Business Standard report. Financial Times reported that JP Morgan has sought views of investors on India's inclusion. Joining the bandwagon  Morgan Stanley recently said that India might get included in JP Morgan's emerging market . The announcement could come as early as this month or sometime next month  according to the house.Another bank Goldman Sachs also foresaw India’s inclusion but in the second or third quarter next year. Russia’s exclusion from the JP Morgan after the invasion of Ukraine has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced  boosting India's chances. Now that the inclusion seems more likely  government officials are also exploring ways to facilitate settlements locally. The index providers have reportedly agreed to try and facilitate the process without pressing for tax exemptions  a key hurdle that has hindered India's inclusion so far.Foreign funds have invested $538 million in Indian bonds in August amid the index inclusion buzz  after six months of continuous outflows.India’s bond yields have also come down from highs on the buzz of India’s inclusion in the JP Morgan bond index. The 10-year benchmark yield was at 7.13% as of Wednesday morning.India's inclusion in the indices could prove to be a game changer in terms of foreign flows.Analysts expect inflows to the tune of $30 billion in the next fiscal alone  from the current $18 billion.Morgan Stanley said bond investors could position themselves before the actual inclusion  which could drive the rally for one or two months in advance  given a prospective $3 billion inflow every month. The actual inflows could take nine to 12 months and will be seen only in June or September 2023. The fund house last year said it expects $170 billion in bond flows over the next decade  lifting Indian bond prices while lowering borrowing costs. This would push foreign ownership in Indian bonds  currently less than 2%  to 9% by 2031.Pankaj Pathak  fund manager - fixed income  Quantum AMC says FPIs could bring a diverse pool of investor base into the bond market. In the short run  sceptical about the current momentum. Passive flows into Indian bonds will take some time.As more foreign capital flows into Indian government bonds  India's consolidated deficit could shrink in the longer run and the inclusion will help Indian corporations with their capital needs and it bodes well for the overall economy.,negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,negative,0.01,0.15,0.83,True,English,"['global bond indices', 'India', '$1 trillion sovereign bond market', 'fifth biggest equity market', 'emerging market debt index', 'JP Morgan bond index', 'growing economic clout', 'Business Standard report', '10-year benchmark yield', 'prospective $3 billion inflow', 'several big powers', 'fifth largest economy', 'recent global headwinds', 'Investment Grade Group', 'nine to 12 months', 'emerging market index', 'global bond indexes', 'Global index provider', 'Indian bond prices', 'several global indices', 'global bond indices', 'Indian government bonds', 'index inclusion buzz', 'debt market', 'market access', 'market consensus', 'Several factors', 'bond yields', 'bond flows', 'index holders', 'MSCI index', 'index review', 'index providers', 'global providers', 'investment decisions', 'investment caps', 'six months', 'two months', 'biggest concerns', 'bond investors', 'Indian bonds', 'Morgan Stanley', 'global investors', 'global house', 'third spot', 'emerging-market economies', 'Central government', 'multiple countries', 'key indicators', 'wide range', 'financial firms', 'strict criteria', 'accessible route', 'Euroclear option', 'Ajay Manglunia', 'JM Financial', 'tech concessions', 'major hurdles', 'tax breaks', 'last year', 'watch list', 'FTSE Russell', 'earlier stance', 'Financial Times', 'Goldman Sachs', 'third quarter', 'government officials', 'tax exemptions', 'key hurdle', 'Foreign funds', 'continuous outflows', 'Wednesday morning', 'game changer', 'foreign flows', 'next fiscal', 'next decade', 'borrowing costs', 'foreign ownership', 'Pankaj Pathak', 'fund manager', 'fixed income', 'Quantum AMC', 'diverse pool', 'investor base', 'short run', 'current momentum', 'Passive flows', 'foreign capital', 'major indices', 'foreign investors', 'global settlement', 'fund house', 'Reserve Bank', 'actual inflows', 'possible inclusion', 'actual inclusion', 'world indices', 'UK', 'track', 'recession', 'country', 'achievements', 'talks', 'result', 'push', 'equities', 'Bloomberg-Barclay', 'years', 'accessibility', 'FAR', 'institutions', 'restrictions', 'MD', 'expectations', 'Budget', 'trading', 'watchlist', 'status', 'scale', 'question', 'chorus', 'shift', 'platforms', 'views', 'bandwagon', 'announcement', 'second', 'Russia', 'exclusion', 'invasion', 'chances', 'ways', 'settlements', 'process', 'August', 'highs', 'terms', 'Analysts', 'tune', 'rally', 'one', 'advance', 'June', 'September', 'FPIs']",2022-09-15,2022-09-16,business-standard.com

Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)In the context of a serious global energy crisis (probably only just beginning)  Artmarket.com has been closely watching the transition to a totally carbon-free blockchain. This is now a reality with Ethereum 2.0 after its ""The Merge"" operation. Indeed  according to its founder  Vitalik Buterin  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests  ""The Merge"" – a switch from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS) – will reduce the energy consumption of the ETH Blockchain by over 99.95%  (source: https://ethereum.foundation/).Before the transition had even been rolled out  Ethereum (ETH) managed to capture the interest of web 2 giant  Google  whose web 3 team  motivated by Ethereum's initiative  rushed to post a doodle displaying a countdown to the ""The Merge"" transition. Google's move represents a superb victory for the cryptocurrency and an extremely advantageous consecration for Ethereum 2.0.In a global context where concerns about what may be called ""the energy war"" and about global warming are reaching paroxysmal levels  this news is absolutely vital. As a result of this initiative  the Central Bank of Norway – a country where ecological issues are given top priority – has announced it will build its MNBC (central bank digital currency) on Ethereum. Meanwhile  the Bank of America now sees Ethereum as a virtuous investment by referring to it as ""green giant"".The art market can only benefit from ""The Merge"". The French newspaper Le Parisien reports Joe Lubin  Ethereum's co-creator  as saying ""many digital artists and art collectors were reluctant to acquire digital works that involved burning so much fossil fuel to produce them… With this transition  these concerns are receding and interesting projects are going to start right from the production of the very first chain blocks after ""the merge"". It's going to liberate a tremendous amount of creative energy.""Lubin adds  ""It won't directly affect Russian gas or gasoline prices  but it will be a powerful message sent to the world when we replace highly energy-consuming mining by a structure that consumes the electricity needed to produce a cup of coffee. It's a profound change that will happen just like an automatic smartphone update.""Artmarket.com therefore expects to see an exponential growth in artistic creation  and that of the art-NFT market in particular. A number of famous artists have already turned towards art-NFTs  as have a number of major art museums. Over the past year  Artmarket.com has expressed its preference for the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain  particularly during its AGM and in its various financial press releases  and it has put all its IT and human resources into confirming its success with NFTs and the Metaverse which represents the backbone of web 3.0. The world famous Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is considering an upcoming sale for around 70 million dollars of works of art via Sotheby's  with the possibility of investing the proceeds from these sales in the purchase of NFTs  on the advice of a team of experts in charge of following the NFT markets and finding the most promising artists there.According to Artprice by Artmarket's CEO and founder thierry Ehrmann  ""In the history of cryptocurrencies  The Merge operation  this 15 september 2022  represents a founding and irrevocable date for Web 3.0 and for art-NFTs  and it could well generate a 'flippening' with Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization in the coming months.""Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/09/image1-ethereum_themerge-artprice-by-artmarket-com.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

If the chairman of the Board of Directors is the CEO or another member of the Company's management  he or she may not be a part of the nomination committee. In such cases  another director shall replace the chairman of the Board of Directors in the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall meet the requirements of composition set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the ""Code""). If the larger shareholders who have the right to appoint members of the nomination committee wish to appoint persons with the consequence that the requirements of composition provided in the Code are not met  the first choice of the larger shareholder shall have precedence over a smaller shareholder. When appointing a new member  the shareholder who shall appoint the new member shall consider the composition of the current nomination committee in terms of the Code.Should any of the three largest shareholders abstain from their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the right to appoint a member shall pass to the next shareholder in line that does not already have the right to appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  the procedure shall only continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.The names of the members of the nomination committee and of the shareholders they represent shall normally be made public on the Company's website at the latest six months prior to the annual general meeting. At this convening  the nomination committee shall appoint a chair amongst its members. The mandate period of the nomination committee shall extend until the next nomination committee is appointed. Changes in the composition of the nomination committee shall be made public on the website of the Company as soon as they have occurred.If a change in the Company's ownership structure occurs after the last trading day in August but before the date which occurs six months ahead of the forthcoming annual general meeting  and if a shareholder  due to or after this change  becomes one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register of the Company or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the nomination committee  makes a request to the chair of the nomination committee to be part of the nomination committee  the shareholder shall have the right  in the discretion of the nomination committee  either to appoint an additional member of the nomination committee or to appoint a member who shall replace the member appointed by the shareholder representing the least number of votes in the nomination committee following the changes in the Company's ownership structure.A shareholder who has appointed a member of the nomination committee has the right to dismiss the member and appoint a new member. If such an exchange takes place  the shareholder shall without delay give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who shall be exchanged  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). The notification shall contain the name of the dismissed member and the person who shall replace him as member of the nomination committee.A member who prematurely resigns from his task shall give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who resigns  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). In such case  the nomination committee shall without delay call upon the shareholder who has appointed the member to appoint a new member. If a new member is not appointed by the shareholder  the nomination committee shall offer other larger shareholders with respect to votes  to appoint members of the nomination committee. Such offer shall be made in order of priority to the largest shareholders with respect to voting rights (that is  first to the largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so  thereafter to the second largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so etc.). The procedure shall continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.No remuneration is to be paid to members of the nomination committee. The company shall  however  defray all reasonable expenses that are required for the work of the nomination committee.ii) Instructions for the nomination committeeThe members of the nomination committee are to promote the common interests of all the shareholders of the Company and are not to reveal the content or details of any discussion held during the nomination committee meetings unduly. Each member of the nomination committee is to consider carefully whether there are any conflicts of interest or other circumstances that make their service on the nomination committee inappropriate before accepting the assignment to form part of the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Code and shall  when applicable  present proposals to an upcoming general meeting for:(a) the election of the chairman of the meeting;(b) the number of directors elected by the general meeting;(c) the election of the chairman and members of the Board of Directors;(d) the fees and other remuneration of elected members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the committees of the Board of Directors;(e) the election of the auditor(s);(f) the remuneration of the auditor(s); and(g) principles for the composition of the nomination committee including any changes to the instructions to the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall apply item 4.1 in the Code regarding the diversity policy  whereby the nomination committee shall take into account that the Board of Directors  with regard to the Company's operations  development stage and other conditions  shall have an appropriate composition  characterised by versatility in respect to the competence  experience  geographic coverage and background of the members elected a general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee shall work with the goal of achieving an even gender distribution on the Board of Directors.The nomination committee has the right  at the Company's reasonable expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task.Agenda item 8 : Resolution on the ESOPThe ESOP program in shortMGI has  through resolutions by the Board of Directors  in April 2020  January 2021 and February 2022 adopted an employee stock option program directed to approximately 50 key employees of MGI ("" ESOP ""). In order to facilitate the ESOP  MGI has resolved to grant to Bodhivas GmbH  which is owned by the largest shareholder of MGI ("" Bodhivas "") the right to subscribe for up to 15 million Ordinary A Shares. Under the ESOP  Bodhivas has corresponding obligations towards the participants to deliver Ordinary A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESOP (the right to receive Ordinary A Shares from Bodhivas is referred to as ""phantom stock""). Bodhivas has further (i) undertaken towards the participants to pay out the upside value between strike price and exercise value at the moment of exercise and to deliver this value either in Ordinary A Shares or in cash and (ii) undertaken towards MGI to manage the ESOP program and (iii) formally agreed that in relation to this ESOP program  any profit by Bodhivas is for the benefit of MGI and any loss incurred by Bodhivas is to be borne by MGI (i.e.  Bodhivas only facilitates the implementation of the ESOP program but does not have any economic interest in the ESOP program).Options under the ESOP can be exercised from May 1  2024  at the earliest  until December 31  2030. There are currently two different programs which differ primarily in terms of start date and strike price. The first started on May 1  2020 and has a strike price of EUR 1.30 (in total approx. 9.2m options). The second started on January 2021 and has a strike price of minimally EUR 2.60 (approx. 3.3m options). For employees participating in the second program but starting at a later date  the strike price is at a premium of 20% above the average share price of 10 trading days prior to the grant date  however always with a minimum of EUR 2.60. Both programs under the ESOP have an end date of December 31  2030.No employee has been granted more than 2 550 000 options under the ESOP. The options under the ESOP are subject to vesting periods  meaning that participants who leave their employment during the programs will lose any unvested shares. The vesting period to become entitled to 100% of the options is 60 months in total and occurs in several partial steps over the entire vesting period.If a participant in the program leaves the Company (voluntarily or due to termination by employer for breach by employee) within two years after the start date of the phantom stock program for this respective participant  all phantom stock is lost. If a participant in the program leaves after more than two years after the start of the phantom stock program the participant loses 50% of the two most recent years of vested phantom stock.The ESOP does not contain any performance criteria in addition to the strike price  due to MGI wanting to incentivize participants  encourage long-term shareholding in the company and local market practice in Malta and the jurisdictions where the group is active.The maximum cumulative amount of options which can be granted under the ESOP to existing and future participants (and consequently the maximum number of Ordinary A Shares which can be issued under the ESOP  except in the event of recalculation) is 15 000 000  of which approx. 12.5 million options have been granted. If all granted options under the ESOP were to be exercised  the dilution would be 7.28 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares) and if all options were to be granted and exercised  the dilution would be 8.61 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares).MGI has not had  and is not expected to have  any material (cash relevant) costs for the ESOP programs. For additional information on the ESOP  please also refer to MGI's annual reports.Following the relocation to Sweden  due to differences between Swedish and Maltese corporate law  the board of directors intends to exercise its authorization (as proposed under item 12 below) to issue warrants to Bodhivas  MGI or a group company in order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the ESOP. MGI may also require that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a MGI group company.The board of directors therefore proposes that the Meeting approves (i) the continuation of current ESOP after the relocation to Sweden  (ii) that MGI shall be entitled to grant Bodhivas or MGI or a group company of MGI the right to subscribe for warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares)  to (iii) entitle MGI to ensure that warrants or shares or the cash value can be delivered to the participants in the ESOP program on the same terms and conditions that now apply for the ESOP contracts with Bodhivas  (iv) entitle MGI to request that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a group company  and (v) entitle the Board of MGI to take all steps required to execute measures (i) - (iv).Approval of transfer of shares to participants in the ESOP programThe board of director proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the intended exercise of the authorisation to issue Ordinary A shares or warrants and that not more than 15 000 000 Ordinary A Shares or warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares) are transferred to existing and future participants in the ESOP program in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESOP.Agenda item 9: Approve the appointment of Deloitte Sweden AB as Auditors of the Company for FY 2023  effective from the date the Company's registration as a Swedish company (pursuant to agenda item 11 below)  and to authorize the Board of Directors to fix their remuneration.It is proposed that the registered accounting firm Deloitte Sweden AB is elected as Auditors of the Company for the period from the date of the Company's registration as a Swedish company (pursuant to agenda item 11 below) until the end of the 2023 annual general meeting. Deloitte Sweden AB has informed the Company that Deloitte Sweden AB will be the auditor in charge if the proposal is approved.It is proposed that auditor's fees shall be payable upon approval of their invoice.Agenda item 10: Extraordinary Resolution to approve the change in name of the Company from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE and to approve the new Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to effect this change.While preparing the relocation from Malta to Sweden the Company was notified that the relevant Swedish rules do not permit the registration of Media and Games Invest under its current name in Sweden due to the name being too generic.Based on that requirement  the Company wishes to change its name from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE in advance of the Proposed Transfer (as defined and described below in under item 11)  which name will also be retained after completion of the Proposed Transfer.The change in the name of the Company will require an amendment to the current memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the "" Current M&A "") to include the new name  which change will become effective once the amended memorandum and articles of association with the new name (the "" Interim M&A "") are filed with and registered by the Malta Business Registry following the Meeting.The Interim M&A (reflecting the limited amendments to the Current M&A for the purpose of the name change) are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's name be changed from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE; that the Current M&A be replaced by the Interim M&A to be adopted following this Meeting; and to authorize the Company Secretary and/or any one (1) Director of the Company to register a copy of the Interim M&A with the Malta Business Registry (the "" MBR "").Agenda item 11: Extraordinary resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon registration as a Swedish company.Following an evaluation by the Board of Directors and management of the Company  in light of Malta's grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in mid-2021  the Company believes that having the Company's registered office in Malta may result in an increased risk premium on the Company's shares and may preclude further investment from prospective investors.Given that the Company's core business is in North America and Continental Europe  and that its operations are not tied to Malta  the Board of Directors has chosen Sweden as the new registered office and headquarter of the Company. The Board of Director's decision was motivated by the fact that the Company; (i) has been listed in Sweden since 2020  (ii) is already familiar with the local capital markets  and (iii) has a very strong local network on the ground  as well as several operating subsidiaries and employees in Stockholm. Furthermore  a large part of the Company's shareholders hail from the Nordics and the Swedish regulatory framework is globally recognized. While MGI's listing structure currently covers three jurisdictions - Malta (registered office)  Germany (listing) and Sweden (listing) - the administrative complexity will be significantly reduced as a result of the relocation.Due to the above  the Board of Directors is proposing that the general meeting resolves that the Company transfers its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden (the "" Proposed Transfer "") pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (the ""SE Regulation"") and in terms of Article 6 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 386.17 - Transfer of Registered Office of a European Company (SE) Regulations (the "" Subsidiary Legislation "").To this end and in connection with the obligation set out under Article 8 of the SE Regulation  the Board of Directors has prepared and submitted a transfer proposal ("" Transfer Proposal "") and a transfer report (""Transfer Report"") to the MBR  which provide explanations of the legal and economic aspects of the Proposed Transfer  including a description of any implications for the Company's shareholders  creditors and employees as a result of the Proposed Transfer.Shareholders are hereby being notified of their right to examine the Transfer Proposal and the Transfer Report  copies of which are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/The Proposed Transfer will also require the substitution of the Interim M&A with new statutes of the Company (the "" New Statutes ""). The New Statutes are to enter into force following the Proposed Transfer and upon registration of MGI as a Swedish company.The New Statutes are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposed that the Meeting resolves on the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's transfer of its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden in terms of the SE Regulation and the Subsidiary Legislation be  and hereby is  approved; that the Transfer Proposal and Transfer Report be  and hereby are  approved; that the Interim M&A be replaced by the New Statutes upon the Company's registration as a Swedish company; and That the Board of MGI is entitled to do all that is required to execute the above measures and actions.Agenda item 12: Extraordinary Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to issue shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company.With reference to the proposal under item 11 for the re-domiciliation of the Company's registered office from Malta to Sweden. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that it would be beneficial for the Company for the Board of Directors to be authorised to (a) issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions and (b) restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue.The purpose of this authorization would be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolution:Without prejudice to the existing authorisation to the Board of Directors  in terms of article 3 of the Company's articles of association  to issue shares of any class  options which may be convertible into shares  and other rights and/or securities (by whatever name referred to) which may entitle the holder thereof to subscribe to shares in the Company  in each case up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company  which authorisation shall remain valid and in effect  to authorize the Board of Directors to - at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting of the Company - issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions  and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (i.e. have the right to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue) and in each case within the limits of the company's articles of association. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to enable the use of securities as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses (including for payments of earn-outs and other deferred payments)  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).(Swedish translation: […] att bemyndiga styrelsen att efter bytet av bolagets registrerade säte - vid ett eller flera tillfällen intill slutet av nästkommande årsstämma - emittera nya aktier  optioner  teckningsoptioner och konvertibler i bolaget  med eller utan bestämmelser om apport  kvittning eller andra villkor  och med eller utan avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt (dvs. en rättighet att inskränka eller begränsa företrädesrätten hos befintliga aktieägare med avseende på sådana emissioner) inom ramen för de gränser som sätts av bolagets bolagsordning. Syftet med bemyndigandet och möjligheten att avvika från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt ska vara att möjliggöra för bolaget att använda värdepapper som likvid vid eller finansiering av förvärv av företag eller rörelser (inklusive för betalning av earn-outs och andra uppskjutna betalningar)  anskaffa kapital för att främja tillväxt och utveckling av bolaget eller att säkra  främja och fullfölja bolagets incitamentsprogram  inklusive ESOP-programmet.)The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves that the Board of Directors  the CEO or such person as the Board of Directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.(Swedish translation: Styrelsen  den verkställande direktören eller den person som styrelsen utser ska bemyndigas att göra sådana smärre justeringar i årsstämmans beslut som kan visa sig erforderliga i samband med registrering av beslutet hos Bolagsverket.)OtherThe Company has 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares in issue as of the date of this notice (one vote per share).The Interim M&A  the Transfer Proposal  the Transfer Report  and the New Statutes  are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/shareholder-meeting/.15 September 2022MEDIA AND GAMES INVEST SEThe Board of DirectorsResponsible partiesThe information in this release has been made public through the agency of the responsible persons at MGI set out below for publication at the time stated by MGI's news distributor EQS Newswire at the publication of this release.

The financial statements for the first half of 2022  approved by the Company's Board of Directors on September 14  2022  have been audited and the certification report is being prepared by the Company's external auditors.""The first half of 2022 has been very eventful for Abivax  as for many other listed companies within this unpredictable international context and its heavy implications on the stock markets. Nevertheless  we made significant progress in our development programs and achieved important milestones for our product candidate obefazimod. In April  we reported excellent results from the obefazimod phase 2b open-label maintenance study  including 217 patients who completed one year of once-daily oral treatment with 50mg obefazimod. These promising outcomes have very recently been recognized by the scientific community through a scientific article in the prestigious journal ‘The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology‘. Abivax's current priority is the swift start and completion of the global phase 3 program in UC and  after the US IRB approval in August  we expect the first-patient-in for the end of September "" said Prof. Hartmut Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax. ""Another important scientific validation of the anti-inflammatory potential of obefazimod was achieved in June by the publication of the phase 2a data of obefazimod in RA in the journal ‘Annals of Rheumatic Diseases'  and through a presentation of these results at the EULAR congress. This shows that our product has not only the potential to relieve UC-patients from symptoms and improve the quality of life in the long run  but that it could also have significant benefits for patients suffering from other chronic inflammatory diseases.""Story continuesDidier Blondel  CFO of Abivax  added: ""Our successful financing round of EUR 49.2M in September 2022 allows Abivax to further advance its priority clinical program of obefazimod in ulcerative colitis. The company's operations are fully funded until the end of Q1 2023 and we stay committed to completing this funding in due course through additional non-dilutive and dilutive financial resources in order to secure the full financing of our UC phase 3 program. Considering the currently very challenging financing environment  we are pleased that Abivax could attract new top-tier US biotech investors - TCGX  Venrock and Deep Track Capital - as well as our existing US and European biotech investors  for the capital increase and royalty certificates. As we have been able to do during the first half of 2022  we will make targeted use of these financial resources  mainly for the conduct and completion of our phase 3 clinical program in order to provide obefazimod as a long-lasting and effective treatment to patients in need and to maximize shareholder value.""FIRST HALF 2022 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSItems in the Income Statement H1 2022 H1 2021 Change In millions of euros M€ M€ M€ Total operating income 0.1 9.6 (9.6 ) Total operating expenses (18.7 ) (26.5 ) 7.9 of which Research and Development costs (15.9) (24.0) 8.1 of which administrative costs and overheads (2.8) (2.6) (0.2) Operating result (18.6 ) (16.9 ) (1.7 ) Financial result (2.1 ) (1.3 ) (0.8 ) Ordinary result (20.7 ) (18.2 ) (2.5 ) Extraordinary result (11.0 ) 0.1 (11.1 ) Tax on income 2.2 1.6 0.6 Result for the period (29.6 ) (16.5 ) (13.0 )Financial Items from the Balance Sheet 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Change in millions of euros M€ M€ M€ Net financial position (22.9 ) 6.6 (29.5 ) of which financial fixed assets* 0.0 0.0 0.0 of which fixed-term deposits (maturing in > 1 year) 0.0 0.0 0.0 of which fixed-term deposits (maturing in < 1 year) 0.0 0.0 0.0 of which available cash flow 26.6 60.7 (34.1 ) (of which financial debts) (49.5 ) (54.1 ) 4.6 Total Assets 71.6 110.4 (38.7 ) Total Equity 6.1 35.6 (29.5 ) of which equity capital (0.8 ) 28.8 (29.5 ) of which conditional advances 6.8 6.8 (0.0 )* Excluding items of the liquidity contract (liquidity and own shares) and deposits & guaranteesOperating loss EUR -18.6M as of June 30  2022 (EUR -1.7M compared to EUR -16.9M as of June 30  2021)  with reduced R&D expenses in H1 2022 compared with H1 2021 (EUR +8.1M)  balanced with reduced revenues in H1 2022 compared with H1 2021 (EUR -9.6M)  when the company recorded a one-off grant from Bpifrance for Covid-19 program at EUR +9.6M.R&D expenses decreased to EUR -15.9M (a decrease of EUR +8.1M compared to EUR -24.0M as of June 30  2021). In H1 2022  R&D expenses were mainly used for the progress of obefazimod development in inflammatory indications (89% of the total R&D expenses). H1 2022 was dedicated to preparatory work for the phase 3 program of obefazimod in UC  with an investment ramp up to be expected in H2 2022.

Following this financing  the Company is funded until the end of Q1 2023  taking into account the existing cash resources and the planned clinical development prioritization for obefazimod  focusing on the UC indication as a top priority.OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS: PORTFOLIO UPDATEObefazimod global pivotal phase 3 clinical program in ulcerative colitis (UC)1 200 moderate to severe UC patients across 36 countries will take part in the pivotal phase 3 program which consists of two induction studies and a single subsequent maintenance study (ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2 induction trials - ABX464-105 and ABX464-106 - and ABTECT maintenance trial - ABX464-107). These three pivotal studies are all randomized  double-blind and placebo controlled  using independent  blinded review of the video-taped endoscopies. The primary efficacy endpoint assessed at week 8 (induction) and at week 44 (maintenance) will be clinical remission according to the modified Mayo Score  as required by FDA. [1]In consultation with international regulators  including FDA and EMA  obefazimod 25mg and 50mg will be investigated in phase 3 for the treatment of UC in advanced therapies (AT) naïve and in AT-failure patients [2] to support the future submission of marketing authorizations.Abivax is working with IQVIA  a global premier CRO  to jointly set-up and conduct these studies across 36 countries in Europe  the Americas  Japan and other global geographies.Currently  more than 430 study sites  out of the targeted 600 sites  have already been qualified to take part in the phase 3 trials.In August  Abivax received approval from the central US Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the protocols of the phase 3 induction studies. This allows the initiation of enrollment of patients into the two phase 3 induction studies in UC in the US. A first patient is anticipated to be included at the end of September 2022.Obefazimod phase 2b clinical induction and maintenance studies in UCIn April 2022  Abivax reported excellent results from its phase 2b open-label maintenance study   including the full set of 217 patients who completed one year of once-daily oral treatment with 50mg obefazimod or who dropped out of the study. These data emphasize obefazimod's capacity to maintain and further improve patient-outcomes over time  as well as its continued favorable safety and tolerability.97.7% (217/222) of all patients who completed the phase 2b induction study  irrespective of treatments or treatment outcome during the induction phase  enrolled in the open-label maintenance study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy profile of obefazimod for up to two years.Among the 217 patients who completed the first year of 50mg once-daily oral dosing with obefazimod  52 had entered the maintenance study already in clinical remission. 38 (73.1%) out of these 52 patients stayed in clinical remission during this first year of maintenance treatment. It is remarkable that 82/165 (49.7%) patients who were not in clinical remission at the end of induction achieved a de novo clinical remission during the first year of maintenance.Furthermore  the clinical remission rate for patients who did not show at least a clinical response at the end of the induction phase was 42.7% (full analysis set) after 48 weeks of treatment  demonstrating that long-term administration of obefazimod provided substantial clinical benefits also for these patients.33/217 (15.2%) of patients dropped out during the first 48 weeks of the phase 2b maintenance study. Worsening of UC was the primary cause of premature study discontinuation (10 patients - 30%). These patients were all considered as treatment failures in the full analysis set.During the induction and the maintenance phases of the phase 2b study  obefazimod continued to show a good safety and tolerability profile  confirming the data already generated in over 1 000 patients and volunteers treated with obefazimod so far. [3]254 patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis were enrolled into the phase 2b clinical study and dosed within three once-daily oral obefazimod treatment groups (25mg  50mg and 100mg) or placebo. 50% of these patients had inadequate response  loss of response  or intolerance to biologics and/or JAK inhibitor treatments while the other 50% were refractory to conventional treatments. Endoscopies were read centrally and blinded by independent reviewers. The baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across all obefazimod dose groups and the placebo group. Enrolled patients suffered from longstanding UC with an overall mean disease duration of 8.05 years and 71.4% of the patients showed a severe disease profile (baseline modified Mayo Score of 7 to 9 points).Obefazimod phase 2b study publication in The Lancet Gastroenterology & HepatologyIn September  Abivax published a scientific article in the peer-reviewed journal ""The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology""  the world-leading gastroenterology and hepatology research journal. [4] The title of the article is "" ABX464 (obefazimod) for moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis: a randomised  placebo controlled phase 2b induction trial and 48-week  open-label extension "". [5]The publication highlights that all doses of obefazimod tested during the induction study (25mg  50mg and 100mg) significantly improved the condition of patients suffering from moderate to severe  active ulcerative colitis compared to placebo  as measured by changes in Modified Mayo Score from baseline at week 8. Further  the data show that patients on continuous daily treatment with 50mg obefazimod during the 48 weeks maintenance trial experienced new or maintained clinical response  clinical remission  endoscopic improvement and endoscopic remission. [6]Obefazimod phase 2a induction and maintenance studies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)In June 2022  the safety and efficacy study results of the obefazimod phase 2a study in RA patients were published in the renowned and peer-reviewed journal ""Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (ARD)"" [7] and presented at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology  EULAR 2022.The publication and EULAR presentation cover the excellent top-line results of the induction phase of its phase 2a clinical study of obefazimod administered in combination with methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of active moderate to severe RA. 60 patients who had either an inadequate response to methotrexate and/or TNFα inhibitors participated in the study.The primary endpoint of this study  safety and tolerability  was met with 50mg obefazimod once-daily  demonstrating a good safety and tolerability profile in the overall patient population during the 12-week induction phase.Although the sample size of this study was not powered to show efficacy  the 50mg group already showed statistically significant differences for the key secondary endpoint ACR20 [8] compared to placebo at week 12 in the per protocol population.Following the induction study results  in March 2022  Abivax reported its phase 2a maintenance results in RA after the first year of treatment. Out of the 40 patients who enrolled into the obefazimod maintenance study  23 patients have completed the first year of treatment and all achieved at least an ACR20  with 19 and 12 patients even achieving ACR50 and ACR70 respectively.The long-term safety profile of 50mg obefazimod once daily administered in association with methotrexate showed to be favorable and consistent with previous observations.The phase 2a data along with the scientific validation in the ARD journal and at EULAR  clearly support moving obefazimod into a subsequent phase 2b trial for the treatment of RA. As Abivax is at present focusing on the phase 3 program in UC  the initiation of next steps for the further clinical development in RA depends on the availability of the necessary resources and funding.""Obefazimod"" registered as INN for ABX464In June  Abivax announced that ""obefazimod"" was confirmed as international nonproprietary name (INN) for drug-candidate ABX464. Obefazimod has officially been registered and published at the WHO as well as the USAN (United States Adopted Names).ABX196 phase 1/2 clinical study in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)The phase 1/2 clinical trial in HCC is conducted at the Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center in San Diego and the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. In this proof-of-concept study  heavily pre-treated hepatocellular cancer (HCC) patients who previously failed on checkpoint inhibitor treatments were dosed with ABX196  a synthetic invariant Natural Killer T cell (iNKT) agonist  in combination with checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo®  Bristol Myers Squibb). The clinical study consists of two phases  a dose escalation phase  and a subsequent expansion phase.10 patients were enrolled in the dose escalation phase and dosed with 0.1µg  0.2µg  or 0.4µg ABX196 in combination with nivolumab. A clinical benefit was observed in 5 patients  including 1 patient with a partial response and 4 patients with stable disease. Median progression-free survival for all patients was 113.5 days (49-450 days) and at 276 days (172-450 days) for those showing a clinical benefit.ABX196 in combination with nivolumab was well tolerated without any dose limiting toxicities or treatment related serious adverse events.The results of the dose escalation phase were presented at the ASCO GI Cancers Symposium in January 2022.These results support the further clinical development of ABX196 in the HCC setting and  as a priority  Abivax is assessing potential partnering options.FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTSAbivax change in governanceIn August  Abivax announced a transition in the governance of its Board of Directors.

In the completed retrospective clinical validation  both iSeq 100 and MiniSeq employing the RPIDD workflow demonstrated a 100% agreement with positive clinical data in identifying the causative pathogen (by employing standard of care (SOC) diagnostics when the Ct value of the samples is <30). In addition  under both iSeq 100 and MiniSeq platforms  RPIDD also showed a 100% agreement with the negative clinical molecular diagnosis data on the relevant clinical samples. In our prospective clinical validation of RPIDD  patients have been enrolled with febrile neutropenia and sepsis conditions and that over 50 samples have been collected and analyzed. The trial is still ongoing but so far general agreement has been observed compared with standard of care diagnostics results such as blood culture technology and/or PCR. Various bacteria and both DNA and RNA viruses have been detected in these patient samples  including (but not limited to) Hepatitis B and C virus  Cytomegalovirus  Epstein-Barr virus  Human Immunodeficiency virus  Dengue  Escherichia coli  Klebsiella pneumoniae and Herpesviridae  etc. In the analytical validations of RPIDD  it has also been demonstrated that (a) analytical sensitivity of 100% in MiniSeq and 92.5% in iSeq 100 in the low-depth low-cost sequencing assay  and (b) analytical specificity of more than 95.0% in MiniSeq.Mr. Darren Lui  CEO and Executive Director of Aptorum Group Limited comments “We are extremely excited with the clinical and analytical validation results of RPIDD conducted so far in 2022. The results so far have been extremely encouraging and support the capability and potentials of the RPIDD technology to overcome some of the highly unmet shortcomings of the existing standard of care diagnostics such as blood culture and PCR currently deployed by clinics and hospitals around the world. We believe the patented RPIDD technology has promisingly tackled the historical industry challenges of depleting hosts’ and enriching pathogenic genetic materials  respectively  for the purposes of NGS sequencing for detection of pathogens in an untargeted manner (without the need for a prior guess of what pathogens are present in the samples). Through the demonstrated clinical results so far  RPIDD has significant potential to disrupt the existing frontline diagnostics industry and hence in due course to significantly contribute towards the reduction of infected patient’s mortality and morbidity. With the encouraging results  we are continuing to expand our clinical validation efforts  in addition to the current site in Singapore  to involve multiple clinical sites and countries targeting to commercialize this technology as soon as possible in conjunction with regional hospitals and clinics. As part of this effort  this year we have commenced steps to establish a clinical laboratory site in the state of California  subject to the relevant Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification  with the dual aims of continuing expansion of (i) clinical validation collaboration targeting US based regional healthcare and academic institutions and (ii) the eventual commercialisation of the RPIDD technology in the United States through proprietary laboratories and healthcare partner collaborations. In addition to iSeq 100 and MiniSeq  we strongly believe the RPIDD technology is compatible with other NGS sequencing platforms and will continue to broaden its adaptation to both different NGS sequencing platforms and sampling methods as well.”About Aptorum’s Rapid Pathogen Identification and Detection Molecular Diagnostics TechnologyRPIDD is an innovative liquid biopsy-driven rapid pathogen molecular diagnostics technology. RPIDD  through proprietary and patented technologies  is developed with the aim to  cost effectively through patient blood samples  enrich pathogenic DNA and RNA for pathogenic genome sequencing analysis through harnessing the power of Next-Generation Sequencing platforms and proprietary artificial intelligence-based software analytics with the goal to rapidly identify and detect any foreign pathogens (virus  bacteria  fungus  parasites) without bias through its genome composition and to identify other unknown pathogens and novel mutated pathogens. RPIDD is comprised of two proprietary metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) components: (i) HostEL for depletion of human background under selective lysis to enrich both pathogen DNA and RNA; (ii) AmpRE for one pot DNA/RNA library preparation for overall cost reduction. RPIDD has been and continues to be validated in human clinical samples and so far  such testing has been able to detect pathogens – ranging from bacteria  fungi and viruses in an unbiased manner.About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications)  autoimmune and infectious diseases.

It's hoped that the test will help the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have celiac disease – but don't know it – take the first step towards treatment.""Those who suffer from Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance deserve all the support they can get  which is why this partnership is so important "" said NIMA Partners CEO  David DellaFave. ""empowerDX's gene risk test represents a powerful new tool for the thousands of people wondering why they aren't feeling right and NIMA is proud to be raising awareness about it.""Travis Wilkes  MD  the Medical Director at empowerDX said  ""The empowerDX & NIMA Partners collaboration will help spread celiac disease awareness  improve access to risk testing  and provide solutions for living well with celiac disease.

10010,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-bioenergies-updates-situation-outlook-153600136.html,Global Bioenergies updates its situation and outlook,Global Bioenergies updates its situation and outlook Evry  15 September 2022 - Global Bioenergies provides a review of its situation and outlook based on...,GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies updates its situation and outlookEvry  15 September 2022 - Global Bioenergies provides a review of its situation and outlook based on four horizons  each corresponding to (i) a volume and a production cost and (ii) one or more target markets.The first horizon involved the conversion of renewable resources into isobutene and derivatives on the scale of a few tonnes per year. Production was carried out at the demo plant in Leuna  Germany  which has now been dismantled. While these volumes enabled a number of process validations  the production cost was too high to allow the marketing of isobutene or its derivatives on this basis. However  a marketing approach was identified: isododecane  a derivative obtained by combining three isobutene molecules  is the basis for the formulation of all longwear eyes and lips make-up. It is systematically used as the No. 1 ingredient in terms of proportion and cannot currently be replaced by any other compound. The Company moved up the value chain as far as the end customer and has produced the first make-up range combining longwear properties and naturalness of over 90%. This led to the creation of the LAST® brand.Florence Hébert  Head of the LAST® Business Unit  said: “The LAST® product range was designed to combine performance with naturalness: it breaks the mould for natural-origin make-up. Besides being marketed via our website www.colors-that-last.com  the brand is now available at several physical and digital sales outlets. The brand should soon be distributed by a major retail chain  and we expect new points of sale to open in 2023  both in France and abroad.”The second horizon is just beginning and involves producing isobutene in tens of tonnes per year. A fully French value chain has been set up comprising five stages  four of which are carried out at toller facilities. Only the second stage  involving the production of isobutene itself  takes place in a unit owned by Global Bioenergies. This unit has been built over the last few months at the Pomacle site near Reims. The construction phase is now complete  and commissioning is underway. The unit is expected to reach maximum capacity of nearly two tonnes of isobutene per week by the end of 2022. Part of this isobutene will be converted into isododecane and sold as a make-up ingredient to major cosmetics industry players under the Isonaturane® 12 brand.Story continuesDaphne Galvez  Global Bioenergies Commercial Director  said: “The first batch comprising several tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 will be delivered in the first quarter of 2023. A large portion of this batch has been purchased by L’Oréal. We then plan to produce a further batch by summer 2023 and another towards the end of the year. Global Bioenergies is currently being listed with around ten manufacturers  some of whom have already purchased volumes for testing  in particular as formulation pilots. In total  we plan to deliver around 15 tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 in 2023. The debottlenecking of the downstream part of the value chain by our tollers would enable us to produce and deliver greater volumes from 2024 onwards.”The isobutene not converted into Isonaturane® 12 will be sold directly or converted into other compounds of the isobutene product tree in order to trigger the start of commercial operations for the third horizon.The third horizon will consist of constructing and commissioning in 2025 a plant capable of producing 2 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year. This operation will be headed by an SPV  which is currently being set up and will initially be a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Bioenergies. The production cost of isobutene and its derivatives will be significantly reduced due to major economies of scale and the fuller integration of production stages. Isonaturane® 12 sales will target not only the make-up market  but also the much larger skincare and haircare markets. The plant may also be able to serve other markets  including materials and fuels.Ronan Euzen  Global Bioenergies Head of Business Development  explained: “Numerous discussions have recently taken place with manufacturers in areas as diverse as rubber  gas and industrial solvents. Times are changing and the entire industry is now actively searching for ways of limiting its consumption of petroleum products. The road fuel sector in particular is undergoing a radical change: European announcements on the possible phase-out of combustion vehicles have tied their destiny to that of biofuels. Niche markets will be exploitable as of the third horizon.”The fourth horizon  which is expected to take shape within five years  will consist of setting up a unit to produce tens of thousands of tonnes of isobutene per year at a reduced cost  enabling the aviation fuel market to be targeted. Many Western countries are strongly committed to reducing CO 2 emissions in this sector with its high environmental impact.Bernard Chaud  Head of Industrial Strategy at Global Bioenergies  said: “The certification of our technology for air transport is on track. Achieving the performance improvement targets set by our R&D division will enable our process for converting residual sugars into sustainable aviation fuel to reach competitive costs. As such  we are looking to significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of air transport on a global scale.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  concluded: “The creation of a new industry always relies on niche markets initially. The multiple niche markets for isobutene and its derivatives have prompted us to draw up a roadmap with four horizons  and will enable our Company  despite its small size  to realistically tackle a challenge as broad as environmental transition.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST® in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane®12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint.

The spot cleverly uses the tunnel as a metaphor to connect fans to the emotion and anticipation the players feel before the match  inspiring them to take the next step in their journey towards pursuing their dreams.

These branches experience a minimum annual growth of more than 10% in their respective turnover  they generate a positive operating result or very close to balance  they are now autonomous in terms of financing.The UDT division holds a portfolio of assets whose cumulative value in 2021 was around €8 million  a value doubled compared to the amounts initially invested. As a company whose only activity is to hold minority stakes in the drone sector  UDT does not generate revenue or operating expenses  as the company has no employees and relies on the infrastructure of Delta Drone SA.The group's financial losses are therefore concentrated on the 4th branch (Delta Drone SA). They result from a high operating cost compared to an incipient turnover  which is still insufficient to cover the expenses. »In order to comply with its business plan  which aims to achieve a balance in operating income for the 2023 financial year  Delta Drone has strongly stepped up its actions to reduce the level of operating expenses of the 4th branch (Delta Drone SA and its support subsidiaries in France):-In recent weeks  Delta Drone and its French subsidiaries Delta Drone Experts and Technidrone have recorded the cumulative departure of 11 employees  including 9 by way of economic dismissal and 2 resulting from resignations. The consequence of these operations will make it possible to start the year 2023 with an annual payroll amount of approximately €1.3 million for these three combined entities (For the record  they represented an annual payroll of nearly €3 million at the end of 2021).Story continuesA programme to reduce general operating expenses has been put in place  which aims to reduce them from €2.5 million to €1.5 million by the end of 2022 at the latest  taking into account the implementation deadlines.At the request of its parent company Delta Drone SA  the subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering (design office activity) was placed in safeguard on August 31  2022 by the Commercial Court of Nantes. This subsidiary employs 14 people and corresponds to approximately €1 million in annual operating expenses. The objective of this approach is to be part of a calendar of a few months at most  devoted to the reorganization of the operation of the entity: it makes it possible to initiate discussions with new customers and / or partners  outside the group  likely to buy ""engineering time"" in the context of R&D projects and thus to cover all or part of the costs.In this new configuration  the rationalization of operating costs is closely linked to the achievement of business objectives (sales and services) related to the isS Spotter (security) and Countbot (logistics) professional solutions  to achieve the operating profit balance in 2023.All solutions combined  the development plan is based on about thirty systems sold and sixty missions carried out in 2023. To date  the progress of many commercial discussions makes it possible to validate the coherence of these objectivesN new bond issueDelta Drone (the ""Company"") issued on July 15  2022 43 000 simple bonds (the ""OS"") with a nominal value of €56 at a price of €50 each  for gross proceeds of €2 150 000  as part of an issue reserved for the benefit of certain investors.

Consolidated balance sheet Shareholder capital 26.5 33.2 -20% Cash1 1.5 3.6 -58%Strong payment flow growthPayment volumes saw sustained growth at 12%  reaching 3.6 billion euros in the first semester of 2022.This performance can be put into perspective with:A challenging comparison base: with the first semester 2021 affected by various lockdowns in Europe.A particularly difficult and volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical context affecting consumer behaviour and business’s investment decisions.This significant growth in the first semester despite these external factors attests to the robustness of the HiPay model  as well as its ability to expand.On the basis of its omnichannel payment offering  HiPay is gaining market share: 151 new key accounts have been added.The group is also accelerating its international development with 36% of its payments occurring outside France  taking its strong commercial dynamics to other markets.Turnover evolutionOverall turnover has increased to 27.5 million euros (up 3% compared with S1 2021).This growth below that of payment volumes can be explained by a number of Belgian banks stopping certain Direct Banking payment methods. These volumes have transferred to other  less lucrative payment methods.Activity in France and elsewhere continues to grow strongly: turnovers have risen sharply from semester to semester  with increases of 25% and 27% per semester between 2019 and 2022 respectively (CAGR).At the group level  spending remains controlled: direct costs are increasing in proportion with flows and staff costs are progressing in a reasoned manner with the recruitment of new talent to consolidate the HiPay team.However  because the increase in turnover is not enough to cover the increase in these operational costs  the net result is -3.6 million euros.Story continuesPerspectivesDuring the first semester of 2022  HiPay obtained additional funding totalling 3.25 million euros  demonstrating the ongoing support of its financial partners.For the 2022 financial period  HiPay aims to experience single-figure growth. The group is also adjusting its overheads in order to account for the expected difficulties caused by the current morose macroeconomic situation.Next financial disclosure:27 October 2022 (before the marketing opening) – Turnover for Quarter 3 2022-------------------1 Unaudited data-------------------About HiPayHiPay is a global payment services provider.

The following items are restated: asset depreciation and impairments (€21.7 million)  provisions for contingencies and charges (-€0.3 million)  provisions related to employee benefits (€0.9 million)  and the other expenses and income without any impact on cash position (€0.4 million)  and the impacts related to transfers (€0.1 million).5 As a reminder  in March 2021  IFRS IC issued a final decision on accounting for the costs of configuring and customizing software used under a SaaS contract. As at June 30  2021  the impacts were being analyzed  and the decision had not yet been applied when preparing the half-yearly accounts. The comparative information was therefore restated in the consolidated financial statements as at June 30  2022.The accounts were audited by the statutory auditors and reviewed by the board of directors on September 13  2022. The report of the statutory auditors is in the process of being issued. The statements and detailed presentation of the half-year results are available on the corporate site at corporate.virbac.com.Thanks to the Virbac teams’ constant dedication to animal health  we posted revenue in the first half of the year of €616.4 million  an increase of +16.4% compared to 2021. Excluding the favorable impact of exchange rates  revenue shows growth of +12.0%. This growth benefited in part from a favorable baseline effect representing one point of growth in revenue  attributable to new products acquired starting in the second quarter of 2021.All areas are growing organically at the end of June. It should be noted  however  that double-digit growth in Europe stalled in the last quarter  due to the slowdown in the market as anticipated in our annual outlook. Thus  the revenue in this area increased by +6.8% at real rates (+6.2% at constant rates)  thanks mainly to the contribution of the United Kingdom  France and Italy. The area is supported by the strong dynamism of the pet ranges (in particular petfood  specialties  and vaccines)  which compensated for the decline in the ranges for production animals. In Asia-Pacific  growth at real rates was +19.8% (+15% at constant exchange rates). Australia and India are driving growth in the region  generating more than 85% of this growth  in particular on products for cattle  which largely compensates for the decline in China  which was heavily impacted by lockdowns at the beginning of the year and which  despite a rebound since May  remains down at the end of June. In Latin America  business grew by +25.1% at real rates (+14.6% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to contributions from Brazil and Mexico. Lastly  in the United States  business grew by +32.2% (+19.9% at constant exchange rates). It benefited from strong sales of new products launched in 2021 (Clomicalm and Itrafungol) and those launched in early 2022 (petfood  and Tulissin for the production animals segment)  as well as good performance on the dental and dermatology range.The current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions amounts to €117.4 million  a significant growth compared to the first half of 2021 (€104.4 million). This improvement is mainly due to the strong growth in our revenue  driven by strong performance in all areas  despite the slowdown in market dynamics seen since the beginning of the year. This was partially offset by a deterioration in the margin in relative terms  due to the impacts of inflation on raw material costs and operational expenses such as transport and energy. We are also seeing a rebound in business expenses (travel expenses  seminars  etc.)  post-Covid-19  as well as an increase in our R&D expenses as a result of our desire to increase our spending in this area. It should also be noted that the half-yearly result at the end of June 2022 benefits from the recognition of income of €3 million  the last compensation tranche for the continuation of R&D projects acquired from Elanco in 2021. As a reminder  the current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions from the first half of 2021 benefited from the recognition of non-recurring items in the amount of €6.6 million (€4 million in compensation for the continuation of R&D projects from Elanco  €1 million in additional margin on the Clomicalm and Itrafungol products which benefited from a zero cost of sales in connection with the acquisition  and €1.6 million from a reversal of a provision for disputes). After restating the positive impact of these items over the two periods  the ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions” to “revenue” at the end of June 2022 is 18.6%  slightly up compared to the same period of 2021 (18.5%).Consolidated net income was €77.6 million  up 5.2% compared to the first half of 2021. This improvement in our net income is explained by the reasons given above  in particular the growth of our business and the good control of our operating expenses  which remain contained as a proportion of our revenue  despite the inflationary pressure observed in the first half of 2022. It should be noted that our financial result corresponds to a charge of €8.1 million  which is significantly up from the first half of 2021 (charge of €1.6 million). This is explained by the drop in foreign exchange income (unrealized loss)  due to the depreciation of the Chilean peso against the euro and the US dollar in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This is only partially offset by the decrease in the cost of net debt of €2.5 million  resulting from the reduction in interest on rate hedges that matured in the second half of 2021 and in January 2022.Net income - Group share amounted to €77.5 million  i.e. an increase of 7.7% compared to the first half of the previous year (€72 million)  driven by operational performance  the elements shared above  and the decrease in the share of non-controlling interests as of June 30  2022  following the acquisition of 100% of Centrovet in the second half of 2021.On the financial side  our net financial excess amounts to €19.6 million at the end of June 2022  compared to €73.8 million at the end of December 2021. This deterioration over the first six months of the year is mainly due to the cyclical nature of our cash generation model  with cash generation occurring more in the second half of the year. This situation was exacerbated over the period by higher working capital requirements in the first half of 2022  due to the strong growth in our revenue  a reduction in the amount of factored receivables  higher capital expenditure  and finally the increase in dividends paid in respect of the results for 2021.It should be noted that on September 12  2022  Virbac unanimously obtained from its banks a one-year extension of the maturity of its €200 million syndicated financing contract  which is now fixed at October 2027.OutlookRevenue growth at constant exchange rates and scope is still expected to be in the range of 5% to 10% and will be refined when the third quarter revenues are published. The ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions” to “revenue” should consolidate at 15% at constant exchange rates  despite impacts from inflation. Finally  our debt relief should be around €30 million excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates.

Steeped in the brand’s heritage and philosophy of culinary excellence and human connection  the “indulgence done right” campaign features chocolate-inspired creative  playful imagery  and local gastronomy-themed guest experiences thoughtfully curated to feed and enrich the soul.The new campaign was inspired by and crafted using recent consumer research  which indicates travelers around the world describe luxury as “having time to relax and enjoy oneself.”* The data and findings show that consumers are increasingly searching for unique experiences and are consciously looking at how to balance health and wellness with the unapologetic satisfaction of enjoying food and beverages. This type of simple indulgence is at the heart of the Mövenpick ethos and the Hotels to Indulge campaign. By combining wholesome pleasures and a healthy dose of self-indulgence  Mövenpick is passionate about creating elevated guest experiences that provide innate joy and transform the world into a realm of endless  playful possibilities.“Hotels to Indulge will inspire travelers to visit  stay  and enjoy Mövenpick along their journeys  where indulgence is deftly woven into every element of the guest experience ” said Alexander Schellenberger  Chief Brand Officer  Accor. “The campaign feeds off the brand’s philosophy of indulgence done right  which includes everything from the daily Chocolate Hour ritual at Mövenpick hotels to the brand’s planet-loving initiatives that nourish our world. It’s a wholehearted invitation to experience a hotel stay that satisfies the appetite – for love  connection  exploration  and life.”The brand’s heritage and philosophy of “indulgence done right” originated from Mövenpick founder Ueli Prager’s vision and his belief that  “We don’t do anything that’s really extraordinary. We are successful because we simply do ordinary things in an extraordinary way.” With Hotels to Indulge  Mövenpick will be “the” destination for food culture that brings people together  enables connections  stirs emotions  and creates magical culinary moments travelers and locals aspire to experience.The new campaign underpins a vital part of the brand’s strategic plan to elevate brand awareness  strengthen its premium positioning  enhance relevancy with core and younger audiences  and deepen engagement and advocacy through elevated  unpretentious and authentic experiences. Hotels to Indulge launches in September 2022 with a strategic media plan focused on engaging audiences across social and digital channels.“Mövenpick does premium hotels but also delicious chocolate  ice cream  coffee and wine. Conceptually  the campaign is whimsical and fairy-tale like  representing places where you take a piece off the wall and it is made of something sweet. Going back to the very roots of the brand  we found a lot of humour  hedonism  culinary moments and bon vivants. The hotels really do have indulgence at their core  an indulgence done right  like the Swiss expertly know how to do. Take the chocolate and cream staircase of Dubai  the honey drop from Marrakesh or the raspberry macaroon from Zürich. Those are clear invitations to a yummy tucked up stay ” said Jean-Guilhem Lamberti  Chief Creative Officer  Accor.Source: AccorSource: AccorAs part of the campaign kick-off  Mövenpick has partnered with famed pâtissier Eric Lanlard  affectionately known as 'Cake-Boy ' for exclusive culinary moments in select markets  beginning with the Middle East. This fall  Mövenpick will invite influencers and content creators to participate in a Weekend of Indulgence with Eric Lanlard at Mövenpick Resort Al Marjan Island. This will be the first in a series of events at Mövenpick properties worldwide that will feature experiences such as chocolate master classes  custom amenities  chocolate-inspired social hours  and sensational dinners. An exclusive Mövenpick Chocolate Hour concept designed by Eric Lanlard will also be offered across 15 hotels and resorts in the Middle East  Africa and Turkey that will surely surprise and delight guests.In addition to on-property events  the Hotels to Indulge campaign will feature a social media contest encouraging individuals to share unexpected  unscripted moments of joy. These could range from random acts of kindness or serendipitously running into a favorite football player to capturing a child’s reaction to their first bite of chocolate cake or seeing snow-capped mountains for the first time. Though times are uncertain  the social campaign is one-way Mövenpick is taking action to remind people that life is full of small moments of joy and that we must all strive to embrace and celebrate them. To participate  fans of the brand can simply post photos or videos on Instagram using the hashtag #HotelsToIndulge. Mövenpick will work in collaboration with a curated group of select partners to encourage their online community to share unexpected stories that move them the most for a chance to win exciting prizes. The contest will launch on 01 October 2022 and conclude on 30 December 2022. See Mövenpick Hotels-to-Indulge Terms & Conditions for further details.“Mövenpick  deeply understands the pleasure that a touch of culinary artistry can bring ” said Eric Lanlard  aka Cake-Boy. “It is a joy to work with Mövenpick and help create those magical  unexpected moments that happen when a guest participates in a culinary creation they’ve never experienced before  or a taste that will forever connect them to a special place and time. It is undeniable that food experiences while traveling create powerful memories.”Moreover  Mövenpick is furthering its brand promise to nourish the world and promote social change with its annual Kilo of Kindness charitable campaign. Launching in October  the seventh annual Kilo of Kindness campaign will invite guests  visitors and the Mövenpick community to donate food  clothing or educational supplies to disadvantaged communities worldwide. More than 45 Mövenpick hotels across Africa  Asia  Europe and the Middle East are set to support the campaign and distribute donations in partnership with local charities.Having originated in 1948 as a restaurant aimed at demystifying fine dining  Mövenpick possesses a rich expertise in gastronomic innovation. The brand’s culinary history remains a key source of inspiration for its hospitality vision and is brought to life in the Hotels to Indulge campaign imagery – through the use of food as a visual metaphor for indulgent yet accessible experiences offered at Mövenpick properties around the globe.For more information  please visit movenpick.com.*Insights sourced from Foresight Factory 2022 Wellness Survey.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.On the 11 September  at the ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) 2022 conference  the Company presented a poster on ongoing lacutamab Phase 1b trial design in monotherapy in PTCL.ANKET™ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):The Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi continues  evaluating IPH6101/SAR’579  the first NKp46/CD16-based NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).During the period  Sanofi informed the Company of the decision to progress IPH6401/SAR’514 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies  triggering a €3 million milestone payment. IPH6401/SAR’514 is a BCMA-targeting NK cell engager using Sanofi’s proprietary CROSSODILE® multi-functional platform  which comprises the Cross-Over-Dual-Variable-Domain (CODV) format. It induces a dual targeting of the NK activating receptors  NKp46 and CD16  for an optimized NK cell activation  based on Innate’s ANKETTM proprietary platform. IPH6401/SAR’514 has shown anti-tumor activity and promising drug properties in pre-clinical models. Sanofi will be responsible for all future development  manufacturing and commercialization of IPH6401/SAR’514.Innate plan to provide updates on IPH65  the tetra-specific ANKETTM  throughout the year as progress is made toward IND-enabling studies in 2023.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:On April 29  Innate announced a $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca was triggered for dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 clinical trial  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).Detailed results from the randomized AstraZeneca-sponsored Phase 2 COAST clinical trial  including monalizumab data in combination with durvalumab  were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on April 22. The results were initially presented during the ESMO Congress 2021. The results of the interim analysis showed monalizumab in combination with durvalumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to durvalumab alone in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who had not progressed after concurrent CRT. The Journal of Clinical Oncology publication now includes exploratory subgroup analysis.On April 11 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting  there was an oral presentation from the AstraZeneca-sponsored Phase 2 NeoCOAST randomized trial in resectable  early-stage NSCLC. The presentation highlighted improved disease responses with durvalumab in combination with monalizumab  oleclumab or danvatirsen  when compared to durvalumab alone. The follow-up randomized Phase 2 clinical trial  NeoCOAST-2  is enrolling patients with resectable  stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC to receive neoadjuvant durvalumab combined with chemotherapy and either oleclumab or monalizumab  followed by surgery and adjuvant durvalumab plus oleclumab or monalizumab.As a post-period event  on August 1  Innate announced that a planned futility interim analysis of the INTERLINK-1 study Phase 3 sponsored by AstraZeneca did not meet a pre-defined threshold for efficacy. The company announced that  based on the result and the recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee  the study was to be discontinued. There were no new safety findings. AstraZeneca plan to share the data in due course. The INTERLINK-1 study  sponsored by AstraZeneca  evaluated monalizumab in combination with cetuximab vs. cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors.On the 12 September at the ESMO 2022 congress  AstraZeneca presented an oral presentation on the Phase 2 NeoCOAST study assessing the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and oleclumab or monalizumab and adjuvant treatment in patients with resectable  early-stage NSCLC.IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:On June 3  Innate announced that IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca  will advance into a Phase 2 clinical trial in lung cancer. Innate received in August 2022 a $5 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca and will be responsible for conducting the study. AstraZeneca and Innate will share study costs and AstraZeneca will supply clinical trial drugs. AstraZeneca conducted a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab. The data are expected to be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in due course.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):The investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 (CHANCES)  in collaboration with Institut Paoli-Calmettes is underway. The trial will be conducted in two parts  Part 1  the dose escalation  followed by a Part 2 safety expansion study cohort. Part 2 will evaluate IPH5301 in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in HER2+ cancer patients.Preclinical updates:During the period  the Company received from AstraZeneca a notice that it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the ""Future Programs Option Agreement"". This option agreement was part 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and Innate. Innate has now regained full rights to further develop the four preclinical molecules.Corporate Update:On May 03  Innate announced the commencement of an At-The-Market (ATM) program  pursuant to which it may  from time to time  offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million American Depositary Shares (“ADS”). Each ADS representing one ordinary share of Innate. As of June 30  2022  the balance available under our May 2022 sales agreement remains at $75 million.Announced on 20 May 2022  as part of the resolutions voted by shareholders  Dr Sally Bennett was appointed as new member of the Supervisory Board. She was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee during the Supervisory Board Meeting of May 20  2022. On the same day it was announced that Mr Patrick Langlois decided to resign from his mandate of Supervisory Board member of Innate Pharma.Financial highlights for the first half of 2022:The key elements of Innate’s financial position and financial results as of and for the six-month period ended June 30  2022 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €158.2 million (€m) as of June 30  2022 (€159.7m2 as of December 31  2021).Revenue and other income from continuing operations 3 amounted to €45.6m in the first half of 2022 (€14.7m in the first half of 2021) and mainly comprise of: Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements  which mainly resulted from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca and Sanofi and which are recognized on the basis of the percentage of completion of the works performed by the Company under such agreements: (i) Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements for monalizumab increased by €10.3m to €16.4m in the first half of 2022 (€6.1m in the first half of 2021). This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4m ($14.0m) triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28  2022. This change in the transaction price generated a €12.5 million favorable cumulative adjustment in the revenue related to monalizumab agreements for the first half of 2022  partially offset by effects of the decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period as compared to the first half of 2021  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity; (ii) Revenue related to IPH5201 for the six months ended June 30  2022 amounted to €4.8m and results from the entire recognition in revenue of the $5.0m milestone payment received in August 2022 from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1  2022 of an amendment to the initial contract signed in October 2018. This amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following AstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study; (iii) During the period  the Company received from AstraZeneca a notice that it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the ""Future Programs Option Agreement"". This option agreement was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and the Company under which the Company received an upfront payment of $20.0m (€17.4m). Innate has now regained full rights to further develop the four preclinical molecules. Consequently  the entire initial payment of $20.0m  or €17.4m was recognized as revenue as of June 30  2022. (iv) During the period  the Company was informed of Sanofi's decision to advance IPH6401/SAR'514 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. As such  Sanofi has selected a second multispecific antibody engaging NK cells as a drug candidate. This selection triggered a €3.0m milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022. This amount was received by the Company on September 9  2022. Government funding for research expenditures of €4.3m in the first half of 2022 (€6.4m in the first half of 2021).amounted to €45.6m in the first half of 2022 (€14.7m in the first half of 2021) and mainly comprise of:Operating expenses from continuing operations are €37.1m in the first half of 2022 (€33.9m in the first half of 2021)  of which 67.3% (€25.0m) are related to R&D. R&D expenses from continuing operations increased by €3.7m to €25.0m in the first half of 2022 (€21.2m in the first half of 2021). This change mainly results from (i) a €0.7m increase in direct R&D expenses relating to lacutamab clinical program and to non-clinical programs  notably IPH65  partially offset by the decrease in others clinical programs expenses; (ii) a €1.7m increase in personnel expenses mainly explained by the increase in share-based payments and (iii) the increase in other R&D expenses explained by the provision relating to the payment to be made to Orega Biotech SAS upon receipt of the $5.0m milestone payment from AstraZeneca under the IPH5201 collaboration and agreement following the amendment signed on June 1  2022.General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing operations decreased by €0.5m to €12.1m in the first half of 2022 (€12.6m in the first half of 2021).A loss on the Lumoxiti discontinued operations amounting to €0.1m (€6.2m for the first half of 2021). As a reminder  the Company recorded  as of June 30  2021  a provision for charges relating to the payment of €5.2 million ($6.2 million) to AstraZeneca under the Lumoxiti transition and termination agreement effective as of June 30  2021. Persuant to the April 2022 underlied agreement  the amount of €5.9 million ($6.2 million) was paid by the Company.A net financial loss of €2.1m in the first half of 2022 (net financial gain of €1.7m in the first half of 2021)  principally as a result of the decrease in fair value of certain of our financial instruments due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 health crisis as well as the Ukrainian crisis on the financial markets.A net income of €6.3m for the first half of 2022 (net loss of €23.7m for the first half of 2021).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30  2022  including 2021 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share June 30  2022 June 30  2021(1) Revenue and other income 45 589 14 671 Research and development expenses (24 956) (21 208) General and administrative expenses (12 140) (12 643) Operating expenses (37 096) (33 851) Operating income (loss) 8 494 (19 179) Net financial income (loss) (2 118) 1 709 Income tax expense — — Net income (loss) from continuing operations 6 376 (17 470) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (73) (6 249) Net income (loss) 6 303 (23 719) Weighted average number of shares ( in thousands) : 79 754 78 998 - Basic income (loss) per share 0.08 (0.30) - Diluted income (loss) per share 0.08 (0.30) -Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations 0.08 (0.22) - Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations 0.08 (0.22) -Basic income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — (0.08) - Diluted income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — (0.08)(1) Comparative relating to the six months ended June 30  2021 have been restated to reflect the impact of the classification of Lumoxiti's activities as discontinued operations in 2021.June 30  2022 December 31 2021 Cash  cash equivalents and financial assets 158 156 159 714 Total assets 280 430 267 496 Total shareholders’ equity 116 333 107 440 Total financial debt 43 374 44 251About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of Natural Killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

These revenues mainly result from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca and Sanofi and which are recognized on the basis of the percentage of completion of the works performed by the Company under such agreements.The evolution for the first half of 2022 is mainly due to:A €10.3 million increase in revenue related to monalizumab  to €16.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  as compared to €6.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4 million ($14.0 million) triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28  2022. This change in the transaction price generated a €12.5 million favorable cumulative adjustment in the revenue related to monalizumab agreements for the first half of 2022  partially offset by effects of the decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period as compared to the first half of 2021  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity. As of June 30  2022  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab was €17.3 million (€9.0 million as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” and €8.3 million as “Deferred revenue—Non-current portion).A €4.8 million increase in revenue related to IPH5201 for the six months ended June 30  2022 amounted to and results from the entire recognition in revenue of the $5.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1  2022 of an amendment to the initial contract signed in October 2018. This amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following AstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The Company will conduct the study. Both parties will share the external cost related to the study and incurred by the Company and AstraZeneca will provide products necessary to conduct the clinical trial.During the period  the Company received from AstraZeneca a notice that it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the ""Future Programs Option Agreement"". This option agreement was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and the Company under which the Company received an upfront payment of $20.0m (€17.4m). Innate has now regained full rights to further develop the four preclinical molecules. Consequently  the entire initial payment of $20.0m  or €17.4 million was recognized as revenue as of June 30  2022.A €1.2 million decrease in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs. Pursuant to our agreements with AstraZeneca  clinical costs for the ongoing Phase 1 trial of avdoralimab and external research and development costs related to IPH5201 are equally shared between Innate Pharma and AstraZeneca  resulting in periodic settlement invoices. These costs are invoiced back on a quarterly basis. This change is mainly explained by the decrease in research and development costs incurred by the Company under these agreements.A €2.0 million increase in revenue from collaboration and research license agreements with Sanofi  to €3.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  as compared to €1.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. During the period  the Company was informed of Sanofi's decision to advance IPH6401/SAR'514 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. As such  Sanofi has selected a second multispecific antibody engaging NK cells as a drug candidate. This selection triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022. This amount was received by the Company on September 9  2022.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment financing for research expenditures decreased by €2.0 million  or 32.2%  to €4.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to €6.4 million the six months ended June 30  2021. This change is primarily a result of a decrease in the research tax credit (CIR) of €0.7 million  which is mainly due to (i) a decrease in eligible subcontracting costs included in research tax credit calculation  in connection with the end of the doubling of public subcontracting expenses eligible for the CIR since January 1  2022  but also to the decrease in private R&D subcontracting over the period due to the maturity of clinical trials. In addition  this decrease is also explained by the deduction from the CIR calculation base of the remaining financing received over the period relating to FORCE (FOR COVID-19 Elimination) trial ; (ii) in addition  there is a €1.4 million decrease in grants in connection with the recording in revenue in the first half of 2021 of the first tranche of the repayable advance paid to the Company and linked to the BPI financing contract signed in August 2020. This payment was received by the Company at contract signing. This financing contract was set up as part of the program set up by the French government to help develop a therapeutic solution with a preventive or curative aim against COVID-19. As of June 30  2021  this financing was considered by the Company to be non-refundable   in accordance with the terms of the agreement  in light of the technical and commercial failure of the project based on the results of the Phase 2 ""Force"" trial evaluating avdoralimab in COVID-19  published on July 6  2021.The Company is again eligible to the SME status under European Union criteria since December 31  2021. Consecutively  the Company is eligible for the early repayment by French treasury of the 2021 research tax credit during the fiscal year 2022.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the six months periods ended June 30  2022 and 2021:In thousands of euros June 30  2022 June 30  2021 (1) Research and development expenses (24 956) (21 208) General and administrative expenses (12 140) (12 643) Operating expenses (37 096) (33 851)(1) Comparative relating to the six months ended June 30  2021 have been restated to reflect the impact of the classification of Lumoxiti's activities as discontinued operations in 2021.Research and development expensesResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses from continuing operations increased by €3.7 million  or 17.7%  to €25.0 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  as compared to €21.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2021  representing a total of 67.3% and 62.7% of the total operating expenses  respectively. R&D expenses include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  and personnel expenses.Direct R&D expenses increased by €0.7 million  or 5.9%  to €12.4 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  as compared to €11.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. This increase is mainly explained by (i) an increase of 1.7 million euros in expenses relating to the lacutamab program as well as (ii) an increase of 1.4 million euros in expenses relating to the IPH65 preclinical program partially offset by (iii) the decrease expenses related to the avdoralimab and monalizumab programs for respectively 1.8 million euros and 0.7 million euros. These decreases follow (i) the decision taken by the Company at the end of the first half of 2020 to stop recruitment in trials evaluating avdoralimab in oncology and (ii) the maturity of phase I/II clinical trials entering the scope of the collaboration with AstraZeneca regarding monalizumab.Also  as of June 30  2022  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €73.1 million  as compared to collaborations liabilities to €40.4 million as of December 31  2021. This increase of €32.7 million mainly results from (i) the increase in the collaboration commitment for an amount of €34.3 million ($36.0 million USD) in connection with the launch of the PACIFIC-9 Phase 3 trial by AstraZeneca on April 28  2022  and (ii) the increase in the collaboration commitment in the amount of €3.7 million in connection with the observed exchange rate fluctuations over the period for the euro-dollar parity  partially offset by (iii) net reimbursements of €5.0 million made in the first half of 2022 to AstraZeneca relating to the co-financing of the monalizumab program  mainly including the Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 trial launched in October 2020.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D increased by €3.1 million  or 32.1%  to €12.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  as compared to an amount of €9.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. This increase is mainly due to (i) the increase of €1.7 million in personnel expenses allocated to research and development  of which €1.1 million related to share-based payments (implementation of an employee savings plan remunerated in free shares in particular) and (ii) the increase of €1.6 million in other expenses allocated to research and development in particular in connection with (a) the provision for charges in the amount of €0.6 million expensed in respect of the payment to be issued to the Company Orega Biotech SAS upon receipt of the milestone payment of $5.0m from AstraZeneca  following the signature on June 1  2022 of an amendment to the initial IPH5201 contract signed in October 2018 and (b) the increase of €0.6 million in non-scientific fees allocated to research and development in view of an increase in the use of external service providers in the first half of 2022.General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative expenses from continuing activities decreased by €0.5 million  or 4.0%  to €12.1 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  as compared to general and administrative expenses of €12.6 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. Selling  general and administrative expenses represented a total of 32.7% and 37.3% of the total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30  2022 and 2021  respectively.Personnel expense includes the compensation paid to our employees  and increased by €0.6 million  to €5.8 million for the six months ended June 30  2022  as compared to €5.2 million for six months ended June 30  2021. This increase of €0.6 million is mainly due to the increase in share-based payments  in particular in connection with the implementation of an employee savings plan paid in bonus shares.Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing  accounting  taxation and legal fees as well as consulting fees in relation to business strategy and operations and hiring services. Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses decreased by €0.3 million  or 10.4%  to €2.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to €2.5 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease in fees in connection with (i) the services of lawyers relating to the arbitration procedure between the Company and Orega Biotech concerning the joint ownership of certain patents relating to IPH5201  settled at the end of 2021 and (ii) the services provided in 2021 as part of support for the application of internal control standards in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act following the Nasdaq listing of the Company in October 2019.The fall in other expenses of €0.8m mainly results from non recurring provisions for liabilities and charges booked in the 1st half of 2021 reversed in 1st half of 2022.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial loss of €2.1 million in the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to a net financial gain of €1.7 million in the six months ended June 30  2021. This variance mainly results from the variance in fair value of our financial instruments (net gain of €1.0 million as compared to a net loss of €2.3 million for the six months ended June 30  2021 and 2022  respectively). The decline in the fair value of our financial instruments observed in the first half of 2022 results from the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis as well as the Ukrainian crisis on the financial markets.Net loss from discontinued operationsAs a reminder  further to the decision to terminate the Lumoxiti Agreement and termination notice sent in December 2020  a Termination and Transition Agreement was discussed and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 terminating the Lumoxiti Agreement as well as Lumoxiti related agreements (including the supply agreement  the quality agreement and other related agreements) and transferring of the U.S. marketing authorization and distribution rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. Consecutively  the activities related to Lumoxiti are presented as a discontinued operation as of October 1  2021 (and for all subsequent and prior period).As a consequence  net loss from discontinued operations relating to Lumoxiti for the six months ended June 30 2022  decreased by €6.2m as compared to net loss from discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30  2021. Net loss for the six months ended June 30  2021 mainly resulted from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m (€5.2m as of June 30  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and non-current financial assets amounted to €158.2 million as of June 30  2022  as compared to €159.7 million as of December 31  2021. Net cash as of June 30  2022 amounted to €92.5 million (€89.1 million as of December 31  2021). Net cash is equal to cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments less current financial liabilities.The other key balance sheet items as of June 30  2022 are:Deferred revenue of €17.4 million (including €8.3 million booked as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’) and collaboration liabilities of €73.1 million (including €59.0 million booked as ‘Collaboration liabilities - non-current portion’) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca not yet recognized as revenue or used as part of the co-financing of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca;Receivables from the French government amounting to €44.4 million in relation to the research tax credit for 2019 to 2021 and the six-month period ended June 30  2022;Intangible assets for a net book value of €43.3 million  mainly corresponding to the rights and licenses relating to the acquisition of the monalizumab and avdoralimab;Shareholders’ equity of €116.3 million  including the net income of the period of €6.3 million;Cash-flow itemsAs of June 30  2022  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €102.9 million  compared to €103.8 million as of December 31  2021  corresponding in a decrease of €0.8 million.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash flow used by operations of €1.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to net cash flows used by operations of €31.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. This increase mainly results from the collection of €47.7 million  in June 2022  following the treatment of the first patient in the second Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating monalizumab  “PACIFIC-9”. This increase is partially offset by the €5.9 million payment to AstraZeneca on April 20  2022 persuant to the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement. As a reminder  net cash flow used in operating activities for the first half of 2021 included €8.0 million of proceeds from Sanofi in January and February 2021  under the IPH6101/SAR443579 agreement signed in 2016. Restated for these transactions  net cash flow used in operating activities for the first half of 2022 increases by €1.4 million as compared to the first half of 2021. This change results from the increase of the outflows in relation with the Company’s operating activities  notably the net collaboration liabilities outflows related to the monalizumab collaboration agreement. Net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation amounted to €5.5 million for the first half of 2022  as compared to €4.4 million for the first half of 2021. The amount consumed for the first half of 2022 relates to the payment of €5.5 million ($6.2 million) made to AstraZeneca in April 2022 in accordance with the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021.Net cash flow used in investing activities of €0.4 million  as compared to €0.2 million for the first half of 2021. The Company has not made any investments in tangible  intangible or significant financial assets during the first half of 2022 and 2021. Net cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for the first half of 2022 and 2021  respectively.Net cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30  2022  are stable as compared to the six months ended June 30  2021. These consumptions are mainly related to repayments of financial liabilities. Net cash flows consumed by financing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for the first half of 2022 and 2021  respectively.Post period eventsOn August 1  2022  the Company announced that the combination of monalizumab and cetuximab did not reach the pre-specified efficacy threshold in the protocol-planned interim futility analysis of the Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 clinical study conducted by AstraZeneca. AstraZaneca has thus informed the Company that the study will be discontinued. Consequently  the Company is not eligible for the additional payment of $50.0 million as provided for in the amendment signed in September 2020 relating to the monzalizumab collaboration and license agreement entered into with AstraZeneca in 2015. All other development and commercial milestone payments related to the agreement remain unchanged.In August 2022  the Company communicated to Société Générale and BNP Paribas its desire to use the capital repayment extension options of the two State-Guaranteed Loans (“PGE”) contracted in December 2021. As a reminder  the Company had obtained non-dilutive financing of 28.7 million in the form of two PGEs from Société Générale (20.0 million euros) and BNP Paribas (8.7 million euros) with a maturity initial of one year with an option to extend up to five years. Discussions are currently underway with Société Générale and BNP Paribas regarding the conditions for extending repayment and the effective interest rate of loans. At the date of this report  the Company has obtained agreements in principle from Société Générale and BNP Paribas concerning financing rates after extension option of 1.56% and 0.95% respectively  excluding insurance and guarantee premium with an excess for the whole of 2023.NotaThe interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30  2022 have been subject to a limited review by our Statutory Auditors and were approved by the Executive Board of the Company on September 14  2022.

Artprice by Artmarket.comIn the context of a serious global energy crisis (probably only just beginning)  Artmarket.com has been closely watching the transition to a totally carbon-free blockchain. This is now a reality with Ethereum 2.0 after its ""The Merge"" operation. Indeed  according to its founder  Vitalik Buterin  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests  ""The Merge"" – a switch from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS) – will reduce the energy consumption of the ETH Blockchain by over 99.95%  (source: https://ethereum.foundation/).Before the transition had even been rolled out  Ethereum (ETH) managed to capture the interest of web 2 giant  Google  whose web 3 team  motivated by Ethereum's initiative  rushed to post a doodle displaying a countdown to the ""The Merge"" transition. Google's move represents a superb victory for the cryptocurrency and an extremely advantageous consecration for Ethereum 2.0.In a global context where concerns about what may be called ""the energy war"" and about global warming are reaching paroxysmal levels  this news is absolutely vital. As a result of this initiative  the Central Bank of Norway – a country where ecological issues are given top priority – has announced it will build its MNBC (central bank digital currency) on Ethereum. Meanwhile  the Bank of America now sees Ethereum as a virtuous investment by referring to it as ""green giant"".The art market can only benefit from ""The Merge"". The French newspaper Le Parisien reports Joe Lubin  Ethereum's co-creator  as saying ""many digital artists and art collectors were reluctant to acquire digital works that involved burning so much fossil fuel to produce them… With this transition  these concerns are receding and interesting projects are going to start right from the production of the very first chain blocks after ""the merge"". It's going to liberate a tremendous amount of creative energy.""Lubin adds  ""It won't directly affect Russian gas or gasoline prices  but it will be a powerful message sent to the world when we replace highly energy-consuming mining by a structure that consumes the electricity needed to produce a cup of coffee. It's a profound change that will happen just like an automatic smartphone update.""Artmarket.com therefore expects to see an exponential growth in artistic creation  and that of the art-NFT market in particular. A number of famous artists have already turned towards art-NFTs  as have a number of major art museums. Over the past year  Artmarket.com has expressed its preference for the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain  particularly during its AGM and in its various financial press releases  and it has put all its IT and human resources into confirming its success with NFTs and the Metaverse which represents the backbone of web 3.0. The world famous Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is considering an upcoming sale for around 70 million dollars of works of art via Sotheby's  with the possibility of investing the proceeds from these sales in the purchase of NFTs  on the advice of a team of experts in charge of following the NFT markets and finding the most promising artists there.According to Artprice by Artmarket's CEO and founder thierry Ehrmann  ""In the history of cryptocurrencies  The Merge operation  this 15 september 2022  represents a founding and irrevocable date for Web 3.0 and for art-NFTs  and it could well generate a 'flippening' with Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization in the coming months.""Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/09/image1-ethereum_themerge-artprice-by-artmarket-com.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Production was carried out at the demo plant in Leuna  Germany  which has now been dismantled. While these volumes enabled a number of process validations  the production cost was too high to allow the marketing of isobutene or its derivatives on this basis. However  a marketing approach was identified: isododecane  a derivative obtained by combining three isobutene molecules  is the basis for the formulation of all longwear eyes and lips make-up. It is systematically used as the No. 1 ingredient in terms of proportion and cannot currently be replaced by any other compound. The Company moved up the value chain as far as the end customer and has produced the first make-up range combining longwear properties and naturalness of over 90%. This led to the creation of the LAST® brand.Florence Hébert  Head of the LAST® Business Unit  said: “The LAST® product range was designed to combine performance with naturalness: it breaks the mould for natural-origin make-up. Besides being marketed via our website www.colors-that-last.com  the brand is now available at several physical and digital sales outlets. The brand should soon be distributed by a major retail chain  and we expect new points of sale to open in 2023  both in France and abroad.”The second horizon is just beginning and involves producing isobutene in tens of tonnes per year. A fully French value chain has been set up comprising five stages  four of which are carried out at toller facilities. Only the second stage  involving the production of isobutene itself  takes place in a unit owned by Global Bioenergies. This unit has been built over the last few months at the Pomacle site near Reims. The construction phase is now complete  and commissioning is underway. The unit is expected to reach maximum capacity of nearly two tonnes of isobutene per week by the end of 2022. Part of this isobutene will be converted into isododecane and sold as a make-up ingredient to major cosmetics industry players under the Isonaturane® 12 brand.Daphne Galvez  Global Bioenergies Commercial Director  said: “The first batch comprising several tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 will be delivered in the first quarter of 2023. A large portion of this batch has been purchased by L’Oréal. We then plan to produce a further batch by summer 2023 and another towards the end of the year. Global Bioenergies is currently being listed with around ten manufacturers  some of whom have already purchased volumes for testing  in particular as formulation pilots. In total  we plan to deliver around 15 tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 in 2023. The debottlenecking of the downstream part of the value chain by our tollers would enable us to produce and deliver greater volumes from 2024 onwards.”The isobutene not converted into Isonaturane® 12 will be sold directly or converted into other compounds of the isobutene product tree in order to trigger the start of commercial operations for the third horizon.The third horizon will consist of constructing and commissioning in 2025 a plant capable of producing 2 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year. This operation will be headed by an SPV  which is currently being set up and will initially be a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Bioenergies. The production cost of isobutene and its derivatives will be significantly reduced due to major economies of scale and the fuller integration of production stages. Isonaturane® 12 sales will target not only the make-up market  but also the much larger skincare and haircare markets. The plant may also be able to serve other markets  including materials and fuels.Ronan Euzen  Global Bioenergies Head of Business Development  explained: “Numerous discussions have recently taken place with manufacturers in areas as diverse as rubber  gas and industrial solvents. Times are changing and the entire industry is now actively searching for ways of limiting its consumption of petroleum products. The road fuel sector in particular is undergoing a radical change: European announcements on the possible phase-out of combustion vehicles have tied their destiny to that of biofuels. Niche markets will be exploitable as of the third horizon.”The fourth horizon  which is expected to take shape within five years  will consist of setting up a unit to produce tens of thousands of tonnes of isobutene per year at a reduced cost  enabling the aviation fuel market to be targeted. Many Western countries are strongly committed to reducing CO 2 emissions in this sector with its high environmental impact.Bernard Chaud  Head of Industrial Strategy at Global Bioenergies  said: “The certification of our technology for air transport is on track. Achieving the performance improvement targets set by our R&D division will enable our process for converting residual sugars into sustainable aviation fuel to reach competitive costs. As such  we are looking to significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of air transport on a global scale.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  concluded: “The creation of a new industry always relies on niche markets initially. The multiple niche markets for isobutene and its derivatives have prompted us to draw up a roadmap with four horizons  and will enable our Company  despite its small size  to realistically tackle a challenge as broad as environmental transition.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST® in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane®12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint.

These branches experience a minimum annual growth of more than 10% in their respective turnover  they generate a positive operating result or very close to balance  they are now autonomous in terms of financing.The UDT division holds a portfolio of assets whose cumulative value in 2021 was around €8 million  a value doubled compared to the amounts initially invested. As a company whose only activity is to hold minority stakes in the drone sector  UDT does not generate revenue or operating expenses  as the company has no employees and relies on the infrastructure of Delta Drone SA.The group's financial losses are therefore concentrated on the 4th branch (Delta Drone SA). They result from a high operating cost compared to an incipient turnover  which is still insufficient to cover the expenses. »In order to comply with its business plan  which aims to achieve a balance in operating income for the 2023 financial year  Delta Drone has strongly stepped up its actions to reduce the level of operating expenses of the 4th branch (Delta Drone SA and its support subsidiaries in France):-In recent weeks  Delta Drone and its French subsidiaries Delta Drone Experts and Technidrone have recorded the cumulative departure of 11 employees  including 9 by way of economic dismissal and 2 resulting from resignations. The consequence of these operations will make it possible to start the year 2023 with an annual payroll amount of approximately €1.3 million for these three combined entities (For the record  they represented an annual payroll of nearly €3 million at the end of 2021).A programme to reduce general operating expenses has been put in place  which aims to reduce them from €2.5 million to €1.5 million by the end of 2022 at the latest  taking into account the implementation deadlines.At the request of its parent company Delta Drone SA  the subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering (design office activity) was placed in safeguard on August 31  2022 by the Commercial Court of Nantes. This subsidiary employs 14 people and corresponds to approximately €1 million in annual operating expenses. The objective of this approach is to be part of a calendar of a few months at most  devoted to the reorganization of the operation of the entity: it makes it possible to initiate discussions with new customers and / or partners  outside the group  likely to buy ""engineering time"" in the context of R&D projects and thus to cover all or part of the costs.In this new configuration  the rationalization of operating costs is closely linked to the achievement of business objectives (sales and services) related to the isS Spotter (security) and Countbot (logistics) professional solutions  to achieve the operating profit balance in 2023.All solutions combined  the development plan is based on about thirty systems sold and sixty missions carried out in 2023. To date  the progress of many commercial discussions makes it possible to validate the coherence of these objectivesN new bond issueDelta Drone (the ""Company"") issued on July 15  2022 43 000 simple bonds (the ""OS"") with a nominal value of €56 at a price of €50 each  for gross proceeds of €2 150 000  as part of an issue reserved for the benefit of certain investors.

Consolidated balance sheet Shareholder capital 26.5 33.2 -20% Cash1 1.5 3.6 -58%Strong payment flow growthPayment volumes saw sustained growth at 12%  reaching 3.6 billion euros in the first semester of 2022.This performance can be put into perspective with:A challenging comparison base: with the first semester 2021 affected by various lockdowns in Europe.A particularly difficult and volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical context affecting consumer behaviour and business’s investment decisions.This significant growth in the first semester despite these external factors attests to the robustness of the HiPay model  as well as its ability to expand.On the basis of its omnichannel payment offering  HiPay is gaining market share: 151 new key accounts have been added.The group is also accelerating its international development with 36% of its payments occurring outside France  taking its strong commercial dynamics to other markets.Turnover evolutionOverall turnover has increased to 27.5 million euros (up 3% compared with S1 2021).This growth below that of payment volumes can be explained by a number of Belgian banks stopping certain Direct Banking payment methods. These volumes have transferred to other  less lucrative payment methods.Activity in France and elsewhere continues to grow strongly: turnovers have risen sharply from semester to semester  with increases of 25% and 27% per semester between 2019 and 2022 respectively (CAGR).At the group level  spending remains controlled: direct costs are increasing in proportion with flows and staff costs are progressing in a reasoned manner with the recruitment of new talent to consolidate the HiPay team.However  because the increase in turnover is not enough to cover the increase in these operational costs  the net result is -3.6 million euros.PerspectivesDuring the first semester of 2022  HiPay obtained additional funding totalling 3.25 million euros  demonstrating the ongoing support of its financial partners.For the 2022 financial period  HiPay aims to experience single-figure growth. The group is also adjusting its overheads in order to account for the expected difficulties caused by the current morose macroeconomic situation.Next financial disclosure:27 October 2022 (before the marketing opening) – Turnover for Quarter 3 2022-------------------1 Unaudited data-------------------About HiPayHiPay is a global payment services provider.

The following items are restated: asset depreciation and impairments (€21.7 million)  provisions for contingencies and charges (-€0.3 million)  provisions related to employee benefits (€0.9 million)  and the other expenses and income without any impact on cash position (€0.4 million)  and the impacts related to transfers (€0.1 million).5 As a reminder  in March 2021  IFRS IC issued a final decision on accounting for the costs of configuring and customizing software used under a SaaS contract. As at June 30  2021  the impacts were being analyzed  and the decision had not yet been applied when preparing the half-yearly accounts. The comparative information was therefore restated in the consolidated financial statements as at June 30  2022.The accounts were audited by the statutory auditors and reviewed by the board of directors on September 13  2022. The report of the statutory auditors is in the process of being issued. The statements and detailed presentation of the half-year results are available on the corporate site at corporate.virbac.com.Thanks to the Virbac teams’ constant dedication to animal health  we posted revenue in the first half of the year of €616.4 million  an increase of +16.4% compared to 2021. Excluding the favorable impact of exchange rates  revenue shows growth of +12.0%. This growth benefited in part from a favorable baseline effect representing one point of growth in revenue  attributable to new products acquired starting in the second quarter of 2021.All areas are growing organically at the end of June. It should be noted  however  that double-digit growth in Europe stalled in the last quarter  due to the slowdown in the market as anticipated in our annual outlook. Thus  the revenue in this area increased by +6.8% at real rates (+6.2% at constant rates)  thanks mainly to the contribution of the United Kingdom  France and Italy. The area is supported by the strong dynamism of the pet ranges (in particular petfood  specialties  and vaccines)  which compensated for the decline in the ranges for production animals. In Asia-Pacific  growth at real rates was +19.8% (+15% at constant exchange rates). Australia and India are driving growth in the region  generating more than 85% of this growth  in particular on products for cattle  which largely compensates for the decline in China  which was heavily impacted by lockdowns at the beginning of the year and which  despite a rebound since May  remains down at the end of June. In Latin America  business grew by +25.1% at real rates (+14.6% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to contributions from Brazil and Mexico. Lastly  in the United States  business grew by +32.2% (+19.9% at constant exchange rates). It benefited from strong sales of new products launched in 2021 (Clomicalm and Itrafungol) and those launched in early 2022 (petfood  and Tulissin for the production animals segment)  as well as good performance on the dental and dermatology range.The current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions amounts to €117.4 million  a significant growth compared to the first half of 2021 (€104.4 million). This improvement is mainly due to the strong growth in our revenue  driven by strong performance in all areas  despite the slowdown in market dynamics seen since the beginning of the year. This was partially offset by a deterioration in the margin in relative terms  due to the impacts of inflation on raw material costs and operational expenses such as transport and energy. We are also seeing a rebound in business expenses (travel expenses  seminars  etc.)  post-Covid-19  as well as an increase in our R&D expenses as a result of our desire to increase our spending in this area. It should also be noted that the half-yearly result at the end of June 2022 benefits from the recognition of income of €3 million  the last compensation tranche for the continuation of R&D projects acquired from Elanco in 2021. As a reminder  the current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions from the first half of 2021 benefited from the recognition of non-recurring items in the amount of €6.6 million (€4 million in compensation for the continuation of R&D projects from Elanco  €1 million in additional margin on the Clomicalm and Itrafungol products which benefited from a zero cost of sales in connection with the acquisition  and €1.6 million from a reversal of a provision for disputes). After restating the positive impact of these items over the two periods  the ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions” to “revenue” at the end of June 2022 is 18.6%  slightly up compared to the same period of 2021 (18.5%).Consolidated net income was €77.6 million  up 5.2% compared to the first half of 2021. This improvement in our net income is explained by the reasons given above  in particular the growth of our business and the good control of our operating expenses  which remain contained as a proportion of our revenue  despite the inflationary pressure observed in the first half of 2022. It should be noted that our financial result corresponds to a charge of €8.1 million  which is significantly up from the first half of 2021 (charge of €1.6 million). This is explained by the drop in foreign exchange income (unrealized loss)  due to the depreciation of the Chilean peso against the euro and the US dollar in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This is only partially offset by the decrease in the cost of net debt of €2.5 million  resulting from the reduction in interest on rate hedges that matured in the second half of 2021 and in January 2022.Net income - Group share amounted to €77.5 million  i.e. an increase of 7.7% compared to the first half of the previous year (€72 million)  driven by operational performance  the elements shared above  and the decrease in the share of non-controlling interests as of June 30  2022  following the acquisition of 100% of Centrovet in the second half of 2021.On the financial side  our net financial excess amounts to €19.6 million at the end of June 2022  compared to €73.8 million at the end of December 2021. This deterioration over the first six months of the year is mainly due to the cyclical nature of our cash generation model  with cash generation occurring more in the second half of the year. This situation was exacerbated over the period by higher working capital requirements in the first half of 2022  due to the strong growth in our revenue  a reduction in the amount of factored receivables  higher capital expenditure  and finally the increase in dividends paid in respect of the results for 2021.It should be noted that on September 12  2022  Virbac unanimously obtained from its banks a one-year extension of the maturity of its €200 million syndicated financing contract  which is now fixed at October 2027.OutlookRevenue growth at constant exchange rates and scope is still expected to be in the range of 5% to 10% and will be refined when the third quarter revenues are published. The ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions” to “revenue” should consolidate at 15% at constant exchange rates  despite impacts from inflation. Finally  our debt relief should be around €30 million excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates. The increase in our working capital requirements due to the growth in our activity  inflation  and management decisions (safety stock  for example) has led us to adjust our debt reduction forecasts for 2022 downwards.ANALYSTS’ PRESENTATION - VIRBACWe will hold a virtual analyst meeting on Friday  September 16  2022 at 2:30 p.m. (Paris time - CEST).Information for participants:Webcast access link: https://bit.ly/3IUnx0tThis access link is available on the corporate.virbac.com site  under the heading “financial press releases.” This link allows participants to access the live and/or archived version of the webcast.You can ask questions via chat (text) directly during the webcast or after watching the replay at the following email address: finances@virbac.com.A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

10038,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/15/lightyear-opens-to-stocks-and-etfs-across-the-uk-and-europe/,Lightyear opens to stocks and ETFs across the UK and Europe,U.K.-based fintech Lightyear is extending its stock-trading offering to include a wide selection of U.K. and European stocks  as well as exchange traded funds (ETF). The news comes just a couple of months after Lightyear launched outside the U.K. for the firs…,U.K.-based fintech Lightyear is extending its stock-trading offering to include a wide selection of U.K. and European stocks  as well as exchange traded funds (ETF).The news comes just a couple of months after Lightyear launched outside the U.K. for the first time  arriving in 19 European markets  with the support of $25 million in fresh funding from U.S. VC giant Lightspeed and Richard Branson’s Virgin Group.Lightyear is one of numerous stock-trading companies that promise the average consumer an easy way to invest their money directly in some of the world’s biggest companies  in addition to ETFs which are essentially a collection of different stocks managed by investment experts. Launching in the U.K. market last year  London-based Lightyear initially only offered support for U.S.-based stocks  such as Apple and Tesla  but with its European launch in July the company opened up to a small selection of stocks trading on European stock exchanges  though this was for customers in the European Union (EU) only.Today’s announcement builds on that  by allowing all customers to invest in companies trading on the London Stock Exchange  and for the first time allowing U.K. customers to access stocks trading outside the U.S. — this includes stock exchanges in Germany  France and the Netherlands  as well as the U.K. On top of that  the limited selection of stocks that were available to European customers previously is expanding to include more companies trading on the Euronext in Paris  Brussels and Amsterdam.In addition to individual stocks  Lightyear is expanding to include a full gamut of U.K. and EU ETFs  which the company said has been the most-requested addition to the platform given that they are a good entry point for newbie investors who don’t follow the latest market ups and downs. With ETFs  which include the likes of BlackRock’s iShares  people can decide how much money they would like to invest and leave it to people whose job it is to follow the latest market trends  while it also diversifies their investment so that they aren’t putting all their eggs in the same volatile basket.Lightyear supported around 50 ETFs when it launched initially for EU customers in July  but with this latest expansion this will include around 100 more  a “big proportion” of which are aligned with the London Stock Exchange  according to Lightyear.Lightyear is up against a number of rival stock-trading entities  including Freetrade and even Wise (formerly TransferWise) which expanded into index investing last year. Lightyear  though  touts its business model as its big USP  in that it doesn’t charge account fees or commissions — instead  it leans entirely on foreign exchange fees  charging 0.35% on currency conversions. Previously  this fee only applied to monthly transactions of more than £3 000 ($3 500)  but moving forward it will apply to all currency conversions  though existing customers in the U.K. will continue to benefit from this through the end of 2022.All the new stocks and ETFs will be going live in the Lightyear app on October 17  and will take Lightyear’s roster of company stocks and ETFs to 3 500 in the U.S.  U.K.  Germany and the Netherlands — this represents a more than three-fold increase on the 1 000 U.S. stocks Lightyear launched with last September.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.9,0.07,0.03,True,English,"['Lightyear', 'stocks', 'ETFs', 'UK', 'Europe', 'U.S. VC giant Lightspeed', 'U.K.-based fintech Lightyear', 'U.S.-based stocks', 'exchange traded funds', 'good entry point', 'same volatile basket', 'London Stock Exchange', 'latest market ups', 'latest market trends', 'rival stock-trading entities', 'foreign exchange fees', 'U.K. market', '1,000 U.S. stocks', 'numerous stock-trading companies', 'European stock exchanges', 'U.K. customers', 'stock-trading offering', 'latest expansion', 'account fees', 'European stocks', '19 European markets', 'European launch', 'European Union', 'wide selection', 'first time', 'fresh funding', 'Richard Branson', 'Virgin Group', 'average consumer', 'easy way', 'different stocks', 'small selection', 'limited selection', 'European customers', 'individual stocks', 'full gamut', 'newbie investors', 'big proportion', 'index investing', 'business model', 'big USP', 'currency conversions', 'monthly transactions', 'new stocks', 'three-fold increase', 'last September', 'existing customers', 'biggest companies', 'investment experts', 'London-based Lightyear', 'EU customers', 'Lightyear app', 'company stocks', 'EU ETFs', '50 ETFs', 'news', 'months', 'support', 'money', 'world', 'addition', 'collection', 'Apple', 'Tesla', 'July', 'announcement', 'Germany', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'top', 'Euronext', 'Paris', 'Brussels', 'Amsterdam', 'platform', 'downs', 'likes', 'BlackRock', 'iShares', 'people', 'job', 'eggs', 'number', 'Freetrade', 'Wise', 'commissions', 'October', 'roster']",2022-09-15,2022-09-16,techcrunch.com

After securing a full European investment licence earlier this year  the company is now ready to launch these European instruments to customers in the UK  and bring some of the most popular UK stocks to retail investors all over Europe.Lightyear was founded by ex-Wise duo Martin Sokk and Mihkel Aamer to bring a global mindset to the European investment world. Customers around Europe traditionally have not had good access to investment opportunities outside their home country. With the exception of access to the US markets  connections between Europe’s most popular exchanges has been limited and costly. Today’s announcement signals a step change for retail investors in Europe to be able to invest in companies they care about and build a global portfolio with little-to-no fees.The new instruments feature stocks listed on exchanges all over Europe including the London Stock Exchange  Euronext and the DAX. Some of the UK’s household names like Tesco  Lloyds and Unilever are included in the first launch of UK stocks  alongside some popular European stocks such as L’Oreal  Heineken and Société Générale.The rollout of Exchange Traded Funds marks the company’s expansion into fund-based products. An ETF is a collection of hundreds or thousands of stocks or bonds  which is managed by experts in a single fund that trades on major stock exchanges  like the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. They are widely considered a great way to diversify a portfolio and a good entry point for newer investors  combining the benefits of diversified mutual funds with real-time pricing  but without high barriers to entry or minimum investment amounts.Lightyear recently raised a $25M Series A equity round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sir Richard Branson to power its expansion into 19 new European countries. The company’s seed investors  Mosaic Ventures  Taavet+Sten and Metaplanet also took part in the round alongside a number of new and existing angel investors.The fresh $25 million in funding supports the company’s expansion across Europe. Starting with 19 countries in the Eurozone alongside the UK  Lightyear became the first neobroker to unlock most of Europe in one move. With no trading fees  no account fees and no custody fees  Lightyear entered most European countries as the most competitively priced investment platform on the market. The only fee on Lightyear is a simple  flat 0.35% fee for currency conversion.Martin Sokk  Co-founder and CEO at Lightyear  adds: “One of our primary missions has always been to offer the people of Europe a low cost way to build a global portfolio.

More than 99% of people who develop celiac disease carry one of the genetic variants identified by empowerDX's new test. Symptoms can range from abdominal issues and joint pain to brain fog  depressed mood  and concentration issues. If left untreated  celiac disease can lead to serious health complications including heart disease  intestinal cancers  and fertility issues.The empowerDX Celiac Risk Gene Test provides access to high-quality HLA genetic testing – which typically requires specialized equipment and rare expertise – at a remarkable value.Unlike most blood-based celiac disease genetic tests  the empowerDX assay uses a sample taken from two non-invasive mouth swabs to analyze HLA markers.

Artprice by Artmarket.com (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)In the context of a serious global energy crisis (probably only just beginning)  Artmarket.com has been closely watching the transition to a totally carbon-free blockchain. This is now a reality with Ethereum 2.0 after its ""The Merge"" operation. Indeed  according to its founder  Vitalik Buterin  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests  ""The Merge"" – a switch from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS) – will reduce the energy consumption of the ETH Blockchain by over 99.95%  (source: https://ethereum.foundation/).Before the transition had even been rolled out  Ethereum (ETH) managed to capture the interest of web 2 giant  Google  whose web 3 team  motivated by Ethereum's initiative  rushed to post a doodle displaying a countdown to the ""The Merge"" transition. Google's move represents a superb victory for the cryptocurrency and an extremely advantageous consecration for Ethereum 2.0.In a global context where concerns about what may be called ""the energy war"" and about global warming are reaching paroxysmal levels  this news is absolutely vital. As a result of this initiative  the Central Bank of Norway – a country where ecological issues are given top priority – has announced it will build its MNBC (central bank digital currency) on Ethereum. Meanwhile  the Bank of America now sees Ethereum as a virtuous investment by referring to it as ""green giant"".The art market can only benefit from ""The Merge"". The French newspaper Le Parisien reports Joe Lubin  Ethereum's co-creator  as saying ""many digital artists and art collectors were reluctant to acquire digital works that involved burning so much fossil fuel to produce them… With this transition  these concerns are receding and interesting projects are going to start right from the production of the very first chain blocks after ""the merge"". It's going to liberate a tremendous amount of creative energy.""Lubin adds  ""It won't directly affect Russian gas or gasoline prices  but it will be a powerful message sent to the world when we replace highly energy-consuming mining by a structure that consumes the electricity needed to produce a cup of coffee. It's a profound change that will happen just like an automatic smartphone update.""Artmarket.com therefore expects to see an exponential growth in artistic creation  and that of the art-NFT market in particular. A number of famous artists have already turned towards art-NFTs  as have a number of major art museums. Over the past year  Artmarket.com has expressed its preference for the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain  particularly during its AGM and in its various financial press releases  and it has put all its IT and human resources into confirming its success with NFTs and the Metaverse which represents the backbone of web 3.0. The world famous Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is considering an upcoming sale for around 70 million dollars of works of art via Sotheby's  with the possibility of investing the proceeds from these sales in the purchase of NFTs  on the advice of a team of experts in charge of following the NFT markets and finding the most promising artists there.According to Artprice by Artmarket's CEO and founder thierry Ehrmann  ""In the history of cryptocurrencies  The Merge operation  this 15 september 2022  represents a founding and irrevocable date for Web 3.0 and for art-NFTs  and it could well generate a 'flippening' with Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization in the coming months.""Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/09/image1-ethereum_themerge-artprice-by-artmarket-com.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/Sept 16 (Reuters) - The possibility of India being included in global bond indexes this year has led to increased buying in a set of local securities.A decision on whether to include the south Asian country into the J.P.Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) could come as early as this month when the operators meet to review the composition of the index.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs expect India to be included in the index by 2023  with a 10% weightage  if an initial announcement is made this year.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterMeanwhile  Barclays said India could also possibly be added to the Bloomberg Global Aggregate bond index.WHAT PROMPTED TALKS OF INCLUSION?The Indian government began considering listing its securities for an inclusion in global bond indexes as far back as 2013.

The recurring digital processing revenue grew by 21.7% y/y to €55.9 million in H1 2022. The Group revenue grew by 13.6% y/y to €91.7 million over the same period. The customer base grew by a strong 14.9% in H1 2022 to reach close to one million customers. Unifiedpost was also able to bring the key investment phase of the European platform roll-out to a good end. This sets the Company in a unique position to take advantage of the expected market growth in the coming years driven by regulation. It also allows management to shift the focus towards becoming cash flow positive.HighlightsGroup revenue grew by 13.6% y/y to €91.7 million in H1 2022  with recurring digital processing revenue up 21.7% y/yStrong growth of customer base by 14.9% in H1 2022 compared to end 2021On the back of platform and roll-out investments  the Group EBITDA amounts to -€6.5 millionCash and cash equivalents amount to €42.7 million and an additional €39.3 million available in undrawn financing. Sufficient cash to allow Unifiedpost to achieve a positive cash flowBecoming cash flow positive by H2 2023 is the key priority for the CompanyCommenting on the H1 2022 results  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder stated: “I am proud of how our businesses have continued to grow in H1 2022. Unifiedpost again shows double-digit organic growth  while investing in the European expansion of our teams  solutions and products. Our performance is in line with management expectations and budget. The peak of our investments is now behind us. We strongly believe our long-term growth and profitability profile is fully intact. The focus will be on gross margin improvement and cost efficiency  balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. The pipeline is well-stocked with major licensing deals and we are also working on major partnerships. We see important economies such as France and Poland reaching milestones in making digital invoicing mandatory. These developments give us confidence for the future. I wish to thank our global teams for their commitment to the development of Unifiedpost so far  and in the future.”Story continuesKey financial figures(EUR million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Group revenue 91.7 80.7 +13.6%Digital processing revenue 59.3 50.4 +17.7% Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 32.4 30.3 +6.9% Recurring revenue (in % of total revenue) 96.3% 94.5% +1.8%pts Gross margin digital processing 40.0% 42.8% -2.8%pts EBITDA -6.5 -1.4 -5.1 R&D costs (expensed and capitalised) 17.9 15.3 +17.0% Loss for the period 21.1 11.1 +90.1% Cash and cash equivalents 42.7 25.1 +70.1%Key business KPI’s(#) End H1 2022 End 2021 Change (%) Customers 910 845 792 594 +14.9% Companies in business network 1 745 401 1 504 895 +16.0% Banqup customers68 645 35 408 +93.9%Impact of macro-economic and geopolitical situationUnifiedpost has not been directly impacted by the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Group has no business in Ukraine  nor in Russia. It also has no development centres in these countries. All countries where the Group is active are however experiencing levels of inflation that have not been observed in decades.Double-digit growth rates in digital processing businessUnifiedpost grew its revenue in H1 2022 by 13.6% y/y in H1 to €91.7 million  driven by a double-digit organic growth of the digital processing revenue combined with a sound growth in postage and parcel optimisation services.The Group saw its revenue from digital processing increasing by 17.7% y/y to €59.3 million in H1 2022. This was mainly driven by the strong organic growth rate of 21.7% y/y of the recurring digital revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and license business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordic countries  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing accelerated growth rates.The project and license business  which is non-recurring  contributed €3.4 million to the H1 2022 revenue. Project revenue is ahead of management expectations.The number of customers increased by 14.9% in H1 2022 to a total of 910 845 at H1 2022. Overall average revenue per user (ARPU) in digital processing business amounts to €23.0 for Q2 2022. This reflects some decline as expected by the management due to the increase in SME business of the Group. 96.3% of the total digital processing revenue resulted from recurring services  slightly higher due to the limited number of large projects.The gross margin of the digital processing business decreased slightly to 40.0% (H1 2021 42.8%). The decrease in the first half of the year is predominantly caused by the launching costs of the new services and by inflation impacting suppliers and salaries.Sound growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessGroup revenue was also supported by robust growth in postage and parcel optimisation services (+ 6.9% y/y in H1 to €32.4 million). Unifiedpost saw its postage and parcel optimisation business having a good H1 2022  resulting in a revenue of €32.4 million. This is an increase of €2.1 million compared to H1 2021. The increase was caused by onboarding of large new customers and general price increases. The postage & parcel optimisation realised a gross margin of 10.3% for H1 2022  down 0.7%pts from H1 2021. Likewise  this decrease has been caused by inflation.H1 2022 result impacted by peak in roll-out costBoth segments combined  i.e. the digital processing revenue and postage and parcel optimisation services  led to a gross profit of €27.0 million at a total revenue of €91.7 million. This resulted in a gross margin of 29.4% (H1 2021: 30.8%).During H1 2022  the Group spent 17.9€ million on research and development (R&D)  of which 57.2% was capitalised. The R&D spending is equivalent to 30% of digital processing revenue  which is the Group's current targeted rate for R&D investments.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses for the period increased by 22.0% y/y to a total of €22.7 million. The increase is mainly due to the three acquisitions in Q2 2021 and includes operational expenses for the pan-European structure. The operational costs related to the roll-out of Banqup which peaked in H1 2022 are expected to decline in the coming periods. Banqup demonstrates the significant additional growth potential of the Group. Unifiedpost has already obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries to issue local payment accounts with their own IBAN numbers. The Group is extending its European footprint by starting up these countries  launching branch payment offices  getting the payment business accredited by local authorities and launching new business in countries with a current limited revenue. This process includes one-off costs that can be considered investments in the further scalability of Banqup as more and more countries in Europe introduce mandatory digital invoicing.Sales & Marketing expenses were up 29.6% y/y for the period and amounted to €14.6 million. This was caused by the increasing efforts in marketing and the additional cost related to the expansion of the pan-European structure.Unifiedpost has now brought the key investment phase of the European platform roll-out to a good end. This sets the Company in a unique position to take advantage of the market growth in the coming years driven by regulation. It also allows the management to shift the focus towards becoming cash flow positive.The Group reported an EBITDA of -€6.5 million for H1 2022 (H1 2021: -€1.4 million). The EBITDA is impacted by €1.4 million non-recurring items.The loss from operations for the period amounted to €21.1 million (H1 2021: €11.1 million).Growth secured with fundingThe cash flow from financing activities amounted to +€51.6 million for the period. Unifiedpost’s cash and cash equivalents increased to €42.7 million at H1 2022. The increase was realised by the Company by signing a committed €100 million five-year senior facilities agreement  provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specializes in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. The facility is structured in a term loan facility A of €75 million which has been drawn and an uncalled capex facility B of €25 million. It remains available for 24 months from the closing date of the facilities agreement (7 March 2022).This new granted loan facility was used for the refinancing of existing financial debts for a total amount of €21.7 million and for the financing of the working capital needs of the Group (€6.8 million). The Group’s net debt position at H1 2022 amounts to €50.5 million. Besides the undrawn capex facility of €25 million of the Francisco Partners agreement  the Group has €14.3 million of other undrawn financing facilities. Based upon the cash forecast for the upcoming twelve months (period: July 2022 until June 2023)  the Group should be well equipped with sufficient liquidity.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023Throughout the remainder of the FY 2022  Unifiedpost expects to generate additional revenue by license deals for the B2B e-invoicing market. The pipeline for license sale is well stocked and will have a positive effect on the growth the Company is aiming for. These deals will support the growth rate to the targeted organic growth of at least 25% in digital processing revenues in FY 2022.In FY 2023 Group management expects to benefit from the growth of key markets. The mandatory digital e-invoicing that is taking place in several European countries is a change imposed by government on Banqup's end-users or final customers.Due to the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cash flow positive its predominant priority. The target is to be cash flow positive for H2 2023.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

Substantial progress has been made this year with completion of enrolment in the pivotal Phase 3 Mont Blanc trial for our lead asset  NCX 470  targeting glaucoma  and we are just weeks away from the results of the first of the two Phase 3 trials. These data  due in November  could provide the cornerstone for building the future of the company ” said Andreas Segerros  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “NCX 470 has already demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over the standard of care for intraocular pressure lowering  latanoprost  in a robust Phase 2 clinical trial. We have also demonstrated beneficial effects in an in vivo model of damage to the optic nerve head and retina. We believe the ongoing Phase 3 program will demonstrate the potential for NCX 470 as a best-in-class glaucoma treatment  addressing a major need in this nearly $6 billion worldwide market  and we are excited to see these results.”Andreas Segerros continued  “In my first few months here I have discovered a very strong ophthalmology-focussed R&D team  which we have since rounded out with excellent new hires  supported by an experienced  competent  corporate  finance and legal organisation. I am delighted to have joined Nicox at such an important time in the company’s history. After reviewing the portfolio  I believe we are well positioned to build upon the strength of the NCX 470 program by potentially advancing our novel nitric oxide-donating phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor  NCX 1728  and through the opportunistic addition of other programs to the development pipeline.”“The NCX 470 data presented to date has the potential to significantly impact the glaucoma treatment paradigm.” said Dr Robert Weinreb  Distinguished Professor and Chair of Ophthalmology at the University of California  San Diego  and member of Nicox’s Glaucoma Clinical Advisory Board"".First Half 2022 Business UpdateAndreas Segerros joined Nicox as Chief Executive Officer on June 1  2022. He brings significant pharma and venture capital expertise  including in ophthalmology  specifically as Global Head of Ophthalmology at Pharmacia  where he launched XALATAN® (latanoprost)  making it the industry’s first billion-dollar ophthalmic drug. With the appointment of Andreas Segerros as Chief Executive Officer  the role was separated from that of Chairman. Jean-Francois Labbé  Board member and Chairman of the Audit Committee  was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nicox SA  effective July 28  2022.NCX 470   Nicox’s lead clinical product candidate  is a novel  potentially best-in-class  nitric oxide (NO)-donating prostaglandin analog eye drop currently in a Phase 3 program for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Topline results from the first Phase 3 clinical trial  Mont Blanc  are due in November. Positive results of the Dolomites Phase 2 clinical trial on NCX 470 were reported in October 2019.Patient enrollment is continuing in both the United States (U.S.) and China in the ongoing Denali Phase 3 clinical trial of NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Denali trial is being jointly conducted and equally financed with our Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics. Based on the current recruitment rates  the Company expects topline results after 2024. The timeline has been impacted by COVID-19  specifically the lockdown in China  and longer-term effects on the wider glaucoma clinical trial environment.NCX 4251 is a novel  patented  ophthalmic suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals for dry eye disease. The Company is currently looking for partnerships outside of China to advance development of this program. NCX 4251 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics in the Chinese market.VYZULTA® (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution)  0.024%  is now approved in 18 markets  including approval in Lebanon in the second quarter of 2022. Following a launch in Thailand in the second quarter of 2022  it is now commercialized in 8 territories  and a launch in Brazil is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. VYZULTA is indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

In light of the reduced European Commission order2  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and  as compensation  will pay IDT up to €36.2 million in cash and the equivalent of €4.5 million in kind  in the form of specified equipment purchased by Valneva.Valneva has started to deliver doses of VLA2001 to the European Member States who ordered the vaccine and is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these Member States should demand increase. In parallel  the Company is continuing discussions with various other governments around the world  with the aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets in the next six to twelve months.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe3 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom4 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates5 and Kingdom of Bahrain6. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States7 and the Kingdom of Bahrain8. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA20019.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that The Lancet has published positive results from a Phase 3 Dupixent® (dupilumab)...,"Dupixent is the first and only biologic that significantly improved skin clearance  and reduced itch and overall disease severity in children as young as 6 months old in a Phase 3 trialPublished results reinforce well-established efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent across age groupsTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  Sept. 15  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that The Lancet has published positive results from a Phase 3 Dupixent® (dupilumab) trial in children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. These data were the basis for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Dupixent in June 2022 and for a regulatory submission currently under review by the European Medicines Agency.""The Lancet's publication of these Phase 3 results is a testament to the significance of the data showing dupilumab can alleviate the multidimensional burden that moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis places on infants  toddlers and their families "" said Amy S. Paller  M.D.  Walter J. Hamlin Professor and Chair of Dermatology and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine  and principal investigator of the trial. ""By addressing the key inflammatory pathway driving atopic dermatitis  the trial demonstrated that dupilumab not only addressed debilitating symptoms like persistent itch and skin lesions  but also meaningfully improved sleep and reduced pain – two aspects of daily life that are critical for any child's development and well-being.""Data from this trial showed that adding Dupixent to low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) significantly improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to TCS alone (placebo) at 16 weeks. Additionally  Dupixent patients experienced significant improvement in measures of sleep quality and skin pain  as well as patient- or caregiver-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life. A substantially lower proportion of Dupixent patients needed rescue medications  compared to those on placebo.Story continuesSafety results through 16 weeks were similar to the safety profile in patients 6 years and older with atopic dermatitis. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included conjunctivitis (5% Dupixent  0% placebo)  herpes viral infections (6% Dupixent  5% placebo)  molluscum contagiosum (5% Dupixent  3% placebo)  rhinorrhea (5% Dupixent  1% placebo) and dental caries (5% Dupixent  0% placebo).The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in children 6 months to 5 years of age with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority outside the U.S.About Atopic DermatitisAtopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Eighty-five to ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  and crusting and oozing. In the U.S.  more than 75 000 children aged 5 years and younger have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and are most in need of new treatment options. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of a young child and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical steroids  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Patients treated with Dupixent received either 200 mg or 300 mg (based on weight) every four weeks.The primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16.Secondary endpoints further assessed disease measures and quality of life. Disease measures included additional EASI outcomes  itch reduction  percent of body surface area affected  skin pain  disease severity as measured by the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  as well as SCORing Atopic Dermatitis measuring a combined assessment of disease area and severity  itch and sleep. Quality of life measures were assessed for children (by Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index for children aged 4 to 17 years and Infants' Dermatitis Quality of Life Index for children less than 4 years of age) and families (by the Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire)  as well as sleep quality.Children who completed the trial were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Dupixent in this age group.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines.

10101,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-chmp-recommends-approval-060000348.html,Press Release: CHMP recommends approval of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for prevention of RSV disease in infants,CHMP recommends approval of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for prevention of RSV disease in infants Recommendation is based on the Beyfortus clinical trial program ...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeCHMP recommends approval of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for prevention of RSV disease in infantsRecommendation is based on the Beyfortus clinical trial program which demonstrated protection against medically attended lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV with a single dose during the RSV seasonIf approved  Beyfortus would be the first broadly protective option for newborns and infantsParis  September 16  2022. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. If approved  Beyfortus would be the first and only single-dose passive immunization for the broad infant population  including those born healthy  at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions. Beyfortus is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Jean-François ToussaintGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines  Sanofi“Today’s positive CHMP opinion is one of the most significant public health achievements in RSV in decades and has the potential to alleviate the enormous physical and emotional burden that RSV can place on families and healthcare systems. With this endorsement  we are one step closer to achieving our goal of protecting all infants against RSV with a single dose.”Iskra ReicExecutive Vice President  Vaccines and Immune Therapies  AstraZeneca“This positive CHMP opinion underscores Beyfortus’ potential as a ground-breaking  first-in-class passive immunization that could transform the medical community’s approach to RSV prevention in infants.”The CHMP based its positive opinion on results from the Beyfortus clinical development program  including the Phase 3 MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY  and Phase 2b trials.1-8 In the MELODY and Phase 2b trials  Beyfortus met its primary endpoint of reducing the incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) caused by RSV during the RSV season vs. placebo with a single dose. 1-6 The safety profile of Beyfortus was similar to placebo. Beyfortus also demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to palivizumab in the Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial.7-8Story continuesRSV is the most common cause of LRTIs and a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations occurring in infants born healthy and at term.9-13 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14 Currently there is no preventative option available for all infants and treatment is limited to symptomatic relief.15 16About BeyfortusBeyfortus® (nirsevimab)  an investigational long-acting antibody designed for all infants for protection against RSV disease from birth through their first RSV season with a single dose  is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Beyfortus has been developed to offer newborns and infants direct RSV protection via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely  rapid and direct protection against disease.17In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialization activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements.Beyfortus has been granted designations to facilitate expedited development by several major regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation byThe China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The safety and efficacy of Beyfortus was evaluated under an accelerated assessment procedure by the EMA. Beyfortus has not been approved by any regulatory authority.About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29–35 weeks’ gestation were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  caused by RSV by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2) compared to placebo. Between November 2016 and December 2017  1 453 infants were randomized (Beyfortus  n=969; placebo  n=484) at the RSV season start. Studies were conducted in both hemispheres  at 164 sites in 23 countries.3 4 Data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in July 2020. The dosing regimen was recommended based on further exploration of the phase 2b data.3 The subsequent Phase 3 study  MELODY  applied the recommended dosing regimen.2The Phase 3 MELODY trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing  versus placebo  in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.1 2 The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV by 74.5% (95% CI 49.6  87.1; P<0.001) compared to placebo. Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. Between July 2019 and March 2020  1 490 infants were randomized to either Beyfortus or placebo at the RSV season start.1 2 Data was published on the primary analysis in NEJM in March 2022.Findings from Beyfortus’ clinical trial program include a pre-specified pooled analysis of the Phase 3 MELODY trial and the recommended dose from the Phase 2b trial  in which an efficacy (relative risk reduction versus placebo) of 79.5% (95% CI 65.9  87.7; P<0.0001) was seen against medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.5 The pooled analysis studied healthy preterm and term infants who received the recommended dose of Beyfortus based on weight compared to placebo through Day 151 and showed an efficacy of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3  89.7; P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations  as published in NEJM in March 2022.1 5MEDLEY was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for Beyfortus in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.7 8 Between July 2019 and May 2021  approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose.7 8 Serum levels of nirsevimab following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial  indicating similar protection in this population to that in the healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.7 Data was published in NEJM in March 2022.The results of MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and the Phase 2b trials illustrate that Beyfortus helps protect infants during their first RSV season against RSV disease with a single dose.1-8 This all-infant population includes preterm  healthy late preterm and term infants  as well as infants with specific conditions.These trials form the basis of regulatory submissions that began in 2022.About RSVRSV is the most common cause of LRTI  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants.9 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.10-13 Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations  and it was estimated that there were 26 300 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.18 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The parties have therefore concluded that the proposed merger no longer has any strategic rationale.As a result  and in agreement with the other parties  Bouygues has decided to end the review of the transaction by the Competition Authority.The parties regret that the Competition Authority did not take into account the speed and extent of the changes sweeping through the French broadcasting sector. They continue to firmly believe that a merger of the TF1 and M6 groups would have provided an appropriate response to the challenges resulting from the increased competition from the international platforms..Press and investor relations contactsTF1 groupINVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENTcomfi@tf1.frPRESS CONTACTMaylis Carcabal - +33 (0) 6 63 59 87 05 - mcarcabal@tf1.frNicole Mariello - +33 (0) 6 62 31 33 04 - nmariello@tf1.frM6 groupINVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENTGuillaume Couturié – +33 (0) 1 41 92 28 03 - guillaume.couturie@m6.frPRESS RELATIONSPaul Mennesson - +33 (0) 1 41 92 61 36 - paul.mennesson@m6.frBouygues groupINVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENTinvestors@bouygues.com – +33 (0) 1 44 20 10 79PRESS CONTACTPierre Auberger - +33 (0) 6 61 07 63 68 - pab@bouygues.comRTL GroupCOMMUNICATIONS AND INVESTOR RELATIONSOliver Fahlbusch - +49 173 284 7873 – +352 621 265 649 - oliver.fahlbusch@rtlgroup.comABOUT THE TF1 GROUPThe TF1 group is a major player in the production  publication and distribution of content.

This can have major consequences  for example fatigue is the main cause of driver errors in 20% of road accidents. Moreover  insufficient sleep leads to chronic health problems  such as diabetes  obesity  heart diseases and strokes. In order to address these major issues and to raise awareness about the importance of a good quality of sleep  Beter Bed Holding’s CEO  John Kruijssen  made an appeal to the industry to co-sign the Sleep Manifesto at the 23rd EBIA General Assembly in Copenhagen.EBIA - the European Bedding Industries’ Association - represents the interests of European mattress producers and suppliers. Mattress producers  innerspring companies  textile industries  as well as PU foam and latex suppliers and representatives of the chemical industry from all over Europe were present at the EBIA General Assembly. John Kruijssen  CEO of Beter Bed Holding  appealed to the community to sign the Sleep Manifesto  referring to results of scientific research on sleep that has increased knowledge about sleep dramatically in the past years. “What if we could address prevention and improve the quality of sleep and therefore lower overall healthcare costs and increase productivity? The quality of sleep has a significant impact on productivity. In the Netherlands alone  productivity loss is estimated to equate to 1.5% to 3% of GDP per year  which is equivalent somewhere between 13 and 26 billion euro ” stated Kruijssen. “There are a lot of other major issues that we  as the European industry  need to address in order for consumers to sleep better  and therefore  live healthier  or I should say  sleep better  live better.”Wake-up callWith the aim of helping consumers to get a better night's rest  Beter Bed launched the Sleep Manifesto earlier this month  with the aim to raise sleep awareness and improve sleep. Sleep deprivation can affect our body  brain and life expectancy. Matthew Walker  an internationally renowned sleep scientist and author of 'Why We Sleep' and TEDx speaker with more than 16 million views  recognised this problem and supported the Manifesto with his first signature. “If 50 to 60% of the entire population were to get more sleep  it would save millions of euros in healthcare spending ” said Walker while signing the Manifesto.At the EBIA  Kruijssen called on the industry to follow in Walker’s footsteps in order to put the importance of better sleep on the agenda. The aim is to encourage better sleep behaviour and provide more information to address this social problem. “Because of the lack of awareness of the benefits of healthy sleep  multisectoral public health campaigns are needed to educate the public about the importance of sleep and the consequences of insufficient sleep ” Kruijssen stated. “Our mission is simple. We believe that the better we sleep  the happier  healthier and more productive we are. And we won’t rest until everyone gets the high-quality sleep they deserve”.Beter Bed believes and promises that everyone can sleep better and does everything to fulfil this promise to increase public awareness of the importance of sleep  through its own platforms  but also through ambassadors and its network of specialists and scientists. Beter Bed has developed a set of innovative solutions  such as Beter Slapen ID  a measuring system that allows it to offer customers objective data-driven sleep advice.

The recurring digital processing revenue grew by 21.7% y/y to €55.9 million in H1 2022. The Group revenue grew by 13.6% y/y to €91.7 million over the same period. The customer base grew by a strong 14.9% in H1 2022 to reach close to one million customers. Unifiedpost was also able to bring the key investment phase of the European platform roll-out to a good end.

Unifiedpost again shows double-digit organic growth  while investing in the European expansion of our teams  solutions and products. Our performance is in line with management expectations and budget. The peak of our investments is now behind us. We strongly believe our long-term growth and profitability profile is fully intact. The focus will be on gross margin improvement and cost efficiency  balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. The pipeline is well-stocked with major licensing deals and we are also working on major partnerships. We see important economies such as France and Poland reaching milestones in making digital invoicing mandatory. These developments give us confidence for the future. I wish to thank our global teams for their commitment to the development of Unifiedpost so far  and in the future.”Key financial figures(EUR million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Group revenue 91.7 80.7 +13.6%Digital processing revenue 59.3 50.4 +17.7% Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 32.4 30.3 +6.9% Recurring revenue (in % of total revenue) 96.3% 94.5% +1.8%pts Gross margin digital processing 40.0% 42.8% -2.8%pts EBITDA -6.5 -1.4 -5.1 R&D costs (expensed and capitalised) 17.9 15.3 +17.0% Loss for the period 21.1 11.1 +90.1% Cash and cash equivalents 42.7 25.1 +70.1%Key business KPI’s(#) End H1 2022 End 2021 Change (%) Customers 910 845 792 594 +14.9% Companies in business network 1 745 401 1 504 895 +16.0% Banqup customers68 645 35 408 +93.9%Impact of macro-economic and geopolitical situationUnifiedpost has not been directly impacted by the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Group has no business in Ukraine  nor in Russia. It also has no development centres in these countries. All countries where the Group is active are however experiencing levels of inflation that have not been observed in decades.Double-digit growth rates in digital processing businessUnifiedpost grew its revenue in H1 2022 by 13.6% y/y in H1 to €91.7 million  driven by a double-digit organic growth of the digital processing revenue combined with a sound growth in postage and parcel optimisation services.The Group saw its revenue from digital processing increasing by 17.7% y/y to €59.3 million in H1 2022. This was mainly driven by the strong organic growth rate of 21.7% y/y of the recurring digital revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and license business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordic countries  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing accelerated growth rates.The project and license business  which is non-recurring  contributed €3.4 million to the H1 2022 revenue. Project revenue is ahead of management expectations.The number of customers increased by 14.9% in H1 2022 to a total of 910 845 at H1 2022. Overall average revenue per user (ARPU) in digital processing business amounts to €23.0 for Q2 2022. This reflects some decline as expected by the management due to the increase in SME business of the Group. 96.3% of the total digital processing revenue resulted from recurring services  slightly higher due to the limited number of large projects.The gross margin of the digital processing business decreased slightly to 40.0% (H1 2021 42.8%). The decrease in the first half of the year is predominantly caused by the launching costs of the new services and by inflation impacting suppliers and salaries.Sound growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessGroup revenue was also supported by robust growth in postage and parcel optimisation services (+ 6.9% y/y in H1 to €32.4 million). Unifiedpost saw its postage and parcel optimisation business having a good H1 2022  resulting in a revenue of €32.4 million. This is an increase of €2.1 million compared to H1 2021. The increase was caused by onboarding of large new customers and general price increases. The postage & parcel optimisation realised a gross margin of 10.3% for H1 2022  down 0.7%pts from H1 2021. Likewise  this decrease has been caused by inflation.H1 2022 result impacted by peak in roll-out costBoth segments combined  i.e. the digital processing revenue and postage and parcel optimisation services  led to a gross profit of €27.0 million at a total revenue of €91.7 million. This resulted in a gross margin of 29.4% (H1 2021: 30.8%).During H1 2022  the Group spent 17.9€ million on research and development (R&D)  of which 57.2% was capitalised. The R&D spending is equivalent to 30% of digital processing revenue  which is the Group's current targeted rate for R&D investments.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses for the period increased by 22.0% y/y to a total of €22.7 million. The increase is mainly due to the three acquisitions in Q2 2021 and includes operational expenses for the pan-European structure. The operational costs related to the roll-out of Banqup which peaked in H1 2022 are expected to decline in the coming periods. Banqup demonstrates the significant additional growth potential of the Group. Unifiedpost has already obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries to issue local payment accounts with their own IBAN numbers. The Group is extending its European footprint by starting up these countries  launching branch payment offices  getting the payment business accredited by local authorities and launching new business in countries with a current limited revenue. This process includes one-off costs that can be considered investments in the further scalability of Banqup as more and more countries in Europe introduce mandatory digital invoicing.Sales & Marketing expenses were up 29.6% y/y for the period and amounted to €14.6 million. This was caused by the increasing efforts in marketing and the additional cost related to the expansion of the pan-European structure.Unifiedpost has now brought the key investment phase of the European platform roll-out to a good end. This sets the Company in a unique position to take advantage of the market growth in the coming years driven by regulation. It also allows the management to shift the focus towards becoming cash flow positive.The Group reported an EBITDA of -€6.5 million for H1 2022 (H1 2021: -€1.4 million). The EBITDA is impacted by €1.4 million non-recurring items.The loss from operations for the period amounted to €21.1 million (H1 2021: €11.1 million).Growth secured with fundingThe cash flow from financing activities amounted to +€51.6 million for the period. Unifiedpost’s cash and cash equivalents increased to €42.7 million at H1 2022. The increase was realised by the Company by signing a committed €100 million five-year senior facilities agreement  provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specializes in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. The facility is structured in a term loan facility A of €75 million which has been drawn and an uncalled capex facility B of €25 million. It remains available for 24 months from the closing date of the facilities agreement (7 March 2022).This new granted loan facility was used for the refinancing of existing financial debts for a total amount of €21.7 million and for the financing of the working capital needs of the Group (€6.8 million). The Group’s net debt position at H1 2022 amounts to €50.5 million. Besides the undrawn capex facility of €25 million of the Francisco Partners agreement  the Group has €14.3 million of other undrawn financing facilities. Based upon the cash forecast for the upcoming twelve months (period: July 2022 until June 2023)  the Group should be well equipped with sufficient liquidity.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023Throughout the remainder of the FY 2022  Unifiedpost expects to generate additional revenue by license deals for the B2B e-invoicing market. The pipeline for license sale is well stocked and will have a positive effect on the growth the Company is aiming for. These deals will support the growth rate to the targeted organic growth of at least 25% in digital processing revenues in FY 2022.In FY 2023 Group management expects to benefit from the growth of key markets. The mandatory digital e-invoicing that is taking place in several European countries is a change imposed by government on Banqup's end-users or final customers.Due to the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cash flow positive its predominant priority. The target is to be cash flow positive for H2 2023.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. If approved  Beyfortus would be the first and only single-dose passive immunization for the broad infant population  including those born healthy  at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions. Beyfortus is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Jean-François ToussaintGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines  Sanofi“Today’s positive CHMP opinion is one of the most significant public health achievements in RSV in decades and has the potential to alleviate the enormous physical and emotional burden that RSV can place on families and healthcare systems. With this endorsement  we are one step closer to achieving our goal of protecting all infants against RSV with a single dose.”Iskra ReicExecutive Vice President  Vaccines and Immune Therapies  AstraZeneca“This positive CHMP opinion underscores Beyfortus’ potential as a ground-breaking  first-in-class passive immunization that could transform the medical community’s approach to RSV prevention in infants.”The CHMP based its positive opinion on results from the Beyfortus clinical development program  including the Phase 3 MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY  and Phase 2b trials.1-8 In the MELODY and Phase 2b trials  Beyfortus met its primary endpoint of reducing the incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) caused by RSV during the RSV season vs. placebo with a single dose. 1-6 The safety profile of Beyfortus was similar to placebo. Beyfortus also demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to palivizumab in the Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial.7-8RSV is the most common cause of LRTIs and a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations occurring in infants born healthy and at term.9-13 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14 Currently there is no preventative option available for all infants and treatment is limited to symptomatic relief.15 16About BeyfortusBeyfortus® (nirsevimab)  an investigational long-acting antibody designed for all infants for protection against RSV disease from birth through their first RSV season with a single dose  is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Beyfortus has been developed to offer newborns and infants direct RSV protection via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely  rapid and direct protection against disease.17In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialization activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements.Beyfortus has been granted designations to facilitate expedited development by several major regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation byThe China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The safety and efficacy of Beyfortus was evaluated under an accelerated assessment procedure by the EMA. Beyfortus has not been approved by any regulatory authority.About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29–35 weeks’ gestation were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  caused by RSV by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2) compared to placebo. Between November 2016 and December 2017  1 453 infants were randomized (Beyfortus  n=969; placebo  n=484) at the RSV season start. Studies were conducted in both hemispheres  at 164 sites in 23 countries.3 4 Data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in July 2020. The dosing regimen was recommended based on further exploration of the phase 2b data.3 The subsequent Phase 3 study  MELODY  applied the recommended dosing regimen.2The Phase 3 MELODY trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing  versus placebo  in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.1 2 The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV by 74.5% (95% CI 49.6  87.1; P<0.001) compared to placebo. Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. Between July 2019 and March 2020  1 490 infants were randomized to either Beyfortus or placebo at the RSV season start.1 2 Data was published on the primary analysis in NEJM in March 2022.Findings from Beyfortus’ clinical trial program include a pre-specified pooled analysis of the Phase 3 MELODY trial and the recommended dose from the Phase 2b trial  in which an efficacy (relative risk reduction versus placebo) of 79.5% (95% CI 65.9  87.7; P<0.0001) was seen against medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.5 The pooled analysis studied healthy preterm and term infants who received the recommended dose of Beyfortus based on weight compared to placebo through Day 151 and showed an efficacy of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3  89.7; P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations  as published in NEJM in March 2022.1 5MEDLEY was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for Beyfortus in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.7 8 Between July 2019 and May 2021  approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose.7 8 Serum levels of nirsevimab following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial  indicating similar protection in this population to that in the healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.7 Data was published in NEJM in March 2022.The results of MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and the Phase 2b trials illustrate that Beyfortus helps protect infants during their first RSV season against RSV disease with a single dose.1-8 This all-infant population includes preterm  healthy late preterm and term infants  as well as infants with specific conditions.These trials form the basis of regulatory submissions that began in 2022.About RSVRSV is the most common cause of LRTI  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants.9 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.10-13 Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations  and it was estimated that there were 26 300 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.18 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that The Lancet has published positive results from a Phase 3 Dupixent® (dupilumab) trial in children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. These data were the basis for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Dupixent in June 2022 and for a regulatory submission currently under review by the European Medicines Agency.""The Lancet's publication of these Phase 3 results is a testament to the significance of the data showing dupilumab can alleviate the multidimensional burden that moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis places on infants  toddlers and their families "" said Amy S. Paller  M.D.  Walter J. Hamlin Professor and Chair of Dermatology and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine  and principal investigator of the trial. ""By addressing the key inflammatory pathway driving atopic dermatitis  the trial demonstrated that dupilumab not only addressed debilitating symptoms like persistent itch and skin lesions  but also meaningfully improved sleep and reduced pain – two aspects of daily life that are critical for any child's development and well-being.""Data from this trial showed that adding Dupixent to low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) significantly improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to TCS alone (placebo) at 16 weeks. Additionally  Dupixent patients experienced significant improvement in measures of sleep quality and skin pain  as well as patient- or caregiver-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life. A substantially lower proportion of Dupixent patients needed rescue medications  compared to those on placebo.Safety results through 16 weeks were similar to the safety profile in patients 6 years and older with atopic dermatitis. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) included conjunctivitis (5% Dupixent  0% placebo)  herpes viral infections (6% Dupixent  5% placebo)  molluscum contagiosum (5% Dupixent  3% placebo)  rhinorrhea (5% Dupixent  1% placebo) and dental caries (5% Dupixent  0% placebo).The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in children 6 months to 5 years of age with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority outside the U.S.About Atopic DermatitisAtopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Eighty-five to ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  and crusting and oozing. In the U.S.  more than 75 000 children aged 5 years and younger have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and are most in need of new treatment options. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of a young child and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical steroids  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Patients treated with Dupixent received either 200 mg or 300 mg (based on weight) every four weeks.The primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16.Secondary endpoints further assessed disease measures and quality of life. Disease measures included additional EASI outcomes  itch reduction  percent of body surface area affected  skin pain  disease severity as measured by the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  as well as SCORing Atopic Dermatitis measuring a combined assessment of disease area and severity  itch and sleep. Quality of life measures were assessed for children (by Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index for children aged 4 to 17 years and Infants' Dermatitis Quality of Life Index for children less than 4 years of age) and families (by the Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire)  as well as sleep quality.Children who completed the trial were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Dupixent in this age group.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

We take pride in covering 400+ technology vendors globally – the largest by any analyst firm in this space.,Saxo Bank and DCAC to explore a combination and listing of Saxo Bank on Euronext AmsterdamBy Leandra MonteiroToday Business CombinationDCACDenmark ShareSaxo Bank A/S and Disruptive Capital Acquisition Company Limited (DCAC) have confirmed their intent to explore a listing of the Bank on Euronext Amsterdam in connection with a business combination with DCAC (the Business Combination).Saxo Bank is well capitalised  so there will be no primary issue of shares by the Bank. The proposed Business Combination would comprise a secondary sale of existing Saxo Bank shares to DCAC for distribution to DCAC’s shareholders; and the subsequent delisting and liquidation of DCAC  with Saxo being the ongoing Euronext listed entity.DCAC is soliciting interest from its existing shareholders and other investors in the secondary offer.The purpose of the potential listing of the Bank is to diversify its shareholder base  raise its profile and so further accelerate its growth strategy.Saxo Bank shareholders Geely Financials Denmark A/S and Sampo Plc intend to sell a limited proportion of their shareholding. Certain members of Saxo Bank’s board and senior management team  including its founder and CEO Kim Fournais  intend to acquire additional shares alongside DCAC  should the Business Combination proceed.The potential transaction values the outstanding shares of Saxo Bank (before a Business Combination) at a pro forma aggregate amount of at least € 2 billion.No binding agreement has been entered into  and there can be no assurance that a Business Combination nor listing of the Bank shares will be achieved.Kim Fournais  CEO & Founder  Saxo Bank commented  “We have a strong ownership  which we hope to strengthen and diversify even further  with full confidence that Saxo Bank is heading in the right strategic direction. We are building a prudent financial institution that is part of the solutions needed in the future – and we remain committed to delivering on our ambitious growth strategy. With this  I am proud to invite new shareholders into Saxo and the exciting growth journey ahead of us.”DCAC co-founder  Edi Truell said  “We are thrilled to have identified Saxo Bank as a high-quality financial services combination for DCAC shareholders.
