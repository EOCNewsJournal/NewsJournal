Sufficient cash to allow Unifiedpost to achieve a positive cash flowBecoming cash flow positive by H2 2023 is the key priority for the CompanyCommenting on the H1 2022 results  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder stated: “I am proud of how our businesses have continued to grow in H1 2022. Unifiedpost again shows double-digit organic growth  while investing in the European expansion of our teams  solutions and products. Our performance is in line with management expectations and budget. The peak of our investments is now behind us. We strongly believe our long-term growth and profitability profile is fully intact. The focus will be on gross margin improvement and cost efficiency  balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. The pipeline is well-stocked with major licensing deals and we are also working on major partnerships. We see important economies such as France and Poland reaching milestones in making digital invoicing mandatory. These developments give us confidence for the future. I wish to thank our global teams for their commitment to the development of Unifiedpost so far  and in the future.”Story continuesKey financial figures(EUR million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Group revenue 91.7 80.7 +13.6%Digital processing revenue 59.3 50.4 +17.7% Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 32.4 30.3 +6.9% Recurring revenue (in % of total revenue) 96.3% 94.5% +1.8%pts Gross margin digital processing 40.0% 42.8% -2.8%pts EBITDA -6.5 -1.4 -5.1 R&D costs (expensed and capitalised) 17.9 15.3 +17.0% Loss for the period 21.1 11.1 +90.1% Cash and cash equivalents 42.7 25.1 +70.1%Key business KPI’s(#) End H1 2022 End 2021 Change (%) Customers 910 845 792 594 +14.9% Companies in business network 1 745 401 1 504 895 +16.0% Banqup customers68 645 35 408 +93.9%Impact of macro-economic and geopolitical situationUnifiedpost has not been directly impacted by the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Group has no business in Ukraine  nor in Russia. It also has no development centres in these countries. All countries where the Group is active are however experiencing levels of inflation that have not been observed in decades.Double-digit growth rates in digital processing businessUnifiedpost grew its revenue in H1 2022 by 13.6% y/y in H1 to €91.7 million  driven by a double-digit organic growth of the digital processing revenue combined with a sound growth in postage and parcel optimisation services.The Group saw its revenue from digital processing increasing by 17.7% y/y to €59.3 million in H1 2022. This was mainly driven by the strong organic growth rate of 21.7% y/y of the recurring digital revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and license business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordic countries  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing accelerated growth rates.The project and license business  which is non-recurring  contributed €3.4 million to the H1 2022 revenue. Project revenue is ahead of management expectations.The number of customers increased by 14.9% in H1 2022 to a total of 910 845 at H1 2022. Overall average revenue per user (ARPU) in digital processing business amounts to €23.0 for Q2 2022. This reflects some decline as expected by the management due to the increase in SME business of the Group. 96.3% of the total digital processing revenue resulted from recurring services  slightly higher due to the limited number of large projects.The gross margin of the digital processing business decreased slightly to 40.0% (H1 2021 42.8%). The decrease in the first half of the year is predominantly caused by the launching costs of the new services and by inflation impacting suppliers and salaries.Sound growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessGroup revenue was also supported by robust growth in postage and parcel optimisation services (+ 6.9% y/y in H1 to €32.4 million). Unifiedpost saw its postage and parcel optimisation business having a good H1 2022  resulting in a revenue of €32.4 million. This is an increase of €2.1 million compared to H1 2021. The increase was caused by onboarding of large new customers and general price increases. The postage & parcel optimisation realised a gross margin of 10.3% for H1 2022  down 0.7%pts from H1 2021. Likewise  this decrease has been caused by inflation.H1 2022 result impacted by peak in roll-out costBoth segments combined  i.e. the digital processing revenue and postage and parcel optimisation services  led to a gross profit of €27.0 million at a total revenue of €91.7 million. This resulted in a gross margin of 29.4% (H1 2021: 30.8%).During H1 2022  the Group spent 17.9€ million on research and development (R&D)  of which 57.2% was capitalised. The R&D spending is equivalent to 30% of digital processing revenue  which is the Group's current targeted rate for R&D investments.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses for the period increased by 22.0% y/y to a total of €22.7 million. The increase is mainly due to the three acquisitions in Q2 2021 and includes operational expenses for the pan-European structure. The operational costs related to the roll-out of Banqup which peaked in H1 2022 are expected to decline in the coming periods. Banqup demonstrates the significant additional growth potential of the Group. Unifiedpost has already obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries to issue local payment accounts with their own IBAN numbers. The Group is extending its European footprint by starting up these countries  launching branch payment offices  getting the payment business accredited by local authorities and launching new business in countries with a current limited revenue. This process includes one-off costs that can be considered investments in the further scalability of Banqup as more and more countries in Europe introduce mandatory digital invoicing.Sales & Marketing expenses were up 29.6% y/y for the period and amounted to €14.6 million. This was caused by the increasing efforts in marketing and the additional cost related to the expansion of the pan-European structure.Unifiedpost has now brought the key investment phase of the European platform roll-out to a good end. This sets the Company in a unique position to take advantage of the market growth in the coming years driven by regulation. It also allows the management to shift the focus towards becoming cash flow positive.The Group reported an EBITDA of -€6.5 million for H1 2022 (H1 2021: -€1.4 million). The EBITDA is impacted by €1.4 million non-recurring items.The loss from operations for the period amounted to €21.1 million (H1 2021: €11.1 million).Growth secured with fundingThe cash flow from financing activities amounted to +€51.6 million for the period. Unifiedpost’s cash and cash equivalents increased to €42.7 million at H1 2022. The increase was realised by the Company by signing a committed €100 million five-year senior facilities agreement  provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specializes in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. The facility is structured in a term loan facility A of €75 million which has been drawn and an uncalled capex facility B of €25 million. It remains available for 24 months from the closing date of the facilities agreement (7 March 2022).This new granted loan facility was used for the refinancing of existing financial debts for a total amount of €21.7 million and for the financing of the working capital needs of the Group (€6.8 million). The Group’s net debt position at H1 2022 amounts to €50.5 million. Besides the undrawn capex facility of €25 million of the Francisco Partners agreement  the Group has €14.3 million of other undrawn financing facilities. Based upon the cash forecast for the upcoming twelve months (period: July 2022 until June 2023)  the Group should be well equipped with sufficient liquidity.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023Throughout the remainder of the FY 2022  Unifiedpost expects to generate additional revenue by license deals for the B2B e-invoicing market. The pipeline for license sale is well stocked and will have a positive effect on the growth the Company is aiming for. These deals will support the growth rate to the targeted organic growth of at least 25% in digital processing revenues in FY 2022.In FY 2023 Group management expects to benefit from the growth of key markets. The mandatory digital e-invoicing that is taking place in several European countries is a change imposed by government on Banqup's end-users or final customers.Due to the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cash flow positive its predominant priority. The target is to be cash flow positive for H2 2023.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

Substantial progress has been made this year with completion of enrolment in the pivotal Phase 3 Mont Blanc trial for our lead asset  NCX 470  targeting glaucoma  and we are just weeks away from the results of the first of the two Phase 3 trials. These data  due in November  could provide the cornerstone for building the future of the company ” said Andreas Segerros  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “NCX 470 has already demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over the standard of care for intraocular pressure lowering  latanoprost  in a robust Phase 2 clinical trial. We have also demonstrated beneficial effects in an in vivo model of damage to the optic nerve head and retina. We believe the ongoing Phase 3 program will demonstrate the potential for NCX 470 as a best-in-class glaucoma treatment  addressing a major need in this nearly $6 billion worldwide market  and we are excited to see these results.”Andreas Segerros continued  “In my first few months here I have discovered a very strong ophthalmology-focussed R&D team  which we have since rounded out with excellent new hires  supported by an experienced  competent  corporate  finance and legal organisation. I am delighted to have joined Nicox at such an important time in the company’s history. After reviewing the portfolio  I believe we are well positioned to build upon the strength of the NCX 470 program by potentially advancing our novel nitric oxide-donating phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor  NCX 1728  and through the opportunistic addition of other programs to the development pipeline.”“The NCX 470 data presented to date has the potential to significantly impact the glaucoma treatment paradigm.” said Dr Robert Weinreb  Distinguished Professor and Chair of Ophthalmology at the University of California  San Diego  and member of Nicox’s Glaucoma Clinical Advisory Board"".First Half 2022 Business UpdateAndreas Segerros joined Nicox as Chief Executive Officer on June 1  2022. He brings significant pharma and venture capital expertise  including in ophthalmology  specifically as Global Head of Ophthalmology at Pharmacia  where he launched XALATAN® (latanoprost)  making it the industry’s first billion-dollar ophthalmic drug. With the appointment of Andreas Segerros as Chief Executive Officer  the role was separated from that of Chairman. Jean-Francois Labbé  Board member and Chairman of the Audit Committee  was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nicox SA  effective July 28  2022.NCX 470   Nicox’s lead clinical product candidate  is a novel  potentially best-in-class  nitric oxide (NO)-donating prostaglandin analog eye drop currently in a Phase 3 program for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Topline results from the first Phase 3 clinical trial  Mont Blanc  are due in November. Positive results of the Dolomites Phase 2 clinical trial on NCX 470 were reported in October 2019.Patient enrollment is continuing in both the United States (U.S.) and China in the ongoing Denali Phase 3 clinical trial of NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Denali trial is being jointly conducted and equally financed with our Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics. Based on the current recruitment rates  the Company expects topline results after 2024. The timeline has been impacted by COVID-19  specifically the lockdown in China  and longer-term effects on the wider glaucoma clinical trial environment.NCX 4251 is a novel  patented  ophthalmic suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals for dry eye disease. The Company is currently looking for partnerships outside of China to advance development of this program. NCX 4251 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics in the Chinese market.VYZULTA® (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution)  0.024%  is now approved in 18 markets  including approval in Lebanon in the second quarter of 2022. Following a launch in Thailand in the second quarter of 2022  it is now commercialized in 8 territories  and a launch in Brazil is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. VYZULTA is indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

In light of the reduced European Commission order2  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and  as compensation  will pay IDT up to €36.2 million in cash and the equivalent of €4.5 million in kind  in the form of specified equipment purchased by Valneva.Valneva has started to deliver doses of VLA2001 to the European Member States who ordered the vaccine and is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these Member States should demand increase. In parallel  the Company is continuing discussions with various other governments around the world  with the aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets in the next six to twelve months.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1.

10101,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-chmp-recommends-approval-060000348.html,Press Release: CHMP recommends approval of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for prevention of RSV disease in infants,CHMP recommends approval of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for prevention of RSV disease in infants Recommendation is based on the Beyfortus clinical trial program ...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeCHMP recommends approval of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for prevention of RSV disease in infantsRecommendation is based on the Beyfortus clinical trial program which demonstrated protection against medically attended lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV with a single dose during the RSV seasonIf approved  Beyfortus would be the first broadly protective option for newborns and infantsParis  September 16  2022. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. If approved  Beyfortus would be the first and only single-dose passive immunization for the broad infant population  including those born healthy  at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions. Beyfortus is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Jean-François ToussaintGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines  Sanofi“Today’s positive CHMP opinion is one of the most significant public health achievements in RSV in decades and has the potential to alleviate the enormous physical and emotional burden that RSV can place on families and healthcare systems. With this endorsement  we are one step closer to achieving our goal of protecting all infants against RSV with a single dose.”Iskra ReicExecutive Vice President  Vaccines and Immune Therapies  AstraZeneca“This positive CHMP opinion underscores Beyfortus’ potential as a ground-breaking  first-in-class passive immunization that could transform the medical community’s approach to RSV prevention in infants.”The CHMP based its positive opinion on results from the Beyfortus clinical development program  including the Phase 3 MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY  and Phase 2b trials.1-8 In the MELODY and Phase 2b trials  Beyfortus met its primary endpoint of reducing the incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) caused by RSV during the RSV season vs. placebo with a single dose. 1-6 The safety profile of Beyfortus was similar to placebo. Beyfortus also demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to palivizumab in the Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial.7-8Story continuesRSV is the most common cause of LRTIs and a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations occurring in infants born healthy and at term.9-13 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14 Currently there is no preventative option available for all infants and treatment is limited to symptomatic relief.15 16About BeyfortusBeyfortus® (nirsevimab)  an investigational long-acting antibody designed for all infants for protection against RSV disease from birth through their first RSV season with a single dose  is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Beyfortus has been developed to offer newborns and infants direct RSV protection via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely  rapid and direct protection against disease.17In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialization activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements.Beyfortus has been granted designations to facilitate expedited development by several major regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation byThe China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The safety and efficacy of Beyfortus was evaluated under an accelerated assessment procedure by the EMA. Beyfortus has not been approved by any regulatory authority.About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29–35 weeks’ gestation were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  caused by RSV by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2) compared to placebo. Between November 2016 and December 2017  1 453 infants were randomized (Beyfortus  n=969; placebo  n=484) at the RSV season start. Studies were conducted in both hemispheres  at 164 sites in 23 countries.3 4 Data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in July 2020. The dosing regimen was recommended based on further exploration of the phase 2b data.3 The subsequent Phase 3 study  MELODY  applied the recommended dosing regimen.2The Phase 3 MELODY trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing  versus placebo  in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.1 2 The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV by 74.5% (95% CI 49.6  87.1; P<0.001) compared to placebo. Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. Between July 2019 and March 2020  1 490 infants were randomized to either Beyfortus or placebo at the RSV season start.1 2 Data was published on the primary analysis in NEJM in March 2022.Findings from Beyfortus’ clinical trial program include a pre-specified pooled analysis of the Phase 3 MELODY trial and the recommended dose from the Phase 2b trial  in which an efficacy (relative risk reduction versus placebo) of 79.5% (95% CI 65.9  87.7; P<0.0001) was seen against medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.5 The pooled analysis studied healthy preterm and term infants who received the recommended dose of Beyfortus based on weight compared to placebo through Day 151 and showed an efficacy of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3  89.7; P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations  as published in NEJM in March 2022.1 5MEDLEY was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for Beyfortus in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.7 8 Between July 2019 and May 2021  approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose.7 8 Serum levels of nirsevimab following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial  indicating similar protection in this population to that in the healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.7 Data was published in NEJM in March 2022.The results of MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and the Phase 2b trials illustrate that Beyfortus helps protect infants during their first RSV season against RSV disease with a single dose.1-8 This all-infant population includes preterm  healthy late preterm and term infants  as well as infants with specific conditions.These trials form the basis of regulatory submissions that began in 2022.About RSVRSV is the most common cause of LRTI  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants.9 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.10-13 Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations  and it was estimated that there were 26 300 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.18 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The parties have therefore concluded that the proposed merger no longer has any strategic rationale.As a result  and in agreement with the other parties  Bouygues has decided to end the review of the transaction by the Competition Authority.The parties regret that the Competition Authority did not take into account the speed and extent of the changes sweeping through the French broadcasting sector. They continue to firmly believe that a merger of the TF1 and M6 groups would have provided an appropriate response to the challenges resulting from the increased competition from the international platforms..Press and investor relations contactsTF1 groupINVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENTcomfi@tf1.frPRESS CONTACTMaylis Carcabal - +33 (0) 6 63 59 87 05 - mcarcabal@tf1.frNicole Mariello - +33 (0) 6 62 31 33 04 - nmariello@tf1.frM6 groupINVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENTGuillaume Couturié – +33 (0) 1 41 92 28 03 - guillaume.couturie@m6.frPRESS RELATIONSPaul Mennesson - +33 (0) 1 41 92 61 36 - paul.mennesson@m6.frBouygues groupINVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENTinvestors@bouygues.com – +33 (0) 1 44 20 10 79PRESS CONTACTPierre Auberger - +33 (0) 6 61 07 63 68 - pab@bouygues.comRTL GroupCOMMUNICATIONS AND INVESTOR RELATIONSOliver Fahlbusch - +49 173 284 7873 – +352 621 265 649 - oliver.fahlbusch@rtlgroup.comABOUT THE TF1 GROUPThe TF1 group is a major player in the production  publication and distribution of content.

This can have major consequences  for example fatigue is the main cause of driver errors in 20% of road accidents. Moreover  insufficient sleep leads to chronic health problems  such as diabetes  obesity  heart diseases and strokes. In order to address these major issues and to raise awareness about the importance of a good quality of sleep  Beter Bed Holding’s CEO  John Kruijssen  made an appeal to the industry to co-sign the Sleep Manifesto at the 23rd EBIA General Assembly in Copenhagen.EBIA - the European Bedding Industries’ Association - represents the interests of European mattress producers and suppliers. Mattress producers  innerspring companies  textile industries  as well as PU foam and latex suppliers and representatives of the chemical industry from all over Europe were present at the EBIA General Assembly. John Kruijssen  CEO of Beter Bed Holding  appealed to the community to sign the Sleep Manifesto  referring to results of scientific research on sleep that has increased knowledge about sleep dramatically in the past years. “What if we could address prevention and improve the quality of sleep and therefore lower overall healthcare costs and increase productivity? The quality of sleep has a significant impact on productivity. In the Netherlands alone  productivity loss is estimated to equate to 1.5% to 3% of GDP per year  which is equivalent somewhere between 13 and 26 billion euro ” stated Kruijssen. “There are a lot of other major issues that we  as the European industry  need to address in order for consumers to sleep better  and therefore  live healthier  or I should say  sleep better  live better.”Wake-up callWith the aim of helping consumers to get a better night's rest  Beter Bed launched the Sleep Manifesto earlier this month  with the aim to raise sleep awareness and improve sleep. Sleep deprivation can affect our body  brain and life expectancy. Matthew Walker  an internationally renowned sleep scientist and author of 'Why We Sleep' and TEDx speaker with more than 16 million views  recognised this problem and supported the Manifesto with his first signature. “If 50 to 60% of the entire population were to get more sleep  it would save millions of euros in healthcare spending ” said Walker while signing the Manifesto.At the EBIA  Kruijssen called on the industry to follow in Walker’s footsteps in order to put the importance of better sleep on the agenda. The aim is to encourage better sleep behaviour and provide more information to address this social problem. “Because of the lack of awareness of the benefits of healthy sleep  multisectoral public health campaigns are needed to educate the public about the importance of sleep and the consequences of insufficient sleep ” Kruijssen stated. “Our mission is simple. We believe that the better we sleep  the happier  healthier and more productive we are. And we won’t rest until everyone gets the high-quality sleep they deserve”.Beter Bed believes and promises that everyone can sleep better and does everything to fulfil this promise to increase public awareness of the importance of sleep  through its own platforms  but also through ambassadors and its network of specialists and scientists. Beter Bed has developed a set of innovative solutions  such as Beter Slapen ID  a measuring system that allows it to offer customers objective data-driven sleep advice. All with the aim of providing our employees and consumers with information on how to sleep better.About Beter Bed HoldingBeter Bed Holding (BBH) is the Netherlands’ leading sleep specialist in retail  wholesale and B2B.Our mission is simple.

This reflects some decline as expected by the management due to the increase in SME business of the Group. 96.3% of the total digital processing revenue resulted from recurring services  slightly higher due to the limited number of large projects.The gross margin of the digital processing business decreased slightly to 40.0% (H1 2021 42.8%). The decrease in the first half of the year is predominantly caused by the launching costs of the new services and by inflation impacting suppliers and salaries.Sound growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessGroup revenue was also supported by robust growth in postage and parcel optimisation services (+ 6.9% y/y in H1 to €32.4 million). Unifiedpost saw its postage and parcel optimisation business having a good H1 2022  resulting in a revenue of €32.4 million. This is an increase of €2.1 million compared to H1 2021. The increase was caused by onboarding of large new customers and general price increases. The postage & parcel optimisation realised a gross margin of 10.3% for H1 2022  down 0.7%pts from H1 2021. Likewise  this decrease has been caused by inflation.H1 2022 result impacted by peak in roll-out costBoth segments combined  i.e. the digital processing revenue and postage and parcel optimisation services  led to a gross profit of €27.0 million at a total revenue of €91.7 million. This resulted in a gross margin of 29.4% (H1 2021: 30.8%).During H1 2022  the Group spent 17.9€ million on research and development (R&D)  of which 57.2% was capitalised. The R&D spending is equivalent to 30% of digital processing revenue  which is the Group's current targeted rate for R&D investments.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses for the period increased by 22.0% y/y to a total of €22.7 million. The increase is mainly due to the three acquisitions in Q2 2021 and includes operational expenses for the pan-European structure. The operational costs related to the roll-out of Banqup which peaked in H1 2022 are expected to decline in the coming periods. Banqup demonstrates the significant additional growth potential of the Group. Unifiedpost has already obtained regulatory approval in 19 countries to issue local payment accounts with their own IBAN numbers. The Group is extending its European footprint by starting up these countries  launching branch payment offices  getting the payment business accredited by local authorities and launching new business in countries with a current limited revenue. This process includes one-off costs that can be considered investments in the further scalability of Banqup as more and more countries in Europe introduce mandatory digital invoicing.Sales & Marketing expenses were up 29.6% y/y for the period and amounted to €14.6 million. This was caused by the increasing efforts in marketing and the additional cost related to the expansion of the pan-European structure.Unifiedpost has now brought the key investment phase of the European platform roll-out to a good end. This sets the Company in a unique position to take advantage of the market growth in the coming years driven by regulation. It also allows the management to shift the focus towards becoming cash flow positive.The Group reported an EBITDA of -€6.5 million for H1 2022 (H1 2021: -€1.4 million). The EBITDA is impacted by €1.4 million non-recurring items.The loss from operations for the period amounted to €21.1 million (H1 2021: €11.1 million).Growth secured with fundingThe cash flow from financing activities amounted to +€51.6 million for the period. Unifiedpost’s cash and cash equivalents increased to €42.7 million at H1 2022. The increase was realised by the Company by signing a committed €100 million five-year senior facilities agreement  provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specializes in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. The facility is structured in a term loan facility A of €75 million which has been drawn and an uncalled capex facility B of €25 million. It remains available for 24 months from the closing date of the facilities agreement (7 March 2022).This new granted loan facility was used for the refinancing of existing financial debts for a total amount of €21.7 million and for the financing of the working capital needs of the Group (€6.8 million). The Group’s net debt position at H1 2022 amounts to €50.5 million. Besides the undrawn capex facility of €25 million of the Francisco Partners agreement  the Group has €14.3 million of other undrawn financing facilities. Based upon the cash forecast for the upcoming twelve months (period: July 2022 until June 2023)  the Group should be well equipped with sufficient liquidity.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023Throughout the remainder of the FY 2022  Unifiedpost expects to generate additional revenue by license deals for the B2B e-invoicing market. The pipeline for license sale is well stocked and will have a positive effect on the growth the Company is aiming for. These deals will support the growth rate to the targeted organic growth of at least 25% in digital processing revenues in FY 2022.In FY 2023 Group management expects to benefit from the growth of key markets. The mandatory digital e-invoicing that is taking place in several European countries is a change imposed by government on Banqup's end-users or final customers.Due to the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cash flow positive its predominant priority. The target is to be cash flow positive for H2 2023.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

Substantial progress has been made this year with completion of enrolment in the pivotal Phase 3 Mont Blanc trial for our lead asset  NCX 470  targeting glaucoma  and we are just weeks away from the results of the first of the two Phase 3 trials. These data  due in November  could provide the cornerstone for building the future of the company ” said Andreas Segerros  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “NCX 470 has already demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over the standard of care for intraocular pressure lowering  latanoprost  in a robust Phase 2 clinical trial. We have also demonstrated beneficial effects in an in vivo model of damage to the optic nerve head and retina. We believe the ongoing Phase 3 program will demonstrate the potential for NCX 470 as a best-in-class glaucoma treatment  addressing a major need in this nearly $6 billion worldwide market  and we are excited to see these results.”Andreas Segerros continued  “In my first few months here I have discovered a very strong ophthalmology-focussed R&D team  which we have since rounded out with excellent new hires  supported by an experienced  competent  corporate  finance and legal organisation. I am delighted to have joined Nicox at such an important time in the company’s history. After reviewing the portfolio  I believe we are well positioned to build upon the strength of the NCX 470 program by potentially advancing our novel nitric oxide-donating phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor  NCX 1728  and through the opportunistic addition of other programs to the development pipeline.”“The NCX 470 data presented to date has the potential to significantly impact the glaucoma treatment paradigm.” said Dr Robert Weinreb  Distinguished Professor and Chair of Ophthalmology at the University of California  San Diego  and member of Nicox’s Glaucoma Clinical Advisory Board"".First Half 2022 Business UpdateAndreas Segerros joined Nicox as Chief Executive Officer on June 1  2022.

The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. If approved  Beyfortus would be the first and only single-dose passive immunization for the broad infant population  including those born healthy  at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions. Beyfortus is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Jean-François ToussaintGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines  Sanofi“Today’s positive CHMP opinion is one of the most significant public health achievements in RSV in decades and has the potential to alleviate the enormous physical and emotional burden that RSV can place on families and healthcare systems. With this endorsement  we are one step closer to achieving our goal of protecting all infants against RSV with a single dose.”Iskra ReicExecutive Vice President  Vaccines and Immune Therapies  AstraZeneca“This positive CHMP opinion underscores Beyfortus’ potential as a ground-breaking  first-in-class passive immunization that could transform the medical community’s approach to RSV prevention in infants.”The CHMP based its positive opinion on results from the Beyfortus clinical development program  including the Phase 3 MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY  and Phase 2b trials.1-8 In the MELODY and Phase 2b trials  Beyfortus met its primary endpoint of reducing the incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) caused by RSV during the RSV season vs. placebo with a single dose. 1-6 The safety profile of Beyfortus was similar to placebo. Beyfortus also demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to palivizumab in the Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial.7-8RSV is the most common cause of LRTIs and a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations occurring in infants born healthy and at term.9-13 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14 Currently there is no preventative option available for all infants and treatment is limited to symptomatic relief.15 16About BeyfortusBeyfortus® (nirsevimab)  an investigational long-acting antibody designed for all infants for protection against RSV disease from birth through their first RSV season with a single dose  is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Beyfortus has been developed to offer newborns and infants direct RSV protection via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely  rapid and direct protection against disease.17In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialization activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements.Beyfortus has been granted designations to facilitate expedited development by several major regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation byThe China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The safety and efficacy of Beyfortus was evaluated under an accelerated assessment procedure by the EMA. Beyfortus has not been approved by any regulatory authority.About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of Beyfortus® (nirsevimab) against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29–35 weeks’ gestation were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  caused by RSV by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2) compared to placebo. Between November 2016 and December 2017  1 453 infants were randomized (Beyfortus  n=969; placebo  n=484) at the RSV season start. Studies were conducted in both hemispheres  at 164 sites in 23 countries.3 4 Data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in July 2020. The dosing regimen was recommended based on further exploration of the phase 2b data.3 The subsequent Phase 3 study  MELODY  applied the recommended dosing regimen.2The Phase 3 MELODY trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing  versus placebo  in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.1 2 The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV by 74.5% (95% CI 49.6  87.1; P<0.001) compared to placebo. Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. Between July 2019 and March 2020  1 490 infants were randomized to either Beyfortus or placebo at the RSV season start.1 2 Data was published on the primary analysis in NEJM in March 2022.Findings from Beyfortus’ clinical trial program include a pre-specified pooled analysis of the Phase 3 MELODY trial and the recommended dose from the Phase 2b trial  in which an efficacy (relative risk reduction versus placebo) of 79.5% (95% CI 65.9  87.7; P<0.0001) was seen against medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.5 The pooled analysis studied healthy preterm and term infants who received the recommended dose of Beyfortus based on weight compared to placebo through Day 151 and showed an efficacy of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3  89.7; P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations  as published in NEJM in March 2022.1 5MEDLEY was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for Beyfortus in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.7 8 Between July 2019 and May 2021  approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ≥5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose.7 8 Serum levels of nirsevimab following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial  indicating similar protection in this population to that in the healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.7 Data was published in NEJM in March 2022.The results of MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and the Phase 2b trials illustrate that Beyfortus helps protect infants during their first RSV season against RSV disease with a single dose.1-8 This all-infant population includes preterm  healthy late preterm and term infants  as well as infants with specific conditions.These trials form the basis of regulatory submissions that began in 2022.About RSVRSV is the most common cause of LRTI  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants.9 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.10-13 Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations  and it was estimated that there were 26 300 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.18 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.14About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

In light of the reduced European Commission order2  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and  as compensation  will pay IDT up to €36.2 million in cash and the equivalent of €4.5 million in kind  in the form of specified equipment purchased by Valneva.Valneva has started to deliver doses of VLA2001 to the European Member States who ordered the vaccine and is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these Member States should demand increase. In parallel  the Company is continuing discussions with various other governments around the world  with the aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets in the next six to twelve months.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe3 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom4 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates5 and Kingdom of Bahrain6. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States7 and the Kingdom of Bahrain8. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA20019.Story continuesAbout Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

10126,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4541072-michelin-stock-trading-strong-fcf-yield-ebitda,Michelin Stock: Trading At A 10-11% FCF Yield And Less Than 4.5 Times EBITDA,Michelin is one of the largest tire producers in the world. The stock is down 40% from its January high  and despite worries about the world economy  I think MGDDF stock is now attractive.,Eric Bascol/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionThe last time I looked at Michelin (OTCPK:MGDDF) (OTCPK:MGDDY) was before COVID struck. Back in January 2020 I liked what I saw as the company was trading at a 7.5% free cash flow yield and a 3.6% dividend yield  but then it dropped a little bit off my radar during COVID as the company had to deal with a lower amount of newbuild cars and a dip in the replacement market as cars and semis completed fewer kilometers. The share price bounced back nicely as economies reopened  but the share price is now down about 40% from its January peak. Time to have another look and perhaps consider starting to bottom-fish.Yahoo FinanceMichelin is part of the CAC 40 index on Euronext Paris and that obviously is the most liquid trading venue for investors interested in Michelin. The ticker symbol in Paris is ML and with an average daily volume of approximately 1.6 million shares  the Paris listing is clearly superior to any of the secondary listings. Michelin currently has a market capitalization of approximately 17B EUR based on the current share price of approximately 24 EUR per share.MGDDF represents one underlying share  MGDDY represents ½ of a share. I will refer to the Paris listing and use the EUR as base currency throughout this article. All relevant information I am referring to in this article can be found here.The first half of the year wasn't so bad  despite a continuous decrease in tires for new vehiclesThe issues in the car manufacturing industry have been going on for a few years now and tire providers like Michelin are definitely not immune. The image below shows the estimated tire volume in the 'original equipment' division (read: new cars)  and Michelin is seeing a very clear decline in its European and North American markets.Michelin Investor RelationsAnd although fewer cars were built which resulted in a demand decrease for Michelin tires to be fitted under the newbuilts  the car usage numbers continued to increase over the past 2-2.5 years since COVID initially broke out. In fact  the replacement tire volumes for cars and light trucks is now higher than in 2019.Michelin Investor RelationsMichelin reported a total revenue of just under 13.3B EUR in the first half of this year but due to the increasing COGS  the gross income increased by less than 10% to 3.64B EUR. A decent enough result but unfortunately most other expenses also increased at a pace of approximately 10% which caused the operating income to increase from 1.42B EUR to 'just' 1.53B EUR. A good result  but perhaps a little bit underwhelming.Michelin Investor RelationsAfter deducting the 273M EUR in 'other' operating expenses (according to the footnotes this is mainly related to the impairment charge on Russian assets with a few other non-recurring items contributing to the total  as you can see below)  the reported operating income was just under 1.26B EUR.Michelin Investor RelationsAs the net interest expenses are increasing and as Michelin was able to record a positive attributable income from equity-accounted investments  it was able to keep the 'damage' limited and the net income came in at 843M EUR  of which 841M EUR or 1.18 EUR per share was attributable to the common shareholders of Michelin. The average tax rate should decrease in the future as the tax bill was higher than it should be due to some non-deductible expenses.As my focus is generally on the cash flows generated by a company  I wanted to make sure Michelin is still generating a healthy amount of free cash flow. As you can see below  the reported operating cash flow was just 7M EUR but this was obviously the direct result of the 1.72B EUR investment in the working capital position. Additionally  the company paid 396M EUR in taxes although only 313M EUR was due. Adjusting the result for these two elements  the operating cash flow was just over $1.8B.Michelin Investor RelationsWe also need to deduct about 130M EUR in lease payments (which is included in the 781M EUR in 'cash flows related to financial liabilities) to end up with an adjusted operating cash flow of 1.67B EUR. Slightly lower than in H1 2021 but still a very decent result.The total capex of 980M EUR is pretty high  especially when you also take the lease payments into consideration  the total comes in at about 1.1B EUR  which is about 20% higher than the 909M EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses. That being said  looking at the capex breakdown  we see the company allocated 273M EUR to 'changes in payables'. The 'pure' capex was just 709M EUR.Michelin Investor RelationsThe full-year capex will be 1.9B EUR this year  but that is also because Michelin is catching up on the lower capex spent in 2020 and 2021 when it was reducing its cash outflow during the COVID crisis.Michelin Investor RelationsI think it is fair to assume the normalized capex will be around 1.7-1.8B EUR (similar to the amounts incurred during the pre-COVID years). The sustaining capex should be even lower than that but Michelin is hesitant to give a breakdown in sustaining capex versus growth capex. I think the normalized sustaining capex (even after taking the impact from the current inflation numbers into account) is just around 1.5B EUR per year.Applying that to an anticipated full-year operating cash flow of approximately 3.3B EUR  I anticipate the full-year sustaining free cash flow to be approximately 1.8B EUR. This translates into approximately 2.5 EUR per share.Investment thesisAnd that makes Michelin quite attractive at the current levels. Sure  an economic slowdown will also impact the demand for new tires and a volatile rubber price will also have to be dealt with by Michelin. But from a fundamental perspective with a net debt of less than 4.5B EUR (including the cash management assets) and about 4.9B EUR in EBITDA  the debt ratio (1.1) and EV/EBITDA ratio (less than 5) are appealing. Additionally  Michelin continues to generate healthy amounts of free cash flow and with an anticipated payout ratio of 50% of the recurring income  shareholders may expect a dividend of 1.2-1.4 EUR per share which would represent a yield of 5-6% (subject to the 12.8% French dividend withholding tax).I currently don't have a position in Michelin  but would be interested in going long. I will likely write some put options with a strike price that is just out of the money.,neutral,0.02,0.9,0.08,mixed,0.11,0.13,0.76,True,English,"['A 10-11% FCF Yield', 'Michelin Stock', 'Less Than', '4.5 Times EBITDA', '7.5% free cash flow yield', 'liquid trading venue', 'car manufacturing industry', ""original equipment' division"", 'North American markets', 'car usage numbers', 'other non-recurring items', 'working capital position', 'operating cash flow', 'most other expenses', 'average daily volume', 'average tax rate', ""other' operating expenses"", 'positive attributable income', 'net interest expenses', 'past 2-2.5 years', '1.72B EUR investment', 'one underlying share', 'replacement tire volumes', 'Michelin Investor Relations', 'decent enough result', 'current share price', '3.6% dividend yield', 'operating income', 'cash flows', 'cash outflow', 'net income', 'non-deductible expenses', 'amortization expenses', 'replacement market', 'tax bill', 'decent result', 'tire providers', 'gross income', 'Eric Bascol', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'lower amount', 'fewer kilometers', 'Yahoo Finance', 'CAC 40 index', 'ticker symbol', '1.6 million shares', 'secondary listings', 'market capitalization', 'base currency', 'relevant information', 'first half', 'new vehicles', 'clear decline', 'light trucks', 'increasing COGS', 'good result', '273M EUR', 'impairment charge', 'Russian assets', 'equity-accounted investments', 'common shareholders', 'healthy amount', 'direct result', '396M EUR', '313M EUR', 'two elements', 'lease payments', '781M EUR', 'financial liabilities', '980M EUR', '909M EUR', ""pure' capex"", 'full-year capex', 'lower capex', 'normalized capex', '1.7-1.8B', 'pre-COVID years', 'sustaining capex', 'Euronext Paris', 'Paris listing', 'newbuild cars', 'new cars', 'fewer cars', 'January peak', 'continuous decrease', 'total revenue', 'total capex', 'capex breakdown', 'Michelin tires', 'COVID crisis', 'Introduction', 'OTCPK', 'MGDDF', 'MGDDY', 'company', 'radar', 'dip', 'semis', 'economies', 'Time', 'look', 'part', 'investors', 'ML', '17B', 'article', 'issues', 'European', 'demand', 'newbuilts', '3B', 'less', '3.64B', 'pace', '1.42B', 'footnotes', '1.26B', 'damage', '843M', 'future', 'focus', '7M', 'taxes', '130M', '67B', 'H1', 'consideration', '1.1B', 'depreciation', 'changes', 'payables', '709M', 'amounts', '½']",2022-09-17,2022-09-17,seekingalpha.com
