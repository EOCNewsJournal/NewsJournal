10126,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4541072-michelin-stock-trading-strong-fcf-yield-ebitda,Michelin Stock: Trading At A 10-11% FCF Yield And Less Than 4.5 Times EBITDA,Michelin is one of the largest tire producers in the world. The stock is down 40% from its January high  and despite worries about the world economy  I think MGDDF stock is now attractive.,Eric Bascol/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionThe last time I looked at Michelin (OTCPK:MGDDF) (OTCPK:MGDDY) was before COVID struck. Back in January 2020 I liked what I saw as the company was trading at a 7.5% free cash flow yield and a 3.6% dividend yield  but then it dropped a little bit off my radar during COVID as the company had to deal with a lower amount of newbuild cars and a dip in the replacement market as cars and semis completed fewer kilometers. The share price bounced back nicely as economies reopened  but the share price is now down about 40% from its January peak. Time to have another look and perhaps consider starting to bottom-fish.Yahoo FinanceMichelin is part of the CAC 40 index on Euronext Paris and that obviously is the most liquid trading venue for investors interested in Michelin. The ticker symbol in Paris is ML and with an average daily volume of approximately 1.6 million shares  the Paris listing is clearly superior to any of the secondary listings. Michelin currently has a market capitalization of approximately 17B EUR based on the current share price of approximately 24 EUR per share.MGDDF represents one underlying share  MGDDY represents ½ of a share. I will refer to the Paris listing and use the EUR as base currency throughout this article. All relevant information I am referring to in this article can be found here.The first half of the year wasn't so bad  despite a continuous decrease in tires for new vehiclesThe issues in the car manufacturing industry have been going on for a few years now and tire providers like Michelin are definitely not immune. The image below shows the estimated tire volume in the 'original equipment' division (read: new cars)  and Michelin is seeing a very clear decline in its European and North American markets.Michelin Investor RelationsAnd although fewer cars were built which resulted in a demand decrease for Michelin tires to be fitted under the newbuilts  the car usage numbers continued to increase over the past 2-2.5 years since COVID initially broke out. In fact  the replacement tire volumes for cars and light trucks is now higher than in 2019.Michelin Investor RelationsMichelin reported a total revenue of just under 13.3B EUR in the first half of this year but due to the increasing COGS  the gross income increased by less than 10% to 3.64B EUR. A decent enough result but unfortunately most other expenses also increased at a pace of approximately 10% which caused the operating income to increase from 1.42B EUR to 'just' 1.53B EUR. A good result  but perhaps a little bit underwhelming.Michelin Investor RelationsAfter deducting the 273M EUR in 'other' operating expenses (according to the footnotes this is mainly related to the impairment charge on Russian assets with a few other non-recurring items contributing to the total  as you can see below)  the reported operating income was just under 1.26B EUR.Michelin Investor RelationsAs the net interest expenses are increasing and as Michelin was able to record a positive attributable income from equity-accounted investments  it was able to keep the 'damage' limited and the net income came in at 843M EUR  of which 841M EUR or 1.18 EUR per share was attributable to the common shareholders of Michelin. The average tax rate should decrease in the future as the tax bill was higher than it should be due to some non-deductible expenses.As my focus is generally on the cash flows generated by a company  I wanted to make sure Michelin is still generating a healthy amount of free cash flow. As you can see below  the reported operating cash flow was just 7M EUR but this was obviously the direct result of the 1.72B EUR investment in the working capital position. Additionally  the company paid 396M EUR in taxes although only 313M EUR was due. Adjusting the result for these two elements  the operating cash flow was just over $1.8B.Michelin Investor RelationsWe also need to deduct about 130M EUR in lease payments (which is included in the 781M EUR in 'cash flows related to financial liabilities) to end up with an adjusted operating cash flow of 1.67B EUR. Slightly lower than in H1 2021 but still a very decent result.The total capex of 980M EUR is pretty high  especially when you also take the lease payments into consideration  the total comes in at about 1.1B EUR  which is about 20% higher than the 909M EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses. That being said  looking at the capex breakdown  we see the company allocated 273M EUR to 'changes in payables'. The 'pure' capex was just 709M EUR.Michelin Investor RelationsThe full-year capex will be 1.9B EUR this year  but that is also because Michelin is catching up on the lower capex spent in 2020 and 2021 when it was reducing its cash outflow during the COVID crisis.Michelin Investor RelationsI think it is fair to assume the normalized capex will be around 1.7-1.8B EUR (similar to the amounts incurred during the pre-COVID years). The sustaining capex should be even lower than that but Michelin is hesitant to give a breakdown in sustaining capex versus growth capex. I think the normalized sustaining capex (even after taking the impact from the current inflation numbers into account) is just around 1.5B EUR per year.Applying that to an anticipated full-year operating cash flow of approximately 3.3B EUR  I anticipate the full-year sustaining free cash flow to be approximately 1.8B EUR. This translates into approximately 2.5 EUR per share.Investment thesisAnd that makes Michelin quite attractive at the current levels. Sure  an economic slowdown will also impact the demand for new tires and a volatile rubber price will also have to be dealt with by Michelin. But from a fundamental perspective with a net debt of less than 4.5B EUR (including the cash management assets) and about 4.9B EUR in EBITDA  the debt ratio (1.1) and EV/EBITDA ratio (less than 5) are appealing. Additionally  Michelin continues to generate healthy amounts of free cash flow and with an anticipated payout ratio of 50% of the recurring income  shareholders may expect a dividend of 1.2-1.4 EUR per share which would represent a yield of 5-6% (subject to the 12.8% French dividend withholding tax).I currently don't have a position in Michelin  but would be interested in going long. I will likely write some put options with a strike price that is just out of the money.,neutral,0.02,0.9,0.08,mixed,0.11,0.13,0.76,True,English,"['A 10-11% FCF Yield', 'Michelin Stock', 'Less Than', '4.5 Times EBITDA', '7.5% free cash flow yield', 'liquid trading venue', 'car manufacturing industry', ""original equipment' division"", 'North American markets', 'car usage numbers', 'other non-recurring items', 'working capital position', 'operating cash flow', 'most other expenses', 'average daily volume', 'average tax rate', ""other' operating expenses"", 'positive attributable income', 'net interest expenses', 'past 2-2.5 years', '1.72B EUR investment', 'one underlying share', 'replacement tire volumes', 'Michelin Investor Relations', 'decent enough result', 'current share price', '3.6% dividend yield', 'operating income', 'cash flows', 'cash outflow', 'net income', 'non-deductible expenses', 'amortization expenses', 'replacement market', 'tax bill', 'decent result', 'tire providers', 'gross income', 'Eric Bascol', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'lower amount', 'fewer kilometers', 'Yahoo Finance', 'CAC 40 index', 'ticker symbol', '1.6 million shares', 'secondary listings', 'market capitalization', 'base currency', 'relevant information', 'first half', 'new vehicles', 'clear decline', 'light trucks', 'increasing COGS', 'good result', '273M EUR', 'impairment charge', 'Russian assets', 'equity-accounted investments', 'common shareholders', 'healthy amount', 'direct result', '396M EUR', '313M EUR', 'two elements', 'lease payments', '781M EUR', 'financial liabilities', '980M EUR', '909M EUR', ""pure' capex"", 'full-year capex', 'lower capex', 'normalized capex', '1.7-1.8B', 'pre-COVID years', 'sustaining capex', 'Euronext Paris', 'Paris listing', 'newbuild cars', 'new cars', 'fewer cars', 'January peak', 'continuous decrease', 'total revenue', 'total capex', 'capex breakdown', 'Michelin tires', 'COVID crisis', 'Introduction', 'OTCPK', 'MGDDF', 'MGDDY', 'company', 'radar', 'dip', 'semis', 'economies', 'Time', 'look', 'part', 'investors', 'ML', '17B', 'article', 'issues', 'European', 'demand', 'newbuilts', '3B', 'less', '3.64B', 'pace', '1.42B', 'footnotes', '1.26B', 'damage', '843M', 'future', 'focus', '7M', 'taxes', '130M', '67B', 'H1', 'consideration', '1.1B', 'depreciation', 'changes', 'payables', '709M', 'amounts', '½']",2022-09-17,2022-09-18,seekingalpha.com
10129,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/09/18/treating-cancer-important-covid-cancer-stay/,Throwing cash at NHS won’t fix ‘hidden pandemic’  warns healthcare chief,Liz Truss has made no secret of the NHS being one of her three priorities since taking over as Prime Minister. Few would argue that the fabled organisation is not sagging under the pressure of a Covid operation backlog and surging waiting lists.,By his own admission  Bernd Montag cuts an imposing figure.“What one doesn't see on Zoom is I am relatively tall ” he says. “I'm a bit of a scary person ” adds the 6’9” former professional basketball player.Siemens Healthineers  the company Montag leads now his days of shooting hoops are over  is a name that perhaps rolls off the tongue less comically in his native Germany than the UK.As the eleventh-biggest company on the German stock exchange  Siemens Healthineers commands a stock market valuation of more than €50bn (£44bn)  sitting one rung below chemical and pharmaceutical titan Bayer and a step above German carmaker BMW in the Deutsche Boerse rankings.Part of Germany’s sprawling Siemens conglomerate for more than a century  Healthineers was spun off in 2018.“[We are] the clear leader in medical imaging ” says Montag.Siemens is credited with building the first X-ray tubes for medical diagnostics in 1896. It helped develop the first ultrasound technology in the 1950s. And later in the same decade  one of Siemen Healthineers predecessor firms then produced the first pacemaker.Innovations that are commonplace in many hospitals followed: the first CT scanner came out in 1975  and the MRI in 1983. Today  the company claims nine out of every 10 hospitals worldwide use its products. It employs 3 000 people in the UK and Ireland  including in Oxford which is home to its global magnet factory for MRI scanners.,negative,0.01,0.07,0.92,negative,0.02,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['hidden pandemic', 'healthcare chief', 'Throwing', 'cash', 'NHS', '6’9” former professional basketball player', 'Siemen Healthineers predecessor firms', 'stock market valuation', 'pharmaceutical titan Bayer', 'Deutsche Boerse rankings', 'global magnet factory', 'first X-ray tubes', 'first ultrasound technology', 'first CT scanner', 'German stock exchange', 'sprawling Siemens conglomerate', 'first pacemaker', 'German carmaker', 'Siemens Healthineers', 'imposing figure', 'scary person', 'one rung', 'a century', 'clear leader', 'medical imaging', 'medical diagnostics', 'same decade', 'Bernd Montag', 'biggest company', 'native Germany', 'many hospitals', 'MRI scanners', 'company Montag', '10 hospitals', 'admission', 'Zoom', 'bit', 'days', 'hoops', 'name', 'tongue', 'UK', 'eleventh', 'chemical', 'BMW', 'Part', '1950s', 'Innovations', 'products', '3,000 people', 'Ireland', 'Oxford']",2022-09-18,2022-09-18,telegraph.co.uk
