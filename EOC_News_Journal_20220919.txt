SoloSmart® is fully compatible with the pharmaceutical group's SoloStar® injection pens.The result of the collaboration initiated in 2019 between the two companies is presented as an accessory to the Sanofi SoloStar®/ DoubleStar® insulin pens  which records information about the insulin dose  time and date of each injection and transmits it via Bluetooth to a compatible mobile application. The SoloSmart® device automatically and accurately records injected doses  eliminating the need for manual logbooks and possibly allows for adapting to new patient uses of continuous glucose monitoring systems or connected BGM.Developed by BIOCORP's R&D department  SoloSmart® meets the latest requirements of the new European medical device regulation. Its commercial launch will begin early 2023 in the distribution networks approved by SANOFI and its partners. This partnership strategic step validates a substantial milestone - more details will be given on September 29th (half year results).Eric Dessertenne  CEO of BIOCORP  said: ""The expertise we have developed with Mallya leads us to improve and develop a new device by miniaturizing it  keeping data reliability. We are today very proud of developments achieved by our respective R&D and to present them today at the EASD  which brings together an international diabetes community. The strength of this industrial and commercial partnership has resulted in a technological achievement which will allow people living with diabetes  users of SoloStar® pens  to benefit from a solution that improves their daily life thanks to a presentation that is very compact but still secure and accurate.”ABOUT BIOCORPRecognized for its expertise in the development and manufacture of medical devices and delivery systems  BIOCORP has today acquired a leading position in the connected medical device market thanks to Mallya.

A waiting list for additional patients has also been established to replace any of the current 38 patients who could prove ineligible for implantation or drop out before implantation takes place. The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety and clinical benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe.The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France  where the first patient was enrolled in December 2020. Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in France  Germany  the UK  the Netherlands  and Italy. Implantations are due to be completed by the end of 2022  and a read-out of the PRIMAvera study's primary endpoints is expected around the end of 2023.""We are very pleased to have reached the target patient number in our pivotal PRIMAvera study  which has been making great progress since it was initiated in late 2020 "" said Professor Frank Holz  the lead investigator for Germany and scientific coordinator of the PRIMAvera study. ""We are excited to be advancing this innovative technology towards the market where patients suffering from dry AMD could benefit. We are looking forward to completing the implantations by the end of the year and announcing the study's read-out around the end of 2023.""Story continuesThe PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

With this acquisition  GENFIT consolidates its position in ACLF via the integration of a clinically advanced asset presenting a solid scientific rationale supported by encouraging Phase 1b and preclinical data. GENFIT will also further expand its pipeline in other liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs with additional product candidates developed by Versantis. In addition  GENFIT’s know-how in ACLF will broaden  with the integration of Versantis’ team of experts  joining forces to accelerate both research and development.Story continuesACLF is an underserved medical condition associated with short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days  depending on severity grade) and a significant cost of care. No drugs have been approved in this indication so far and incidence is growing at epidemic rates due to an aging population and a higher prevalence of diabetes  obesity  NASH  as well as alcohol and drug-induced liver injury. From a patient perspective  the ACLF syndrome is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a pre-existing advanced chronic liver disease resulting in liver and extrahepatic organ failure (brain  kidneys  cardiovascular and respiratory). The cascade of multiple organ failures  including the development of a neuropsychiatric condition called hepatic encephalopathy (HE)  together  lead to major complications in patients with ACLF  who can rapidly progress into coma and death. Every year  an estimated 137'000 patients are hospitalized in the US with ACLF  with very few therapeutic options. This represents an important unmet medical need.As a pioneer in ACLF  Versantis has acquired a unique expertise  developing clinical-stage technology and assets aiming to improve ACLF patients’ outcomes.Its main asset  VS-01  is a first-in-class innovative liposomal-based therapeutic product candidate currently in clinical development as a potential first-line therapy for the timely recovery of ACLF and UCD. If approved  it would be the first drug to use the intraperitoneal route to simultaneously support the liver  kidney and brain  the organs that most often fail in cirrhotic patients. VS-01 operates to clear toxic metabolites from the body following paracentesis  by extracting them from the blood into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity  where they are captured by proprietary scavenging liposomes which are then drained from the body. A planned 60-patient  randomized and controlled Phase 2 Proof-of-concept trial of VS-01 in ACLF is expected to launch in the fourth quarter 2022. Efficacy and safety interim data are expected as early as the first half of 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted VS-01 with the Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in ACLF and in UCD and with the Rare Pediatric Diseases Designation (RPDD) for the acute treatment of UCD. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted VS-01 with ODD in acute liver failure. Given the unmet medical need and the current standard of care  GENFIT intends to seek approval of these candidates via expedited regulatory pathways.VS-02 is a pre-clinical oral  small molecule drug candidate being developed for the chronic management of HE  considered an endemic disease worldwide. HE is a nervous system disorder brought on by advanced chronic liver disease. VS-02 will be developed as a unique colon-active formulation designed to minimize systemic absorption of ammonia and act where ammonia is primarily produced  while reducing glutamine levels in the brain.GENFIT will also be able to develop TS-01  a unique point-of-care diagnostic device in prototype development for the at-home measurement of ammonia in the blood  the primary cause of HE.The deal should be completed during the fourth quarter 2022  following completion of the consultation of GENFIT’s employees representative bodies.In parallel  GENFIT continues the development of its other program evaluating NTZ in ACLF  with a pre-IND meeting scheduled with the FDA in the coming weeks  following encouraging Phase 1 data.Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT  commented: “Versantis has an exciting portfolio that is complementary to GENFIT’s. We are also thrilled to welcome a talented team that has developed a strong scientific expertise in ACLF. We believe that significant synergies exist and that this acquisition will accelerate the development of several promising drug candidates in areas of high unmet needs.” Jean-François Mouney  Co-founder and Chairman of the Board of GENFIT  added: “This agreement is a new chapter in the implementation of GENFIT’s strategy  which expands and diversifies our portfolio with assets presenting a significant market potential.” Vincent Forster  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer and Meriam Kabbaj  PhD  Chief Operations Officer  both Board Members and Co-founders of Versantis  concluded: “We are enthusiastic to be part of GENFIT  considering their experience in exploring severe and underserved conditions. We think that GENFIT’s knowledge and experience in the development of programs targeting complex liver diseases will be invaluable to accelerate and maximize the probability of success of our programs. We also are excited by the new opportunities offered by GENFIT’s research capabilities.”FinancialsThe deal includes an initial consideration of CHF40 million due at closing  with contingent consideration of up to CHF65 million upon positive Phase 2 results for VS-01 and VS-02 and regulatory approval of VS-01. In addition  Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01’s pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party  or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs. GENFIT will finance the base acquisition consideration from its current cash and cash equivalents. Based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis’ programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate that funding of the Group’s corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.GENFIT will host a conference call on September 19  2022 at 08:00am ET / 1.00pm GMT / 2.00pm CET in English and in FrenchBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the events section at https://ir.genfit.com/ or by calling 888-394-8218 (toll-free US and Canada)  0800 358 6377 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (France toll-free) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 3338254).

With this acquisition  GENFIT consolidates its position in ACLF via the integration of a clinically advanced asset presenting a solid scientific rationale supported by encouraging Phase 1b and preclinical data. GENFIT will also further expand its pipeline in other liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs with additional product candidates developed by Versantis. In addition  GENFIT’s know-how in ACLF will broaden  with the integration of Versantis’ team of experts  joining forces to accelerate both research and development.ACLF is an underserved medical condition associated with short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days  depending on severity grade) and a significant cost of care. No drugs have been approved in this indication so far and incidence is growing at epidemic rates due to an aging population and a higher prevalence of diabetes  obesity  NASH  as well as alcohol and drug-induced liver injury. From a patient perspective  the ACLF syndrome is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a pre-existing advanced chronic liver disease resulting in liver and extrahepatic organ failure (brain  kidneys  cardiovascular and respiratory). The cascade of multiple organ failures  including the development of a neuropsychiatric condition called hepatic encephalopathy (HE)  together  lead to major complications in patients with ACLF  who can rapidly progress into coma and death. Every year  an estimated 137'000 patients are hospitalized in the US with ACLF  with very few therapeutic options. This represents an important unmet medical need.As a pioneer in ACLF  Versantis has acquired a unique expertise  developing clinical-stage technology and assets aiming to improve ACLF patients’ outcomes.Its main asset  VS-01  is a first-in-class innovative liposomal-based therapeutic product candidate currently in clinical development as a potential first-line therapy for the timely recovery of ACLF and UCD. If approved  it would be the first drug to use the intraperitoneal route to simultaneously support the liver  kidney and brain  the organs that most often fail in cirrhotic patients. VS-01 operates to clear toxic metabolites from the body following paracentesis  by extracting them from the blood into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity  where they are captured by proprietary scavenging liposomes which are then drained from the body. A planned 60-patient  randomized and controlled Phase 2 Proof-of-concept trial of VS-01 in ACLF is expected to launch in the fourth quarter 2022. Efficacy and safety interim data are expected as early as the first half of 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted VS-01 with the Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in ACLF and in UCD and with the Rare Pediatric Diseases Designation (RPDD) for the acute treatment of UCD. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted VS-01 with ODD in acute liver failure. Given the unmet medical need and the current standard of care  GENFIT intends to seek approval of these candidates via expedited regulatory pathways.VS-02 is a pre-clinical oral  small molecule drug candidate being developed for the chronic management of HE  considered an endemic disease worldwide. HE is a nervous system disorder brought on by advanced chronic liver disease. VS-02 will be developed as a unique colon-active formulation designed to minimize systemic absorption of ammonia and act where ammonia is primarily produced  while reducing glutamine levels in the brain.GENFIT will also be able to develop TS-01  a unique point-of-care diagnostic device in prototype development for the at-home measurement of ammonia in the blood  the primary cause of HE.The deal should be completed during the fourth quarter 2022  following completion of the consultation of GENFIT’s employees representative bodies.In parallel  GENFIT continues the development of its other program evaluating NTZ in ACLF  with a pre-IND meeting scheduled with the FDA in the coming weeks  following encouraging Phase 1 data.Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT  commented: “Versantis has an exciting portfolio that is complementary to GENFIT’s. We are also thrilled to welcome a talented team that has developed a strong scientific expertise in ACLF. We believe that significant synergies exist and that this acquisition will accelerate the development of several promising drug candidates in areas of high unmet needs.” Jean-François Mouney  Co-founder and Chairman of the Board of GENFIT  added: “This agreement is a new chapter in the implementation of GENFIT’s strategy  which expands and diversifies our portfolio with assets presenting a significant market potential.” Vincent Forster  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer and Meriam Kabbaj  PhD  Chief Operations Officer  both Board Members and Co-founders of Versantis  concluded: “We are enthusiastic to be part of GENFIT  considering their experience in exploring severe and underserved conditions. We think that GENFIT’s knowledge and experience in the development of programs targeting complex liver diseases will be invaluable to accelerate and maximize the probability of success of our programs. We also are excited by the new opportunities offered by GENFIT’s research capabilities.”FinancialsThe deal includes an initial consideration of CHF40 million due at closing  with contingent consideration of up to CHF65 million upon positive Phase 2 results for VS-01 and VS-02 and regulatory approval of VS-01. In addition  Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01’s pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party  or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs. GENFIT will finance the base acquisition consideration from its current cash and cash equivalents. Based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis’ programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate that funding of the Group’s corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.GENFIT will host a conference call on September 19  2022 at 08:00am ET / 1.00pm GMT / 2.00pm CET in English and in FrenchBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the events section at https://ir.genfit.com/ or by calling 888-394-8218 (toll-free US and Canada)  0800 358 6377 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (France toll-free) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 3338254).

The rest are international investment banks  such as Goldman Sachs  Citi and BNP Paribas.While Davy was forced from the panel due to its regulatory issues  many of the banks on the panel have faced scandals of their own.Danske Bank  for instance  was embroiled in a multi-jurisdictional money laundering investigation involving $200bn in transactions just four years ago. Last week it was fined €1.8m for failure to monitor transactions at its Irish branch for money laundering.The NTMA removed Davy from its panel of dealers just three days before a scheduled auction of €1.5bn of government debt. Euronext Dublin  which owns and operates the Irish Stock Exchange  also suspended its recognition of Davy as a primary dealer consequent to the NTMA’s announcement.Davy was then left scrambling to steady its crumbling franchise after the rebuke.However  a quick decision to sell the stockbroker flushed out Bank of Ireland as a buyer  in a deal that was valued at more than €600m in a three-part transaction.That deal finally closed in June  bringing Davy officially under the umbrella of Bank of Ireland.BOI  Davy and the NTMA all declined to comment.,neutral,0.07,0.58,0.35,negative,0.01,0.06,0.93,True,English,"['Irish State debt', 'Davy', 'frame', 'National Treasury Management Agency', 'multi-jurisdictional money laundering investigation', 'global investor base', 'Covid funding needs', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'state debt issuance', 'primary dealer status', 'lucrative fee income', 'bond trading scandal', 'international investment banks', 'reconstituted bond desk', 'Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland', 'primary dealer panel', 'Barclays Bank Ireland', 'management depth', 'trading income', 'potential fee', 'Irish branch', 'primary dealers', 'government debt', 'stockbroking subsidiary', 'interest rules', 'official rehabilitation', 'private client', 'dealing capability', 'marketing strategy', 'wide distribution', 'bankers’ remuneration', 'post-crash rules', 'bankers’ pay', 'strategic sense', 'multimillion-euro stream', 'busy period', 'Goldman Sachs', 'BNP Paribas', 'regulatory issues', 'Euronext Dublin', 'crumbling franchise', 'quick decision', 'three-part transaction', 'fire sale', 'recent months', 'stern rebuke', 'Central Bank', 'Danske Bank', 'The NTMA', 'government bonds', 'NTMA criteria', '18 months', 'Davy', 'ticket', 'stockbroker', 'conflict', 'inquiries', 'move', 'line', 'billions', 'March', 'fine', 'regulators', '16 people', 'response', 'experience', 'bonuses', 'access', 'Citi', 'scandals', 'instance', 'transactions', 'failure', 'auction', 'recognition', 'announcement', 'buyer', 'June', 'umbrella', 'BOI', '€']",2022-09-19,2022-09-19,independent.ie

A waiting list for additional patients has also been established to replace any of the current 38 patients who could prove ineligible for implantation or drop out before implantation takes place. The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety and clinical benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe.The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France  where the first patient was enrolled in December 2020. Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in France  Germany  the UK  the Netherlands  and Italy. Implantations are due to be completed by the end of 2022  and a read-out of the PRIMAvera study's primary endpoints is expected around the end of 2023.""We are very pleased to have reached the target patient number in our pivotal PRIMAvera study  which has been making great progress since it was initiated in late 2020 "" said Professor Frank Holz  the lead investigator for Germany and scientific coordinator of the PRIMAvera study. ""We are excited to be advancing this innovative technology towards the market where patients suffering from dry AMD could benefit. We are looking forward to completing the implantations by the end of the year and announcing the study's read-out around the end of 2023.""The PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.
