Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in France  Germany  the UK  the Netherlands  and Italy. Implantations are due to be completed by the end of 2022  and a read-out of the PRIMAvera study's primary endpoints is expected around the end of 2023.""We are very pleased to have reached the target patient number in our pivotal PRIMAvera study  which has been making great progress since it was initiated in late 2020 "" said Professor Frank Holz  the lead investigator for Germany and scientific coordinator of the PRIMAvera study. ""We are excited to be advancing this innovative technology towards the market where patients suffering from dry AMD could benefit. We are looking forward to completing the implantations by the end of the year and announcing the study's read-out around the end of 2023.""Story continuesThe PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

With this acquisition  GENFIT consolidates its position in ACLF via the integration of a clinically advanced asset presenting a solid scientific rationale supported by encouraging Phase 1b and preclinical data. GENFIT will also further expand its pipeline in other liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs with additional product candidates developed by Versantis. In addition  GENFIT’s know-how in ACLF will broaden  with the integration of Versantis’ team of experts  joining forces to accelerate both research and development.Story continuesACLF is an underserved medical condition associated with short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days  depending on severity grade) and a significant cost of care. No drugs have been approved in this indication so far and incidence is growing at epidemic rates due to an aging population and a higher prevalence of diabetes  obesity  NASH  as well as alcohol and drug-induced liver injury. From a patient perspective  the ACLF syndrome is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a pre-existing advanced chronic liver disease resulting in liver and extrahepatic organ failure (brain  kidneys  cardiovascular and respiratory). The cascade of multiple organ failures  including the development of a neuropsychiatric condition called hepatic encephalopathy (HE)  together  lead to major complications in patients with ACLF  who can rapidly progress into coma and death. Every year  an estimated 137'000 patients are hospitalized in the US with ACLF  with very few therapeutic options. This represents an important unmet medical need.As a pioneer in ACLF  Versantis has acquired a unique expertise  developing clinical-stage technology and assets aiming to improve ACLF patients’ outcomes.Its main asset  VS-01  is a first-in-class innovative liposomal-based therapeutic product candidate currently in clinical development as a potential first-line therapy for the timely recovery of ACLF and UCD. If approved  it would be the first drug to use the intraperitoneal route to simultaneously support the liver  kidney and brain  the organs that most often fail in cirrhotic patients. VS-01 operates to clear toxic metabolites from the body following paracentesis  by extracting them from the blood into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity  where they are captured by proprietary scavenging liposomes which are then drained from the body. A planned 60-patient  randomized and controlled Phase 2 Proof-of-concept trial of VS-01 in ACLF is expected to launch in the fourth quarter 2022. Efficacy and safety interim data are expected as early as the first half of 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted VS-01 with the Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in ACLF and in UCD and with the Rare Pediatric Diseases Designation (RPDD) for the acute treatment of UCD. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted VS-01 with ODD in acute liver failure. Given the unmet medical need and the current standard of care  GENFIT intends to seek approval of these candidates via expedited regulatory pathways.VS-02 is a pre-clinical oral  small molecule drug candidate being developed for the chronic management of HE  considered an endemic disease worldwide. HE is a nervous system disorder brought on by advanced chronic liver disease. VS-02 will be developed as a unique colon-active formulation designed to minimize systemic absorption of ammonia and act where ammonia is primarily produced  while reducing glutamine levels in the brain.GENFIT will also be able to develop TS-01  a unique point-of-care diagnostic device in prototype development for the at-home measurement of ammonia in the blood  the primary cause of HE.The deal should be completed during the fourth quarter 2022  following completion of the consultation of GENFIT’s employees representative bodies.In parallel  GENFIT continues the development of its other program evaluating NTZ in ACLF  with a pre-IND meeting scheduled with the FDA in the coming weeks  following encouraging Phase 1 data.Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT  commented: “Versantis has an exciting portfolio that is complementary to GENFIT’s. We are also thrilled to welcome a talented team that has developed a strong scientific expertise in ACLF. We believe that significant synergies exist and that this acquisition will accelerate the development of several promising drug candidates in areas of high unmet needs.” Jean-François Mouney  Co-founder and Chairman of the Board of GENFIT  added: “This agreement is a new chapter in the implementation of GENFIT’s strategy  which expands and diversifies our portfolio with assets presenting a significant market potential.” Vincent Forster  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer and Meriam Kabbaj  PhD  Chief Operations Officer  both Board Members and Co-founders of Versantis  concluded: “We are enthusiastic to be part of GENFIT  considering their experience in exploring severe and underserved conditions. We think that GENFIT’s knowledge and experience in the development of programs targeting complex liver diseases will be invaluable to accelerate and maximize the probability of success of our programs. We also are excited by the new opportunities offered by GENFIT’s research capabilities.”FinancialsThe deal includes an initial consideration of CHF40 million due at closing  with contingent consideration of up to CHF65 million upon positive Phase 2 results for VS-01 and VS-02 and regulatory approval of VS-01. In addition  Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01’s pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party  or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs. GENFIT will finance the base acquisition consideration from its current cash and cash equivalents. Based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis’ programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate that funding of the Group’s corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.GENFIT will host a conference call on September 19  2022 at 08:00am ET / 1.00pm GMT / 2.00pm CET in English and in FrenchBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the events section at https://ir.genfit.com/ or by calling 888-394-8218 (toll-free US and Canada)  0800 358 6377 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (France toll-free) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 3338254).

With this acquisition  GENFIT consolidates its position in ACLF via the integration of a clinically advanced asset presenting a solid scientific rationale supported by encouraging Phase 1b and preclinical data. GENFIT will also further expand its pipeline in other liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs with additional product candidates developed by Versantis. In addition  GENFIT’s know-how in ACLF will broaden  with the integration of Versantis’ team of experts  joining forces to accelerate both research and development.ACLF is an underserved medical condition associated with short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days  depending on severity grade) and a significant cost of care. No drugs have been approved in this indication so far and incidence is growing at epidemic rates due to an aging population and a higher prevalence of diabetes  obesity  NASH  as well as alcohol and drug-induced liver injury. From a patient perspective  the ACLF syndrome is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a pre-existing advanced chronic liver disease resulting in liver and extrahepatic organ failure (brain  kidneys  cardiovascular and respiratory). The cascade of multiple organ failures  including the development of a neuropsychiatric condition called hepatic encephalopathy (HE)  together  lead to major complications in patients with ACLF  who can rapidly progress into coma and death. Every year  an estimated 137'000 patients are hospitalized in the US with ACLF  with very few therapeutic options. This represents an important unmet medical need.As a pioneer in ACLF  Versantis has acquired a unique expertise  developing clinical-stage technology and assets aiming to improve ACLF patients’ outcomes.Its main asset  VS-01  is a first-in-class innovative liposomal-based therapeutic product candidate currently in clinical development as a potential first-line therapy for the timely recovery of ACLF and UCD. If approved  it would be the first drug to use the intraperitoneal route to simultaneously support the liver  kidney and brain  the organs that most often fail in cirrhotic patients. VS-01 operates to clear toxic metabolites from the body following paracentesis  by extracting them from the blood into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity  where they are captured by proprietary scavenging liposomes which are then drained from the body. A planned 60-patient  randomized and controlled Phase 2 Proof-of-concept trial of VS-01 in ACLF is expected to launch in the fourth quarter 2022. Efficacy and safety interim data are expected as early as the first half of 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted VS-01 with the Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in ACLF and in UCD and with the Rare Pediatric Diseases Designation (RPDD) for the acute treatment of UCD. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted VS-01 with ODD in acute liver failure. Given the unmet medical need and the current standard of care  GENFIT intends to seek approval of these candidates via expedited regulatory pathways.VS-02 is a pre-clinical oral  small molecule drug candidate being developed for the chronic management of HE  considered an endemic disease worldwide. HE is a nervous system disorder brought on by advanced chronic liver disease. VS-02 will be developed as a unique colon-active formulation designed to minimize systemic absorption of ammonia and act where ammonia is primarily produced  while reducing glutamine levels in the brain.GENFIT will also be able to develop TS-01  a unique point-of-care diagnostic device in prototype development for the at-home measurement of ammonia in the blood  the primary cause of HE.The deal should be completed during the fourth quarter 2022  following completion of the consultation of GENFIT’s employees representative bodies.In parallel  GENFIT continues the development of its other program evaluating NTZ in ACLF  with a pre-IND meeting scheduled with the FDA in the coming weeks  following encouraging Phase 1 data.Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT  commented: “Versantis has an exciting portfolio that is complementary to GENFIT’s. We are also thrilled to welcome a talented team that has developed a strong scientific expertise in ACLF. We believe that significant synergies exist and that this acquisition will accelerate the development of several promising drug candidates in areas of high unmet needs.” Jean-François Mouney  Co-founder and Chairman of the Board of GENFIT  added: “This agreement is a new chapter in the implementation of GENFIT’s strategy  which expands and diversifies our portfolio with assets presenting a significant market potential.” Vincent Forster  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer and Meriam Kabbaj  PhD  Chief Operations Officer  both Board Members and Co-founders of Versantis  concluded: “We are enthusiastic to be part of GENFIT  considering their experience in exploring severe and underserved conditions. We think that GENFIT’s knowledge and experience in the development of programs targeting complex liver diseases will be invaluable to accelerate and maximize the probability of success of our programs. We also are excited by the new opportunities offered by GENFIT’s research capabilities.”FinancialsThe deal includes an initial consideration of CHF40 million due at closing  with contingent consideration of up to CHF65 million upon positive Phase 2 results for VS-01 and VS-02 and regulatory approval of VS-01. In addition  Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01’s pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party  or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs. GENFIT will finance the base acquisition consideration from its current cash and cash equivalents. Based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis’ programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate that funding of the Group’s corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.GENFIT will host a conference call on September 19  2022 at 08:00am ET / 1.00pm GMT / 2.00pm CET in English and in FrenchBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the events section at https://ir.genfit.com/ or by calling 888-394-8218 (toll-free US and Canada)  0800 358 6377 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (France toll-free) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 3338254).

The rest are international investment banks  such as Goldman Sachs  Citi and BNP Paribas.While Davy was forced from the panel due to its regulatory issues  many of the banks on the panel have faced scandals of their own.Danske Bank  for instance  was embroiled in a multi-jurisdictional money laundering investigation involving $200bn in transactions just four years ago. Last week it was fined €1.8m for failure to monitor transactions at its Irish branch for money laundering.The NTMA removed Davy from its panel of dealers just three days before a scheduled auction of €1.5bn of government debt. Euronext Dublin  which owns and operates the Irish Stock Exchange  also suspended its recognition of Davy as a primary dealer consequent to the NTMA’s announcement.Davy was then left scrambling to steady its crumbling franchise after the rebuke.However  a quick decision to sell the stockbroker flushed out Bank of Ireland as a buyer  in a deal that was valued at more than €600m in a three-part transaction.That deal finally closed in June  bringing Davy officially under the umbrella of Bank of Ireland.BOI  Davy and the NTMA all declined to comment.,neutral,0.07,0.58,0.35,negative,0.01,0.06,0.93,True,English,"['Irish State debt', 'Davy', 'frame', 'National Treasury Management Agency', 'multi-jurisdictional money laundering investigation', 'global investor base', 'Covid funding needs', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'state debt issuance', 'primary dealer status', 'lucrative fee income', 'bond trading scandal', 'international investment banks', 'reconstituted bond desk', 'Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland', 'primary dealer panel', 'Barclays Bank Ireland', 'management depth', 'trading income', 'potential fee', 'Irish branch', 'primary dealers', 'government debt', 'stockbroking subsidiary', 'interest rules', 'official rehabilitation', 'private client', 'dealing capability', 'marketing strategy', 'wide distribution', 'bankers’ remuneration', 'post-crash rules', 'bankers’ pay', 'strategic sense', 'multimillion-euro stream', 'busy period', 'Goldman Sachs', 'BNP Paribas', 'regulatory issues', 'Euronext Dublin', 'crumbling franchise', 'quick decision', 'three-part transaction', 'fire sale', 'recent months', 'stern rebuke', 'Central Bank', 'Danske Bank', 'The NTMA', 'government bonds', 'NTMA criteria', '18 months', 'Davy', 'ticket', 'stockbroker', 'conflict', 'inquiries', 'move', 'line', 'billions', 'March', 'fine', 'regulators', '16 people', 'response', 'experience', 'bonuses', 'access', 'Citi', 'scandals', 'instance', 'transactions', 'failure', 'auction', 'recognition', 'announcement', 'buyer', 'June', 'umbrella', 'BOI', '€']",2022-09-19,2022-09-20,independent.ie

A waiting list for additional patients has also been established to replace any of the current 38 patients who could prove ineligible for implantation or drop out before implantation takes place. The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety and clinical benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe.The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France  where the first patient was enrolled in December 2020. Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in France  Germany  the UK  the Netherlands  and Italy. Implantations are due to be completed by the end of 2022  and a read-out of the PRIMAvera study's primary endpoints is expected around the end of 2023.""We are very pleased to have reached the target patient number in our pivotal PRIMAvera study  which has been making great progress since it was initiated in late 2020 "" said Professor Frank Holz  the lead investigator for Germany and scientific coordinator of the PRIMAvera study. ""We are excited to be advancing this innovative technology towards the market where patients suffering from dry AMD could benefit. We are looking forward to completing the implantations by the end of the year and announcing the study's read-out around the end of 2023.""The PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

10183,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/22925/fintech-in-belgium---a-country-with-unexplored-potential,Fintech in Belgium - A country with unexplored potential (Joris Lochy),Belgium is unfortunately not (yet) a hot spot of Fintech in the world. Contrary to our surrounding c...,"Belgium is unfortunately not (yet) a hot spot of Fintech in the world. Contrary to our surrounding countries from which several Fintech Unicorns have emerged (e.g. Qonto  Alan or SpenDesk in France  Revolut  Monzo and Starling Bank in the UK  Mollie  Adyen and Bunq in the Netherlands or Trade Republic  N26 and Solarisbank in Germany)  Belgium unfortunately doesn’t have a pure Fintech unicorn yet.This is unfortunate  as such unicorns often form a source of inspiration and a pool of money and people  which result in interesting new Fintech start-ups.Belgium does however have some unicorns  which have a strong link with the financial services industry  i.e. Collibra (data governance  for which the financial sector is one of their primary targets)  Odoo (a platform for business apps with strong financial integrations)  Deliverect (integration of online food orders into restaurant’s POS systems) and team.blue (provider of internet services)  but no pure Fintech player.It’s a pity that Belgium is not more dominant on the Fintech map  as it has a lot of strengths to bring to the table:First of all there is the location . Located centrally in Western Europe and having a dense road  railway and airport infrastructure  it allows to connect to the rest of Europe and the rest of the World in a very easy way.Belgium is part of the European Union and the Euro zone   meaning international expansion to other Euro countries is a lot easier  as most financial directives applicable in Belgium  also apply in other European countries and National Bank (financial) licenses can be easily passported to other European countries.There is of course also the presence of the European headquarters and several other international institutions (like e.g. the NATO). This give a close proximity to the instances discussing the financial directives of tomorrow and it also gives access to a pool of international  highly qualified resources.Belgium has a long successful history of banking and insuring   which resulted in several leading (historical) players having their international or European headquarters in Belgium  e.g. SWIFT  Euroclear  Bank of New York Mellon and MasterCard. Historically Belgium has been a pioneer in the financial services industry  with systems like Proton (a digital wallet on your bank card)  Payconiq (a QR-based payment system) or Isabel (a multi-bank system for companies to access bank their accounts from different banks in 1 platform) launched years ahead of similar initiatives in other countries. Additionally some successful Fintech avant-la-lettre like Clear2Pay  Unified Post or Isabel Group originated from Belgium.It is also the home to some of the most innovative banks in the world   like KBC and Belfius  which rank both in the top 5 of having the best mobile apps (according to several studies)  surpassing multiple well respected neobanks. These banks not only offer all the innovative features for which neobanks became famous (like digital onboarding  PFM features  account aggregation  deals in the forms of cashbacks and other promos…​)  but have gone even a step further. E.g. KBC offers access to a large amount of third-party services in their app (like mobility and government services  but also the possibility to reserve a restaurant or even a service called Goal Alert  which notifies customers via the KBC app  when a soccer highlight occurs) and aims to become a sort of super-app in Belgium.The availability of highly skilled resources   thanks to this historical presence of large financial players in Belgium and the high-quality educational system. The Belgian universities form hundreds of excellent (software) engineers  mathematicians  economists…​ who are immediately deployable in the Fintech industry and are often multi-lingual (with good knowledge of English).And finally the existing large players have a number of Fintech start-up accelerators and programs and Fintech labs  which are a great source of innovation. E.g. KBC StartIt program  Belfius Studio or different innovation programs of MasterCard (like the StartPath-programme or Mastercard Fintech Express programme).Unfortunately all those strengths don’t sufficiently compensate for the deficits of the Belgian market.First of all Belgium lacks somewhat the entrepreneurial climate that matches the Fintech sector  i.e. the Fintech sector is a world of fast and aggressive growth  which matches difficult with the Belgian entrepreneurial culture  which is more conservative and slow growing (hence also the reason of a large number of very successful historical SMEs in Belgium). Additionally the general mentality in Belgium towards entrepreneurs can be quite negative.Linked to that first point  there is also a lack of VC funds   especially for early - more risky - (seed) rounds. There are some VCs active in the field  e.g. SmartFin Capital (Jurgen Ingels)  Pamica (Michel Akkermans)  Hummingbird Ventures  Volta Ventures  Fortino…​ and also some government-supported investment vehicles like PMV  FPIM  GIMV  GIMB or Sambrinvest  but those are considerably smaller and less focused on Fintech than VCs in other countries.The small size and complexity of the market . A Belgian Fintech has only access to a market of 11 million consumers and immediately has to deal with a lot of complexity  i.e. supporting 3 or even 4 languages (Dutch  French  German and English)  cope with the regional (Flanders  Brussels and Wallonia) differences in regulation and culture/habits and needs to convince a market which is quite conservative in the adoption of new technologies.The complex structure and bureaucratic processes of Belgium  consisting of 3 regions  3 communities and a federal government  makes it hard to cope with all regulations and to find your way through the web of administration. This division of responsibilities over different government levels (e.g. fiscal regulation is a federal responsibility  while regulation and subsidies for boosting employment and innovation is at regional level) makes it also very hard to come with an englobing ""master"" plan to boost the Fintech sector (like e.g. the successful initiative of president Macron in France to boost the Fintech sector).Even in a small country like Belgium  different hubs - often linked to (competing) universities (i.e. mainly Brussels  Antwerp  Ghent  Louvain and Louvain-La-Neuve) compete with each other  instead of working together to put Belgium on the Fintech map.Belgium has also a quite conservative and risk-reluctant regulator   which makes it hard for Fintechs (coming with new ideas) to obtain their licenses and get a fair level playing field. Additionally the Belgian regulator has its hands full with the regulation of all big historical financial institutions (of which there are a lot compared to the size of Belgium). As a result  the regulator is more a blocking than a stimulating factor. This contrary to countries like the UK and Lithuania  where the regulators have been stimulating innovation in Fintech.The Belgian market is difficult to disrupt   as it already has a very high quality of banking services. The low market penetration of successful neobanks (like N26  Revolut  Bunq…​) on the Belgian market is the best of proof of this. Even initiatives focused primarily on Belgium  like NewB (although not positioned as a Neobank  but more as a cooperative  ethical and sustainable bank)  Banx (the Belfius-Proximus initiative) and Aion have difficulties to get a substantial market share.And finally the disproportional large number of strong incumbent players tend to attract a lot of talent and often block entrepreneurship (not necessarily deliberately  but if resources are able to do interesting projects at large institutions  they might not be inclined to create or join a start-up or scale-up).Despite all this  Belgium is definitely not a green field on Fintech companies either. Quite some Fintech players are very successful both in Belgium and abroad and have enormous potential to grow even further.First of all  there are some historical (avant-la-lettre) Fintech players  like Isabel Group  Bancontact  Ogone (now Wordline-Ingenico)  Clear2Pay (now FIS)  Unified Post  Buy Way  Callatay & Wouter (now SOPRA Banking Group)…​Additionally Belgium has a rich history of strong (consulting) service providers in the financial services sector  like e.g. Capco (now part of Wipro)  Projective  DynaFin or Kronos group.But there is also a whole list of Belgian Fintechs created in the last decade such asPayTech : Fintechs simplifying national and international payments  e.g. Bancontact Payconiq : leader of payment services in Belgium  with the Bancontact payment scheme and mobile payment app Payconiq. The company is also on the short-list of the EU to be positioned as a European payment alternative for VISA and MasterCard.

We would like to meet up with you and discuss in person all the opportunities and our potential cooperation.”The division  which calls itself the distribution department of Warner Music Russia  does not work with big name international artists signed to the world’s third-biggest record label.The email directly contradicted Warner Music Group’s announcement on 10 March that it was “suspending operations in Russia  including investments in and development of projects  promotional and marketing activities  and manufacturing of all physical products” after the invasion of Ukraine in February.A spokesperson for Warner Music Group confirmed that the executive should not have been conducting business in Russia and said it has launched an investigation.“We suspended our operations in Russia in March ” he said. “This email is more than five months old  but it should not have been sent. We’re investigating what happened and we’ve also reiterated the rules of our suspension to our local team.”The transgression by the music executive notwithstanding  it is not thought that the Russian business is operating in breach of Warner Music’s rules on a day-to-day basis.However  French music group Believe  which has worked with artists including Slayer and La Roux  is continuing to operate in Russia on a much larger scale including making payments to a local streaming service that until recently was owned by the country’s largest lender  Sberbank  which is on UK  EU and US sanctions lists.After the invasion of Ukraine  Believe  one of France’s biggest tech businesses  which is valued at more than €800m (£702m) on the Paris Stock Exchange  advised Russian partners how to continue to work around sanctions while also saying it remained in full compliance with international sanctions.After a Guardian investigation  the company said that it had stopped hiring and new investment in Russia and suspended activities including releasing music from independent artists that use its services  as well as terminating relationships with local labels and artists it works with directly under international sanctions.However  it has emerged that Denis Gorshkov  the managing director of Believe’s Russia operation  is continuing to try to sign deals with artists and for new catalogues.One email  seen by the Guardian  includes a follow-up on a €3m “new offer” with a Russian label to “monetise new releases and the back catalogue”.The company said this does not break its pledge made in March as it is a new deal with an existing partner  not a new investment in Russia.“Believe has pledged for peace and made the choice to continue to operate with its local clients  artists  and partners in the Russian market in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations ” said a spokesperson for Believe. “Believe is maintaining all its operations in Russia in order to support its artists  labels and protect its people’s safety as well as ensure access to music production and distribution. Believe’s mission always remains to protect creation  artists  music and its people all over the world  and to support both teams and people.”Believe – which was founded in 2005  launched in the UK in 2010 and floated on Euronext last year – has also continued to hire staff for roles including label manager and creative producer.A spokesperson for Believe said that the new hires are to replace natural staff turnover and do not represent an expansion of its Russian operation.A financial report of a Russian artist’s activity with Believe  seen by the Guardian  also shows that it conducts business with local streaming service SberZvuk  which until recently was owned by state-controlled Sberbank.In May  Sberbank  which acquired the streaming service in 2020 to create a competitor to Apple Music  Spotify and local rival Yandex  sold its stake as part of a wider divestment of positions in Russian tech companies after the invasion.A month later  the UK also added the new owner of the streaming service  JSC New Opportunities  to its list of sanctioned businesses stating that the deal with Sberbank meant it is “involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the government of Russia by carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance  namely the Russian information  communications and digital technologies sector”.JSC New Opportunities  the new owner of Zvuk  has not been sanctioned by the EU.“Believe confirms that its assessment concluded that Zvuk has never been under EU  neither US sanctions regarding Believe’s activities ” the company said. “Should Zvuk be under European Union and/or US sanctions at any time  Believe will immediately drop out all its catalogue from this platform and terminate any kind of partnership.”The company owns brands including New York-based music distribution platform TuneCore and in 2018 bought a controlling stake in Germany’s Nuclear Blast  one of the biggest labels in rock and metal music that is home to acts including Slayer  Sepultura and Machinehead.,neutral,0.04,0.51,0.44,mixed,0.09,0.21,0.7,True,English,"['Warner Music arm', 'Russian deals', 'business suspension', 'big name international artists', 'Warner Music email addresses', 'Sir Leonard Blavatnik', 'biggest tech businesses', 'Paris Stock Exchange', 'biggest record label', 'French music group', '€3m “new offer', 'local streaming service', 'Warner Music Group', 'wider ADA operation', 'natural staff turnover', 'US sanctions lists', 'local independent labels', 'Warner Music Russia', 'French company Believe', 'international sanctions', 'streaming rates', 'local labels', 'local team', 'Russian label', 'label manager', 'Russian operation', 'music production', 'new investment', 'new catalogues', 'new releases', 'new deal', 'new hires', 'Russian arms', 'Ed Sheeran', 'Dua Lipa', 'Ukrainian-born billionaire', 'Gorky Park', 'potential cooperation', 'premium rates', 'vinyl releases', 'advanced analytics', 'physical products', 'La Roux', 'larger scale', 'largest lender', 'Denis Gorshkov', 'managing director', 'back catalogue', 'existing partner', 'Russian market', 'applicable laws', 'creative producer', 'financial report', 'Russian artist', 'local clients', 'independent artists', 'music services', 'music executive', 'ADA Russia', 'Russia operation', 'marketing email', 'One email', 'parent company', 'top executive', 'distribution department', 'marketing activities', 'day basis', 'Russian partners', 'full compliance', 'UK citizenship', 'state-controlled Sberbank', 'suspending operations', 'Russian business', 'Guardian investigation', 'Executives', 'deals', 'suspension', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Zemfira', 'The', 'YouTuber', 'rapper', 'KSI', 'offices', 'March', 'April', 'range', 'string', 'Everything', 'examples', 'person', 'opportunities', 'division', 'world', 'announcement', 'investments', 'development', 'projects', 'promotional', 'manufacturing', 'February', 'rules', 'transgression', 'breach', 'Slayer', 'payments', 'country', 'EU', 'France', 'relationships', 'follow-up', 'pledge', 'peace', 'choice', 'regulations', 'order', 'people', 'safety', 'access', 'mission', 'creation', 'teams', 'roles', 'expansion', 'activity', 'SberZvuk', 'May']",2022-09-20,2022-09-20,amp.theguardian.com

This conflict and its economic tensions weighed negatively on financial markets. Initially  differences in perception of the consequences of this war by the United States and Europe and asynchronous monetary policies in the face of inflationary risks created major international de-correlations on the markets  particularly in the second quarter. The main stock market indices ended up with a fairly similar negative performance over the six-month period  with -20% for the European Eurostoxx 50 index and -21% for the S&P 500.Despite this difficult context on the world markets  the group reports excellent half-year results absorbing the decline in M&A activities  a decline consistent with the economic and geo-political situation. Annualized ROE is 20.2%. This result once again confirms the excellence of the group's know-how in a context of high volatility.Dividend PolicyOn the proposal of the Board of Directors  and in accordance with its quarterly distribution policy  ABC arbitrage will pay two interim dividends of €0.10 per share each. The ex-dates are scheduled on Tuesday October 11  2022 and Tuesday  December 6  2022 for payments on October 13  2022 and December 8  2022 respectively .Story continuesOutlookThe year 2022 seems to outline the end of the central bank paradigm established since 2012. The size of their balance sheets is still very significant and the ECB's anti-fragmentation stance confirms for the time being the durability of their strong presence in the market ecosystem. The war in Ukraine and the inflationary tensions resulting from past central bank interventions and catalyzed by this war are going to be the key issues in the coming months. The level of volatility  which has been hovering above its historical average since February 2022  illustrates this situation. This volatility allows most of the strategies deployed by the group to produce historically high performance. Nevertheless  geographical decorrelation remains difficult to manage for some of our strategies  in particular for the ABCA Reversion fund. Although performance was significantly better than the financial indices  it was still below the group's expectations in such a context. This  combined with legitimate investor apprehension in this type of situation  makes it unlikely that the ambitions of the ""ABC 2022"" strategic plan in terms of new assets under management will be achieved.The group's strong expertise in this type of context should enable the ABCA Reversion and ABCA Opportunities funds to come back to satisfactory levels of performance in the coming months and thus favor a resumption of growth in assets under management. As of September 1  2022  the average monthly activity rate is thus comparable to that of fiscal year 2021  despite the prohibition of working on Russian stocks and the overall decline in M&A activity. The year 2022 represents the end of the ABC 2022 strategic plan in a context of turbulent markets.Market parameters should help us finalize the majority of our objectives while maintaining our investments to begin the launch of the next strategic plan to be announced in March 2023.1As of the date of this press release  the work of the statutory auditors is in the process of being finalized.Contacts: abc-arbitrage.comShareholder relations: actionnaires@abc-arbitrage.comPress relations: VERBATEE / v.sabineu@verbatee.com EURONEXT Paris - Compartiment BISIN: FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.23,0.16,0.62,True,English,"['ABC arbitrage', 'Interim Result', '2022 annualized ROE', 'past central bank interventions', 'Bloomberg ABCA FP Attachment', 'average monthly activity rate', 'main stock market indices', 'central bank paradigm', 'M&A activity', 'Chairman Dominique Ceolin', 'asynchronous monetary policies', 'major international de-correlations', 'European Eurostoxx 50 index', 'excellent half-year results', 'M&A activities', 'legitimate investor apprehension', 'ABCA Opportunities funds', 'next strategic plan', 'Compartiment B ISIN', 'quarterly distribution policy', 'two interim dividends', 'ABCA Reversion fund', 'ABC 2022"" strategic plan', 'ABC 2022 strategic plan', 'consolidated financial statements', 'similar negative performance', 'consolidated net income', 'Second World War', 'financial indices', 'historical average', 'market ecosystem', 'Market parameters', 'second quarter', 'Dividend Policy', 'Net revenues', 'world markets', 'ABC arbitrage', 'financial markets', '2022 Interim Result', 'first half', 'United States', 'inflationary risks', 'six-month period', 'S&P 500', 'balance sheets', 'anti-fragmentation stance', 'strong presence', 'inflationary tensions', 'key issues', 'coming months', 'geographical decorrelation', 'strong expertise', 'satisfactory levels', 'Russian stocks', 'press release', 'statutory auditors', 'Shareholder relations', 'Press relations', 'EURONEXT Paris', 'Reuters BITI', 'Business performance', 'high performance', 'turbulent markets', '2022 annualized ROE', 'IFRS standards', 'economic tensions', 'new assets', 'high volatility', 'fiscal year', 'overall decline', 'geo-political situation', 'difficult context', 'IFRS June', 'Tuesday October', '2021 IFRS', '30 June', 'year 2022', 'Board', 'Directors', 'September', 'millions', 'Dec.', 'Earnings', 'Return', 'Equity', 'accordance', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'differences', 'perception', 'consequences', 'face', 'group', 'excellence', 'know', 'proposal', 'ex-dates', 'December', 'payments', 'Story', 'Outlook', 'size', 'ECB', 'durability', 'February', 'strategies', 'expectations', 'type', 'ambitions', 'terms', 'management', 'resumption', 'growth', 'prohibition', 'majority', 'objectives', 'investments', 'launch', 'March', 'work', 'process', 'Contacts', 'actionnaires', 'abc-arbitrage', 'VERBATEE', 'sabineu']",2022-09-20,2022-09-20,finance.yahoo.com

By combining their expertise  WALLIX and Nozomi Networks now offer industrial companies an unparalleled level of cybersecurity  ensuring business continuity  resilience to cyberattacks  and compliance with regulatory data protection requirements.Paris  20 September 2022 – WALLIX  (Euronext ALLIX) a E uropean cybersecurity software publisher and expert in Access and Identity Solutions  and Nozomi Networks  the leader in OT and IoT security  sign a technology alliance to strengthen industry cybersecurity. Nozomi Networks supports the world's largest oil  pharmaceutical  mining  and energy providers by securing their digital transformation.With digital transformation  industrial companies have modernized their production environment and equipped themselves with various connected machines and equipment (industrial IoT). As a result  operating technologies (OT) - hardware and software that control industrial equipment - have become part of the information technology (IT) network of industrial companies.Today  digital transformation is accelerating for industrial operators and critical infrastructure as they address the challenges of competitiveness  sustainable development  and traceability in both consumer and global regulatory matters. The sector is making massive use of IT technologies - the Internet of Things  cloud services  Big Data Analytics  blockchain  artificial intelligence  and cybersecurity - to optimize production costs  energy consumption  and maintenance operations  as well as to drastically reduce its carbon footprint.However  these digital uses are now potential entry points for hackers and must be secured. Indeed  a cyberattack can lead to a partial or total paralysis of operations. But before securing these vulnerable access points  the first step is to know which equipment is connected to the industrial company's OT and IT network.Nozomi Networks is the leader in its market and offers solutions that provide exceptional network visibility  without affecting equipment activity. Today  Nozomi Networks' solutions monitor over 74 million devices in thousands of facilities in the energy  manufacturing  mining  transportation  utilities  building automation  smart cities  and critical infrastructure sectors. As a result  Nozomi Networks provides its customers with immediate awareness of anomalies  cyber risks and cyber threats to which they are exposed  and it also offers detection and response to security incidents.Once the list of assets connected to the network has been established  it is essential to secure all critical digital accesses. WALLIX PAM4OT  the unified privilege management solution for industrial environments  now integrates with Nozomi Networks' technologies providing traceability of actions performed on connected devices  in addition to analysis and detection of suspicious behavior in the event of a cyberattack. By combining their expertise  WALLIX and Nozomi Networks now offer industrial companies an unprecedented level of cybersecurity. Together  the two leaders ensure business continuity  resilience to cyberattacks  and compliance with regulatory data protection requirements.""Founding a technology alliance with Nozomi Networks was an obvious choice. We are both developing technologies that enable industrial companies to implement a Zero-Trust cybersecurity architecture that aims to strengthen the cybersecurity of the sector  which is so vulnerable to cyberattacks. Together  our two platforms offer unparalleled cyber threat detection and analysis power "" said Yoann Delomier  OT Team Leader at WALLIX.""We are excited to partner with WALLIX in order to provide our industrial customers with an advanced level of cybersecurity.

This transaction  which was carried out pursuant to a decision by the Company's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on July 25  2022  took effect on September 15  2022.The old Spineway shares with a par value of €0.0001 (ISIN code: FR00140072P8) were delisted from the Euronext Growth market after the close of the market on September 14  2022 and were replaced with the new Spineway shares with a par value of €4.00 (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) on September 15  2022. The mnemonic code (ALSPW) remains unchanged.It should be noted that  as of September 14  2022  the new shares that could not be allotted individually and which correspond to fractional rights will be sold automatically by block on the market by financial intermediaries. The financial intermediaries will make the proceeds of the sale available to their shareholder clients within 30 days from September 14  2022. For more information on the reverse split  shareholders are invited to consult the notice of reverse split published in the BALO number 90 of July 29  and available on the Company's website (www.spineway.com) and the press release published on July 26  2022 also available on the Company's website.Clarification on the publication of the September 12 Euronext noticePursuant to the publication on September 12  2022 of a Euronext notice announcing the increase in the number of Spineway shares via the admission of 6 billion shares on September 14  2022  Spineway wishes to clarify to its shareholders that these 6 billion shares correspond to conversions of Negma bonds carried out over the summer  on August 5 and 19  and which related to tranches of convertible bonds previously exercised. The latter were taken into consideration by the Company's account keeper in August and largely resold by Negma before the reverse stock split.These 6 billion shares therefore have no connection with the consolidation transaction and had been admitted to trading well before September 14  2022. During the consolidation period  i.e. between August 16 and September 14  no new tranche of convertible bonds was issued nor shares converted. Moreover  in accordance with the announcement made when its half-yearly results were published  Spineway would like to reiterate that it has decided to suspend the issuance of new tranches of Convertible Bonds until the end of 20221.Reduction of the share capitalSubsequent to the reverse stock split  the Company's Board of Directors decided on September 19  2022 to reduce the share capital by reducing the par value of the Company's shares2. This purely technical operation has no impact on the value of the Company's stock value  nor on the number of shares in circulation. Thus  after this operation  the Company's share capital is still composed of 761 848 ordinary shares  i.e. the number of shares making up the share capital following the above-mentioned reverse stock split  effective on September 15.Upcoming:September 28  2022: Lyon Pôle Bourse Forum at the Palais du Commerce in LyonOctober 14  2022: Third quarter revenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

The upgraded facility  developed within the Mirafiori Complex in Turin  Italy  will complement the existing capacity in Metz  France.The Company also announced that the Mirafiori Complex will be home to its leading Circular Economy Hub  starting with three activities for the sustainable use of vehicles and parts: vehicle reconditioning  vehicle dismantling  and parts remanufacturing  with the scope set to expand further globally. This builds on the skills the Company currently has and is another important step in the implementation of the strategic plan for Stellantis’ Circular Economy Business Unit as it pushes to quadruple extended life revenues for parts and services and multiply recycling revenues by 10 times by 2030 as compared to 2021.Story continues“Today’s announcements highlight both our commitment to Italy and our ability to take responsible decisions to anticipate the upcoming global change in our industry  as we push to achieve our Dare Forward 2030 targets ” said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. “I am very thankful to everyone involved in finalizing and executing these plans on our charge to becoming a sustainable mobility tech company with the bold objective to become carbon net zero ahead of competition.”Increasing eDCT ProductionThe 50/50 joint venture between Stellantis and Punch Powertrain  called e-Transmissions Assembly  manufactures and supplies breakthrough eDCTs for the Company’s next generation of hybrid and PHEV models helping Stellantis further electrify its brand portfolio with clean  safe and affordable solutions.The new Mirafiori e-Transmissions Assembly site is expected to start production in the second half of 2024. At full production  the Mirafiori and Metz  France  facilities together will supply all relevant Stellantis manufacturing sites in Europe.Launching Company’s Leading Circular Economy HubThe Stellantis Circular Economy Business Unit is one of the seven accretive business units announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan and is a 360-degree business based on the 4Rs strategy - repair  reuse  reman and recycle.

The dedicated operation will enable the expansion of Stellantis’ current activities and support its ‘cradle-to-cradle’ business model in Europe. Later announcements will be made that will support Stellantis globally.Commitment to Italian RootsDuring a meeting in March 2022 with the Piedmont Region  the Municipality of Turin and the Industrial Association of Turin  Stellantis re affirmed its continuous commitment to Italy to improve its performance   and more specifically  to the Piedmont region to enhance the “Turin Manufacturing District” of which both of these facilities would belong. The Turin Manufacturing District serves as a vehicle production hub  an electrification engineering center and the heart of design for iconic Italian brands.Additional activities supporting this commitment and aimed at accelerating Stellantis’ global electrification transformation  include:The Melfi facility  together with Sochaux in France  will host the new electric platform called STLA Medium  specifically designed for the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market with a high level of flexibility and expected to achieve a range up to 700 kilometers (440 miles).Automotive Cells Company (ACC)  of which Stellantis is a partner with a one-third equity stake  intends to build a third European battery cell manufacturing plant in Termoli by repurposing an existing Stellantis plant to support electric vehicle battery production.The ongoing progressive electrification of all Italian plants for production of new electric or low-emission models.In the past four years  Stellantis has invested over €5 billion in Italian operations for new products and manufacturing sites.

Cattlemen Solar Park in central Texas will annually power the equivalent of 37 000 average homes.,Houston  Texas  Sept. 20  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA)  a leading renewable energy developer and operator in North America  announces the start of construction on its 240-megawatt (MW) Cattlemen I Solar Park in Milam County  Texas.Cattlemen Solar Park  which was developed and constructed and will be operated by EDPR NA  will bring a wealth of economic benefits to Milam County and the greater central Texas region through millions of dollars that will be paid to local landowners  a projected $55 million in taxes that will be paid to support area schools and community services  and millions of dollars that will be spent locally during the project’s construction and multi-decade operational life. Cattlemen will also support local jobs – both in the 400 employment opportunities created during construction and the several full-time team members who will be employed to safely run and perform routine maintenance on the park during operations. Once online in 2023  Cattlemen’s generation will be equivalent to the consumption of more than 37 000 average Texas homes. Cattlemen will also save more than 304 million gallons of water and avoid more than 271 000 tons of CO2 each year that would be needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of energy capacity as the solar park.“Cattlemen is EDP Renewables’ first solar park in Texas and will soon be our largest operational solar park in our North American portfolio ” Kris Cheney  EDP Renewables North America Executive Vice President – Central and Western Regions and Mexico  Environmental Affairs  and Energy Storage Analytics said. “The Milam County community has been a great partner throughout Cattlemen’s development. As we move closer to operation  we look forward to continuing that partnership as a contributing member of the community and expanding upon our relationship with the landowners  local officials  and residents.”EDP Renewables is a clean energy leader in Texas.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEuronext Dublin  the operator of the Irish Stock Exchange  has called on Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to introduce tax incentives for entrepreneurs to help boost initial public offerings (IPOs) in a market where flotations have trailed global trends since the financial crash.In a submission to the Government ahead of Budget 2023  which is set to be unveiled on September 27th  the exchange operator said that while IPOs open an avenue for companies to raise money to grow  they should “also reward entrepreneurs” for the risk they take in building a company. Most founders pay themselves “below market rates” to get a businesses off the ground  it added.“An IPO can create an opportunity for founders to sell some of their shares at the time of IPO or at a later date after a lock-up period. Having appropriate tax incentives to allow founders to sell part of their holdings could help boost IPOs ” said Euronext Dublin  led by chief executive Daryl Byrne. “The majority of founders will have paid themselves below market rates  while bootstrapping the business over many years.”Euronext Dublin said a measure such as reducing capital gains tax for entrepreneurs or founders selling a part of their holdings “in the context of an IPO and/or in staged elements in subsequent years would be beneficial and an important decision factor for founders choosing between an IPO  trade sale or other form of financing”.READ MORETax creditsThe submission also called for the introduction of a tax credit scheme to reduce the costs of accessing public markets for small- to medium-sized Irish businesses.“For smaller SMEs  the cost of issuance may amount to 15 per cent of the capital raised through listing  making IPOs an unattractive way of raising new funding [in particular compared to other alternative sources of financing  such as private equity] ” Euronext Dublin said.“To assist in enhancing the attractiveness and accessibility of Irish public markets to Irish companies  in particular SMEs  we consider that it would be beneficial to introduce a tax credit regime for expenses incurred by a company as part of its IPO process.”Euronext said that a tax scheme could be capped at €1 million and apply to businesses that have a market value of less than €500 million at the time of flotation. Sweden  Italy and Hungary currently have such market incentives  the submission noted.Euronext Dublin said that the costs of the tax incentives “would be very low for the exchequer  whereas the benefits would be considerable  especially given the potential contribution of newly listed scaling Irish companies to the continued growth of domestic employment and the Irish economy”.Global trendsThe Irish exchange’s IPO activity trailed global trends during an international equities bull run during the past decade  with its pipeline mainly saved by the post-crash flotations of four real-estate investment trusts (of which only Ires Reit remains listed)  two housebuilders  and the return of AIB to the bourse’s main market in 2017.Renewable-energy storage company’s Corre Energy and HealthBeacon  a medical technology company  were the only Irish stock market listings in 2021  in an otherwise record year for IPOs globally in which a total of more than $600 billion (€599 billion) was raised.Meanwhile  exits from the Irish market continued over the past two years  with the likes of recruitment firm CPL Resources and fuel forecourt retailer Applegreen  as well as property groups Yew Grove Reit and Hibernia Reit being acquired.Elsewhere  Swiss-Irish backed goods group Aryzta scrapped its Irish listing last year  underscoring how the group’s centre of gravity has moved to Zurich from Dublin. Tullow Oil said last week that it is also abandoning its Irish listing as its shares continue to be traded in London and Ghana.IPO’s worldwide fell almost 50 per cent during the first half of 2022  with the number of technology companies going public plunging 61 per cent  according to EY  as equities plunged in value amid rising inflation  interest rates and fears about the Ukraine war and global economy.,neutral,0.08,0.81,0.11,mixed,0.15,0.23,0.62,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'tax breaks', 'Government', 'IPOs', 'small- to medium-sized Irish businesses', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'four real-estate investment trusts', 'international equities bull run', 'Swiss-Irish backed goods group', 'Irish stock market listings', 'chief executive Daryl Byrne', 'Finance Paschal Donohoe', 'important decision factor', 'fuel forecourt retailer', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'initial public offerings', 'tax credit regime', 'other alternative sources', 'The Irish exchange', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'tax credit scheme', 'Renewable-energy storage company', 'Irish public markets', 'appropriate tax incentives', 'scaling Irish companies', 'below market rates', 'capital gains tax', 'medical technology company', 'past two years', 'Irish market', 'tax scheme', 'Irish economy', 'market incentives', 'Tax credits', 'other form', 'past decade', 'two housebuilders', 'technology companies', 'Irish listing', 'many years', 'subsequent years', 'Ires Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'interest rates', 'main market', 'exchange operator', 'global trends', 'financial crash', 'September 27th', 'later date', 'lock-up period', 'trade sale', '15 per cent', 'unattractive way', 'new funding', 'private equity', 'potential contribution', 'continued growth', 'domestic employment', 'Corre Energy', 'record year', 'recruitment firm', 'CPL Resources', 'property groups', 'Tullow Oil', 'first half', 'rising inflation', 'Ukraine war', 'global economy', 'market value', 'Euronext Dublin', 'smaller SMEs', 'post-crash flotations', 'IPO process', 'IPO activity', 'Most founders', 'part', 'holdings', 'IPOs', 'Photograph', 'Minister', 'entrepreneurs', 'submission', 'Government', 'Budget', 'avenue', 'money', 'risk', 'ground', 'opportunity', 'shares', 'time', 'majority', 'measure', 'context', 'elements', 'financing', 'READ', 'introduction', 'costs', 'issuance', 'attractiveness', 'accessibility', 'expenses', 'Sweden', 'Italy', 'Hungary', 'exchequer', 'benefits', 'pipeline', 'return', 'AIB', 'bourse', 'HealthBeacon', 'total', 'exits', 'likes', 'Applegreen', 'Aryzta', 'centre', 'gravity', 'Zurich', 'London', 'Ghana', 'number', 'fears']",2022-09-20,2022-09-20,irishtimes.com

All of our operating divisions contributed to the growth  with some posting growth in the double digits.To accelerate its ongoing project development  the Group has added R&D and sales staff. Furthermore  it will be a year before wage increases are passed on to clients  as the vast majority of Group contracts stipulate annual price indexing. The lag time will hamper margins in 2022  most notably at the Software & Services division. Despite the temporary disruption  the Flow  Data & marketing and BPO divisions all posted recurring operating income growth and improved their margins.Cegedim is in a great position to seize opportunities in its markets and is confident in its outlook for the second half of the year.”Key figuresIn millions of euros H1 2022 H1 2021 % chg.

Recurring operating income fell by €9.6 million.Revenue: All of the division’s activities turned in solid performances with the exception of the healthcare professional computerization business in the UK  where revenue declined  as expected.Recurring operating income(1) was hurt by increased hiring for sales teams assigned to Cegedim Santé’s latest offerings and for development teams working on innovations and who do not meet the criteria for capitalized costs.FlowThe Flux division posted like-for-like revenue growth of 8.2% in the first half of 2022. Recurring operating income increased by 43.8%.Revenue: The process digitalization and digital data flow business experienced strong growth in France.

The partnership will draw on the recognized expertise of Cegedim  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP  who all share the goal of improving patients’ access to care and making the course of care as smooth as possible.To this end  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe—who together represent 25 million beneficiaries in France—subscribed a reserved capital increase of €65 million on May 24  2022  and now own 18% of the shares of Cegedim Santé. The deal values Cegedim Santé at €360.9 million. As part of the deal  Cegedim Santé acquired Groupe VYV subsidiary MesDocteurs  a telehealth solution pioneer and one of the originators of 24/7 telemedicine.Acquisition of LaponiOn June 21  2022  Cegedim SRH acquired Laponi  an innovative solution for managing absenteeism in real time. Laponi  a French startup founded in 2016  has successfully developed a digital SaaS platform that lets companies ask internal and external employees to cover shifts when someone is absent. The Laponi solution is easy to use and alerts employees in real time about available assignments. Employees are then free to choose assignments while boosting their income. The acquisition enhances Cegedim SRH’s TeamsRH HRIS platform.An integral part of Cegedim SRH’s portfolio  Laponi will be able to help solve absenteeism issues at the company’s 400 clients  and its solution will benefit from Cegedim SRH’s technical and financial resources as well as its sales force.Laponi is profitable.TaxOn February 21  2018  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2015  to December 31  2016. After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent. the Group believes that the adjustment is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision.--------------------(1) Alternative performance indicator  for a definition and reconciliation of these figures  see point 3.6  note 2 of the 2022 Interim Financial Report.As part of this process  in the first half of 2022 Cegedim S.A. received a notice of collection and paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax losses used through 2020 and a €0.3 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments is not the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the deferred tax assets line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved. Furthermore  the Group continues to record the disputed tax losses as an asset equal to €20 million in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.Cegedim faces a maximum risk of €20.5 million at June 30  2022  as a result of the dispute  of which €12.1 million has already been paid. Cegedim believes that there is little risk with respect to this amount or to the €20 million of deferred tax assets and sees no reason to call their valuation into question.On October 21  2021  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020. The audit is currently underway.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2022Apart from the items cited below. to the best of the company’s knowledge. there were no events or changes after June 30  2022  that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Dividend paymentA dividend of c.€6 830 000 (i.e. €0.5 per share) in respect of fiscal year 2021 was approved at the General Shareholders’ Meeting on June 17  2022  and paid in July 2022.Acquisition of SediaOn July 19  2022  Cegedim e-business rounded out its Hospitalis offering by acquiring Sedia  which has specialized in software that tracks medical instrumentation usage since 1985. Thanks to this acquisition  Hospitalis now offers a medical device and implantable medical device (MD/IMD) tracking service. The service is responsible for 900 000 scans annually and has tracked more than 8 million IMDs. The newest component in the Hospitalis range  Sedia offers health  financial  and logistical tracking of MD/IMDs that are on consignment or have been lent or purchased outright.Sedia is profitable and will begin contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope on August 1  2022.Acquisition of ClinigridIn July 2022  Cegedim acquired a 70% majority stake in Clinigrid  which owns 100% of Cinityx. Clinigrid specializes in innovative data valorization models  and Clinityx has unique expertise in real world data and matching them to the SNDS (the French administrative healthcare database).OutlookCegedim still expects like-for-like revenue growth(1) of c.5% in 2022. Considering current economic conditions and the lag between the increase in prices and in wages on the one hand  and R&D investments and sales force recruitment on the other  the percentage decline in 2022 recurring operating income(1) is not expected to exceed the decline in the first half.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2022. And lastly  the Group does not provide earnings estimates or forecasts.---------------The Audit Committee met on September 19  2022. The Board of Directors  chaired by Jean-Claude Labrune  met on September 20  2022  and approved the consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022  of which the statutory auditors have conducted a limited review.

At full production  the Mirafiori and Metz  France  facilities together will supply all relevant Stellantis manufacturing sites in Europe.Launching Company’s Leading Circular Economy HubThe Stellantis Circular Economy Business Unit is one of the seven accretive business units announced in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan and is a 360-degree business based on the 4Rs strategy - repair  reuse  reman and recycle. As an independent business unit  it will generate more than €2 billion in revenues in 2030.Today’s announcement confirms the leading global Circular Economy Hub will be launched in 2023 in Mirafiori Complex. The dedicated operation will enable the expansion of Stellantis’ current activities and support its ‘cradle-to-cradle’ business model in Europe. Later announcements will be made that will support Stellantis globally.Commitment to Italian RootsDuring a meeting in March 2022 with the Piedmont Region  the Municipality of Turin and the Industrial Association of Turin  Stellantis re affirmed its continuous commitment to Italy to improve its performance   and more specifically  to the Piedmont region to enhance the “Turin Manufacturing District” of which both of these facilities would belong. The Turin Manufacturing District serves as a vehicle production hub  an electrification engineering center and the heart of design for iconic Italian brands.Additional activities supporting this commitment and aimed at accelerating Stellantis’ global electrification transformation  include:The Melfi facility  together with Sochaux in France  will host the new electric platform called STLA Medium  specifically designed for the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market with a high level of flexibility and expected to achieve a range up to 700 kilometers (440 miles).Automotive Cells Company (ACC)  of which Stellantis is a partner with a one-third equity stake  intends to build a third European battery cell manufacturing plant in Termoli by repurposing an existing Stellantis plant to support electric vehicle battery production.by repurposing an existing Stellantis plant to support electric vehicle battery production.

This conflict and its economic tensions weighed negatively on financial markets. Initially  differences in perception of the consequences of this war by the United States and Europe and asynchronous monetary policies in the face of inflationary risks created major international de-correlations on the markets  particularly in the second quarter. The main stock market indices ended up with a fairly similar negative performance over the six-month period  with -20% for the European Eurostoxx 50 index and -21% for the S&P 500.Despite this difficult context on the world markets  the group reports excellent half-year results absorbing the decline in M&A activities  a decline consistent with the economic and geo-political situation. Annualized ROE is 20.2%. This result once again confirms the excellence of the group's know-how in a context of high volatility.Dividend PolicyOn the proposal of the Board of Directors  and in accordance with its quarterly distribution policy  ABC arbitrage will pay two interim dividends of €0.10 per share each. The ex-dates are scheduled on Tuesday October 11  2022 and Tuesday  December 6  2022 for payments on October 13  2022 and December 8  2022 respectively .OutlookThe year 2022 seems to outline the end of the central bank paradigm established since 2012. The size of their balance sheets is still very significant and the ECB's anti-fragmentation stance confirms for the time being the durability of their strong presence in the market ecosystem. The war in Ukraine and the inflationary tensions resulting from past central bank interventions and catalyzed by this war are going to be the key issues in the coming months. The level of volatility  which has been hovering above its historical average since February 2022  illustrates this situation. This volatility allows most of the strategies deployed by the group to produce historically high performance. Nevertheless  geographical decorrelation remains difficult to manage for some of our strategies  in particular for the ABCA Reversion fund. Although performance was significantly better than the financial indices  it was still below the group's expectations in such a context. This  combined with legitimate investor apprehension in this type of situation  makes it unlikely that the ambitions of the ""ABC 2022"" strategic plan in terms of new assets under management will be achieved.The group's strong expertise in this type of context should enable the ABCA Reversion and ABCA Opportunities funds to come back to satisfactory levels of performance in the coming months and thus favor a resumption of growth in assets under management. As of September 1  2022  the average monthly activity rate is thus comparable to that of fiscal year 2021  despite the prohibition of working on Russian stocks and the overall decline in M&A activity. The year 2022 represents the end of the ABC 2022 strategic plan in a context of turbulent markets.Market parameters should help us finalize the majority of our objectives while maintaining our investments to begin the launch of the next strategic plan to be announced in March 2023.1As of the date of this press release  the work of the statutory auditors is in the process of being finalized.Contacts: abc-arbitrage.comShareholder relations: actionnaires@abc-arbitrage.comPress relations: VERBATEE / v.sabineu@verbatee.com EURONEXT Paris - Compartiment BISIN: FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.2,0.14,0.65,True,English,"['ABC arbitrage', 'Interim Result', '2022 annualized ROE', 'past central bank interventions', 'Bloomberg ABCA FP Attachment', 'average monthly activity rate', 'main stock market indices', 'central bank paradigm', 'M&A activity', 'Chairman Dominique Ceolin', 'asynchronous monetary policies', 'major international de-correlations', 'European Eurostoxx 50 index', 'excellent half-year results', 'M&A activities', 'legitimate investor apprehension', 'ABCA Opportunities funds', 'next strategic plan', 'Compartiment B ISIN', 'quarterly distribution policy', 'two interim dividends', 'ABCA Reversion fund', 'ABC 2022"" strategic plan', 'ABC 2022 strategic plan', 'consolidated financial statements', 'similar negative performance', 'consolidated net income', 'Second World War', 'financial indices', 'historical average', 'market ecosystem', 'Market parameters', 'second quarter', 'Dividend Policy', 'Net revenues', 'world markets', 'ABC arbitrage', 'financial markets', 'French English', '2022 Interim Result', 'first half', 'United States', 'inflationary risks', 'six-month period', 'S&P 500', 'balance sheets', 'anti-fragmentation stance', 'strong presence', 'inflationary tensions', 'key issues', 'coming months', 'geographical decorrelation', 'strong expertise', 'satisfactory levels', 'Russian stocks', 'press release', 'statutory auditors', 'Shareholder relations', 'Press relations', 'EURONEXT Paris', 'Reuters BITI', 'Business performance', 'high performance', 'turbulent markets', '2022 annualized ROE', 'IFRS standards', 'economic tensions', 'new assets', 'high volatility', 'fiscal year', 'overall decline', 'geo-political situation', 'difficult context', 'IFRS June', 'Tuesday October', '2021 IFRS', '30 June', 'year 2022', 'Board', 'Directors', 'September', 'millions', 'Dec.', 'Earnings', 'Return', 'Equity', 'accordance', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'differences', 'perception', 'consequences', 'face', 'group', 'excellence', 'know', 'proposal', 'ex-dates', 'December', 'payments', 'Outlook', 'size', 'ECB', 'durability', 'February', 'strategies', 'expectations', 'type', 'ambitions', 'terms', 'management', 'resumption', 'growth', 'prohibition', 'majority', 'objectives', 'investments', 'launch', 'March', 'work', 'process', 'Contacts', 'actionnaires', 'abc-arbitrage', 'VERBATEE', 'sabineu']",2022-09-20,2022-09-20,globenewswire.com

The partnership will draw on the recognized expertise of Cegedim  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP  who all share the goal of improving patients’ access to care and making the course of care as smooth as possible.To this end  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe—who together represent 25 million beneficiaries in France—subscribed a reserved capital increase of €65 million on May 24  2022  and now own 18% of the shares of Cegedim Santé. The deal values Cegedim Santé at €360.9 million. As part of the deal  Cegedim Santé acquired Groupe VYV subsidiary MesDocteurs  a telehealth solution pioneer and one of the originators of 24/7 telemedicine.Acquisition of LaponiOn June 21  2022  Cegedim SRH acquired Laponi  an innovative solution for managing absenteeism in real time. Laponi  a French startup founded in 2016  has successfully developed a digital SaaS platform that lets companies ask internal and external employees to cover shifts when someone is absent. The Laponi solution is easy to use and alerts employees in real time about available assignments. Employees are then free to choose assignments while boosting their income. The acquisition enhances Cegedim SRH’s TeamsRH HRIS platform.An integral part of Cegedim SRH’s portfolio  Laponi will be able to help solve absenteeism issues at the company’s 400 clients  and its solution will benefit from Cegedim SRH’s technical and financial resources as well as its sales force.Laponi is profitable.TaxOn February 21  2018  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2015  to December 31  2016. After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent. the Group believes that the adjustment is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision.--------------------(1) Alternative performance indicator  for a definition and reconciliation of these figures  see point 3.6  note 2 of the 2022 Interim Financial Report.As part of this process  in the first half of 2022 Cegedim S.A. received a notice of collection and paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax losses used through 2020 and a €0.3 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments is not the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the deferred tax assets line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved. Furthermore  the Group continues to record the disputed tax losses as an asset equal to €20 million in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.Cegedim faces a maximum risk of €20.5 million at June 30  2022  as a result of the dispute  of which €12.1 million has already been paid. Cegedim believes that there is little risk with respect to this amount or to the €20 million of deferred tax assets and sees no reason to call their valuation into question.On October 21  2021  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020. The audit is currently underway.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2022Apart from the items cited below. to the best of the company’s knowledge. there were no events or changes after June 30  2022  that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Dividend paymentA dividend of c.€6 830 000 (i.e. €0.5 per share) in respect of fiscal year 2021 was approved at the General Shareholders’ Meeting on June 17  2022  and paid in July 2022.Acquisition of SediaOn July 19  2022  Cegedim e-business rounded out its Hospitalis offering by acquiring Sedia  which has specialized in software that tracks medical instrumentation usage since 1985. Thanks to this acquisition  Hospitalis now offers a medical device and implantable medical device (MD/IMD) tracking service. The service is responsible for 900 000 scans annually and has tracked more than 8 million IMDs. The newest component in the Hospitalis range  Sedia offers health  financial  and logistical tracking of MD/IMDs that are on consignment or have been lent or purchased outright.Sedia is profitable and will begin contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope on August 1  2022.Acquisition of ClinigridIn July 2022  Cegedim acquired a 70% majority stake in Clinigrid  which owns 100% of Cinityx. Clinigrid specializes in innovative data valorization models  and Clinityx has unique expertise in real world data and matching them to the SNDS (the French administrative healthcare database).OutlookCegedim still expects like-for-like revenue growth(1) of c.5% in 2022. Considering current economic conditions and the lag between the increase in prices and in wages on the one hand  and R&D investments and sales force recruitment on the other  the percentage decline in 2022 recurring operating income(1) is not expected to exceed the decline in the first half.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2022. And lastly  the Group does not provide earnings estimates or forecasts.---------------The Audit Committee met on September 19  2022. The Board of Directors  chaired by Jean-Claude Labrune  met on September 20  2022  and approved the consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022  of which the statutory auditors have conducted a limited review.

This transaction  which was carried out pursuant to a decision by the Company's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on July 25  2022  took effect on September 15  2022.The old Spineway shares with a par value of €0.0001 (ISIN code: FR00140072P8) were delisted from the Euronext Growth market after the close of the market on September 14  2022 and were replaced with the new Spineway shares with a par value of €4.00 (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) on September 15  2022. The mnemonic code (ALSPW) remains unchanged.It should be noted that  as of September 14  2022  the new shares that could not be allotted individually and which correspond to fractional rights will be sold automatically by block on the market by financial intermediaries. The financial intermediaries will make the proceeds of the sale available to their shareholder clients within 30 days from September 14  2022. For more information on the reverse split  shareholders are invited to consult the notice of reverse split published in the BALO number 90 of July 29  and available on the Company's website (www.spineway.com) and the press release published on July 26  2022 also available on the Company's website.Clarification on the publication of the September 12 Euronext noticePursuant to the publication on September 12  2022 of a Euronext notice announcing the increase in the number of Spineway shares via the admission of 6 billion shares on September 14  2022  Spineway wishes to clarify to its shareholders that these 6 billion shares correspond to conversions of Negma bonds carried out over the summer  on August 5 and 19  and which related to tranches of convertible bonds previously exercised. The latter were taken into consideration by the Company's account keeper in August and largely resold by Negma before the reverse stock split.These 6 billion shares therefore have no connection with the consolidation transaction and had been admitted to trading well before September 14  2022. During the consolidation period  i.e. between August 16 and September 14  no new tranche of convertible bonds was issued nor shares converted. Moreover  in accordance with the announcement made when its half-yearly results were published  Spineway would like to reiterate that it has decided to suspend the issuance of new tranches of Convertible Bonds until the end of 20221.Story continuesReduction of the share capitalSubsequent to the reverse stock split  the Company's Board of Directors decided on September 19  2022 to reduce the share capital by reducing the par value of the Company's shares2. This purely technical operation has no impact on the value of the Company's stock value  nor on the number of shares in circulation. Thus  after this operation  the Company's share capital is still composed of 761 848 ordinary shares  i.e. the number of shares making up the share capital following the above-mentioned reverse stock split  effective on September 15.Upcoming:September 28  2022: Lyon Pôle Bourse Forum at the Palais du Commerce in LyonOctober 14  2022: Third quarter revenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

This subscription represents 63.3% of the Capital Increase. Truffle Capital has undertaken to hold the New Shares thus subscribed for a period of 3 months as from the settlement-delivery date.All subscriptions  whether irreducible or reducible  were served.The gross amount of the Capital Increase is EUR6 million  or a net amount of EUR5.8 million  and reflects the creation of 2 586 400 New Shares subscribed at a unit price of EUR2.32  representing a discount of 22.67% to the closing price on August 25  2022 (EUR3.00). The proceeds from this Capital Increase are expected to extend the Company's cash horizon until March 2023 and to help secure the financing of its clinical development programs with the following key short-term objectives:-- Patient recruitment for the first in-man Minerva/Epygon study;-- Acceleration and finalization of patient recruitment for the Optimise II pivotal study of KaliosTM(positive interim result published in July 2022);-- Launch of the Artus pilot/pivotal study according to the authorization date of the competent authorities.Michel Finance  Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors  and Sébastien Ladet  Chief Executive Officer  commented: ""We sincerely thank our new and existing shareholders who contributed to this critical funding for Affluent Medical.
