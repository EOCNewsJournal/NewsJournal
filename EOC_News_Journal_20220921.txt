The wider ADA operation lists artists including YouTuber and rapper KSI as clients.A marketing email sent by a top executive at ADA Russia  which is located within Warner Music’s offices and whose staff have Warner Music email addresses  tried to drum up business with local labels almost a month after its parent company announced a suspension of all operations in Russia in March.The email  sent in April and seen by the Guardian  sought to discuss “potential cooperation”  offering premium rates for a range of music services and citing a string of Russian artists the company already represents.“I would like to note that our streaming rates are much higher  we can do vinyl releases as well  and we offer advanced analytics ” the executive said in the email. “Everything is ready  and we’d like to demonstrate it in examples. We would like to meet up with you and discuss in person all the opportunities and our potential cooperation.”The division  which calls itself the distribution department of Warner Music Russia  does not work with big name international artists signed to the world’s third-biggest record label.The email directly contradicted Warner Music Group’s announcement on 10 March that it was “suspending operations in Russia  including investments in and development of projects  promotional and marketing activities  and manufacturing of all physical products” after the invasion of Ukraine in February.A spokesperson for Warner Music Group confirmed that the executive should not have been conducting business in Russia and said it has launched an investigation.“We suspended our operations in Russia in March ” he said. “This email is more than five months old  but it should not have been sent. We’re investigating what happened and we’ve also reiterated the rules of our suspension to our local team.”The transgression by the music executive notwithstanding  it is not thought that the Russian business is operating in breach of Warner Music’s rules on a day-to-day basis.However  French music group Believe  which has worked with artists including Slayer and La Roux  is continuing to operate in Russia on a much larger scale including making payments to a local streaming service that until recently was owned by the country’s largest lender  Sberbank  which is on UK  EU and US sanctions lists.After the invasion of Ukraine  Believe  one of France’s biggest tech businesses  which is valued at more than €800m (£702m) on the Paris Stock Exchange  advised Russian partners how to continue to work around sanctions while also saying it remained in full compliance with international sanctions.After a Guardian investigation  the company said that it had stopped hiring and new investment in Russia and suspended activities including releasing music from independent artists that use its services  as well as terminating relationships with local labels and artists it works with directly under international sanctions.However  it has emerged that Denis Gorshkov  the managing director of Believe’s Russia operation  is continuing to try to sign deals with artists and for new catalogues.One email  seen by the Guardian  includes a follow-up on a €3m “new offer” with a Russian label to “monetise new releases and the back catalogue”.The company said this does not break its pledge made in March as it is a new deal with an existing partner  not a new investment in Russia.“Believe has pledged for peace and made the choice to continue to operate with its local clients  artists  and partners in the Russian market in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations ” said a spokesperson for Believe. “Believe is maintaining all its operations in Russia in order to support its artists  labels and protect its people’s safety as well as ensure access to music production and distribution. Believe’s mission always remains to protect creation  artists  music and its people all over the world  and to support both teams and people.”Believe – which was founded in 2005  launched in the UK in 2010 and floated on Euronext last year – has also continued to hire staff for roles including label manager and creative producer.A spokesperson for Believe said that the new hires are to replace natural staff turnover and do not represent an expansion of its Russian operation.A financial report of a Russian artist’s activity with Believe  seen by the Guardian  also shows that it conducts business with local streaming service SberZvuk  which until recently was owned by state-controlled Sberbank.In May  Sberbank  which acquired the streaming service in 2020 to create a competitor to Apple Music  Spotify and local rival Yandex  sold its stake as part of a wider divestment of positions in Russian tech companies after the invasion.A month later  the UK also added the new owner of the streaming service  JSC New Opportunities  to its list of sanctioned businesses stating that the deal with Sberbank meant it is “involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the government of Russia by carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance  namely the Russian information  communications and digital technologies sector”.JSC New Opportunities  the new owner of Zvuk  has not been sanctioned by the EU.“Believe confirms that its assessment concluded that Zvuk has never been under EU  neither US sanctions regarding Believe’s activities ” the company said. “Should Zvuk be under European Union and/or US sanctions at any time  Believe will immediately drop out all its catalogue from this platform and terminate any kind of partnership.”The company owns brands including New York-based music distribution platform TuneCore and in 2018 bought a controlling stake in Germany’s Nuclear Blast  one of the biggest labels in rock and metal music that is home to acts including Slayer  Sepultura and Machinehead.,neutral,0.04,0.51,0.44,mixed,0.09,0.21,0.7,True,English,"['Warner Music arm', 'Russian deals', 'business suspension', 'big name international artists', 'Warner Music email addresses', 'Sir Leonard Blavatnik', 'biggest tech businesses', 'Paris Stock Exchange', 'biggest record label', 'French music group', '€3m “new offer', 'local streaming service', 'Warner Music Group', 'wider ADA operation', 'natural staff turnover', 'US sanctions lists', 'local independent labels', 'Warner Music Russia', 'French company Believe', 'international sanctions', 'streaming rates', 'local labels', 'local team', 'Russian label', 'label manager', 'Russian operation', 'music production', 'new investment', 'new catalogues', 'new releases', 'new deal', 'new hires', 'Russian arms', 'Ed Sheeran', 'Dua Lipa', 'Ukrainian-born billionaire', 'Gorky Park', 'potential cooperation', 'premium rates', 'vinyl releases', 'advanced analytics', 'physical products', 'La Roux', 'larger scale', 'largest lender', 'Denis Gorshkov', 'managing director', 'back catalogue', 'existing partner', 'Russian market', 'applicable laws', 'creative producer', 'financial report', 'Russian artist', 'local clients', 'independent artists', 'music services', 'music executive', 'ADA Russia', 'Russia operation', 'marketing email', 'One email', 'parent company', 'top executive', 'distribution department', 'marketing activities', 'day basis', 'Russian partners', 'full compliance', 'UK citizenship', 'state-controlled Sberbank', 'suspending operations', 'Russian business', 'Guardian investigation', 'Executives', 'deals', 'suspension', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Zemfira', 'The', 'YouTuber', 'rapper', 'KSI', 'offices', 'March', 'April', 'range', 'string', 'Everything', 'examples', 'person', 'opportunities', 'division', 'world', 'announcement', 'investments', 'development', 'projects', 'promotional', 'manufacturing', 'February', 'rules', 'transgression', 'breach', 'Slayer', 'payments', 'country', 'EU', 'France', 'relationships', 'follow-up', 'pledge', 'peace', 'choice', 'regulations', 'order', 'people', 'safety', 'access', 'mission', 'creation', 'teams', 'roles', 'expansion', 'activity', 'SberZvuk', 'May']",2022-09-20,2022-09-21,amp.theguardian.com

As a joined force  we have the talent and resources to further accelerate work on our proprietary platforms and the capability to enable Cellistic’s partners to bring iPSC-based allogeneic cell therapies to patients faster.”Michel Lussier  co-founder and interim CEO of Celyad Oncology  said  “We have focused our efforts on an allogeneic approach for the past few years and our manufacturing facility and staff has been a key element to enable many of our past trials  but has been underutilized in recent years as we mainly used the facility for our autologous candidates. Our current allogeneic programs are better suited for outsourced manufacturing. Through existing materials manufactured at Celyad  we have ensured the means to continue our clinical programs with cryopreserved cells until 2024. Based on this strategy  we are confident that this decision to transfer our manufacturing facility and the staff to Cellistic  who is the perfect company for such an agreement  will allow us to further execute on our business goals in the future.”Story continuesCellistic will invest substantial capital into the newly acquired 11 000 square foot facility  which will be optimized for its iPSC-based allogeneic cell therapy platforms and processes creating the world’s first purpose built facility to support customers from cell reprogramming and master cell banking through clinical trial material manufacturing.

This conflict and its economic tensions weighed negatively on financial markets. Initially  differences in perception of the consequences of this war by the United States and Europe and asynchronous monetary policies in the face of inflationary risks created major international de-correlations on the markets  particularly in the second quarter. The main stock market indices ended up with a fairly similar negative performance over the six-month period  with -20% for the European Eurostoxx 50 index and -21% for the S&P 500.Despite this difficult context on the world markets  the group reports excellent half-year results absorbing the decline in M&A activities  a decline consistent with the economic and geo-political situation. Annualized ROE is 20.2%. This result once again confirms the excellence of the group's know-how in a context of high volatility.Dividend PolicyOn the proposal of the Board of Directors  and in accordance with its quarterly distribution policy  ABC arbitrage will pay two interim dividends of €0.10 per share each. The ex-dates are scheduled on Tuesday October 11  2022 and Tuesday  December 6  2022 for payments on October 13  2022 and December 8  2022 respectively .Story continuesOutlookThe year 2022 seems to outline the end of the central bank paradigm established since 2012. The size of their balance sheets is still very significant and the ECB's anti-fragmentation stance confirms for the time being the durability of their strong presence in the market ecosystem. The war in Ukraine and the inflationary tensions resulting from past central bank interventions and catalyzed by this war are going to be the key issues in the coming months. The level of volatility  which has been hovering above its historical average since February 2022  illustrates this situation. This volatility allows most of the strategies deployed by the group to produce historically high performance. Nevertheless  geographical decorrelation remains difficult to manage for some of our strategies  in particular for the ABCA Reversion fund. Although performance was significantly better than the financial indices  it was still below the group's expectations in such a context. This  combined with legitimate investor apprehension in this type of situation  makes it unlikely that the ambitions of the ""ABC 2022"" strategic plan in terms of new assets under management will be achieved.The group's strong expertise in this type of context should enable the ABCA Reversion and ABCA Opportunities funds to come back to satisfactory levels of performance in the coming months and thus favor a resumption of growth in assets under management. As of September 1  2022  the average monthly activity rate is thus comparable to that of fiscal year 2021  despite the prohibition of working on Russian stocks and the overall decline in M&A activity. The year 2022 represents the end of the ABC 2022 strategic plan in a context of turbulent markets.Market parameters should help us finalize the majority of our objectives while maintaining our investments to begin the launch of the next strategic plan to be announced in March 2023.1As of the date of this press release  the work of the statutory auditors is in the process of being finalized.Contacts: abc-arbitrage.comShareholder relations: actionnaires@abc-arbitrage.comPress relations: VERBATEE / v.sabineu@verbatee.com EURONEXT Paris - Compartiment BISIN: FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.23,0.16,0.62,True,English,"['ABC arbitrage', 'Interim Result', '2022 annualized ROE', 'past central bank interventions', 'Bloomberg ABCA FP Attachment', 'average monthly activity rate', 'main stock market indices', 'central bank paradigm', 'M&A activity', 'Chairman Dominique Ceolin', 'asynchronous monetary policies', 'major international de-correlations', 'European Eurostoxx 50 index', 'excellent half-year results', 'M&A activities', 'legitimate investor apprehension', 'ABCA Opportunities funds', 'next strategic plan', 'Compartiment B ISIN', 'quarterly distribution policy', 'two interim dividends', 'ABCA Reversion fund', 'ABC 2022"" strategic plan', 'ABC 2022 strategic plan', 'consolidated financial statements', 'similar negative performance', 'consolidated net income', 'Second World War', 'financial indices', 'historical average', 'market ecosystem', 'Market parameters', 'second quarter', 'Dividend Policy', 'Net revenues', 'world markets', 'ABC arbitrage', 'financial markets', '2022 Interim Result', 'first half', 'United States', 'inflationary risks', 'six-month period', 'S&P 500', 'balance sheets', 'anti-fragmentation stance', 'strong presence', 'inflationary tensions', 'key issues', 'coming months', 'geographical decorrelation', 'strong expertise', 'satisfactory levels', 'Russian stocks', 'press release', 'statutory auditors', 'Shareholder relations', 'Press relations', 'EURONEXT Paris', 'Reuters BITI', 'Business performance', 'high performance', 'turbulent markets', '2022 annualized ROE', 'IFRS standards', 'economic tensions', 'new assets', 'high volatility', 'fiscal year', 'overall decline', 'geo-political situation', 'difficult context', 'IFRS June', 'Tuesday October', '2021 IFRS', '30 June', 'year 2022', 'Board', 'Directors', 'September', 'millions', 'Dec.', 'Earnings', 'Return', 'Equity', 'accordance', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'differences', 'perception', 'consequences', 'face', 'group', 'excellence', 'know', 'proposal', 'ex-dates', 'December', 'payments', 'Story', 'Outlook', 'size', 'ECB', 'durability', 'February', 'strategies', 'expectations', 'type', 'ambitions', 'terms', 'management', 'resumption', 'growth', 'prohibition', 'majority', 'objectives', 'investments', 'launch', 'March', 'work', 'process', 'Contacts', 'actionnaires', 'abc-arbitrage', 'VERBATEE', 'sabineu']",2022-09-20,2022-09-21,finance.yahoo.com

The transaction is subject to a number of customary conditions precedent and is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of this year.“We at Cellistic are incredibly excited to welcome this uniquely talented team into our organization ” said Stefan Braam  founder and CEO of Cellistic. “We’re bringing aboard a group of people whose passion and capabilities align incredibly well with our vision for the future of cell therapy. As a joined force  we have the talent and resources to further accelerate work on our proprietary platforms and the capability to enable Cellistic’s partners to bring iPSC-based allogeneic cell therapies to patients faster.”Michel Lussier  co-founder and interim CEO of Celyad Oncology  said  “We have focused our efforts on an allogeneic approach for the past few years and our manufacturing facility and staff has been a key element to enable many of our past trials  but has been underutilized in recent years as we mainly used the facility for our autologous candidates. Our current allogeneic programs are better suited for outsourced manufacturing. Through existing materials manufactured at Celyad  we have ensured the means to continue our clinical programs with cryopreserved cells until 2024. Based on this strategy  we are confident that this decision to transfer our manufacturing facility and the staff to Cellistic  who is the perfect company for such an agreement  will allow us to further execute on our business goals in the future.”Cellistic will invest substantial capital into the newly acquired 11 000 square foot facility  which will be optimized for its iPSC-based allogeneic cell therapy platforms and processes creating the world’s first purpose built facility to support customers from cell reprogramming and master cell banking through clinical trial material manufacturing.

This transaction  which was carried out pursuant to a decision by the Company's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on July 25  2022  took effect on September 15  2022.The old Spineway shares with a par value of €0.0001 (ISIN code: FR00140072P8) were delisted from the Euronext Growth market after the close of the market on September 14  2022 and were replaced with the new Spineway shares with a par value of €4.00 (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) on September 15  2022. The mnemonic code (ALSPW) remains unchanged.It should be noted that  as of September 14  2022  the new shares that could not be allotted individually and which correspond to fractional rights will be sold automatically by block on the market by financial intermediaries. The financial intermediaries will make the proceeds of the sale available to their shareholder clients within 30 days from September 14  2022. For more information on the reverse split  shareholders are invited to consult the notice of reverse split published in the BALO number 90 of July 29  and available on the Company's website (www.spineway.com) and the press release published on July 26  2022 also available on the Company's website.Clarification on the publication of the September 12 Euronext noticePursuant to the publication on September 12  2022 of a Euronext notice announcing the increase in the number of Spineway shares via the admission of 6 billion shares on September 14  2022  Spineway wishes to clarify to its shareholders that these 6 billion shares correspond to conversions of Negma bonds carried out over the summer  on August 5 and 19  and which related to tranches of convertible bonds previously exercised. The latter were taken into consideration by the Company's account keeper in August and largely resold by Negma before the reverse stock split.These 6 billion shares therefore have no connection with the consolidation transaction and had been admitted to trading well before September 14  2022. During the consolidation period  i.e. between August 16 and September 14  no new tranche of convertible bonds was issued nor shares converted. Moreover  in accordance with the announcement made when its half-yearly results were published  Spineway would like to reiterate that it has decided to suspend the issuance of new tranches of Convertible Bonds until the end of 20221.Reduction of the share capitalSubsequent to the reverse stock split  the Company's Board of Directors decided on September 19  2022 to reduce the share capital by reducing the par value of the Company's shares2. This purely technical operation has no impact on the value of the Company's stock value  nor on the number of shares in circulation. Thus  after this operation  the Company's share capital is still composed of 761 848 ordinary shares  i.e. the number of shares making up the share capital following the above-mentioned reverse stock split  effective on September 15.Upcoming:September 28  2022: Lyon Pôle Bourse Forum at the Palais du Commerce in LyonOctober 14  2022: Third quarter revenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

Cattlemen Solar Park in central Texas will annually power the equivalent of 37 000 average homes.,Houston  Texas  Sept. 20  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA)  a leading renewable energy developer and operator in North America  announces the start of construction on its 240-megawatt (MW) Cattlemen I Solar Park in Milam County  Texas.Cattlemen Solar Park  which was developed and constructed and will be operated by EDPR NA  will bring a wealth of economic benefits to Milam County and the greater central Texas region through millions of dollars that will be paid to local landowners  a projected $55 million in taxes that will be paid to support area schools and community services  and millions of dollars that will be spent locally during the project’s construction and multi-decade operational life. Cattlemen will also support local jobs – both in the 400 employment opportunities created during construction and the several full-time team members who will be employed to safely run and perform routine maintenance on the park during operations. Once online in 2023  Cattlemen’s generation will be equivalent to the consumption of more than 37 000 average Texas homes. Cattlemen will also save more than 304 million gallons of water and avoid more than 271 000 tons of CO2 each year that would be needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of energy capacity as the solar park.“Cattlemen is EDP Renewables’ first solar park in Texas and will soon be our largest operational solar park in our North American portfolio ” Kris Cheney  EDP Renewables North America Executive Vice President – Central and Western Regions and Mexico  Environmental Affairs  and Energy Storage Analytics said. “The Milam County community has been a great partner throughout Cattlemen’s development. As we move closer to operation  we look forward to continuing that partnership as a contributing member of the community and expanding upon our relationship with the landowners  local officials  and residents.”EDP Renewables is a clean energy leader in Texas.

10233,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/09/20/irish-stock-exchange-presses-government-for-tax-breaks-to-boost-ipos/,Irish stock exchange presses Government for tax breaks to boost IPOs,Exchange wants to attract more firms to go public in Dublin,Daryl Byrne  chief executive at Euronext Dublin: 'Having appropriate tax incentives to allow founders to sell part of their holdings could help boost IPOs.' Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEuronext Dublin  the operator of the Irish Stock Exchange  has called on Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to introduce tax incentives for entrepreneurs to help boost initial public offerings (IPOs) in a market where flotations have trailed global trends since the financial crash.In a submission to the Government ahead of Budget 2023  which is set to be unveiled on September 27th  the exchange operator said that while IPOs open an avenue for companies to raise money to grow  they should “also reward entrepreneurs” for the risk they take in building a company. Most founders pay themselves “below market rates” to get a businesses off the ground  it added.“An IPO can create an opportunity for founders to sell some of their shares at the time of IPO or at a later date after a lock-up period. Having appropriate tax incentives to allow founders to sell part of their holdings could help boost IPOs ” said Euronext Dublin  led by chief executive Daryl Byrne. “The majority of founders will have paid themselves below market rates  while bootstrapping the business over many years.”Euronext Dublin said a measure such as reducing capital gains tax for entrepreneurs or founders selling a part of their holdings “in the context of an IPO and/or in staged elements in subsequent years would be beneficial and an important decision factor for founders choosing between an IPO  trade sale or other form of financing”.READ MORETax creditsThe submission also called for the introduction of a tax credit scheme to reduce the costs of accessing public markets for small- to medium-sized Irish businesses.“For smaller SMEs  the cost of issuance may amount to 15 per cent of the capital raised through listing  making IPOs an unattractive way of raising new funding [in particular compared to other alternative sources of financing  such as private equity] ” Euronext Dublin said.“To assist in enhancing the attractiveness and accessibility of Irish public markets to Irish companies  in particular SMEs  we consider that it would be beneficial to introduce a tax credit regime for expenses incurred by a company as part of its IPO process.”Euronext said that a tax scheme could be capped at €1 million and apply to businesses that have a market value of less than €500 million at the time of flotation. Sweden  Italy and Hungary currently have such market incentives  the submission noted.Euronext Dublin said that the costs of the tax incentives “would be very low for the exchequer  whereas the benefits would be considerable  especially given the potential contribution of newly listed scaling Irish companies to the continued growth of domestic employment and the Irish economy”.Global trendsThe Irish exchange’s IPO activity trailed global trends during an international equities bull run during the past decade  with its pipeline mainly saved by the post-crash flotations of four real-estate investment trusts (of which only Ires Reit remains listed)  two housebuilders  and the return of AIB to the bourse’s main market in 2017.Renewable-energy storage company’s Corre Energy and HealthBeacon  a medical technology company  were the only Irish stock market listings in 2021  in an otherwise record year for IPOs globally in which a total of more than $600 billion (€599 billion) was raised.Meanwhile  exits from the Irish market continued over the past two years  with the likes of recruitment firm CPL Resources and fuel forecourt retailer Applegreen  as well as property groups Yew Grove Reit and Hibernia Reit being acquired.Elsewhere  Swiss-Irish backed goods group Aryzta scrapped its Irish listing last year  underscoring how the group’s centre of gravity has moved to Zurich from Dublin. Tullow Oil said last week that it is also abandoning its Irish listing as its shares continue to be traded in London and Ghana.IPO’s worldwide fell almost 50 per cent during the first half of 2022  with the number of technology companies going public plunging 61 per cent  according to EY  as equities plunged in value amid rising inflation  interest rates and fears about the Ukraine war and global economy.,neutral,0.08,0.81,0.11,mixed,0.15,0.23,0.62,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'tax breaks', 'Government', 'IPOs', 'small- to medium-sized Irish businesses', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'four real-estate investment trusts', 'international equities bull run', 'Swiss-Irish backed goods group', 'Irish stock market listings', 'chief executive Daryl Byrne', 'Finance Paschal Donohoe', 'important decision factor', 'fuel forecourt retailer', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'initial public offerings', 'tax credit regime', 'other alternative sources', 'The Irish exchange', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'tax credit scheme', 'Renewable-energy storage company', 'Irish public markets', 'appropriate tax incentives', 'scaling Irish companies', 'below market rates', 'capital gains tax', 'medical technology company', 'past two years', 'Irish market', 'tax scheme', 'Irish economy', 'market incentives', 'Tax credits', 'other form', 'past decade', 'two housebuilders', 'technology companies', 'Irish listing', 'many years', 'subsequent years', 'Ires Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'interest rates', 'main market', 'exchange operator', 'global trends', 'financial crash', 'September 27th', 'later date', 'lock-up period', 'trade sale', '15 per cent', 'unattractive way', 'new funding', 'private equity', 'potential contribution', 'continued growth', 'domestic employment', 'Corre Energy', 'record year', 'recruitment firm', 'CPL Resources', 'property groups', 'Tullow Oil', 'first half', 'rising inflation', 'Ukraine war', 'global economy', 'market value', 'Euronext Dublin', 'smaller SMEs', 'post-crash flotations', 'IPO process', 'IPO activity', 'Most founders', 'part', 'holdings', 'IPOs', 'Photograph', 'Minister', 'entrepreneurs', 'submission', 'Government', 'Budget', 'avenue', 'money', 'risk', 'ground', 'opportunity', 'shares', 'time', 'majority', 'measure', 'context', 'elements', 'financing', 'READ', 'introduction', 'costs', 'issuance', 'attractiveness', 'accessibility', 'expenses', 'Sweden', 'Italy', 'Hungary', 'exchequer', 'benefits', 'pipeline', 'return', 'AIB', 'bourse', 'HealthBeacon', 'total', 'exits', 'likes', 'Applegreen', 'Aryzta', 'centre', 'gravity', 'Zurich', 'London', 'Ghana', 'number', 'fears']",2022-09-20,2022-09-21,irishtimes.com

All of our operating divisions contributed to the growth  with some posting growth in the double digits.To accelerate its ongoing project development  the Group has added R&D and sales staff. Furthermore  it will be a year before wage increases are passed on to clients  as the vast majority of Group contracts stipulate annual price indexing.

After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent. the Group believes that the adjustment is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision.--------------------(1) Alternative performance indicator  for a definition and reconciliation of these figures  see point 3.6  note 2 of the 2022 Interim Financial Report.As part of this process  in the first half of 2022 Cegedim S.A. received a notice of collection and paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax losses used through 2020 and a €0.3 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments is not the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the deferred tax assets line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved. Furthermore  the Group continues to record the disputed tax losses as an asset equal to €20 million in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.Cegedim faces a maximum risk of €20.5 million at June 30  2022  as a result of the dispute  of which €12.1 million has already been paid. Cegedim believes that there is little risk with respect to this amount or to the €20 million of deferred tax assets and sees no reason to call their valuation into question.On October 21  2021  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020.

The newest component in the Hospitalis range  Sedia offers health  financial  and logistical tracking of MD/IMDs that are on consignment or have been lent or purchased outright.Sedia is profitable and will begin contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope on August 1  2022.Acquisition of ClinigridIn July 2022  Cegedim acquired a 70% majority stake in Clinigrid  which owns 100% of Cinityx. Clinigrid specializes in innovative data valorization models  and Clinityx has unique expertise in real world data and matching them to the SNDS (the French administrative healthcare database).OutlookCegedim still expects like-for-like revenue growth(1) of c.5% in 2022. Considering current economic conditions and the lag between the increase in prices and in wages on the one hand  and R&D investments and sales force recruitment on the other  the percentage decline in 2022 recurring operating income(1) is not expected to exceed the decline in the first half.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2022. And lastly  the Group does not provide earnings estimates or forecasts.---------------The Audit Committee met on September 19  2022.

This conflict and its economic tensions weighed negatively on financial markets. Initially  differences in perception of the consequences of this war by the United States and Europe and asynchronous monetary policies in the face of inflationary risks created major international de-correlations on the markets  particularly in the second quarter. The main stock market indices ended up with a fairly similar negative performance over the six-month period  with -20% for the European Eurostoxx 50 index and -21% for the S&P 500.Despite this difficult context on the world markets  the group reports excellent half-year results absorbing the decline in M&A activities  a decline consistent with the economic and geo-political situation. Annualized ROE is 20.2%. This result once again confirms the excellence of the group's know-how in a context of high volatility.Dividend PolicyOn the proposal of the Board of Directors  and in accordance with its quarterly distribution policy  ABC arbitrage will pay two interim dividends of €0.10 per share each. The ex-dates are scheduled on Tuesday October 11  2022 and Tuesday  December 6  2022 for payments on October 13  2022 and December 8  2022 respectively .OutlookThe year 2022 seems to outline the end of the central bank paradigm established since 2012. The size of their balance sheets is still very significant and the ECB's anti-fragmentation stance confirms for the time being the durability of their strong presence in the market ecosystem. The war in Ukraine and the inflationary tensions resulting from past central bank interventions and catalyzed by this war are going to be the key issues in the coming months. The level of volatility  which has been hovering above its historical average since February 2022  illustrates this situation. This volatility allows most of the strategies deployed by the group to produce historically high performance. Nevertheless  geographical decorrelation remains difficult to manage for some of our strategies  in particular for the ABCA Reversion fund. Although performance was significantly better than the financial indices  it was still below the group's expectations in such a context. This  combined with legitimate investor apprehension in this type of situation  makes it unlikely that the ambitions of the ""ABC 2022"" strategic plan in terms of new assets under management will be achieved.The group's strong expertise in this type of context should enable the ABCA Reversion and ABCA Opportunities funds to come back to satisfactory levels of performance in the coming months and thus favor a resumption of growth in assets under management. As of September 1  2022  the average monthly activity rate is thus comparable to that of fiscal year 2021  despite the prohibition of working on Russian stocks and the overall decline in M&A activity. The year 2022 represents the end of the ABC 2022 strategic plan in a context of turbulent markets.Market parameters should help us finalize the majority of our objectives while maintaining our investments to begin the launch of the next strategic plan to be announced in March 2023.1As of the date of this press release  the work of the statutory auditors is in the process of being finalized.Contacts: abc-arbitrage.comShareholder relations: actionnaires@abc-arbitrage.comPress relations: VERBATEE / v.sabineu@verbatee.com EURONEXT Paris - Compartiment BISIN: FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.2,0.14,0.65,True,English,"['ABC arbitrage', 'Interim Result', '2022 annualized ROE', 'past central bank interventions', 'Bloomberg ABCA FP Attachment', 'average monthly activity rate', 'main stock market indices', 'central bank paradigm', 'M&A activity', 'Chairman Dominique Ceolin', 'asynchronous monetary policies', 'major international de-correlations', 'European Eurostoxx 50 index', 'excellent half-year results', 'M&A activities', 'legitimate investor apprehension', 'ABCA Opportunities funds', 'next strategic plan', 'Compartiment B ISIN', 'quarterly distribution policy', 'two interim dividends', 'ABCA Reversion fund', 'ABC 2022"" strategic plan', 'ABC 2022 strategic plan', 'consolidated financial statements', 'similar negative performance', 'consolidated net income', 'Second World War', 'financial indices', 'historical average', 'market ecosystem', 'Market parameters', 'second quarter', 'Dividend Policy', 'Net revenues', 'world markets', 'ABC arbitrage', 'financial markets', 'French English', '2022 Interim Result', 'first half', 'United States', 'inflationary risks', 'six-month period', 'S&P 500', 'balance sheets', 'anti-fragmentation stance', 'strong presence', 'inflationary tensions', 'key issues', 'coming months', 'geographical decorrelation', 'strong expertise', 'satisfactory levels', 'Russian stocks', 'press release', 'statutory auditors', 'Shareholder relations', 'Press relations', 'EURONEXT Paris', 'Reuters BITI', 'Business performance', 'high performance', 'turbulent markets', '2022 annualized ROE', 'IFRS standards', 'economic tensions', 'new assets', 'high volatility', 'fiscal year', 'overall decline', 'geo-political situation', 'difficult context', 'IFRS June', 'Tuesday October', '2021 IFRS', '30 June', 'year 2022', 'Board', 'Directors', 'September', 'millions', 'Dec.', 'Earnings', 'Return', 'Equity', 'accordance', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'differences', 'perception', 'consequences', 'face', 'group', 'excellence', 'know', 'proposal', 'ex-dates', 'December', 'payments', 'Outlook', 'size', 'ECB', 'durability', 'February', 'strategies', 'expectations', 'type', 'ambitions', 'terms', 'management', 'resumption', 'growth', 'prohibition', 'majority', 'objectives', 'investments', 'launch', 'March', 'work', 'process', 'Contacts', 'actionnaires', 'abc-arbitrage', 'VERBATEE', 'sabineu']",2022-09-20,2022-09-21,globenewswire.com

Laponi  a French startup founded in 2016  has successfully developed a digital SaaS platform that lets companies ask internal and external employees to cover shifts when someone is absent.

After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent. the Group believes that the adjustment is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision.--------------------(1) Alternative performance indicator  for a definition and reconciliation of these figures  see point 3.6  note 2 of the 2022 Interim Financial Report.As part of this process  in the first half of 2022 Cegedim S.A. received a notice of collection and paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax losses used through 2020 and a €0.3 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments is not the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the deferred tax assets line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved. Furthermore  the Group continues to record the disputed tax losses as an asset equal to €20 million in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.Cegedim faces a maximum risk of €20.5 million at June 30  2022  as a result of the dispute  of which €12.1 million has already been paid. Cegedim believes that there is little risk with respect to this amount or to the €20 million of deferred tax assets and sees no reason to call their valuation into question.On October 21  2021  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020. The audit is currently underway.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2022Apart from the items cited below. to the best of the company’s knowledge. there were no events or changes after June 30  2022  that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Dividend paymentA dividend of c.€6 830 000 (i.e. €0.5 per share) in respect of fiscal year 2021 was approved at the General Shareholders’ Meeting on June 17  2022  and paid in July 2022.Acquisition of SediaOn July 19  2022  Cegedim e-business rounded out its Hospitalis offering by acquiring Sedia  which has specialized in software that tracks medical instrumentation usage since 1985. Thanks to this acquisition  Hospitalis now offers a medical device and implantable medical device (MD/IMD) tracking service. The service is responsible for 900 000 scans annually and has tracked more than 8 million IMDs. The newest component in the Hospitalis range  Sedia offers health  financial  and logistical tracking of MD/IMDs that are on consignment or have been lent or purchased outright.Sedia is profitable and will begin contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope on August 1  2022.Acquisition of ClinigridIn July 2022  Cegedim acquired a 70% majority stake in Clinigrid  which owns 100% of Cinityx.

Considering current economic conditions and the lag between the increase in prices and in wages on the one hand  and R&D investments and sales force recruitment on the other  the percentage decline in 2022 recurring operating income(1) is not expected to exceed the decline in the first half.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2022. And lastly  the Group does not provide earnings estimates or forecasts.---------------The Audit Committee met on September 19  2022.

REUTERS/Viacheslav Musiienko/File PhotoNAPERVILLE  Ill.  Sept 20 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures are hovering near the highest-ever levels for the time of year despite record global production prospects  but that optimistic crop forecast paints far too rosy a picture of the tighter wheat market setup.Relative to demand  global wheat stocks in major exporting countries may drop near record-low levels by mid-2023 following mediocre harvests in some of those countries and severe disruption in Ukraine.Top supplier Russia's export share in 2022-23 is set to exceed 20% for the third time in history  a spike needed if prices are to ease. However  global sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine  especially if they intensify  could push back on the export efforts.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterCBOT wheat prices in the latest month have averaged about 16% higher than in the year-ago period and Paris-traded Euronext futures are nearly a third higher  but global demand is set to fall just fractionally this marketing year versus last.That emphasizes the importance of successful crops and unhindered trade flows  particularly in the Black Sea region  where conflict has kept world wheat prices historically elevated since early 2022.Most-active CBOT wheat futures on Tuesday reached more than two-month highs  surging almost 8% to $8.93-3/4 per bushel as Russian-installed leaders set out plans for the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territories. read moreThis potential escalation may jeopardize the Ukraine export deal  now halfway through its 120-day renewable tenure. Grain shipments have increased from Ukraine's vital seaports since the deal's implementation  but volumes remain well below normal levels.Market participants are already making large discounts to Ukraine's export capabilities and especially grain production  which might worsen into 2023. Ukraine said Tuesday its 2023 wheat crop may reach 16-18 million tonnes versus 19 million in 2022 and 32.2 million in 2021.CBOT most-active wheat futuresRECORD OUTPUTThe U.S. Department of Agriculture sees 2022-23 global wheat production up fractionally on the year to a record 784 million tonnes  driven largely by a strong Russian crop. That is despite a nearly 40% annual decline in the recently harvested Ukrainian crop.In fact  USDA projects both production and exports out of Russia plus Ukraine to rise on the year based on the huge Russian volumes. This combined view is useful because some industry estimates of Russian wheat production include occupied areas of Ukraine.Excluding Russia's 91 million-tonne crop projection  USDA shows 2022-23 world wheat output dropping nearly 2% on the year  placing more weight on Russia's crop success and its ability to access world markets. Global exports also drop by the same degree when subtracting Russia.But finding dependable information from the region has recently been more difficult.In previous years  Reuters reported Russian harvest progress data published weekly by the agriculture ministry  but those have been absent this year. This lack of transparency is unsurprising given that Russia in April suspended publication of trade data to avoid ""speculation.""USDA in August 2021 shuttered its Russian offices due to deepening tensions between Moscow and Washington  but the agency remained confident in its ability to provide reliable estimates. It is unclear if that has proven true.Wheat traders' moods heading into next year will also be influenced by Russia's 2023-24 crop prospects  which are largely unknown right now. Farmers there should have already begun the sowing process.STOCKS-TO-USEWorld wheat stocks relative to use are set for eight-year lows  but the expected stocks-to-use ratio of 27% is not far off the long-term average.China is routinely excluded from world wheat analyses because of its small part in global trade compared with its massive stockpiles  which will account for a record 54% of global wheat supply by mid-next year according to USDA figures.World-minus-China stocks-to-use for 2022-23 is pegged at 14.6%  the second lowest on record behind 14.3% in 2007-08. That is down from 15.9% the previous year and compares with a five-year average of 18%.Wheat stocks-to-use drops to 13.8% in 2022-23 when considering only the major exporters  which account for nearly 90% of trade. That is also second lowest behind 13.1% in 2007-08 and down from 14.7% in 2021-22.That major exporter ledger does not include India or Brazil  who have been increasingly relevant in global trade and could potentially expand that footprint.

While we recently decreased our target price  click to read why we confirm our buy rating for Euronext stock.,robertomm/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine  here at the Lab  our internal team decided to move Euronext's rating from neutral to buy (OTCPK:EUXTF). Since then  it has been a continuous decline in the company's stock price. Looking at the year-to-date performances  we see that:Euronext has lost 23%; Deutsche Börse has gained 16%; the London Stock Exchange is positive by almost 10%.Euronext stock price evolution YTD Deutsche Börse stock price evolution YTD London Stock Exchange stock price evolution YTDEuronext buy case recap was based on 1) higher market volatility (using VIX as a proxy)  2) synergies from Borsa Italiana  3) IPO acceleration and 4) a strong cash flow that was supportive of an increase in the dividend per share. After our comments on the Q1 and Q2 results  we were even more positive. So  today we are wondering what has happened and what's next for this jewel.Starting with the negative news  the Italian Index called the FTSE MIB has lost more than 20% since January and many investors sold their investments due to the European energy crisis. It is also true that there were several delistings from Euronext in 2022  among the best-known names are Tods and Exor (which we recently analyzed). This is due to the persistence of different tax systems in Europe. It is a reality that some corporations choose Amsterdam over Euronext to go public for tax reasons.In addition  a few large-cap IPOs were postponed and others were listed abroad such as Ferretti in Hong Kong. Related to our point 3) and looking at the new entries on the Euronext market  IPOs were 70% less compared to 2021.Looking to the just-released data  we see a decline in trading activities with lower volumes on a monthly basis. Despite the fact that this August had two more working days  transactions were recorded minus 6%.Euronext transaction volume monthly dataWhy are we still positive?First of all  on a monthly basis  transaction volumes are down but on a yearly basis are up. This did not justify a loss in market cap of more than 23%. Moreover  we are positive about the new IPO regulation that will simplify the rules for the listing. But how will the listing process change? And  how the IPO rules will positively affect Euronext? Borsa Italiana is working to increase the admission process efficiency by streamlining bureaucracy  time and costs. This will support companies and increase the listed numbers. Borsa Italiana approved the elimination of two documents considered burdensome or no longer indispensable which at the European level are not acquired either by the market operator or by the regulators. To sum up  simplification will save up to a month and part of the documents can only be in English. Regulator's ok is expected at the end of September and once the green light has been obtained  the amendments will enter into force in October 2023.Regarding the valuation  we recently decreased our buy target price from €100 to €98 per share maintaining our outperforming rating. IPO negative flow is much more compensated by the new rules designed to speed up the process. Volatility remains at a very high level and Euronext will benefit from this environment.

10277,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reverse-stock-split-reduction-share-180000072.html,Reverse stock split and reduction of the share capital,Press Release Ecully  September 20  2022 –8 pm Effective date of the Spineway reverse stock split Spineway announces the completion of the reverse stock...,SPINEWAYPress Release Ecully  September 20  2022 –8 pmEffective date of the Spineway reverse stock splitSpineway announces the completion of the reverse stock split by exchanging 1 new share of 4.00 euros par value for 40 000 old shares of 0.0001 euro par value. This transaction  which was carried out pursuant to a decision by the Company's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on July 25  2022  took effect on September 15  2022.The old Spineway shares with a par value of €0.0001 (ISIN code: FR00140072P8) were delisted from the Euronext Growth market after the close of the market on September 14  2022 and were replaced with the new Spineway shares with a par value of €4.00 (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) on September 15  2022. The mnemonic code (ALSPW) remains unchanged.It should be noted that  as of September 14  2022  the new shares that could not be allotted individually and which correspond to fractional rights will be sold automatically by block on the market by financial intermediaries. The financial intermediaries will make the proceeds of the sale available to their shareholder clients within 30 days from September 14  2022. For more information on the reverse split  shareholders are invited to consult the notice of reverse split published in the BALO number 90 of July 29  and available on the Company's website (www.spineway.com) and the press release published on July 26  2022 also available on the Company's website.Clarification on the publication of the September 12 Euronext noticePursuant to the publication on September 12  2022 of a Euronext notice announcing the increase in the number of Spineway shares via the admission of 6 billion shares on September 14  2022  Spineway wishes to clarify to its shareholders that these 6 billion shares correspond to conversions of Negma bonds carried out over the summer  on August 5 and 19  and which related to tranches of convertible bonds previously exercised. The latter were taken into consideration by the Company's account keeper in August and largely resold by Negma before the reverse stock split.These 6 billion shares therefore have no connection with the consolidation transaction and had been admitted to trading well before September 14  2022. During the consolidation period  i.e. between August 16 and September 14  no new tranche of convertible bonds was issued nor shares converted. Moreover  in accordance with the announcement made when its half-yearly results were published  Spineway would like to reiterate that it has decided to suspend the issuance of new tranches of Convertible Bonds until the end of 20221.Story continuesReduction of the share capitalSubsequent to the reverse stock split  the Company's Board of Directors decided on September 19  2022 to reduce the share capital by reducing the par value of the Company's shares2. This purely technical operation has no impact on the value of the Company's stock value  nor on the number of shares in circulation. Thus  after this operation  the Company's share capital is still composed of 761 848 ordinary shares  i.e. the number of shares making up the share capital following the above-mentioned reverse stock split  effective on September 15.Upcoming:September 28  2022: Lyon Pôle Bourse Forum at the Palais du Commerce in LyonOctober 14  2022: Third quarter revenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

On the clinical front  our Phase 2 NASH DESTINY-1 trial for PXL065 met its objectives demonstrating a statistically significant effect with a favorable safety profile. Based on these positive results  PXL065 will be prioritized for further development in NASH and we will initiate discussions for a potential pivotal program in NASH. In parallel  we will focus PXL770 development efforts exclusively in rare diseases on the basis of our promising data which demonstrated strong potential in multiple rare metabolic indications. In addition  these recent PXL065 results have validated our hypothesis that the deuterated-thiazolidinediones (d-TZD) platform reduces PPARγ side-effects while retaining the efficacy benefits of TZDs  and thus warrants exploration in other diseases  such as ALD. Over the summer  we also extended our cash runway through the restructuring of our debt and an equity-linked financing facility. This accomplishment provides us further flexibility to secure additional financing solutions necessary to execute our rare disease strategy.”H1 Key EventsClinical UpdatesIn ALD  PXL770 is prepared to advance into a Phase 2a biomarker proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trial in male patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the most common ALD subtype. The 12-week study will evaluate pharmacokinetics  safety and potential for efficacy based on relevant disease biomarkers  such as the effect on very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)  the characteristic plasma marker of the disease. Considering the DESTINY-1 results for PXL065 in NASH  which validated the deuterium-modified thiazolidinedione (TZD) platform  a second identical study continues to be planned in order to assess the potential of the deuterium-modified TZD platform with PXL065 in ALD. ALD studies are expected to initiate as soon as possible  subject to additional financing.In February and April  the FDA awarded Fast Track Designation (FTD) to PXL065 and PXL770 respectively  for ALD. The FDA grants FTD to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion.In May  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) 1 to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received. Two preclinical articles on X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) for PXL065 and PXL770 were published: The article on PXL065 was published in The Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (“JIMD”) and is entitled “ Therapeutic potential of deuterium-stabilized (R)-pioglitazone - PXL065 - for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ”. It is available here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510808/. The article on PXL770 was published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (“JPET”)   and is entitled “ Beneficial effects of the direct AMP-Kinase activator PXL770 in in vitro and in vivo models of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy”. It is available here: https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2022/06/25/jpet.122.001208.In ADPKD  preclinical studies were completed and demonstrated efficacy of PXL770 in in vitro cyst assays including ADPKD patient-derived cells. In vivo efficacy in a classical animal model of ADPKD was also observed including improvements in renal function  kidney weight  cyst index  and other benefits in kidney tissues. Initiation of development planning and regulatory interactions is underway.Corporate UpdateIn June  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a new patent for PXL065 that describes a specific form of PXL065 with unique properties. Importantly  this recently issued patent provides additional protection through 2041 and could expand protection for PXL065 worldwide  with the potential for an additional 5 years through patent term extension.On June 21  Poxel held its annual general meeting.

PXL065-treated patients achieved statistically significant improvements in the relative decrease in liver fat content measured by magnetic resonance imaging estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI - PDFF) at 36-weeks for all doses. PXL065 was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in body weight and no increased lower extremity edema vs. placebo. The safety profile is consistent with reduced PPAR γ -mediated side effects vs. published results of pioglitazone.PDFF) at 36-weeks for all doses. PXL065 was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in body weight and no increased lower extremity edema vs. placebo. The safety profile is consistent with reduced PPAR -mediated side effects vs. published results of pioglitazone. On September 21  the Company announced additional DESTINY-1 results including histology. Histology findings from paired liver biopsies showed strong improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH  consistent with dose-dependent reduction of all biomarkers related to fibrinogenesis and fibrosis risk scores. Additional favorable trends in other histology parameters were observed. Additional dose-dependent benefits on glucose control and indices of insulin sensitivity were also observed.TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)As of September 1st  initial launch year restrictions for TWYMEEG which limited new products to two weeks prescriptions have been lifted.

RP2Ds were determined for NBTXR3 plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab for patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC that has not received prior immunotherapy  lung metastases (mets) from any primary tumor  or liver mets from any primary tumor as well.The combined dose escalation and dose expansion parts of Study 1100 are expected to enroll up to 141 patients. The complete dose escalation part enrolled 29 patients in three cohorts: (i) head and neck lesions from LRR or R/M HNSCC eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy; (ii) lung mets from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy; and (iii) liver mets from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy. Study participants received a one-time intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 prior to their first radiotherapy session. They then received radiotherapy  followed by anti-PD-1. Based on the study’s results  the RP2D for all three cohorts was determined to be 33% of gross tumor volume.Nanobiotix aims to deliver an industry-leading head and neck cancer treatment franchise powered by NBTXR3  and to replicate that approach across other solid tumor indications. Pursuant to this strategy  the Company has amended the ongoing expansion phase of Study 1100 to further strengthen the rationale behind a registrational protocol evaluating NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 for patients with R/M HNSCC that is resistant to prior immunotherapy.The amended dose expansion part of study 1100 also has three cohorts  however the cohorts have been re-designed to further explore NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in several immunotherapy-eligible indications  with a particular focus on the treatment of patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC primary lesions that are either naïve or resistant to prior immunotherapy. The expansion part cohorts are as follows: (i) LRR or R/M HNSCC that is resistant to prior immunotherapy; (ii) LRR or R/M HNSCC that has not received prior immunotherapy; (iii) lung  liver  or soft tissue mets from inoperable NSCLC  malignant melanoma  hepatocellular carcinoma  renal cell carcinoma (RCC)  urothelial cancer  cervical cancer  or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) primary tumors.The Company expects to provide updated clinical data from Study 1100 in Q4 2022. The registrational phase 3 protocol submission is expected in Q1 2023  followed by modification of the study design.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across solid tumors that can be treated with radiotherapy and across different therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone which has reduced PPARγ activity  but retains non-genomic thiazolidinedione (TZD) actions.“Pioglitazone’s positive effects in 6 independent prior trials where NASH patients were assessed via liver biopsy propelled the study of PXL065 in patients with NASH and fibrosis. PXL065 is differentiated from pioglitazone based on its distinct pharmacology and lower potential for PPARγ-mediated side effects ” said Stephen Harrison  MD  President  Summit Clinical Research  and principal investigator of this study. “The primary endpoint findings observed on liver fat content reduction along with the other positive findings observed in secondary analysis of key histopathologic features of NASH and fibrosis are promising. When coupled with the benefits seen in glycemic control and a very good safety and tolerability profile  larger studies in NASH are warranted.”“In addition to our previously reported finding of clinically meaningful improvements in liver fat content and circulating biomarkers related to NASH and metabolic health  these results address the high unmet need for fibrosis improvement that remains  particularly for oral products  which we believe will be the cornerstone to treatment ” said Thomas Kuhn  CEO of Poxel. “Based on pioglitazone’s proven efficacy in NASH  PXL065 could become a key product for the treatment of NASH  alone and in combination with other treatment modalities. We will initiate discussions to pursue a potential pivotal program in NASH – leveraging the FDA 505(b)(2) regulatory path and the extensive safety database of pioglitazone as an approved medicine for Type 2 diabetes – which would represent a potentially accelerated and de-risked development with a high probability of success.”Summary of Phase 2 NASH (DESTINY-1) PXL065 Study ResultsDESTINY-1 is a Phase 2  36-week  randomized  dose-ranging  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of PXL065 in patients with noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH across multiple clinical sites in the US. The primary endpoint of the study measured the relative change in the percentage of liver fat content based on magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). The study also assessed the effects of PXL065 on liver histology and other metabolic and non-metabolic biomarkers.117 subjects were randomized to one of 4 daily (QD) treatment arms (7.5 mg  15 mg  22.5 mg  placebo). Analysis of histologic changes was based on paired liver biopsies in PXL065 vs. placebo-treated NASH patients before and after the 36-week treatment period. This trial was not powered to detect statistically significant changes in histology endpoints.New top line results pertaining to liver histology and additional parameters included:Biopsy EndpointsFibrosis improvement by > 1 stage without worsening of NASH  an endpoint recognized by FDA for approval  occurred in 31-50% patients in the PXL065 study arms vs. 17% with placebo. Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  39% of patients had fibrosis improvement by ≥1 stage without worsening NASH (%) vs. 17% with placebo.Worsening of fibrosis by > 1 stage was observed in 9-12% of patients in PXL065 arms vs. 26% with placebo.A > 2 point improvement in the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) with no worsening of fibrosis was observed in 50% of PXL065 treated patients at the 15 and 22.5 mg dose levels vs. 30% with placebo.Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  26% of patients achieved NASH resolution with ≥1 stage fibrosis improvement vs. 13% with placebo.Changes in Liver Fat and Key Markers of Fibrosis and Liver InjuryThe primary efficacy endpoint was achieved: a statistically significant (p=0.024 to p=0.008) mean relative decrease vs. placebo of 21% to 25% in liver fat content from baseline to 36 weeks was observed at all PXL065 doses. 40% of patients who received PXL065 at the 22.5 mg dose achieved a >30% relative reduction in liver fat content (previously reported).Trend in least-square mean ALT decreases up to 18.4 IU/L vs. baseline. Subjects experiencing a decrease in ALT by more than -17U/L were numerically higher in the PXL065 groups (38% to 54%) versus placebo (26%) (previously reported).Statistically significant dose-dependent decreases in PIIINP (fibrogenesis biomarker  p=0.02 at 22.5 mg) and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (p=0.04 at 22.5 mg) along with favorable trends for dose-dependent improvements in other markers of fibrogenesis/fibrosis risk (ProC31  ELF  Fib4) were observed.Metabolic ParametersA dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c (up to 0.41 % placebo-adjusted; p=0.003 at 22.5 mg) was observed; in patients with co-existing Type 2 diabetes  the placebo-adjusted change was up to -0.56%. Given baseline HbA1c values indicating good glucose control on existing Type 2 diabetes treatments (6.1-6.3% overall; 6.6-7.4% in T2D)  these effects are potentially clinically meaningful.Improvements in insulin levels and insulin sensitivity indices (HOMA-IR  Adipo-IR  QUICKI) were also observed.Modest plasma adiponectin level increase of up to +5.26 ug/mL (p<0.0001 vs. placebo at 22.5 mg); consistent with limited degree of PPARγ activation and observed safety profile with reduced potential for weight gain or peripheral edema.Safety & TolerabilityThere was no dose-dependent increase in body weight: a minimal least-square mean increase of 0.68 kg was observed at the top dose of 22.5 mg vs. placebo (previously reported).Low incidence of edema without observed treatment or dose relation when compared to placebo (previously reported).With respect to other safety measures  PXL065 was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated; the number of patients presenting with treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were similar among all groups including placebo without dose effect. None were treatment related (previously reported).PharmacokineticsAs predicted  pharmacokinetic measurements showed dose-proportional drug levels with the desired degree of higher exposure to the pioglitazone R-stereoisomer and reduced exposure to the (PPARγ active) S-stereoisomer (previously reported).The full Phase 2 results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting.About PXL065PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone. Although pioglitazone is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH  it is the most extensively studied drug for NASH; in multiple prior trials  improvements in liver histology  including reductions in fibrosis  were demonstrated2 3. Pioglitazone is the only drug recommended for biopsy-proven NASH patients by the Practice Guidelines published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)4. Pioglitazone’s off-label use for NASH  however  has been limited due to the PPARγ-related side effects  which include weight gain  bone fractures and fluid retention.Pioglitazone is a 1:1 mixture of two mirror-image compounds (R- and S-stereoisomers) that interconvert in vivo. Using deuterium  Poxel stabilized each stereoisomer and characterized their different pharmacological properties. In in vitro studies  PXL065 has been shown to target non-genomic pathways including mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4). In preclinical animal models  PXL065 exhibits the NASH efficacy associated with pioglitazone with no significant weight gain or fluid retention  side effects which are associated with the S-stereoisomer5. NASH Phase 2 (DESTINY 1 trial) results available to-date show statistically significant effects of PXL065 on liver fat content  biomarkers related to liver fibrogenesis-fibrosis risk  as well as positive effects on fibrosis and other key parameters based on histology analysis. Relative to published data for pioglitazone  reduced potential for weight gain and edema was also evident. Based upon preclinical  Phase 1 and Phase 2 results  Poxel believes that PXL065 may have a better therapeutic profile than pioglitazone for NASH and may also have suitable properties for further development in other indications including adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).About NASHNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disease with no clear disease origin that is quickly becoming a worldwide epidemic. It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver causing inflammation and fibrosis. The disease can be silent for a long period of time  but once it accelerates  severe damage and liver cirrhosis can occur  which can significantly impact liver function or can even result in liver failure or liver cancer. Typical risk factors for NASH include obesity  elevated levels of blood lipids (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes. Currently no curative or specific therapies are available.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). In rare diseases  development of PXL770  a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  is focused on the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)  Poxel’s first-in-class product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  is now marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan by Sumitomo Pharma and Poxel expects to receive royalties and sales-based payments.

As this is a relatively small company with a market cap of just under $1B and as it doesn’t have a full US listing  the company is still flying under the radar as it is trading at less than 3 times earnings on an annualized basis.Yahoo FinanceMPC’s most liquid listing definitely is its listing on Euronext Oslo  where it's trading with MPCC as ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Norway exceeds 3 million shares so interested investors should definitely use the company’s Norwegian listing. There are currently 444 million shares outstanding resulting in a market capitalization of approximately 9B NOK. At the current exchange rate  this represents less than $900M.The website contains download-only links  but you can find all relevant data here.A strong performance in the first half of the yearMPC Container Ships focuses on the smaller segment of the container vessels as its average capacity per vessel is just around 2 500 TEU. The fleet list shows 69 vessels but this includes one vessel available for sale and the four newbuilds which will only be delivered in 2024. There are 64 vessels active for MPC and the average amount of vessels deployed during the first and the second quarter came in at 60.The total revenue in the second quarter was just over $151M  an increase of in excess of 5% compared to the first quarter. Meanwhile  the operating expenditures actually decreased compared to the first quarter and the only reason why the gross profit and EBITDA came in lower than in the first quarter was the much lower contribution from joint ventures. Excluding this element  the gross profit would have increased by approximately 10% in the second quarter.MPC Container ShipsThis doesn’t mean Q2 was bad. The company was still printing cash thanks to the exceptionally high charter rates and the quarterly net income was approximately $90.1M resulting in an EPS of $0.20. This brought the H1 2022 earnings to $0.47 and at the current exchange rate  this represents an EPS of approximately 4.8 NOK. This means that if you would annualize the H1 earnings  MPC Container Ships is essentially trading at just over 2 times the net income. Not bad at all  and that’s slightly lower than its peers like a Global Ship Lease (GSL) which I think is the closest comparable.It also doesn’t come as a surprise to see the operating cash flow come in at a very strong level as the company generated approximately $99M in operating cash flow and after deducting the interest expenses and lease costs  the adjusted operating cash flow was a very strong $97M.MPC Container ShipsThe company spent about $15M on scrubbers and dry-docking resulting in a free cash flow result of approximately $82M. A very strong result which also means the company is in an excellent position to cover the dividend and shouldn’t have any issues to finance the new vessels.The company’s dividend policy is pretty clear: The company plans to use 75% of the recurring earnings for dividends and based on the $0.20 EPS in Q2  a dividend of $0.15 per share was paid. That’s approximately 1.5 NOK and represents about 7.5% on the current share price for just the second quarter.MPC Container ShipsOf course  charter rates are coming down a bit so it wouldn’t be wise to just assume the dividend will remain stable: It will always fluctuate in function of the recurring earnings. The dividends can be increased if extraordinary circumstances occur. The shareholders will for instance also benefit from the sale of a vessel.Between now and the end of 2024  MPC Container Ships will need to spend almost $225M on four new vessels. But MPC played it smart and it has already secured charters which should generate in excess of $280M in EBITDA. So basically MPC is already pretty sure these new vessels are paying for themselves.MPC Container ShipsThe majority of the days have been fixed for 2023 and 2024 as well  creating strong visibilityThe main issue in the container shipping sector is the lack of visibility when it comes to charter rates for vessels. Fortunately MPC has locked in longer term contracts for a large portion of its fleet. For 2023  for instance  84% of the days have been fixed at an average charter rate of almost $32 000/day. This means the contracted revenue for 2023 is already $548M with 16% of the available days still open for new charters.MPC Container ShipsEven for 2024  about 56% of the days are fixed at an even higher average daily rate of in excess of $35 000 per day. So although the percentage of contracted days drops from 84% to 56% (a 33% decrease)  the total revenue falls by just over 20% as the higher charter rates are making up for the lower amount of contracted days.The next image is a very interesting slide provided by MPC. It explains how the current contracted EBITDA and the scrap value of the vessels already exceed the current enterprise value of MPC.MPC Container ShipsAnd since this slide was published  the market capitalization fell by an additional $200M. Based on a net debt of just $101M and a market cap of $900M  the enterprise value is just $1B which is handsomely covered by the combination of contracted EBITDA and the scrap value of the vessels.Investment thesisWhile MPC is attractively priced  it looks like the dividends are subject to the 25% Norwegian dividend withholding tax and this could be a handicap versus other container ship lessor companies that are domiciled in more advantageous jurisdictions.While I’m not really a big fan of the owners of container vessels as quite a few newbuilds will hit the water in the coming years  I always will have a good look at well-run companies with a strong balance sheet and high contracted revenues with reputable parties. MPC fits that bill and although the charter rates will remain volatile  MPC’s longer term contracts provide excellent visibility. There is a realistic chance the company will pay out its entire current market capitalization in dividends by the end of 2025.I currently have no position in MPC but will keep an eye on the company’s performance.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.32,0.13,0.55,True,English,"['MPC Container Ships Stock', '25-30% Dividend Yield', 'Next 2 Years', 'The', 'MPZZF', 'free cash flow result', 'higher average daily rate', 'average daily volume', 'longer term contracts', 'current exchange rate', 'container shipping sector', 'operating cash flow', 'average charter rate', 'higher charter rates', 'Global Ship Lease', 'high charter rates', 'current enterprise value', 'MPC Container Ships', 'full US listing', 'quarterly net income', 'current share price', 'four new vessels', 'strong result', 'average capacity', 'average amount', 'operating expenditures', 'four newbuilds', 'lease costs', 'scrap value', 'container vessels', 'Getty Images', 'Norway-listed lessor', 'Tier-1 operators', 'CMA CGM', 'market cap', 'annualized basis', 'Yahoo Finance', 'liquid listing', 'Euronext Oslo', 'ticker symbol', '3 million shares', 'interested investors', 'Norwegian listing', '444 million shares', 'relevant data', 'strong performance', 'smaller segment', 'second quarter', 'gross profit', 'lower contribution', 'joint ventures', 'H1 2022 earnings', 'H1 earnings', 'strong level', 'interest expenses', 'strong $97M', 'excellent position', 'recurring earnings', 'extraordinary circumstances', 'main issue', 'large portion', 'lower amount', 'next image', 'interesting slide', 'first half', 'first quarter', 'new charters', 'total revenue', '3 times earnings', 'fleet list', 'strong visibility', '9B NOK', 'one vessel', 'dividend policy', 'available days', 'small company', 'MPC.', '69 vessels', '64 vessels', '2 times', '4.8 NOK', '1.5 NOK', 'SHansche', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'OTCPK', 'MPZZF', 'number', 'COSCO', 'Maersk', 'Seaboard', 'radar', 'MPCC', 'website', 'download', 'links', 'year', '2,500 TEU', 'sale', 'increase', 'excess', 'reason', 'EBITDA', 'element', 'Q2', 'EPS', 'peers', 'GSL', 'surprise', 'scrubbers', 'dry-docking', 'issues', 'dividends', 'function', 'shareholders', 'instance', 'majority', 'lack', 'percentage', '33% decrease']",2022-09-21,2022-09-21,seekingalpha.com

Please refer to the FDA approved Prescribing Information on Drugs@FDA .4Gadopiclenol  the active substance of EluciremTM  has been designed with two sites for water molecule exchange to increase relaxivity and contrast  allowing to use it at half the conventional dose of gadolinium compared to other non-specific GBCAs.The efficacy and safety of Gadopiclenol have been assessed as part of Guerbet’s clinical development plan  with marketing authorization being targeted worldwide (cf. phase III trial results below).The FDA is the first health authority to have approved EluciremTM. It is currently in the process of examination by the European Medicines Agency via a centralized procedure.Story continues“As a pioneer in MR imaging  thanks to the success of our first gadolinium-based macrocyclic contrast agent  we are delighted with the FDA approval of Elucirem™. This approval allows patients and practitioners to benefit from the innovations brought by Elucirem™”David Hale  Chief Executive Officer of Guerbet GroupPhase III clinical trials for Elucirem™The approval was primarily based on data from two Phase III studies completed in March 2021 which demonstrated that Elucirem™ leads to non-inferior results in brain and body MRI at half the gadolinium dose of Gadobutrol.5 6 The endpoints were met in terms of the diagnostic benefit of injecting Gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) during MRI examinations  based on two criteria:1/ the superiority of the examination with Gadopiclenol compared to the examination with no contrast agent;and 2/ the non-inferiority of Gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) compared to Gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) for the visualization and detection of lesions of the central nervous system and in the other anatomical areas studied.No major safety signals were reported during the development of Gadopiclenol  and the adverse reactions reported during the two-Phase III studies were similar for both products administered.

Controlling access to applications  data  and systems is an increasingly important aspect of securing any environment and protecting it against both internal and external threats.After two years of the pandemic  confidence in addressing certain security risks and threats arising from hybrid and remote work has improved among businesses and organizations around the world. When it comes to secure access to applications  data  and systems  84% IT professionals this year said they have some degree of confidence in their current user access security systems to enable remote work securely and easily  compared to 56% in 2021. In addition  60% said this year they were highly confident compared to just 22% last year.These are among some of the key findings from the 2022 Thales Access Management Index  a global survey of 2 600 IT decision makers  conducted by 451 Research  part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.Firms Gaining Confidence Addressing Security of Remote WorkOverall  the report findings suggest that firms remain concerned about the security risks of remote work  but those concerns seem to be less severe. At the same time  firms are also growing more confident in the ability of authentication and access management systems to manage those risks. Only 31% of IT professional surveyed reported having “very high” concerns about the security risks and threats of remote work in 2022  down from 39% in 2021  while those who said they were “somewhat concerned” – the most popular response – increased from 43% to 48% in 2022.Multi-Factor Authentication on the Rise But Not WidespreadWhile multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage remains most prevalent for remote workers (68%) and privileged users (52%)  the report shows that MFA adoption is on the rise for internal and non-IT staff with MFA adoption increasing to 40% compared to 34% in 2021. However  widespread MFA adoption by businesses is still yet to be the norm with just over half (56%) have adopted MFA in their organizations.Lingering Effects of Pandemic Drive Interest in Access Management  MFA and ZTNAThe survey inquired about direct impacts that the pandemic and remote work had on deployment plans for new access security technologies. Responses revealed a six-percentage-point global increase in plans to deploy stand-alone MFA  up from 31% in 2021. The pandemic also impacted plans to deploy cloud-based access management  selected by 45% of respondents worldwide compared to 41% in 2021. These two increases illustrate respondents’ growing awareness that threats come from all angles  and that proper authentication and management of access and privileges is necessary for an adequate security foundation. Last year  Zero Trust Network Access/Software-Defined Perimeter (ZTNA)/(SDP) was the top choice  selected by 44% of respondents. In 2022  ZTNA was the second choice at 42%.Francois Lasnier  Vice President of Access Management Solutions at Thales comments: “The past few years have cemented remote work and work-from-anywhere as a permanent part of the security landscape  and they have also introduced new security risks and challenges. However  growing familiarity with remote work has ultimately broadened awareness on an enterprise level of daily business security risks and has strengthened both confidence and ability in security teams and products to handle those risks and threats properly.”Garrett Bekker  Principal Analyst at 451 Research comments: “Just as the threat landscape has evolved  the tools and methods to handle the landscape have  too. However  even with innovative tools and boosted confidence levels  security plans and approaches still need to adapt to the ever-changing threat environment. A greater shift towards a Zero Trust model would place access management in a central role in corporate security strategies  with a related reliance on MFA as a critical supporting enabler.”Thales and 451 Research will discuss the findings in more detail during a webinar on 29 September 2022.

The global edition of the 2022 Thales Access Management Index looked at various aspects of those impacts in a wide-ranging survey of security professionals and executive leadership that touched on issues including access management and access security  multi-factor authentication  zero-trust network access  security spending plans  remote work and VPNs  and ransomware. The 2022 Thales Access Management Study is based on data from a survey of nearly 2 800 security professionals and executive leaders in more than 15 countries across the globe.

Every individual experiences gMG differently  which is why we’re excited about the possibility of introducing multiple ways to meet the needs of patients  including with route of administration and dosing schedule ” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “The submission of this BLA is the latest milestone in honoring our commitment to the gMG patient community. We look forward to working closely with the agency through the BLA review process and to potentially bringing forth another first-in-class option for gMG patients.”The BLA submission package includes data from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod as compared with intravenously administered VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The majority of enrolled patients were positive for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies  but the trial also included patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Story continuesADAPT-SC met its primary endpoint (p< 0.0001) of total IgG reduction from baseline at day 29 demonstrating noninferiority of SC efgartigimod to VYVGART. Patients treated with SC efgartigimod achieved mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% reduction with VYVGART. Results were consistent across the overall population  including those with AChR antibodies and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected. Further  69.1% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Responders are defined as having at least a two-point improvement on the MG-ADL score for at least four consecutive weeks. 65.5% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score. Responders are defined as having at least a three-point improvement on the QMG score for at least four consecutive weeks. Minimal symptom expression (MSE)  a measure of symptom-free status  was achieved in 37% of SC efgartigimod-treated patients after one treatment cycle. Onset of effect was also consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT study.The safety profile for SC efgartigimod was consistent with the ADAPT study. It was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time. After completing ADAPT-SC  95% of participants entered ADAPT-SC+  a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of SC efgartigimod.Phase 3 ADAPT-SC Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) as compared with VYVGART (10mg/kg) in patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect as measured by percent change from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29  one week after the last dose of IV or SC efgartigimod  served as the primary endpoint in the ADAPT-SC trial. The correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG was demonstrated in a Phase 2 trial and the Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which served as the basis for approval of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and Europe. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed.A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial and were treated. Inclusion criteria of the trial were the same as the Phase 3 ADAPT trial of VYVGART; enrolled patients had a confirmed gMG diagnosis and an MG-ADL total score of at least 5 with greater than 50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms  at screening and baseline. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  and were required to remain on that stable dose throughout the primary trial. Patients were eligible to enroll in ADAPT-SC regardless of antibody status  including patients with AChR antibodies (AChR-Ab+) and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod or IV efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information. For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infectionHave received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology.About VYVGARTVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected.

10299,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guerbet-announces-u-food-drug-175000252.html,Guerbet Announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval of Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) Injection for Use in Contrast-Enhanced MRI,Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  and the first to bring a macrocyclic GBCA to the global market  is ...,"Elucirem™ has the highest relaxivity compared to other non-specific GBCAs 1Elucirem™ requires only half the gadolinium dose of conventional non-specific GBCAsElucirem™ will be manufactured in Raleigh  North Carolina by Liebel-Flarsheim™ Company LLC  a Guerbet Group company.PRINCETON  N.J.  Sept. 21  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  and the first to bring a macrocyclic GBCA to the global market  is proud to announce the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) injection. This next generation  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older. 4 FDA granted Elucirem™ priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5GBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active substance of EluciremTM  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional dose of other non-specific GBCAs.Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) Injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis and musculoskeletal system).""Guerbet is a leader in the field of GBCA-based MRI imaging agents and developed the first macrocyclic GBCA. We are extremely gratified that this approval from the FDA will make it possible for clinicians and patients to benefit from the innovations brought by Elucirem™"" said David Hale  Chief Executive Officer of Guerbet.Story continuesThe approval was primarily based on data from two adequate and well-controlled Phase III studies completed in March 2021 which showed that gadopiclenol was designed to improve image quality in brain and body MRI at half the conventional gadolinium dose.2 3 In both the PICTURE trial for CNS MRI and the PROMISE trial in Body MRI  gadopiclenol-enhanced MRI at 0.05 mmol/kg showed superiority as compared to unenhanced MRI and non-inferiority as compared to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg as assessed in 3 lesion visualization co-primary criteria: border delineation  internal morphology and contrast enhancement.2 3 In the PICTURE trial  readers preferred the quality of visualization obtained with a half dose of Gadopiclenol compared to a full dose of Gadobutrol. 2Gadopiclenol was evaluated in 1 047 patients with doses ranging from 0.025 mmol/kg BW (one half the recommended dose) to 0.3 mmol/kg BW (six times the recommended dose). A total of 708 patients (age range two years to 88 years) received the recommended dose of 0.05 mmol/kg BW. No major safety signals were reported during the development of gadopiclenol  and the adverse reactions reported during the two-Phase III studies were similar for both products administered. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >0.2%) in patients who received Gadopiclenol were injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth and coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling.""After 15 years of dedicated research to bring Elucirem to fruition Guerbet is very proud of this FDA approval of Elucirem™  confirming the commitment of Guerbet's R&D teams in developing solutions for MRI  adapted to the needs of radiologists and patients."" said Dr Philippe Bourrinet  Senior Vice-President Development  Medical & Regulatory Affairs of Guerbet.Elucirem™ will be available in glass vials  pharmacy bulk package and plastic pre-filled syringes which can help to streamline workflow in the imaging suite.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREMTM (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREMWarnings and PrecautionsNephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis: GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic  severe kidney disease as well as patients with acute kidney injury.Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies  particularly closely spaced studies when possibleAcute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Do not exceed the recommended dose.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling.Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BW ELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. There are no available data on ELUCIREM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of ELUCIREM in human milk  the effects on the breastfed infant  or the effects on milk production. However  published lactation data on other GBCAs indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is excreted in breast milk.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ELUCIREM have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney  and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.Renal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment  the exposure of gadopiclenol is increased compared to patients with normal renal function. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. No dose adjustment of ELUCIREM is recommended for patients with renal impairment. ELUCIREM can be removed from the body by hemodialysisYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

The data we are presenting this week further underscore this commitment with a growing body of clinical safety and efficacy data on VYVGART  our first-in-class FcRn blocker and the anchor of our neuromuscular franchise. gMG is a disease that affects each patient differently and that is exactly how we want to approach treatment – meeting the needs of patients and physicians based on their individual disease experience ” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer  argenx. “Deeper within our neuromuscular franchise  we are highlighting the thoughtful trial designs of the ADHERE study of efgartigimod in CIDP and the ARDA trial of ARGX-117 in MMN  bringing us one step closer to reaching many more people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.”Story continuesHighlights from AANEM and MGFASeventeen scientific abstracts have been accepted between both meetings  including previously reported data from the ADAPT+ open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety  tolerability and efficacy of VYVGART and the registrational ADAPT-SC trial evaluating the noninferiority of subcutaneous (SC) efgartigimod compared to intravenously administered VYVGART based on total IgG reduction. New data analyses from ADAPT+ and real-world case studies are being presented on the adult anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody negative (AChR-Ab-) gMG patient population.ADAPT+ : Data suggest that long-term treatment with VYVGART provides consistent decreases in IgG antibodies and repeatable improvements in function and strength based on Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) disease scores; the long-term safety profile of VYVGART remained consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT trial.ADAPT-SC : Topline data show SC efgartigimod was noninferior to VYVGART in total IgG reduction at day 29 and demonstrated consistent clinical improvement based on MG-ADL and QMG disease scores.Seronegative gMG Population : New pooled data from ADAPT+ and real-world case studies indicate that VYVGART treatment was associated with clinically meaningful disease score improvements (≥2-point improvement in MG-ADL and ≥3-point improvement in QMG) in adult AChR-Ab- gMG patients. Clinically meaningful improvement in MG-ADL scores was observed in AChR-Ab- patients across 10 treatment cycles in ADAPT+. Additionally  preliminary real-world experience in the AChR-Ab- patient population is largely consistent with the ADAPT studies.gMG Disease and Treatment Burden : Additional evidence from argenx-sponsored health economic outcomes research studies demonstrate the severity of gMG based on annual hospitalizations and readmission and mortality rates  especially in older gMG patients.Vaccine Response: Preliminary data suggest treatment with VYVGART does not impact immune response to vaccinations  including to COVID-19.AANEM Poster Presentations are taking place at the following times in Ryman Exhibit Hall B1:AANEM Session I: Thursday  9/22 from 6:00 - 6:30 pm CTAANEM Session II: Friday  9/23 from 9:30 - 10:00 am CTAANEM Session III: Friday  9/23 from 3:30 - 4:00 pm CTVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)Long-Term Safety  Tolerability  and Efficacy of Efgartigimod in Patients with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis: Interim Results of the ADAPT+ StudyJames F.

For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.Important Safety Information for VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. prescribing information)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare chronic  inﬂammatory  pure motor polyneuropathy leading to slowly progressive muscle weakness  mainly of the hands and forearms and lower legs. MMN is associated with increased levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies against the ganglioside GM1  which is widely expressed in the nervous system and important for nerve conduction. The clinical course of MMN is chronically progressive without remission. MMN is often misdiagnosed as CIDP because of the similar clinical features and its progressive nature but MMN is asymmetric and affects the right and left side of the body differently.About VYVGARTVYVGART (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is not currently approved in any country for CIDP or MMN  and clinical studies of these conditions are ongoing.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S.  Japan  and the EU.

The Group’s global brands are at the forefront  embedding sustainability across the brand and guest experience each in their own distinctive way.Over the past several years  the expectations and desire for more sustainable and responsible travel have been gaining momentum. In fact  73% of travelers now consider environmentally sustainable practices as a deciding factor when booking travel accommodations*. At the same time  the industry-wide response is expanding  with responsible actions from key players such as the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance  a consortium of engaged hospitality companies working collectively to address major sustainability challenges. At Accor  we believe that it is our role to drive change for a more sustainable future of travel  both together with other industry leaders  and with the Group leading the way for a sustainable transformation across our activities and brands.Hospitality is at the crossroads of many activities and sustainability is multifaceted  encompassing a wide range of areas  including the impact of the food we prepare and consume  how we travel and the way we live our lives. With this in mind  we work to deliver impactful  innovative solutions and client experiences to address the key environmental and social challenges we face  and each of our brands plays a crucial role. Discover how four of our brands bring our sustainability commitments to life  each one with initiatives in line with their identity.Pioneering circular hospitality: greetWhen the first greet hotels opened their doors in 2019  travelers discovered a world of alternative hospitality  guided by the ethos of reduce  reuse  recycle. From the outset  greet hotels were designed with a circular mindset. Whether it’s turning unsold  “ugly” fruits into smoothies  banning single-use plastics  sourcing secondhand furniture or reused or recycled materials  everything gets a second lease on life at greet.greet Lyon Confluence - France — Photo by AccorThe brand’s community-based hotels also host repair workshops and resale events  donate unused food products  and source food locally or from short food supply chains to reduce carbon emissions. With 21 existing greet hotels and 24 more in the pipeline  this concept is certainly taking off.Rooted in its local communities and natural ecosystems: FairmontFairmont  the world’s first luxury hotel brand to truly embrace environmental stewardship  celebrated the 30th anniversary of its award-winning Fairmont Sustainability Partnership in 2021. The brand’s commitment to sustainability is rooted in its dedication to the local communities where it operates.The Bee Sustainable program  for example  seeks to contribute to and protect the biodiversity around Fairmont properties by creating more than 40 apiaries and wild bee hotels in 20 properties around the world. Meanwhile  among various partnerships with local farms and communities  the Fairmont Mayakoba in Mexico joined forces with the Oceanus AC charity to protect the Mesoamerican Reef౼home to more than 500 aquatic species.Source: AccorOn the social front  the brand further stepped up its two-decade partnership with the Make-A-Wish ® foundation to positively impact the lives of Wish children and their families.

Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the most advanced pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.ContactsInventivaPascaline Clerc  VP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon / Aude Lepreux ; Media relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

This includes a positive forex effect of €12.8 million  almost half of which (€6 million) was due to the dollar’s strength against the euro.Excluding forex effects and on a like-for-like basis  first-half revenue was down -1.3% at €358.3 million. It was up +0.5% in the first quarter and down -3.1% in the second quarter due to a largely unfavorable base effect (sales had jumped +25.1% in the second quarter of 2021 in a context of post-lockdown improvements).Good momentum across all sectors and geographic areas  excluding the Raleigh effectIn the Americas  reported sales were up +6.4% (down -3.7% at CER). Demand remained strong  with activity at the industrial site in Raleigh (North Carolina) hampered in the first half of the year by recruitment difficulties affecting the production of Optiray® and Dotarem®. The measures put in place in recent months have paid off and are now significantly limiting the impact of these difficulties.In Asia  activity increased 7.7% (4.2% at CER)  driven by the introduction of direct distribution in China in the second quarter.In EMEA  reported sales were down -3.2% (-2.6% at CER) with stable volumes overall  accompanied by continued price erosion.Diagnostic Imaging revenue in the first half grew 2.1% at current exchange rates (-1.3% at CER).In MRI  H1 revenue increased +2.5% to €121.3 million (-0.5% at CER).X-ray revenue totaled €206.8 million  up 1.9% (-1.8% at CER) thanks to volumes and prices that remained strong for Xenetix® and despite the decline in Optiray® sales due to production constraints at the Raleigh site.In Interventional Imaging  reported sales were up 2.5%. At CER  sales were down -1.6%. The implementation of a worldwide Lipiodol® sales contract led to a decline in revenue from this activity in the first quarter (-9.7%) due to one-off price effects. The recovery was very pronounced in the second quarter (+7.3%). For the first half as a whole  there was double-digit growth in micro-catheters (+21.5%).Resilient first-half resultsIn millions of euros Consolidated financial statements (IFRS) H1 2021Reported H1 2022Reported Revenue 363.1 371.1 EBITDA2% of revenue 62.317.1% 50.513.6% Operating income% of revenue 34.89.6% 16.94.6% Net income% of revenue 23.46.4% 3.30.9% Net debt 249.3 251.52 EBITDA: Operating income before net amortization  depreciation  and provisions.The 2022 half-year financial statements  approved by the Board of Directors on Wednesday  September 21  2022  underwent a limited review by the statutory auditors. The statutory auditors' report is being prepared.EBITDA margin in line with expectationsAs a reminder  the exceptional budgetary measures put in place at the height of the COVID crisis led to the Group’s EBITDA ratio of 17.1% at the end of June 2021. During the second half of 2021  the Group relaunched its sales and marketing investments to boost activity and accelerate the strategy’s implementation  resulting in an EBITDA/revenue ratio of 14.4% at the end of 2021.In an environment of inflation and labor market tensions  the Group managed to preserve its profitability by continuing its efforts to optimize production and structural costs. This discipline enabled it to limit the impact of rising costs of raw materials and other supplies (iodine in particular). The increase in payroll costs remained contained (+3.3%) despite intense recruitment pressure in the US. Excluding extraordinary costs related to the optimization of the Group’s operating structure and the change in the sales model in China (direct distribution)  the EBITDA/revenue ratio was 13.9%  in line with the Group’s expectations at the end of this first half of the year. The reported margin was 13.6%.As of June 30  operating income totaled €16.9 million. This includes an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as provisions related to quality disputes with component suppliers.Net income for the first half amounted to €3.3 million. Financial expenses fell sharply to €1.2 million (versus €4.4 million in the first half of 2021). The tax expense increased to €11.2 million (compared with €5.1 million previously) after the Group analyzed the tax risks across all its subsidiaries and booked an additional €9.5 million provision in its consolidated accounts in compliance with IFRIC 23.As of June 30  2022  equity totaled €429 million  compared with €405 million on Friday  December 31  2021. The decrease in cash (-€56 million  at €60 million) reflects the €25 million repayment of the installment loan obtained in 2019 and the increase in WCR fueled by the establishment of precautionary stocks and stocks of EluciremTM to prepare for its launch in 2023. This did not prevent a further improvement in the debt ratio  with a net debt/equity ratio of 0.59 as of June 30  2022  compared with 0.64 a year earlier.2022 outlook and guidanceDuring the first half of the year  the Group made industrial  commercial  and operational investments on several fronts in order to prepare for the future  thus contributing to an unprecedented renewal of its product portfolio in all divisions.In Diagnostic Imaging   the production chains are on track for the sale of Elucirem TM   expected by 2023  after reviews by the FDA and the EMA 1 .  the production chains are on track for the sale of Elucirem   expected by 2023  after reviews by the FDA and the EMA . In Interventional Imaging   the significant expansion of the portfolio of SeQure® and DraKon™ microcatheters (addition of 20 models  representing a total of 38 products) and the launch of a new line of Axessio™ guidewires allow Guerbet to now offer a complete platform of solutions to the interventional radiology community.  the significant expansion of the portfolio of SeQure® and DraKon™ microcatheters (addition of 20 models  representing a total of 38 products) and the launch of a new line of Axessio™ guidewires allow Guerbet to now offer a complete platform of solutions to the interventional radiology community. In Artificial Intelligence (AI)  the Group is preparing to launch its first solution in 2023 to help diagnose prostate cancer.Guerbet believes that it can meet its ambitious revenue growth objective of 2% to 4% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates for the full 2022 fiscal year  on the back of solid activity in the first two months of the third quarter and a continuous improvement in production rates at the Raleigh site. The Group also reiterates its operating profitability forecast for the full 2022 fiscal year of an EBITDA/revenue ratio at least identical to the 2021 ratio (14.4%)  excluding extraordinary costs for optimizing the Group’s operating plan and shifting to direct distribution in China.1 EluciremTM (gadopiclenol) is under review in Europe by the EMA (European Medicines Agency) and in the US by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)Upcoming events:Publication of Q3 2022 revenueThursday  October 20  2022  after tradingAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare chronic  inﬂammatory  pure motor polyneuropathy leading to slowly progressive muscle weakness  mainly of the hands and forearms and lower legs. MMN is associated with increased levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies against the ganglioside GM1  which is widely expressed in the nervous system and important for nerve conduction. The clinical course of MMN is chronically progressive without remission. MMN is often misdiagnosed as CIDP because of the similar clinical features and its progressive nature but MMN is asymmetric and affects the right and left side of the body differently.About VYVGARTVYVGART (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is not currently approved in any country for CIDP or MMN  and clinical studies of these conditions are ongoing.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

ENHANZE facilitates the subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics that are typically administered via intravenous (IV) infusion.“Our vision for the gMG program is to deliver the broadest treatment offering for people living with this debilitating  and often overlooked disease. Every individual experiences gMG differently  which is why we’re excited about the possibility of introducing multiple ways to meet the needs of patients  including with route of administration and dosing schedule ” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “The submission of this BLA is the latest milestone in honoring our commitment to the gMG patient community. We look forward to working closely with the agency through the BLA review process and to potentially bringing forth another first-in-class option for gMG patients.”The BLA submission package includes data from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod as compared with intravenously administered VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The majority of enrolled patients were positive for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies  but the trial also included patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.ADAPT-SC met its primary endpoint (p< 0.0001) of total IgG reduction from baseline at day 29 demonstrating noninferiority of SC efgartigimod to VYVGART. Patients treated with SC efgartigimod achieved mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% reduction with VYVGART. Results were consistent across the overall population  including those with AChR antibodies and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected. Further  69.1% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Responders are defined as having at least a two-point improvement on the MG-ADL score for at least four consecutive weeks. 65.5% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score. Responders are defined as having at least a three-point improvement on the QMG score for at least four consecutive weeks. Minimal symptom expression (MSE)  a measure of symptom-free status  was achieved in 37% of SC efgartigimod-treated patients after one treatment cycle. Onset of effect was also consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT study.The safety profile for SC efgartigimod was consistent with the ADAPT study. It was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time. After completing ADAPT-SC  95% of participants entered ADAPT-SC+  a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of SC efgartigimod.Phase 3 ADAPT-SC Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) as compared with VYVGART (10mg/kg) in patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect as measured by percent change from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29  one week after the last dose of IV or SC efgartigimod  served as the primary endpoint in the ADAPT-SC trial. The correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG was demonstrated in a Phase 2 trial and the Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which served as the basis for approval of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and Europe. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed.A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial and were treated. Inclusion criteria of the trial were the same as the Phase 3 ADAPT trial of VYVGART; enrolled patients had a confirmed gMG diagnosis and an MG-ADL total score of at least 5 with greater than 50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms  at screening and baseline. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  and were required to remain on that stable dose throughout the primary trial. Patients were eligible to enroll in ADAPT-SC regardless of antibody status  including patients with AChR antibodies (AChR-Ab+) and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod or IV efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology.About VYVGARTVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Sept. 21  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  and the first to bring a macrocyclic GBCA to the global market  is proud to announce the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) injection. This next generation  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older. 4 FDA granted Elucirem™ priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5GBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active substance of EluciremTM  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional dose of other non-specific GBCAs.Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) Injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis and musculoskeletal system).""Guerbet is a leader in the field of GBCA-based MRI imaging agents and developed the first macrocyclic GBCA. We are extremely gratified that this approval from the FDA will make it possible for clinicians and patients to benefit from the innovations brought by Elucirem™"" said David Hale  Chief Executive Officer of Guerbet.The approval was primarily based on data from two adequate and well-controlled Phase III studies completed in March 2021 which showed that gadopiclenol was designed to improve image quality in brain and body MRI at half the conventional gadolinium dose.2 3 In both the PICTURE trial for CNS MRI and the PROMISE trial in Body MRI  gadopiclenol-enhanced MRI at 0.05 mmol/kg showed superiority as compared to unenhanced MRI and non-inferiority as compared to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg as assessed in 3 lesion visualization co-primary criteria: border delineation  internal morphology and contrast enhancement.2 3 In the PICTURE trial  readers preferred the quality of visualization obtained with a half dose of Gadopiclenol compared to a full dose of Gadobutrol. 2Gadopiclenol was evaluated in 1 047 patients with doses ranging from 0.025 mmol/kg BW (one half the recommended dose) to 0.3 mmol/kg BW (six times the recommended dose). A total of 708 patients (age range two years to 88 years) received the recommended dose of 0.05 mmol/kg BW. No major safety signals were reported during the development of gadopiclenol  and the adverse reactions reported during the two-Phase III studies were similar for both products administered. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >0.2%) in patients who received Gadopiclenol were injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth and coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling.""After 15 years of dedicated research to bring Elucirem to fruition Guerbet is very proud of this FDA approval of Elucirem™  confirming the commitment of Guerbet's R&D teams in developing solutions for MRI  adapted to the needs of radiologists and patients."" said Dr Philippe Bourrinet  Senior Vice-President Development  Medical & Regulatory Affairs of Guerbet.Elucirem™ will be available in glass vials  pharmacy bulk package and plastic pre-filled syringes which can help to streamline workflow in the imaging suite. It will be manufactured by Liebel-Flarsheim™ Company LLC  a Guerbet Group company  in Raleigh  North Carolina.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

The test is made possible through a partnership with Clinical Enterprise Inc.  a CLIA-certified  CAP-accredited laboratory located in Framingham  Mass.Brigham and Women's Hospital is among the first healthcare facilities to make the test available through its Preventive Genomics Clinic  where PRS is being used  along with comprehensive whole-genome sequencing  to provide patients with personal disease risk factors.""Polygenic risk scores are an exciting new tool to identify individuals at increased risk for common complex disorders like heart disease  diabetes  and common forms of cancer "" said Robert Green  a medical geneticist and professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital  Ariadne Labs and Harvard Medical School  who is a scientific advisor to the company. ""Identifying those at highest risk means that surveillance and intervention can be focused earlier and have a greater impact  moving us closer to proactive and preventive health care  rather than reactive sick care.""Allelica's new  ancestry-specific PRS tests are available as a physician-ordered test and set new standards for accessibility  accuracy  and cost. The tests use a patient's saliva as a DNA sample for genotyping analysis carried out by Clinical Enterprise. The analysis leverages genome-wide microarray technology that takes into account hundreds of thousands of genetic variants and offers significant cost savings compared to whole-genome sequencing.The output of the microarray analysis is input into the Allelica platform  which applies proprietary algorithms to calculate an ancestry-specific PRS and generate clinical-grade reports. Allelica PRS algorithms have been developed and validated in multiple prospective datasets that include individuals of all continental ancestries. The reports  which are also available as a white-label package  are delivered to providers through a secure portal or through integration with electronic medical records.Available immediately are tests for coronary artery disease  breast cancer  prostate cancer  Type 2 Diabetes  and Alzheimer's disease. They can be ordered as standalone tests for a single PRS or as panels with multiple PRSs. Allelica plans to expand testing to include more diseases across cardiology  oncology  and women's health.Giordano Bottà  CEO of Allelica  sees the announcement as an important milestone for genomic medicine because it integrates polygenic risk score analysis and reporting into the clinical workflow in a responsible and equitable way.""Prior PRS scores were limited by utilizing databases of largely or exclusively European ancestry. Our priority was to develop a PRS that can benefit everyone  regardless of their ancestries. By providing clinical-grade polygenic risk score testing to people of all ancestries in an accessible and scalable way  we are empowering healthcare professionals to revolutionize healthcare by applying the next generation of clinical genomics "" he said.For information on pricing and how to order the test  contact Allelica at [email protected]What is a polygenic risk score (PRS)?A PRS is a measurement of a person's risk of disease that results from the combined effect of many DNA variants across the genome. It is calculated by combining the effect of these variants  each contributing a small increase or decrease in risk into an overall risk score. This information can be used to stratify individuals based on their risk of disease. By combining PRS with conventional risk factors  Allelica aims to make precision medicine available at scale.About EurofinsEurofins is Testing for Life.
