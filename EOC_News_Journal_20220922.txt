REUTERS/Viacheslav Musiienko/File PhotoNAPERVILLE  Ill.  Sept 20 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures are hovering near the highest-ever levels for the time of year despite record global production prospects  but that optimistic crop forecast paints far too rosy a picture of the tighter wheat market setup.Relative to demand  global wheat stocks in major exporting countries may drop near record-low levels by mid-2023 following mediocre harvests in some of those countries and severe disruption in Ukraine.Top supplier Russia's export share in 2022-23 is set to exceed 20% for the third time in history  a spike needed if prices are to ease. However  global sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine  especially if they intensify  could push back on the export efforts.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterCBOT wheat prices in the latest month have averaged about 16% higher than in the year-ago period and Paris-traded Euronext futures are nearly a third higher  but global demand is set to fall just fractionally this marketing year versus last.That emphasizes the importance of successful crops and unhindered trade flows  particularly in the Black Sea region  where conflict has kept world wheat prices historically elevated since early 2022.Most-active CBOT wheat futures on Tuesday reached more than two-month highs  surging almost 8% to $8.93-3/4 per bushel as Russian-installed leaders set out plans for the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territories. read moreThis potential escalation may jeopardize the Ukraine export deal  now halfway through its 120-day renewable tenure. Grain shipments have increased from Ukraine's vital seaports since the deal's implementation  but volumes remain well below normal levels.Market participants are already making large discounts to Ukraine's export capabilities and especially grain production  which might worsen into 2023. Ukraine said Tuesday its 2023 wheat crop may reach 16-18 million tonnes versus 19 million in 2022 and 32.2 million in 2021.CBOT most-active wheat futuresRECORD OUTPUTThe U.S. Department of Agriculture sees 2022-23 global wheat production up fractionally on the year to a record 784 million tonnes  driven largely by a strong Russian crop. That is despite a nearly 40% annual decline in the recently harvested Ukrainian crop.In fact  USDA projects both production and exports out of Russia plus Ukraine to rise on the year based on the huge Russian volumes. This combined view is useful because some industry estimates of Russian wheat production include occupied areas of Ukraine.Excluding Russia's 91 million-tonne crop projection  USDA shows 2022-23 world wheat output dropping nearly 2% on the year  placing more weight on Russia's crop success and its ability to access world markets. Global exports also drop by the same degree when subtracting Russia.But finding dependable information from the region has recently been more difficult.In previous years  Reuters reported Russian harvest progress data published weekly by the agriculture ministry  but those have been absent this year. This lack of transparency is unsurprising given that Russia in April suspended publication of trade data to avoid ""speculation.""USDA in August 2021 shuttered its Russian offices due to deepening tensions between Moscow and Washington  but the agency remained confident in its ability to provide reliable estimates. It is unclear if that has proven true.Wheat traders' moods heading into next year will also be influenced by Russia's 2023-24 crop prospects  which are largely unknown right now. Farmers there should have already begun the sowing process.STOCKS-TO-USEWorld wheat stocks relative to use are set for eight-year lows  but the expected stocks-to-use ratio of 27% is not far off the long-term average.China is routinely excluded from world wheat analyses because of its small part in global trade compared with its massive stockpiles  which will account for a record 54% of global wheat supply by mid-next year according to USDA figures.World-minus-China stocks-to-use for 2022-23 is pegged at 14.6%  the second lowest on record behind 14.3% in 2007-08. That is down from 15.9% the previous year and compares with a five-year average of 18%.Wheat stocks-to-use drops to 13.8% in 2022-23 when considering only the major exporters  which account for nearly 90% of trade. That is also second lowest behind 13.1% in 2007-08 and down from 14.7% in 2021-22.That major exporter ledger does not include India or Brazil  who have been increasingly relevant in global trade and could potentially expand that footprint. But adding them in does not change the previous conclusion: 2022-23 world wheat stocks-to-use is still set for a 15-year low.China has an extra year's worth of its wheat needs in storage as it stockpiles the grain for food security purposes. The world's top wheat consumer and producer does not export its wheat  but global supply tightness could be solved in a jiffy if China were ever to change its policy.Wheat stocks-to-use in major exportersKaren Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

While we recently decreased our target price  click to read why we confirm our buy rating for Euronext stock.,robertomm/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine  here at the Lab  our internal team decided to move Euronext's rating from neutral to buy (OTCPK:EUXTF). Since then  it has been a continuous decline in the company's stock price. Looking at the year-to-date performances  we see that:Euronext has lost 23%; Deutsche Börse has gained 16%; the London Stock Exchange is positive by almost 10%.Euronext stock price evolution YTD Deutsche Börse stock price evolution YTD London Stock Exchange stock price evolution YTDEuronext buy case recap was based on 1) higher market volatility (using VIX as a proxy)  2) synergies from Borsa Italiana  3) IPO acceleration and 4) a strong cash flow that was supportive of an increase in the dividend per share. After our comments on the Q1 and Q2 results  we were even more positive. So  today we are wondering what has happened and what's next for this jewel.Starting with the negative news  the Italian Index called the FTSE MIB has lost more than 20% since January and many investors sold their investments due to the European energy crisis. It is also true that there were several delistings from Euronext in 2022  among the best-known names are Tods and Exor (which we recently analyzed). This is due to the persistence of different tax systems in Europe. It is a reality that some corporations choose Amsterdam over Euronext to go public for tax reasons.In addition  a few large-cap IPOs were postponed and others were listed abroad such as Ferretti in Hong Kong. Related to our point 3) and looking at the new entries on the Euronext market  IPOs were 70% less compared to 2021.Looking to the just-released data  we see a decline in trading activities with lower volumes on a monthly basis. Despite the fact that this August had two more working days  transactions were recorded minus 6%.Euronext transaction volume monthly dataWhy are we still positive?First of all  on a monthly basis  transaction volumes are down but on a yearly basis are up. This did not justify a loss in market cap of more than 23%. Moreover  we are positive about the new IPO regulation that will simplify the rules for the listing. But how will the listing process change? And  how the IPO rules will positively affect Euronext? Borsa Italiana is working to increase the admission process efficiency by streamlining bureaucracy  time and costs. This will support companies and increase the listed numbers. Borsa Italiana approved the elimination of two documents considered burdensome or no longer indispensable which at the European level are not acquired either by the market operator or by the regulators. To sum up  simplification will save up to a month and part of the documents can only be in English. Regulator's ok is expected at the end of September and once the green light has been obtained  the amendments will enter into force in October 2023.Regarding the valuation  we recently decreased our buy target price from €100 to €98 per share maintaining our outperforming rating. IPO negative flow is much more compensated by the new rules designed to speed up the process. Volatility remains at a very high level and Euronext will benefit from this environment.

On the clinical front  our Phase 2 NASH DESTINY-1 trial for PXL065 met its objectives demonstrating a statistically significant effect with a favorable safety profile. Based on these positive results  PXL065 will be prioritized for further development in NASH and we will initiate discussions for a potential pivotal program in NASH. In parallel  we will focus PXL770 development efforts exclusively in rare diseases on the basis of our promising data which demonstrated strong potential in multiple rare metabolic indications. In addition  these recent PXL065 results have validated our hypothesis that the deuterated-thiazolidinediones (d-TZD) platform reduces PPARγ side-effects while retaining the efficacy benefits of TZDs  and thus warrants exploration in other diseases  such as ALD. Over the summer  we also extended our cash runway through the restructuring of our debt and an equity-linked financing facility. This accomplishment provides us further flexibility to secure additional financing solutions necessary to execute our rare disease strategy.”H1 Key EventsClinical UpdatesIn ALD  PXL770 is prepared to advance into a Phase 2a biomarker proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trial in male patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the most common ALD subtype. The 12-week study will evaluate pharmacokinetics  safety and potential for efficacy based on relevant disease biomarkers  such as the effect on very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)  the characteristic plasma marker of the disease. Considering the DESTINY-1 results for PXL065 in NASH  which validated the deuterium-modified thiazolidinedione (TZD) platform  a second identical study continues to be planned in order to assess the potential of the deuterium-modified TZD platform with PXL065 in ALD. ALD studies are expected to initiate as soon as possible  subject to additional financing.In February and April  the FDA awarded Fast Track Designation (FTD) to PXL065 and PXL770 respectively  for ALD. The FDA grants FTD to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion.In May  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) 1 to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received. Two preclinical articles on X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) for PXL065 and PXL770 were published: The article on PXL065 was published in The Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (“JIMD”) and is entitled “ Therapeutic potential of deuterium-stabilized (R)-pioglitazone - PXL065 - for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ”. It is available here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510808/. The article on PXL770 was published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (“JPET”)   and is entitled “ Beneficial effects of the direct AMP-Kinase activator PXL770 in in vitro and in vivo models of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy”. It is available here: https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2022/06/25/jpet.122.001208.In ADPKD  preclinical studies were completed and demonstrated efficacy of PXL770 in in vitro cyst assays including ADPKD patient-derived cells. In vivo efficacy in a classical animal model of ADPKD was also observed including improvements in renal function  kidney weight  cyst index  and other benefits in kidney tissues. Initiation of development planning and regulatory interactions is underway.Corporate UpdateIn June  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a new patent for PXL065 that describes a specific form of PXL065 with unique properties. Importantly  this recently issued patent provides additional protection through 2041 and could expand protection for PXL065 worldwide  with the potential for an additional 5 years through patent term extension.On June 21  Poxel held its annual general meeting. The shareholders approved all the resolutions that were recommended by the Board of Directors.

PXL065-treated patients achieved statistically significant improvements in the relative decrease in liver fat content measured by magnetic resonance imaging estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI - PDFF) at 36-weeks for all doses. PXL065 was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in body weight and no increased lower extremity edema vs. placebo. The safety profile is consistent with reduced PPAR γ -mediated side effects vs. published results of pioglitazone.PDFF) at 36-weeks for all doses. PXL065 was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in body weight and no increased lower extremity edema vs. placebo. The safety profile is consistent with reduced PPAR -mediated side effects vs. published results of pioglitazone. On September 21  the Company announced additional DESTINY-1 results including histology. Histology findings from paired liver biopsies showed strong improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH  consistent with dose-dependent reduction of all biomarkers related to fibrinogenesis and fibrosis risk scores. Additional favorable trends in other histology parameters were observed. Additional dose-dependent benefits on glucose control and indices of insulin sensitivity were also observed.TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)As of September 1st  initial launch year restrictions for TWYMEEG which limited new products to two weeks prescriptions have been lifted. Due to Sumitomo Pharma's promotional activities and efforts since launch in September 2021  TWYMEEG is very well known among prescribers.

RP2Ds were determined for NBTXR3 plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab for patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC that has not received prior immunotherapy  lung metastases (mets) from any primary tumor  or liver mets from any primary tumor as well.The combined dose escalation and dose expansion parts of Study 1100 are expected to enroll up to 141 patients. The complete dose escalation part enrolled 29 patients in three cohorts: (i) head and neck lesions from LRR or R/M HNSCC eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy; (ii) lung mets from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy; and (iii) liver mets from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy. Study participants received a one-time intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 prior to their first radiotherapy session. They then received radiotherapy  followed by anti-PD-1. Based on the study’s results  the RP2D for all three cohorts was determined to be 33% of gross tumor volume.Nanobiotix aims to deliver an industry-leading head and neck cancer treatment franchise powered by NBTXR3  and to replicate that approach across other solid tumor indications. Pursuant to this strategy  the Company has amended the ongoing expansion phase of Study 1100 to further strengthen the rationale behind a registrational protocol evaluating NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 for patients with R/M HNSCC that is resistant to prior immunotherapy.The amended dose expansion part of study 1100 also has three cohorts  however the cohorts have been re-designed to further explore NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in several immunotherapy-eligible indications  with a particular focus on the treatment of patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC primary lesions that are either naïve or resistant to prior immunotherapy. The expansion part cohorts are as follows: (i) LRR or R/M HNSCC that is resistant to prior immunotherapy; (ii) LRR or R/M HNSCC that has not received prior immunotherapy; (iii) lung  liver  or soft tissue mets from inoperable NSCLC  malignant melanoma  hepatocellular carcinoma  renal cell carcinoma (RCC)  urothelial cancer  cervical cancer  or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) primary tumors.The Company expects to provide updated clinical data from Study 1100 in Q4 2022. The registrational phase 3 protocol submission is expected in Q1 2023  followed by modification of the study design.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across solid tumors that can be treated with radiotherapy and across different therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone which has reduced PPARγ activity  but retains non-genomic thiazolidinedione (TZD) actions.“Pioglitazone’s positive effects in 6 independent prior trials where NASH patients were assessed via liver biopsy propelled the study of PXL065 in patients with NASH and fibrosis. PXL065 is differentiated from pioglitazone based on its distinct pharmacology and lower potential for PPARγ-mediated side effects ” said Stephen Harrison  MD  President  Summit Clinical Research  and principal investigator of this study. “The primary endpoint findings observed on liver fat content reduction along with the other positive findings observed in secondary analysis of key histopathologic features of NASH and fibrosis are promising. When coupled with the benefits seen in glycemic control and a very good safety and tolerability profile  larger studies in NASH are warranted.”“In addition to our previously reported finding of clinically meaningful improvements in liver fat content and circulating biomarkers related to NASH and metabolic health  these results address the high unmet need for fibrosis improvement that remains  particularly for oral products  which we believe will be the cornerstone to treatment ” said Thomas Kuhn  CEO of Poxel. “Based on pioglitazone’s proven efficacy in NASH  PXL065 could become a key product for the treatment of NASH  alone and in combination with other treatment modalities. We will initiate discussions to pursue a potential pivotal program in NASH – leveraging the FDA 505(b)(2) regulatory path and the extensive safety database of pioglitazone as an approved medicine for Type 2 diabetes – which would represent a potentially accelerated and de-risked development with a high probability of success.”Summary of Phase 2 NASH (DESTINY-1) PXL065 Study ResultsDESTINY-1 is a Phase 2  36-week  randomized  dose-ranging  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of PXL065 in patients with noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH across multiple clinical sites in the US. The primary endpoint of the study measured the relative change in the percentage of liver fat content based on magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). The study also assessed the effects of PXL065 on liver histology and other metabolic and non-metabolic biomarkers.117 subjects were randomized to one of 4 daily (QD) treatment arms (7.5 mg  15 mg  22.5 mg  placebo). Analysis of histologic changes was based on paired liver biopsies in PXL065 vs. placebo-treated NASH patients before and after the 36-week treatment period. This trial was not powered to detect statistically significant changes in histology endpoints.New top line results pertaining to liver histology and additional parameters included:Biopsy EndpointsFibrosis improvement by > 1 stage without worsening of NASH  an endpoint recognized by FDA for approval  occurred in 31-50% patients in the PXL065 study arms vs. 17% with placebo. Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  39% of patients had fibrosis improvement by ≥1 stage without worsening NASH (%) vs. 17% with placebo.Worsening of fibrosis by > 1 stage was observed in 9-12% of patients in PXL065 arms vs. 26% with placebo.A > 2 point improvement in the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) with no worsening of fibrosis was observed in 50% of PXL065 treated patients at the 15 and 22.5 mg dose levels vs. 30% with placebo.Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  26% of patients achieved NASH resolution with ≥1 stage fibrosis improvement vs. 13% with placebo.Changes in Liver Fat and Key Markers of Fibrosis and Liver InjuryThe primary efficacy endpoint was achieved: a statistically significant (p=0.024 to p=0.008) mean relative decrease vs. placebo of 21% to 25% in liver fat content from baseline to 36 weeks was observed at all PXL065 doses. 40% of patients who received PXL065 at the 22.5 mg dose achieved a >30% relative reduction in liver fat content (previously reported).Trend in least-square mean ALT decreases up to 18.4 IU/L vs. baseline. Subjects experiencing a decrease in ALT by more than -17U/L were numerically higher in the PXL065 groups (38% to 54%) versus placebo (26%) (previously reported).Statistically significant dose-dependent decreases in PIIINP (fibrogenesis biomarker  p=0.02 at 22.5 mg) and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (p=0.04 at 22.5 mg) along with favorable trends for dose-dependent improvements in other markers of fibrogenesis/fibrosis risk (ProC31  ELF  Fib4) were observed.Metabolic ParametersA dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c (up to 0.41 % placebo-adjusted; p=0.003 at 22.5 mg) was observed; in patients with co-existing Type 2 diabetes  the placebo-adjusted change was up to -0.56%. Given baseline HbA1c values indicating good glucose control on existing Type 2 diabetes treatments (6.1-6.3% overall; 6.6-7.4% in T2D)  these effects are potentially clinically meaningful.Improvements in insulin levels and insulin sensitivity indices (HOMA-IR  Adipo-IR  QUICKI) were also observed.Modest plasma adiponectin level increase of up to +5.26 ug/mL (p<0.0001 vs. placebo at 22.5 mg); consistent with limited degree of PPARγ activation and observed safety profile with reduced potential for weight gain or peripheral edema.Safety & TolerabilityThere was no dose-dependent increase in body weight: a minimal least-square mean increase of 0.68 kg was observed at the top dose of 22.5 mg vs. placebo (previously reported).Low incidence of edema without observed treatment or dose relation when compared to placebo (previously reported).With respect to other safety measures  PXL065 was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated; the number of patients presenting with treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were similar among all groups including placebo without dose effect. None were treatment related (previously reported).PharmacokineticsAs predicted  pharmacokinetic measurements showed dose-proportional drug levels with the desired degree of higher exposure to the pioglitazone R-stereoisomer and reduced exposure to the (PPARγ active) S-stereoisomer (previously reported).The full Phase 2 results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting.About PXL065PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone. Although pioglitazone is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH  it is the most extensively studied drug for NASH; in multiple prior trials  improvements in liver histology  including reductions in fibrosis  were demonstrated2 3. Pioglitazone is the only drug recommended for biopsy-proven NASH patients by the Practice Guidelines published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)4. Pioglitazone’s off-label use for NASH  however  has been limited due to the PPARγ-related side effects  which include weight gain  bone fractures and fluid retention.Pioglitazone is a 1:1 mixture of two mirror-image compounds (R- and S-stereoisomers) that interconvert in vivo. Using deuterium  Poxel stabilized each stereoisomer and characterized their different pharmacological properties. In in vitro studies  PXL065 has been shown to target non-genomic pathways including mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4). In preclinical animal models  PXL065 exhibits the NASH efficacy associated with pioglitazone with no significant weight gain or fluid retention  side effects which are associated with the S-stereoisomer5. NASH Phase 2 (DESTINY 1 trial) results available to-date show statistically significant effects of PXL065 on liver fat content  biomarkers related to liver fibrogenesis-fibrosis risk  as well as positive effects on fibrosis and other key parameters based on histology analysis. Relative to published data for pioglitazone  reduced potential for weight gain and edema was also evident. Based upon preclinical  Phase 1 and Phase 2 results  Poxel believes that PXL065 may have a better therapeutic profile than pioglitazone for NASH and may also have suitable properties for further development in other indications including adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).About NASHNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disease with no clear disease origin that is quickly becoming a worldwide epidemic. It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver causing inflammation and fibrosis. The disease can be silent for a long period of time  but once it accelerates  severe damage and liver cirrhosis can occur  which can significantly impact liver function or can even result in liver failure or liver cancer. Typical risk factors for NASH include obesity  elevated levels of blood lipids (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes. Currently no curative or specific therapies are available.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). In rare diseases  development of PXL770  a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  is focused on the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

10285,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4542167-mpc-containerships-providing-strong-dividend-yield-for-the-next-two-years,MPC Container Ships Stock: Providing 25-30% Dividend Yield For The Next 2 Years (MPZZF),MPC Container Ships is a Norwegian company focusing on the small containership segment. Read why MPC is an investment consideration given its backlog of contracted revenue and EBITDA.,SHansche/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionMPC Container Ships (OTCPK:MPZZF) is a Norway-listed lessor of container vessels to a number of Tier-1 operators like COSCO  CMA CGM  Maersk and Seaboard. As this is a relatively small company with a market cap of just under $1B and as it doesn’t have a full US listing  the company is still flying under the radar as it is trading at less than 3 times earnings on an annualized basis.Yahoo FinanceMPC’s most liquid listing definitely is its listing on Euronext Oslo  where it's trading with MPCC as ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Norway exceeds 3 million shares so interested investors should definitely use the company’s Norwegian listing. There are currently 444 million shares outstanding resulting in a market capitalization of approximately 9B NOK. At the current exchange rate  this represents less than $900M.The website contains download-only links  but you can find all relevant data here.A strong performance in the first half of the yearMPC Container Ships focuses on the smaller segment of the container vessels as its average capacity per vessel is just around 2 500 TEU. The fleet list shows 69 vessels but this includes one vessel available for sale and the four newbuilds which will only be delivered in 2024. There are 64 vessels active for MPC and the average amount of vessels deployed during the first and the second quarter came in at 60.The total revenue in the second quarter was just over $151M  an increase of in excess of 5% compared to the first quarter. Meanwhile  the operating expenditures actually decreased compared to the first quarter and the only reason why the gross profit and EBITDA came in lower than in the first quarter was the much lower contribution from joint ventures. Excluding this element  the gross profit would have increased by approximately 10% in the second quarter.MPC Container ShipsThis doesn’t mean Q2 was bad. The company was still printing cash thanks to the exceptionally high charter rates and the quarterly net income was approximately $90.1M resulting in an EPS of $0.20. This brought the H1 2022 earnings to $0.47 and at the current exchange rate  this represents an EPS of approximately 4.8 NOK. This means that if you would annualize the H1 earnings  MPC Container Ships is essentially trading at just over 2 times the net income. Not bad at all  and that’s slightly lower than its peers like a Global Ship Lease (GSL) which I think is the closest comparable.It also doesn’t come as a surprise to see the operating cash flow come in at a very strong level as the company generated approximately $99M in operating cash flow and after deducting the interest expenses and lease costs  the adjusted operating cash flow was a very strong $97M.MPC Container ShipsThe company spent about $15M on scrubbers and dry-docking resulting in a free cash flow result of approximately $82M. A very strong result which also means the company is in an excellent position to cover the dividend and shouldn’t have any issues to finance the new vessels.The company’s dividend policy is pretty clear: The company plans to use 75% of the recurring earnings for dividends and based on the $0.20 EPS in Q2  a dividend of $0.15 per share was paid. That’s approximately 1.5 NOK and represents about 7.5% on the current share price for just the second quarter.MPC Container ShipsOf course  charter rates are coming down a bit so it wouldn’t be wise to just assume the dividend will remain stable: It will always fluctuate in function of the recurring earnings. The dividends can be increased if extraordinary circumstances occur. The shareholders will for instance also benefit from the sale of a vessel.Between now and the end of 2024  MPC Container Ships will need to spend almost $225M on four new vessels. But MPC played it smart and it has already secured charters which should generate in excess of $280M in EBITDA. So basically MPC is already pretty sure these new vessels are paying for themselves.MPC Container ShipsThe majority of the days have been fixed for 2023 and 2024 as well  creating strong visibilityThe main issue in the container shipping sector is the lack of visibility when it comes to charter rates for vessels. Fortunately MPC has locked in longer term contracts for a large portion of its fleet. For 2023  for instance  84% of the days have been fixed at an average charter rate of almost $32 000/day. This means the contracted revenue for 2023 is already $548M with 16% of the available days still open for new charters.MPC Container ShipsEven for 2024  about 56% of the days are fixed at an even higher average daily rate of in excess of $35 000 per day. So although the percentage of contracted days drops from 84% to 56% (a 33% decrease)  the total revenue falls by just over 20% as the higher charter rates are making up for the lower amount of contracted days.The next image is a very interesting slide provided by MPC. It explains how the current contracted EBITDA and the scrap value of the vessels already exceed the current enterprise value of MPC.MPC Container ShipsAnd since this slide was published  the market capitalization fell by an additional $200M. Based on a net debt of just $101M and a market cap of $900M  the enterprise value is just $1B which is handsomely covered by the combination of contracted EBITDA and the scrap value of the vessels.Investment thesisWhile MPC is attractively priced  it looks like the dividends are subject to the 25% Norwegian dividend withholding tax and this could be a handicap versus other container ship lessor companies that are domiciled in more advantageous jurisdictions.While I’m not really a big fan of the owners of container vessels as quite a few newbuilds will hit the water in the coming years  I always will have a good look at well-run companies with a strong balance sheet and high contracted revenues with reputable parties. MPC fits that bill and although the charter rates will remain volatile  MPC’s longer term contracts provide excellent visibility. There is a realistic chance the company will pay out its entire current market capitalization in dividends by the end of 2025.I currently have no position in MPC but will keep an eye on the company’s performance.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.32,0.13,0.55,True,English,"['MPC Container Ships Stock', '25-30% Dividend Yield', 'Next 2 Years', 'The', 'MPZZF', 'free cash flow result', 'higher average daily rate', 'average daily volume', 'longer term contracts', 'current exchange rate', 'container shipping sector', 'operating cash flow', 'average charter rate', 'higher charter rates', 'Global Ship Lease', 'high charter rates', 'current enterprise value', 'MPC Container Ships', 'full US listing', 'quarterly net income', 'current share price', 'four new vessels', 'strong result', 'average capacity', 'average amount', 'operating expenditures', 'four newbuilds', 'lease costs', 'scrap value', 'container vessels', 'Getty Images', 'Norway-listed lessor', 'Tier-1 operators', 'CMA CGM', 'market cap', 'annualized basis', 'Yahoo Finance', 'liquid listing', 'Euronext Oslo', 'ticker symbol', '3 million shares', 'interested investors', 'Norwegian listing', '444 million shares', 'relevant data', 'strong performance', 'smaller segment', 'second quarter', 'gross profit', 'lower contribution', 'joint ventures', 'H1 2022 earnings', 'H1 earnings', 'strong level', 'interest expenses', 'strong $97M', 'excellent position', 'recurring earnings', 'extraordinary circumstances', 'main issue', 'large portion', 'lower amount', 'next image', 'interesting slide', 'first half', 'first quarter', 'new charters', 'total revenue', '3 times earnings', 'fleet list', 'strong visibility', '9B NOK', 'one vessel', 'dividend policy', 'available days', 'small company', 'MPC.', '69 vessels', '64 vessels', '2 times', '4.8 NOK', '1.5 NOK', 'SHansche', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'OTCPK', 'MPZZF', 'number', 'COSCO', 'Maersk', 'Seaboard', 'radar', 'MPCC', 'website', 'download', 'links', 'year', '2,500 TEU', 'sale', 'increase', 'excess', 'reason', 'EBITDA', 'element', 'Q2', 'EPS', 'peers', 'GSL', 'surprise', 'scrubbers', 'dry-docking', 'issues', 'dividends', 'function', 'shareholders', 'instance', 'majority', 'lack', 'percentage', '33% decrease']",2022-09-21,2022-09-22,seekingalpha.com

The product is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine and associated tissues) and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system). Please refer to the FDA approved Prescribing Information on Drugs@FDA .4Gadopiclenol  the active substance of EluciremTM  has been designed with two sites for water molecule exchange to increase relaxivity and contrast  allowing to use it at half the conventional dose of gadolinium compared to other non-specific GBCAs.The efficacy and safety of Gadopiclenol have been assessed as part of Guerbet’s clinical development plan  with marketing authorization being targeted worldwide (cf. phase III trial results below).The FDA is the first health authority to have approved EluciremTM. It is currently in the process of examination by the European Medicines Agency via a centralized procedure.Story continues“As a pioneer in MR imaging  thanks to the success of our first gadolinium-based macrocyclic contrast agent  we are delighted with the FDA approval of Elucirem™. This approval allows patients and practitioners to benefit from the innovations brought by Elucirem™”David Hale  Chief Executive Officer of Guerbet GroupPhase III clinical trials for Elucirem™The approval was primarily based on data from two Phase III studies completed in March 2021 which demonstrated that Elucirem™ leads to non-inferior results in brain and body MRI at half the gadolinium dose of Gadobutrol.5 6 The endpoints were met in terms of the diagnostic benefit of injecting Gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) during MRI examinations  based on two criteria:1/ the superiority of the examination with Gadopiclenol compared to the examination with no contrast agent;and 2/ the non-inferiority of Gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) compared to Gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) for the visualization and detection of lesions of the central nervous system and in the other anatomical areas studied.No major safety signals were reported during the development of Gadopiclenol  and the adverse reactions reported during the two-Phase III studies were similar for both products administered.

Controlling access to applications  data  and systems is an increasingly important aspect of securing any environment and protecting it against both internal and external threats.After two years of the pandemic  confidence in addressing certain security risks and threats arising from hybrid and remote work has improved among businesses and organizations around the world. When it comes to secure access to applications  data  and systems  84% IT professionals this year said they have some degree of confidence in their current user access security systems to enable remote work securely and easily  compared to 56% in 2021. In addition  60% said this year they were highly confident compared to just 22% last year.These are among some of the key findings from the 2022 Thales Access Management Index  a global survey of 2 600 IT decision makers  conducted by 451 Research  part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.Firms Gaining Confidence Addressing Security of Remote WorkOverall  the report findings suggest that firms remain concerned about the security risks of remote work  but those concerns seem to be less severe. At the same time  firms are also growing more confident in the ability of authentication and access management systems to manage those risks. Only 31% of IT professional surveyed reported having “very high” concerns about the security risks and threats of remote work in 2022  down from 39% in 2021  while those who said they were “somewhat concerned” – the most popular response – increased from 43% to 48% in 2022.Multi-Factor Authentication on the Rise But Not WidespreadWhile multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage remains most prevalent for remote workers (68%) and privileged users (52%)  the report shows that MFA adoption is on the rise for internal and non-IT staff with MFA adoption increasing to 40% compared to 34% in 2021. However  widespread MFA adoption by businesses is still yet to be the norm with just over half (56%) have adopted MFA in their organizations.Lingering Effects of Pandemic Drive Interest in Access Management  MFA and ZTNAThe survey inquired about direct impacts that the pandemic and remote work had on deployment plans for new access security technologies. Responses revealed a six-percentage-point global increase in plans to deploy stand-alone MFA  up from 31% in 2021. The pandemic also impacted plans to deploy cloud-based access management  selected by 45% of respondents worldwide compared to 41% in 2021. These two increases illustrate respondents’ growing awareness that threats come from all angles  and that proper authentication and management of access and privileges is necessary for an adequate security foundation. Last year  Zero Trust Network Access/Software-Defined Perimeter (ZTNA)/(SDP) was the top choice  selected by 44% of respondents. In 2022  ZTNA was the second choice at 42%.Francois Lasnier  Vice President of Access Management Solutions at Thales comments: “The past few years have cemented remote work and work-from-anywhere as a permanent part of the security landscape  and they have also introduced new security risks and challenges. However  growing familiarity with remote work has ultimately broadened awareness on an enterprise level of daily business security risks and has strengthened both confidence and ability in security teams and products to handle those risks and threats properly.”Garrett Bekker  Principal Analyst at 451 Research comments: “Just as the threat landscape has evolved  the tools and methods to handle the landscape have  too. However  even with innovative tools and boosted confidence levels  security plans and approaches still need to adapt to the ever-changing threat environment. A greater shift towards a Zero Trust model would place access management in a central role in corporate security strategies  with a related reliance on MFA as a critical supporting enabler.”Thales and 451 Research will discuss the findings in more detail during a webinar on 29 September 2022.

The global edition of the 2022 Thales Access Management Index looked at various aspects of those impacts in a wide-ranging survey of security professionals and executive leadership that touched on issues including access management and access security  multi-factor authentication  zero-trust network access  security spending plans  remote work and VPNs  and ransomware.

ENHANZE facilitates the subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics that are typically administered via intravenous (IV) infusion.“Our vision for the gMG program is to deliver the broadest treatment offering for people living with this debilitating  and often overlooked disease. Every individual experiences gMG differently  which is why we’re excited about the possibility of introducing multiple ways to meet the needs of patients  including with route of administration and dosing schedule ” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “The submission of this BLA is the latest milestone in honoring our commitment to the gMG patient community. We look forward to working closely with the agency through the BLA review process and to potentially bringing forth another first-in-class option for gMG patients.”The BLA submission package includes data from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod as compared with intravenously administered VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The majority of enrolled patients were positive for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies  but the trial also included patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Story continuesADAPT-SC met its primary endpoint (p< 0.0001) of total IgG reduction from baseline at day 29 demonstrating noninferiority of SC efgartigimod to VYVGART. Patients treated with SC efgartigimod achieved mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% reduction with VYVGART. Results were consistent across the overall population  including those with AChR antibodies and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected. Further  69.1% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Responders are defined as having at least a two-point improvement on the MG-ADL score for at least four consecutive weeks. 65.5% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score. Responders are defined as having at least a three-point improvement on the QMG score for at least four consecutive weeks. Minimal symptom expression (MSE)  a measure of symptom-free status  was achieved in 37% of SC efgartigimod-treated patients after one treatment cycle. Onset of effect was also consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT study.The safety profile for SC efgartigimod was consistent with the ADAPT study. It was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time. After completing ADAPT-SC  95% of participants entered ADAPT-SC+  a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of SC efgartigimod.Phase 3 ADAPT-SC Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) as compared with VYVGART (10mg/kg) in patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect as measured by percent change from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29  one week after the last dose of IV or SC efgartigimod  served as the primary endpoint in the ADAPT-SC trial. The correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG was demonstrated in a Phase 2 trial and the Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which served as the basis for approval of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and Europe. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed.A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial and were treated. Inclusion criteria of the trial were the same as the Phase 3 ADAPT trial of VYVGART; enrolled patients had a confirmed gMG diagnosis and an MG-ADL total score of at least 5 with greater than 50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms  at screening and baseline. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  and were required to remain on that stable dose throughout the primary trial. Patients were eligible to enroll in ADAPT-SC regardless of antibody status  including patients with AChR antibodies (AChR-Ab+) and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod or IV efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information. For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infectionHave received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization).

Sept. 21  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  and the first to bring a macrocyclic GBCA to the global market  is proud to announce the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) injection. This next generation  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older. 4 FDA granted Elucirem™ priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5GBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active substance of EluciremTM  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional dose of other non-specific GBCAs.Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) Injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis and musculoskeletal system).""Guerbet is a leader in the field of GBCA-based MRI imaging agents and developed the first macrocyclic GBCA. We are extremely gratified that this approval from the FDA will make it possible for clinicians and patients to benefit from the innovations brought by Elucirem™"" said David Hale  Chief Executive Officer of Guerbet.Story continuesThe approval was primarily based on data from two adequate and well-controlled Phase III studies completed in March 2021 which showed that gadopiclenol was designed to improve image quality in brain and body MRI at half the conventional gadolinium dose.2 3 In both the PICTURE trial for CNS MRI and the PROMISE trial in Body MRI  gadopiclenol-enhanced MRI at 0.05 mmol/kg showed superiority as compared to unenhanced MRI and non-inferiority as compared to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg as assessed in 3 lesion visualization co-primary criteria: border delineation  internal morphology and contrast enhancement.2 3 In the PICTURE trial  readers preferred the quality of visualization obtained with a half dose of Gadopiclenol compared to a full dose of Gadobutrol. 2Gadopiclenol was evaluated in 1 047 patients with doses ranging from 0.025 mmol/kg BW (one half the recommended dose) to 0.3 mmol/kg BW (six times the recommended dose). A total of 708 patients (age range two years to 88 years) received the recommended dose of 0.05 mmol/kg BW. No major safety signals were reported during the development of gadopiclenol  and the adverse reactions reported during the two-Phase III studies were similar for both products administered. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >0.2%) in patients who received Gadopiclenol were injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth and coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling.""After 15 years of dedicated research to bring Elucirem to fruition Guerbet is very proud of this FDA approval of Elucirem™  confirming the commitment of Guerbet's R&D teams in developing solutions for MRI  adapted to the needs of radiologists and patients."" said Dr Philippe Bourrinet  Senior Vice-President Development  Medical & Regulatory Affairs of Guerbet.Elucirem™ will be available in glass vials  pharmacy bulk package and plastic pre-filled syringes which can help to streamline workflow in the imaging suite.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREMTM (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREMWarnings and PrecautionsNephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis: GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic  severe kidney disease as well as patients with acute kidney injury.Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies  particularly closely spaced studies when possibleAcute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Do not exceed the recommended dose.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling.Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BW ELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. There are no available data on ELUCIREM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of ELUCIREM in human milk  the effects on the breastfed infant  or the effects on milk production. However  published lactation data on other GBCAs indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is excreted in breast milk.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ELUCIREM have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney  and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.Renal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment  the exposure of gadopiclenol is increased compared to patients with normal renal function. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. No dose adjustment of ELUCIREM is recommended for patients with renal impairment. ELUCIREM can be removed from the body by hemodialysisYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

The data we are presenting this week further underscore this commitment with a growing body of clinical safety and efficacy data on VYVGART  our first-in-class FcRn blocker and the anchor of our neuromuscular franchise. gMG is a disease that affects each patient differently and that is exactly how we want to approach treatment – meeting the needs of patients and physicians based on their individual disease experience ” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer  argenx. “Deeper within our neuromuscular franchise  we are highlighting the thoughtful trial designs of the ADHERE study of efgartigimod in CIDP and the ARDA trial of ARGX-117 in MMN  bringing us one step closer to reaching many more people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.”Story continuesHighlights from AANEM and MGFASeventeen scientific abstracts have been accepted between both meetings  including previously reported data from the ADAPT+ open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety  tolerability and efficacy of VYVGART and the registrational ADAPT-SC trial evaluating the noninferiority of subcutaneous (SC) efgartigimod compared to intravenously administered VYVGART based on total IgG reduction. New data analyses from ADAPT+ and real-world case studies are being presented on the adult anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody negative (AChR-Ab-) gMG patient population.ADAPT+ : Data suggest that long-term treatment with VYVGART provides consistent decreases in IgG antibodies and repeatable improvements in function and strength based on Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) disease scores; the long-term safety profile of VYVGART remained consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT trial.ADAPT-SC : Topline data show SC efgartigimod was noninferior to VYVGART in total IgG reduction at day 29 and demonstrated consistent clinical improvement based on MG-ADL and QMG disease scores.Seronegative gMG Population : New pooled data from ADAPT+ and real-world case studies indicate that VYVGART treatment was associated with clinically meaningful disease score improvements (≥2-point improvement in MG-ADL and ≥3-point improvement in QMG) in adult AChR-Ab- gMG patients. Clinically meaningful improvement in MG-ADL scores was observed in AChR-Ab- patients across 10 treatment cycles in ADAPT+. Additionally  preliminary real-world experience in the AChR-Ab- patient population is largely consistent with the ADAPT studies.gMG Disease and Treatment Burden : Additional evidence from argenx-sponsored health economic outcomes research studies demonstrate the severity of gMG based on annual hospitalizations and readmission and mortality rates  especially in older gMG patients.Vaccine Response: Preliminary data suggest treatment with VYVGART does not impact immune response to vaccinations  including to COVID-19.AANEM Poster Presentations are taking place at the following times in Ryman Exhibit Hall B1:AANEM Session I: Thursday  9/22 from 6:00 - 6:30 pm CTAANEM Session II: Friday  9/23 from 9:30 - 10:00 am CTAANEM Session III: Friday  9/23 from 3:30 - 4:00 pm CTVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)Long-Term Safety  Tolerability  and Efficacy of Efgartigimod in Patients with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis: Interim Results of the ADAPT+ StudyJames F.

For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.Important Safety Information for VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. prescribing information)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare chronic  inﬂammatory  pure motor polyneuropathy leading to slowly progressive muscle weakness  mainly of the hands and forearms and lower legs. MMN is associated with increased levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies against the ganglioside GM1  which is widely expressed in the nervous system and important for nerve conduction. The clinical course of MMN is chronically progressive without remission. MMN is often misdiagnosed as CIDP because of the similar clinical features and its progressive nature but MMN is asymmetric and affects the right and left side of the body differently.About VYVGARTVYVGART (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is not currently approved in any country for CIDP or MMN  and clinical studies of these conditions are ongoing.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S.  Japan  and the EU.

Lanifibranor is currently evaluated in a pivotal Phase III trial in NASHInventiva will receive a $12 million upfront  $5 million in short term potential milestone payments  up to $290 million of clinical  regulatory and commercial milestone payments  in addition to tiered royaltiesDaix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  Beijing/Hong Kong (China)  September 21 2022 – Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs  and Chia Tai-Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co.  Ltd (“CTTQ”)  a subsidiary of Sino Biopharm  have entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement (the “Agreement”) to develop and commercialize lanifibranor  Inventiva’s proprietary compound  for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and potentially other metabolic diseases in mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau and Taiwan (“Greater China”).Frederic Cren  CEO and cofounder of Inventiva  stated: “This agreement with Sino Biopharm represents an important milestone not only to support and accelerate the development of lanifibranor  but also to potentially develop and commercialize lanifibranor in Greater China  a region which has a similar prevalence of NASH to the U.S. and a large number of untreated patients at risk of progressing to cirrhosis. Moreover  this agreement could make a significant contribution to the reinforcement of our cash position. We are particularly proud of partnering with Sino Biopharm  a company with a strong presence in the hepatology field and a clear motivation and strategy to make lanifibranor a potential treatment option for patients with NASH in Greater China.”Theresa Tse  Chairwoman  Sino Biopharm: “This agreement is further evidence of Sino Biopharm’s commitment to seeking innovation  in one of our core therapeutics areas  liver disease. We have been at the forefront in helping China eliminate hepatitis B for over a decade  and today  NASH without any approved treatments  is the fastest growing cause of liver transplants and liver cancer  so we are delighted to enter into this agreement with Inventiva  which is a great opportunity to bring a promising and convenient treatment of NASH to China.”Sean Chen  Chief Strategy Officer  Sino Biopharm: “Sino Biopharm ranks top in China on liver disease drug sales and we believe this collaboration on lanifibranor  the potential best-in-class pan-PPAR agonist for the treatment of NASH  will further enrich our innovative pipeline on liver disease and strengthen our leadership in this therapeutic area. Our team is looking forward to partnering with Inventiva to accelerate the development of Lanifibranor in China and to satisfy an unmet clinical need in the quickest possible timeframe.”In exchange for receiving an exclusive license to develop  import  manufacture  commercialize and market lanifibranor in Greater China  CTTQ will pay Inventiva an upfront payment of $12 million and $5 million are also expected in the short-term if certain clinical milestones are met. Under the terms of the Agreement  Inventiva has the potential to receive up to $290 million of clinical  regulatory and commercial milestone payments. In addition  subject to regulatory approval  Inventiva will receive tiered royalties from high single-digit to mid-teen double digits of net sales made by Sino Biopharm in Greater China during the first three years of commercialization and from low to mid-teen double digits starting from year four. Depending on multiple factors  including Chinese regulatory authority feedback  CTTQ will either join the ongoing NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH or run an independent study. CTTQ will bear all costs associated with the trials conducted in Greater China.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  MPS and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signalling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .About Sino BiopharmSino Biopharm is a leading  innovative R&D-driven pharmaceutical conglomerate in China.

Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the most advanced pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.ContactsInventivaPascaline Clerc  VP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon / Aude Lepreux ; Media relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

This includes a positive forex effect of €12.8 million  almost half of which (€6 million) was due to the dollar’s strength against the euro.Excluding forex effects and on a like-for-like basis  first-half revenue was down -1.3% at €358.3 million. It was up +0.5% in the first quarter and down -3.1% in the second quarter due to a largely unfavorable base effect (sales had jumped +25.1% in the second quarter of 2021 in a context of post-lockdown improvements).Good momentum across all sectors and geographic areas  excluding the Raleigh effectIn the Americas  reported sales were up +6.4% (down -3.7% at CER). Demand remained strong  with activity at the industrial site in Raleigh (North Carolina) hampered in the first half of the year by recruitment difficulties affecting the production of Optiray® and Dotarem®. The measures put in place in recent months have paid off and are now significantly limiting the impact of these difficulties.In Asia  activity increased 7.7% (4.2% at CER)  driven by the introduction of direct distribution in China in the second quarter.In EMEA  reported sales were down -3.2% (-2.6% at CER) with stable volumes overall  accompanied by continued price erosion.Diagnostic Imaging revenue in the first half grew 2.1% at current exchange rates (-1.3% at CER).In MRI  H1 revenue increased +2.5% to €121.3 million (-0.5% at CER).X-ray revenue totaled €206.8 million  up 1.9% (-1.8% at CER) thanks to volumes and prices that remained strong for Xenetix® and despite the decline in Optiray® sales due to production constraints at the Raleigh site.In Interventional Imaging  reported sales were up 2.5%. At CER  sales were down -1.6%. The implementation of a worldwide Lipiodol® sales contract led to a decline in revenue from this activity in the first quarter (-9.7%) due to one-off price effects. The recovery was very pronounced in the second quarter (+7.3%). For the first half as a whole  there was double-digit growth in micro-catheters (+21.5%).Resilient first-half resultsIn millions of euros Consolidated financial statements (IFRS) H1 2021Reported H1 2022Reported Revenue 363.1 371.1 EBITDA2% of revenue 62.317.1% 50.513.6% Operating income% of revenue 34.89.6% 16.94.6% Net income% of revenue 23.46.4% 3.30.9% Net debt 249.3 251.52 EBITDA: Operating income before net amortization  depreciation  and provisions.The 2022 half-year financial statements  approved by the Board of Directors on Wednesday  September 21  2022  underwent a limited review by the statutory auditors. The statutory auditors' report is being prepared.EBITDA margin in line with expectationsAs a reminder  the exceptional budgetary measures put in place at the height of the COVID crisis led to the Group’s EBITDA ratio of 17.1% at the end of June 2021. During the second half of 2021  the Group relaunched its sales and marketing investments to boost activity and accelerate the strategy’s implementation  resulting in an EBITDA/revenue ratio of 14.4% at the end of 2021.In an environment of inflation and labor market tensions  the Group managed to preserve its profitability by continuing its efforts to optimize production and structural costs. This discipline enabled it to limit the impact of rising costs of raw materials and other supplies (iodine in particular). The increase in payroll costs remained contained (+3.3%) despite intense recruitment pressure in the US. Excluding extraordinary costs related to the optimization of the Group’s operating structure and the change in the sales model in China (direct distribution)  the EBITDA/revenue ratio was 13.9%  in line with the Group’s expectations at the end of this first half of the year. The reported margin was 13.6%.As of June 30  operating income totaled €16.9 million. This includes an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as provisions related to quality disputes with component suppliers.Net income for the first half amounted to €3.3 million. Financial expenses fell sharply to €1.2 million (versus €4.4 million in the first half of 2021). The tax expense increased to €11.2 million (compared with €5.1 million previously) after the Group analyzed the tax risks across all its subsidiaries and booked an additional €9.5 million provision in its consolidated accounts in compliance with IFRIC 23.As of June 30  2022  equity totaled €429 million  compared with €405 million on Friday  December 31  2021. The decrease in cash (-€56 million  at €60 million) reflects the €25 million repayment of the installment loan obtained in 2019 and the increase in WCR fueled by the establishment of precautionary stocks and stocks of EluciremTM to prepare for its launch in 2023. This did not prevent a further improvement in the debt ratio  with a net debt/equity ratio of 0.59 as of June 30  2022  compared with 0.64 a year earlier.2022 outlook and guidanceDuring the first half of the year  the Group made industrial  commercial  and operational investments on several fronts in order to prepare for the future  thus contributing to an unprecedented renewal of its product portfolio in all divisions.In Diagnostic Imaging   the production chains are on track for the sale of Elucirem TM   expected by 2023  after reviews by the FDA and the EMA 1 .  the production chains are on track for the sale of Elucirem   expected by 2023  after reviews by the FDA and the EMA .

For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.Important Safety Information for VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. prescribing information)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.VYVGART may increase the risk of infection.

Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare chronic  inﬂammatory  pure motor polyneuropathy leading to slowly progressive muscle weakness  mainly of the hands and forearms and lower legs. MMN is associated with increased levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies against the ganglioside GM1  which is widely expressed in the nervous system and important for nerve conduction. The clinical course of MMN is chronically progressive without remission. MMN is often misdiagnosed as CIDP because of the similar clinical features and its progressive nature but MMN is asymmetric and affects the right and left side of the body differently.About VYVGARTVYVGART (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is not currently approved in any country for CIDP or MMN  and clinical studies of these conditions are ongoing.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

ENHANZE facilitates the subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics that are typically administered via intravenous (IV) infusion.“Our vision for the gMG program is to deliver the broadest treatment offering for people living with this debilitating  and often overlooked disease. Every individual experiences gMG differently  which is why we’re excited about the possibility of introducing multiple ways to meet the needs of patients  including with route of administration and dosing schedule ” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “The submission of this BLA is the latest milestone in honoring our commitment to the gMG patient community. We look forward to working closely with the agency through the BLA review process and to potentially bringing forth another first-in-class option for gMG patients.”The BLA submission package includes data from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod as compared with intravenously administered VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The majority of enrolled patients were positive for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies  but the trial also included patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.ADAPT-SC met its primary endpoint (p< 0.0001) of total IgG reduction from baseline at day 29 demonstrating noninferiority of SC efgartigimod to VYVGART. Patients treated with SC efgartigimod achieved mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% reduction with VYVGART. Results were consistent across the overall population  including those with AChR antibodies and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected. Further  69.1% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Responders are defined as having at least a two-point improvement on the MG-ADL score for at least four consecutive weeks. 65.5% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score. Responders are defined as having at least a three-point improvement on the QMG score for at least four consecutive weeks. Minimal symptom expression (MSE)  a measure of symptom-free status  was achieved in 37% of SC efgartigimod-treated patients after one treatment cycle. Onset of effect was also consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT study.The safety profile for SC efgartigimod was consistent with the ADAPT study. It was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time. After completing ADAPT-SC  95% of participants entered ADAPT-SC+  a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of SC efgartigimod.Phase 3 ADAPT-SC Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) as compared with VYVGART (10mg/kg) in patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect as measured by percent change from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29  one week after the last dose of IV or SC efgartigimod  served as the primary endpoint in the ADAPT-SC trial. The correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG was demonstrated in a Phase 2 trial and the Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which served as the basis for approval of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and Europe. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed.A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial and were treated. Inclusion criteria of the trial were the same as the Phase 3 ADAPT trial of VYVGART; enrolled patients had a confirmed gMG diagnosis and an MG-ADL total score of at least 5 with greater than 50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms  at screening and baseline. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  and were required to remain on that stable dose throughout the primary trial. Patients were eligible to enroll in ADAPT-SC regardless of antibody status  including patients with AChR antibodies (AChR-Ab+) and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod or IV efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information. For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.VYVGART may increase the risk of infection.

Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infectionHave received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology.About VYVGARTVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness.

Sept. 21  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  and the first to bring a macrocyclic GBCA to the global market  is proud to announce the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) injection. This next generation  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older. 4 FDA granted Elucirem™ priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5GBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active substance of EluciremTM  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional dose of other non-specific GBCAs.Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) Injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis and musculoskeletal system).""Guerbet is a leader in the field of GBCA-based MRI imaging agents and developed the first macrocyclic GBCA. We are extremely gratified that this approval from the FDA will make it possible for clinicians and patients to benefit from the innovations brought by Elucirem™"" said David Hale  Chief Executive Officer of Guerbet.The approval was primarily based on data from two adequate and well-controlled Phase III studies completed in March 2021 which showed that gadopiclenol was designed to improve image quality in brain and body MRI at half the conventional gadolinium dose.2 3 In both the PICTURE trial for CNS MRI and the PROMISE trial in Body MRI  gadopiclenol-enhanced MRI at 0.05 mmol/kg showed superiority as compared to unenhanced MRI and non-inferiority as compared to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg as assessed in 3 lesion visualization co-primary criteria: border delineation  internal morphology and contrast enhancement.2 3 In the PICTURE trial  readers preferred the quality of visualization obtained with a half dose of Gadopiclenol compared to a full dose of Gadobutrol. 2Gadopiclenol was evaluated in 1 047 patients with doses ranging from 0.025 mmol/kg BW (one half the recommended dose) to 0.3 mmol/kg BW (six times the recommended dose). A total of 708 patients (age range two years to 88 years) received the recommended dose of 0.05 mmol/kg BW. No major safety signals were reported during the development of gadopiclenol  and the adverse reactions reported during the two-Phase III studies were similar for both products administered. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >0.2%) in patients who received Gadopiclenol were injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth and coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling.""After 15 years of dedicated research to bring Elucirem to fruition Guerbet is very proud of this FDA approval of Elucirem™  confirming the commitment of Guerbet's R&D teams in developing solutions for MRI  adapted to the needs of radiologists and patients."" said Dr Philippe Bourrinet  Senior Vice-President Development  Medical & Regulatory Affairs of Guerbet.Elucirem™ will be available in glass vials  pharmacy bulk package and plastic pre-filled syringes which can help to streamline workflow in the imaging suite.

The test is made possible through a partnership with Clinical Enterprise Inc.  a CLIA-certified  CAP-accredited laboratory located in Framingham  Mass.Brigham and Women's Hospital is among the first healthcare facilities to make the test available through its Preventive Genomics Clinic  where PRS is being used  along with comprehensive whole-genome sequencing  to provide patients with personal disease risk factors.""Polygenic risk scores are an exciting new tool to identify individuals at increased risk for common complex disorders like heart disease  diabetes  and common forms of cancer "" said Robert Green  a medical geneticist and professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital  Ariadne Labs and Harvard Medical School  who is a scientific advisor to the company. ""Identifying those at highest risk means that surveillance and intervention can be focused earlier and have a greater impact  moving us closer to proactive and preventive health care  rather than reactive sick care.""Allelica's new  ancestry-specific PRS tests are available as a physician-ordered test and set new standards for accessibility  accuracy  and cost. The tests use a patient's saliva as a DNA sample for genotyping analysis carried out by Clinical Enterprise. The analysis leverages genome-wide microarray technology that takes into account hundreds of thousands of genetic variants and offers significant cost savings compared to whole-genome sequencing.The output of the microarray analysis is input into the Allelica platform  which applies proprietary algorithms to calculate an ancestry-specific PRS and generate clinical-grade reports. Allelica PRS algorithms have been developed and validated in multiple prospective datasets that include individuals of all continental ancestries. The reports  which are also available as a white-label package  are delivered to providers through a secure portal or through integration with electronic medical records.Available immediately are tests for coronary artery disease  breast cancer  prostate cancer  Type 2 Diabetes  and Alzheimer's disease. They can be ordered as standalone tests for a single PRS or as panels with multiple PRSs. Allelica plans to expand testing to include more diseases across cardiology  oncology  and women's health.Giordano Bottà  CEO of Allelica  sees the announcement as an important milestone for genomic medicine because it integrates polygenic risk score analysis and reporting into the clinical workflow in a responsible and equitable way.""Prior PRS scores were limited by utilizing databases of largely or exclusively European ancestry. Our priority was to develop a PRS that can benefit everyone  regardless of their ancestries. By providing clinical-grade polygenic risk score testing to people of all ancestries in an accessible and scalable way  we are empowering healthcare professionals to revolutionize healthcare by applying the next generation of clinical genomics "" he said.For information on pricing and how to order the test  contact Allelica at [email protected]What is a polygenic risk score (PRS)?A PRS is a measurement of a person's risk of disease that results from the combined effect of many DNA variants across the genome. It is calculated by combining the effect of these variants  each contributing a small increase or decrease in risk into an overall risk score. This information can be used to stratify individuals based on their risk of disease. By combining PRS with conventional risk factors  Allelica aims to make precision medicine available at scale.About EurofinsEurofins is Testing for Life.

On 3 June 2022  the EU imposed sanctions on the National Settlement Depository (“NSD”)  which effectively blocked the operations between Euroclear and NSD. Euroclear is the operator of CREST  the relevant system for paperless settlement of share transfers and the holding of shares in uncertificated form. As a result of the sanctions  shareholders who hold their shares through NSD (which the Company estimates to be  in aggregate  approximately 22% of the Company's issued share capital)  have been unable to receive dividends and/or take part in any corporate actions of the Company. On 23 June 2022  the Board announced that it was consulting with its legal advisors and regulators to confirm the outcome of sanctions imposed by the EU and evaluate measures that could be taken to re-enfranchise shareholders affected by the sanctions in order to restore their respective economic and voting rights in the Company. The Company has sought potential solutions that would ensure that such measures do not affect the rights attached to Ordinary Shares held by all other shareholders in all respects. Until a solution is found  the Board is not minded to propose any corporate action or dividend in which such a sizeable proportion of the Company’s shareholder base cannot participate. Today  the Board announces its intention to conduct an exchange offer. The exchange offer invites shareholders whose rights have been affected by the sanctions imposed on NSD  subject to fulfilling eligibility criteria  to tender such shares for exchange in consideration for the issuance of a certificated share  on a one-for-one basis. Eligible shareholders who successfully participate in the exchange offer will regain the enjoyment of their rights in the Company  albeit where such rights are evidenced in certificated form. The certificated shares will have the same rights and ISIN as  and be fungible with  the Ordinary Shares in all respects  including ranking equally for dividends. At this time  due to restrictions imposed by securities laws and sanctions applicable to the jurisdictions in which the Company operates  the Board is unable to extend this facility to all shareholders affected by the imposition of such sanctions. Specifically  shareholders who are resident in  incorporated in  established in  or citizens of  Russia (including those with a second citizenship outside Russia) will not be eligible to participate in the exchange offer. Consequently  the Board understands that approximately 11% of the Company's issued share capital may not be eligible for exchange under the Exchange Offer. Under relevant Jersey laws  the manner in which the Exchange Offer is being conducted  requires the approval in general meeting of shareholders. The exchange offer is therefore subject to the passing of all relevant resolutions  at a General Meeting of the Company  by the shareholders who are eligible to vote on the resolutions. Shareholders from whom shares are exchanged are not entitled to vote those shares on certain of the resolutions  however  with respect to those resolutions  they are entitled to vote any shares that are not exchanged in the exchange offer. All resolutions for consideration at the General Meeting will be decided on a poll rather than a show of hands. Shareholders are strongly encouraged  regardless of the number of shares owned  to complete  sign and return the Form of Proxy appointing the Chair of the General Meeting as proxy. This will ensure that the vote is counted even if the shareholder is unable to attend. The Directors consider that the Exchange Offer is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Directors unanimously recommend shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions. Further details of the exchange offer can be found in the combined shareholder circular and notice of General Meeting (the ""Circular"")  which has been published today. The following documents have been posted or made available to shareholders today: The Circular;The Tender Form;Form of Proxy for the General Meeting; andNotice of Availability. The expected timetable for the General Meeting and Exchange Offer is as outlined below: 2022 Exchange Offer opens 22 September Latest time and date for receipt of tender forms and accompanying documentation by 4 p.m. on 6 October Exchange Offer closes 4 p.m. on 6 October Record Date for the Exchange Offer 5 p.m. on 6 October Latest time and date for receipt of Proxy forms1 by 10 a.m. on 10 October General Meeting 10 a.m. on 12 October Announcement of results of General Meeting 12 October Notification to participating shareholders of any other information required 13 October Response to additional information requests of the Company by 4 p.m. on 20 October Notification to participating shareholders of successful tenders 13 October to 11 November Latest time for completion of individual exchanges up to 18 November Announcement of results of each exchange up to 21 November The above times and/or dates may be subject to change by the Company and in the event of any such change  the revised times and/or dates will be notified to shareholders by an announcement through a Regulatory Information Service.

Despite an estimated $17.1 trillion in ""sustainable"" investments at stake  there are few standards for marketing investments that consider environmental  social  and governance factors. Moreover  concerns around greenwashing and exaggerated ESG claims remain a top priority for the SEC as it has stepped up enforcement efforts on this score. Against this background  the SEC has issued two new rulemaking proposals and a request for comment. The comment period for these releases concluded in August.In a new Strategic Perspective entitled ""SEC targets ESG asset managers and fuels critics""  Wolters Kluwer legal experts consider the increasingly vocal opponents to ESG investing  as well as examine reactions to the SEC rule proposals  including the likelihood of adoption and legal challenges.Additionally  the Strategic Perspective includes the views and insights from two of today's leading legal practitioners in the asset management space  Gwen Williamson  partner in the Investment Management group at Perkins Coie  and Howard Sidman  partner in the Financial Markets practice at Jones Day.Who: Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; and Matthew Garza  J.D.  Managing EditorLike a nutrition label  the SEC's proposed ESG disclosures for advisers and funds aim to give investors greater confidence that ESG claims mean something real. There are disagreements as to specifics  but overall there appears to be broad support for the goal of improving ESG information for investors.- Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystStory continuesThe wide range of public comments received in connection with the SEC's ""Names Rule"" demonstrates that the war over ESG investing and its regulation is alive and well. While supporters of the SEC's initiative see the proposals as a means to prevent greenwashing and enhancing investor understanding  opponents view the very same proposed rules as furthering confusion  complexity  and devoid of any corresponding benefits to the public.- Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystFinancial data providers like S&P  Morningstar  and Bloomberg have moved aggressively to meet investor demand for bespoke ESG indexes and other investment products. Their success has earned them attacks from state attorneys general  right-leaning media  Elon Musk  even some academic circles  and now they find the SEC's nose under their tent.- Matthew Garza  J.D.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 30.06.2022 30.06.2021 Var. in % Revenue 491.0 487.6 0.7% EBITDA 42.3 64.7 (34.6)% Current operating income 17.7 50.0 (64.6)% Current operating margin 3.6% 10.3% -6.7 pts Operating income 17.2 50.7 (66.1)% Financial income (10.0) (0.6) - Net result (group share) 1.9 38.0 (95.0)% Net margin 0.4% 7.8% -7.4 ptsINCREASING ACTIVITY IN AN AUTOMOTIVE MARKET THAT REMAINS TURBULENTIn the first half of 2022  AKWEL posted a consolidated turnover of €491.0 m  stable compared to the first half of 2021  but up by 5% on a like-for-like basis  while global vehicle production has remained down over the period (-1.8%1). For the first time  the posted turnover includes the application of the IAS 29 standard (“financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies”) impacting the Turkish subsidiaries  generating a readjustment of +€2.9 m compared to the figure posted in July. In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).A MARKED DECREASE IN HALF-YEAR RESULTSAs noted by the Group when publishing its half-year turnover  the half-year results have seen a significant drop. They have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. For AKWEL  these substantial rises represent a cost increase of €31.6 m over the half year and are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices in line with negotiation periods and conditions.In this context  gross operating surplus was down 34.6% to €42.3 m  and current operating income fell by 64.6% to €17.7 m  i.e. a current operating margin of 3.6% of turnover  down by 6.7 points. Financial income fell by €9.4 m as a result of the application of the IAS 29 standard mentioned above. Tax charges accounted for €5.1 m compared to €12.2 m in the first half of 2021  leading to a net income Group share of €1.9 m (net margin of 0.4%).Story continuesFree cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. After payment of the dividend and loan repayments totalling €22.1 m  the Group’s net cash position (including debts on lease obligations) at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.CREATION OF A THIRD AREA OF EXPERTISEAmong its priorities  the Group has set itself the target of accelerating the development of its product potential in 2022 as part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles while also continuing its existing development of the TAMIC brake particle recovery solution. In addition to fluid management and mechanisms  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts.

The share options have an average vesting period of 2 5 years and will vest in four equal quarterly portions  starting on 1 July 2024. They will vest at the 90 days average closing prices of the GOJXN stock in the period immediately preceding the vesting date. The settlement will be in ordinary shares of the company.This is the third time that share options have been granted under such a scheme. The initial grant was announced in a press release dated 29 October 2020 and then  a second grant announced on 1 November 2021.GeoJunxion also announces the first quarterly vesting of the share options awarded in 2020.

First-half revenues temporarily grew less quickly than expenses  linked in part to the impact of inflation  but above all to absorb the strong growth that the Group expects to achieve over the coming half-year periods and particularly the second half of this year.Extract from the condensed half-year consolidated financial statements approved by the Board of Directors on September 22  2022At 30 June (€m)H1 2022H1 2021Change Value % Revenues 84.0 75.4 +8.6 +11% EBITDA 11.2 14.3 (3.1) -22% % revenues 13.3% 19.0% Current operating income 3.9 8.6 (4.7) -55% % revenues 4.6% 11.4% Operating income 2.5 8.0 (5.5) - Pre-tax income 2.1 6.9 (4.8) - Net income 1.2 5.1 (3.8) -Sustained growth maintained during the first half of 2022The LUMIBIRD Group’s consolidated revenues came to €84.0m at June 30  2022  up 11% (+9% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). This growth is split equally across the Photonics and Medical divisions  although with various deliveries deferred from one quarter to another depending on the business segments.For the Photonics division  the contrasting levels of progress do not necessarily reflect the overall trend. The Industrial and Scientific business lines recorded first-half growth of +2% (to €17.4m)  while the Lidar business climbed +48% to €11.0m  with an increase in sales for both Lidar and OEM systems. The Defense / Space business was stable during the first half of the year (+1% to €10.2m). On May 31  2022  Lumibird Photonics Sweden  which took on the laser rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  became operational. Its first-half contribution was marginal (€0.36m).The Medical division  with first-half growth of +11% (€45.4m)  benefited from an acceleration in sales  particularly in the United States and Japan  where the strengthening of the sales teams and the extension of the product range are reflected in very positive trends.Story continuesContrasting contributions for the two divisionsSummary of results for each division(€m)Photonics Medical 2021-H1 2022-H1 Change (%) 2021 –H1 2022-H2 Change (%) Revenues 34.7 38.7 +11.3% 40.7 45.4 +11.5% Gross margin 23.2 24.7 +6.4% 24.4 27.7 +13.6% % 66.9% 64.0% 60.0% 61.1% EBITDA 6.7 3.7 -43.8% 7.6 7.5 -2.4% % 19.2% 9.7% 18.8% 16.4% Current op. income 3.7 (0.8) -123% 4.9 4.7 -3.1% % 10.7% (2.2)% 11.9% 10.4%The Group’s gross margin rate is still high  at 62.4%  compared with 63.1% in H1 2021. However  this change shows differences for the two divisions  mainly as a result of a price effect  which was more favorable for the Medical division (61.1% gross margin vs 60.0% in H1 2021)  in which the price rises can be passed on almost immediately  while the Photonics division (64.0% vs 66.9%) is held back by a structure of longer-term contracts.During the first half of 2022  LUMIBIRD recorded €11.2m of EBITDA  representing 13.3% of revenues  compared with 19.0% one year earlier  linked to the structuring of the organization looking ahead to a higher level of business in 2022 and beyond. The structuring investments began during H2 2021 and continued in H1 2022. This will enable the Group to deliver the growth and operational performance expected.The temporary contraction in profitability can be seen more for the Photonics division (EBITDA margin of 9.7% vs 19.2% in H1 2021) than the Medical division (16.4% vs 18.8% in H1 2021). This mainly reflects the additional structural costs recorded by the Photonics division to prepare for future growth.First-half income from ordinary operations came to €3.9m  compared with €8.6m for the first half of 2021.Following -€0.4m of financial income and expenses (vs -€1.1m in H1 2021) and €0.9m of taxes (vs €1.8m in H1 2021)  net income totaled €1.2m  compared with €5.1m for the first half of 2021.Cash flow: capex and increase in inventory to prepare for the future(€m) 30/06/2021 30/06/2022 Net cash-flow from operations 8.1 (10.2) Operating cash-flow before interests and tax 14.5 11.0 Change in WCR (7.7) (20.1) Taxes paid 1.3 (1.0) Net cash-flow from investing activities (7.7) (18.2) Capital expenditures (4.8) (10.6) External growth (2.3) (7.2) Other financial assets investments (0.5) (0.4) Net cash-flow from financing activities (1.0) (0.7) Capital increase - - Net loans issuance (0.1) 1.3 Financing cost (0.8) (1.3) Other change (0.1) (0.7) NET CASH FLOW 1 (0.6) (29.1)The combined impacts of the component crisis and the preparations for a strong level of production in the second half of the year resulted in a significant increase in inventory levels (+€11.2m) at end-June. The investments in industrial facilities  including the expansion of the Lannion site  the creation of the Gothenburg site to incorporate the rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  and the preparation of the new site to take on the activities from Les Ulis (€5.2m)  also had a significant impact on first-half capex. During the first half of the year  total cash requirements  representing nearly €30m  were covered entirely by existing cash.Balance sheet positionBalance sheet highlights (€m) 31.12.2021 30.06.2022 Goodwill 70.3 71.1 Non-current assets (excl.

The investments made in the Group’s industrial facilities and the strengthening of its capacity are expected to support a strong level of commercial development over the coming half-year periods.In this context  the Group is confirming its objectives for 2023 reported revenues of €250m  driven by organic and external growth  with its EBITDA margin to continue increasing within a 20%-25% range.Next date:Q3 2022 revenues on October 24  2022 after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers.

This project brought together several European industries such as Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  with the objective of demonstrating the conversion of wood residues into sustainable high-performance components for road and aviation fuels  and thus participate to the decarbonization efforts of ground and air transportation. The project was coordinated by Global Bioenergies and received €13.8 million in funding from the European Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.The project  otherwise known by its full name  “Residual Wood Conversion to High-performance drop-in Biofuels”  was funded under contract n° 792104 through the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA). Beside Global Bioenergies  Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  the project also involved SkyNRG  Peab  Neste  IPSB  Technip FMC  Metex NoovistaGo and the Energie Institut JKU.For this project  sugars from wood were supplied by Sekab and Fibenol.Tino Lassmann  Project Manager at Sekab said: “Our technology to produce second generation sugars is considered to be among the best in the world  especially when it comes to wood as raw material. We are convinced of its many values and possibilities as a way to reducing our environmental footprint. We are proud to have been a part of REWOFUEL together with other leading players in the European bioeconomy and we will continue the cooperation towards a more sustainable world.”Peep Pitk  Chief Development Officer at Fibenol said: “We have been impressed by the performance of Global Bioenergies’ bio-isobutene process with our wood sugars. From 2023 we are producing these wood sugars at 20 000 tons per year capacity at our plant in Imavere  Estonia and looking forward to taking this collaboration to the next level.”Story continuesThese sugars were then processed into high performance sustainable biofuels.Bernard Chaud  Head of Industrial Strategy at Global Bioenergies  said: “We have shown that bio-isobutene produced from second generation sugars from wood can be used to produce both octane booster for road transportation as well as Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”As a result  batches of bio-isooctane  bio-ETBE and sustainable aviation fuel have been produced by Global Bioenergies and then tested by Repsol  Spain’s leading oil company.Javier Marcos González  Project Manager at Repsol said: “The initial tests we conducted were satisfactory. Having these isobutene derivatives from second-generation renewable resources would be a significant step forward for the fuel industry.”Batches of sustainable aviation fuel were produced and transferred to SkyNRG  leader in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Significant work has been coordinated by SkyNRG for the certification of these isobutene derivatives as a sustainable aviation fuel.Maarten van Dijk  Chief Development Officer at SkyNRG said: “For the aviation industry to lower its carbon footprint and meet European targets on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)  we need to keep developing new production pathways  with the aim to unlock new sustainable feedstock sources and increase conversion efficiencies. The REWOFUEL project has proven to be able to do exactly this. We have been impressed by the drive of all partners to make this project a success and by the innovative platform of Global Bioenergies in particular. We are looking forward to the next scale-up step and hope to see Global Bioenergies’ sustainable aviation fuel in commercial aircraft in the future.”Meanwhile  by-products from the ligneous part of wood chips have been incorporated by Peab into successfully implemented bitumen products. Producing bitumen with a better environmental footprint will help to optimise overall road transport performance.The proteins resulting from fermentation are intended to be used in animal feed. The experiments conducted by Metex NoovistaGo in this respect have produced positive results.Finally  the Energie Institut JKU has carried out life cycle analyses of the various segments of this value chain and has quantified the reduction in CO 2 emissions according to different configurations  which can lead to savings of up to 85% compared to the benchmark fossil solution.Meanwhile  engineering efforts have been conducted by Neste   Technip-FMC  and IPSB  a French engineering company specialized in agribusinesses.Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  added: “This REWOFUEL project has brought together players from different fields to assemble an industrial value chain aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of air and road transportation. These sectors are at the heart of the environmental debate: transportation based on thermal engines must switch to renewable energy if it wants to survive in the coming decades. Air transport must also reduce its environmental impact. The players of the REWOFUEL project will maintain relations beyond the project to make the prospects more concrete.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

Our collaboration with AbbVie led to a new €4 million milestone payment following the initiation of the Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant which is expected to finish H1 2023. We estimate our current cash position  combined with the expected $12 million upfront payment from the agreement with Sino Biopharm and the anticipated first €25 million tranche under the EIB credit facility extends our cash runway through Q4 2023. This agreement with Sino Biopharm represents an important milestone and allows us to start the development of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH in a country where the prevalence of NASH is particularly high. We also continued to progress our NASH programs with the screening of the first patient in our LEGEND trial and the clearance of our IND application by the FDA. Looking ahead  we expect even more exciting developments  including with the results from our Phase II clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes planned for Q1 2023. Finally  we are also very pleased to have feedback from the FDA that a single phase 2/3 trial could potentially support a marketing application for odiparcil.”Key financial results for the first half of 2022(in thousands of euros  except share and per share amounts) June 30  2022 June 30  2021 Revenues 67 139 Other income 3 325 2 009 Research and development expenses (29 866) (19 109) Marketing – business development expenses (278) (258) General and administrative expenses (6 847) (5 779) Other operating income (expenses) 131 (607) Net operating loss (33 468) (23 605) Net financial income 3 983 824 Income (expense) tax 19 (355) Net loss for the period (29 466) (23 136) Basic/diluted loss per share (euros/share) (0.72) (0.60) Weighted average number of outstanding shares used to calculate basic/diluted loss per share 40 864 457 38 677 187Revenues for the first half of 2022 reached €0.1 million in line with the same period in 2021.R&D expenses for the first half of 2022 amounted to €29.9 million  mainly driven by the development of lanifibranor in NASH  and were up 56% compared to the €19.1 million for the first half of 2021. This significant increase was driven mostly by the costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH including a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and  to a lesser extent  with the Legend Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes.General and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to €6.8 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 18% compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2021  mainly due to personnel costs linked to the share-based payment expenses  a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and to a lesser extent an increase in compliance fees related to the dual listing of Inventiva securities.Other operating income (expenses) amounted to €0.1 million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€0.6) million in the first half of 2021.Net financial income amounted to €4.0 million in the first half of 2022  mainly linked to foreign exchange gains due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro during the period.The Company’s net loss stood at (€29.5) million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€23.1) million in the first half of 2021.Inventiva’s net cash flow (excluding any exchange rate effect) amounted to (€12.5) million in the six months ended June 30  2022  compared to (€15.0) million in the same period in 2021.Net cash used in operating activities amounted to €26.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €19.8 million for the same period in 2021. This increase in cash use is mainly due to higher R&D expenses. Cash flow from operating activities was also positively impacted in the first half of 2022 by the payment in January 2022 of €4 million milestone payment from AbbVie following the inclusion of the first patient in the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant (formerly ABBV-157) in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  and the 2021 French Research tax credit (“CIR”) for €3.6 million that was received in April 2022.Net cash generated used in investing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to (€0.3) million  compared to €4.7 million3 for the same period in 2021.Net cash generated from financing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to €14.0 million compared to no net cash generated from financing activities over the first half of 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s At-The-Market Program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) on June 15  2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million. One of the loans has been contracted as part of a French state-guaranteed loan facility (""Prêt Garanti par l’Etat"" or “PGE”) with Bpifrance and the two others obtained as part of a French State stimulus economic plan  (""Prêts Participatifs Relance"" or “PPR”) granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale.Over the first half of 2022  the Company recorded a positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of €2.4 million3 versus €3.0 million for the first half of 2021  due to the favourable evolution of USD versus Euro.As of June 30  2022  Inventiva’s cash and cash equivalent position was €76.4 million compared to €86.6 million as of December 31  2021. The cash position including short term deposits1 reach €87 2 million compared to €95.4 million as of December 31  2021.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs and excluding any potential proceeds from the EIB credit facility and any potential additional financial resources  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through Q4 2023 [including the expected €25 million upfront payment from Sino Biopharm and the €25 million from the EIB credit facility3.The financial statements of the first half of 2022 were approved by Inventiva’s Board of Directors on September 21  2022. The statutory auditors have issued a limited review report. For more details  the Half-Year Financial Report is available on the Company’s website at: www.inventivapharma.com .Financial information after closing the accountsOn July 1st  2022  in connection with the EIB credit facility  Inventiva agreed to issue warrants to EIB as a condition to the potential funding of each tranche of the credit facility. During July 2022  the Company rebalanced its foreign currency accounts by taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate of the euro against the dollar; it converted 25 million dollars from current and term accounts into euros.Main areas of progress in the R&D portfolioLanifibranor in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)Inventiva is now targeting the last patient first visit for NATiV3  the Company’s ongoing Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH  for H2 2023  subject to the continuing implementation of measures to accelerate the enrollment rate. The delay we face is primarily due to a higher than originally projected screen failure rate resulting in slower than anticipated enrollment rate. In addition  we continue to see slower than predicted site activation  screening and enrollment due to negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to be unable to conduct clinical trial activities at sites originally located in Ukraine and Russia. Inventiva has implemented and is planning further measures designed to accelerate enrollment and reduce screen failures in the NATiV3 trial  and additional sites have been identified to help compensate for the inability to use sites in Ukraine and Russia.Accordingly  the publication of the topline results of the part 1 of NATiV3 is now targeted for second half of 2025.Completion of the recruitment for the investigator-initiated Phase II trial of lanifibranor in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (“NAFLD”) and with type 2 diabetes (“T2D”)  conducted by Professor Cusi from the University of Florida. However due to a late enrollment of the last patient  the results are now expected in the first quarter 2023.Screening in the United States of the first patient in Inventiva’s LEGEND’s proof-of-concept Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin for the treatment of patients with NASH and T2D. All the 36 sites in France  the United Kingdom  Belgium  the Netherlands  and the United States anticipated to participate in the trial have been qualified. Topline results are expected to be published in the second half of 2023.Completion by the FDA of its safety review of Inventiva’s Investigational New Drug application (IND) for the LEGEND Phase II combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D.Collaboration with AbbVie on cedirogant in autoimmune diseasesReceipt of a €4 million milestone payment from AbbVie in January 2022.

Our collaboration with AbbVie led to a new €4 million milestone payment following the initiation of the Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant which is expected to finish H1 2023. We estimate our current cash position  combined with the expected $12 million upfront payment from the agreement with Sino Biopharm and the anticipated first €25 million tranche under the EIB credit facility extends our cash runway through Q4 2023. This agreement with Sino Biopharm represents an important milestone and allows us to start the development of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH in a country where the prevalence of NASH is particularly high. We also continued to progress our NASH programs with the screening of the first patient in our LEGEND trial and the clearance of our IND application by the FDA. Looking ahead  we expect even more exciting developments  including with the results from our Phase II clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes planned for Q1 2023. Finally  we are also very pleased to have feedback from the FDA that a single phase 2/3 trial could potentially support a marketing application for odiparcil.”Key financial results for the first half of 2022(in thousands of euros  except share and per share amounts) June 30  2022 June 30  2021 Revenues 67 139 Other income 3 325 2 009 Research and development expenses (29 866) (19 109) Marketing – business development expenses (278) (258) General and administrative expenses (6 847) (5 779) Other operating income (expenses) 131 (607) Net operating loss (33 468) (23 605) Net financial income 3 983 824 Income (expense) tax 19 (355) Net loss for the period (29 466) (23 136) Basic/diluted loss per share (euros/share) (0.72) (0.60) Weighted average number of outstanding shares used to calculate basic/diluted loss per share 40 864 457 38 677 187Revenues for the first half of 2022 reached €0.1 million in line with the same period in 2021.R&D expenses for the first half of 2022 amounted to €29.9 million  mainly driven by the development of lanifibranor in NASH  and were up 56% compared to the €19.1 million for the first half of 2021. This significant increase was driven mostly by the costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH including a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and  to a lesser extent  with the Legend Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes.General and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to €6.8 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 18% compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2021  mainly due to personnel costs linked to the share-based payment expenses  a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and to a lesser extent an increase in compliance fees related to the dual listing of Inventiva securities.Other operating income (expenses) amounted to €0.1 million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€0.6) million in the first half of 2021.Net financial income amounted to €4.0 million in the first half of 2022  mainly linked to foreign exchange gains due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro during the period.The Company’s net loss stood at (€29.5) million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€23.1) million in the first half of 2021.Inventiva’s net cash flow (excluding any exchange rate effect) amounted to (€12.5) million in the six months ended June 30  2022  compared to (€15.0) million in the same period in 2021.Net cash used in operating activities amounted to €26.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €19.8 million for the same period in 2021. This increase in cash use is mainly due to higher R&D expenses. Cash flow from operating activities was also positively impacted in the first half of 2022 by the payment in January 2022 of €4 million milestone payment from AbbVie following the inclusion of the first patient in the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant (formerly ABBV-157) in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  and the 2021 French Research tax credit (“CIR”) for €3.6 million that was received in April 2022.Net cash generated used in investing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to (€0.3) million  compared to €4.7 million3 for the same period in 2021.Net cash generated from financing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to €14.0 million compared to no net cash generated from financing activities over the first half of 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s At-The-Market Program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) on June 15  2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million. One of the loans has been contracted as part of a French state-guaranteed loan facility (""Prêt Garanti par l’Etat"" or “PGE”) with Bpifrance and the two others obtained as part of a French State stimulus economic plan  (""Prêts Participatifs Relance"" or “PPR”) granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale.Over the first half of 2022  the Company recorded a positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of €2.4 million3 versus €3.0 million for the first half of 2021  due to the favourable evolution of USD versus Euro.As of June 30  2022  Inventiva’s cash and cash equivalent position was €76.4 million compared to €86.6 million as of December 31  2021. The cash position including short term deposits1 reach €87 2 million compared to €95.4 million as of December 31  2021.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs and excluding any potential proceeds from the EIB credit facility and any potential additional financial resources  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through Q4 2023 [including the expected €25 million upfront payment from Sino Biopharm and the €25 million from the EIB credit facility3.The financial statements of the first half of 2022 were approved by Inventiva’s Board of Directors on September 21  2022. The statutory auditors have issued a limited review report. For more details  the Half-Year Financial Report is available on the Company’s website at: www.inventivapharma.com .Financial information after closing the accountsOn July 1st  2022  in connection with the EIB credit facility  Inventiva agreed to issue warrants to EIB as a condition to the potential funding of each tranche of the credit facility. During July 2022  the Company rebalanced its foreign currency accounts by taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate of the euro against the dollar; it converted 25 million dollars from current and term accounts into euros.Main areas of progress in the R&D portfolioLanifibranor in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)Inventiva is now targeting the last patient first visit for NATiV3  the Company’s ongoing Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH  for H2 2023  subject to the continuing implementation of measures to accelerate the enrollment rate. The delay we face is primarily due to a higher than originally projected screen failure rate resulting in slower than anticipated enrollment rate. In addition  we continue to see slower than predicted site activation  screening and enrollment due to negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to be unable to conduct clinical trial activities at sites originally located in Ukraine and Russia. Inventiva has implemented and is planning further measures designed to accelerate enrollment and reduce screen failures in the NATiV3 trial  and additional sites have been identified to help compensate for the inability to use sites in Ukraine and Russia.Accordingly  the publication of the topline results of the part 1 of NATiV3 is now targeted for second half of 2025.Completion of the recruitment for the investigator-initiated Phase II trial of lanifibranor in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (“NAFLD”) and with type 2 diabetes (“T2D”)  conducted by Professor Cusi from the University of Florida. However due to a late enrollment of the last patient  the results are now expected in the first quarter 2023.Screening in the United States of the first patient in Inventiva’s LEGEND’s proof-of-concept Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin for the treatment of patients with NASH and T2D. All the 36 sites in France  the United Kingdom  Belgium  the Netherlands  and the United States anticipated to participate in the trial have been qualified. Topline results are expected to be published in the second half of 2023.Completion by the FDA of its safety review of Inventiva’s Investigational New Drug application (IND) for the LEGEND Phase II combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D.Collaboration with AbbVie on cedirogant in autoimmune diseasesReceipt of a €4 million milestone payment from AbbVie in January 2022.

Inventiva’s current plans not to pursue odiparcil development directly remain; however  the Company believes this feedback increases the potential for the development of odiparcil for the treatment of MPS VI and continues to review potential options to further development of odiparcil for the treatment of MPS VI  which may include pursuing a partnership – August  2022Entry of Inventiva in the Euronext Tech Leaders segment  a new Euronext segment which includes more than 100 high-growth and leading tech companies across Europe – June 7  2022Signature of a credit facility agreement for up to €50 million  subject to conditions precedent  with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) with the plan to use any potential borrowings under the facility towards Inventiva’s preclinical and clinical pipeline  including to help fund a portion of its Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH  subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent – May 16  2022Next key expected milestonesPublication of the results of the investigator-initiated study with lanifibranor in patients with NAFLD and T2D – now planned for the first quarter of 2023Study completion of Phase IIb trial with cedirogant in patients with psoriasis conducted by AbbVie – planned for first half of 2023Publication of the topline results of the Phase IIa LEGEND of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – planned for second half of 2023Last Patient First Visit of the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – now targeted for second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationGuggenheim Nantucket Therapeutics Conference – September 27-29  NantucketLyon Pôle Bourse – September 28  LyonHealthTech Innovation Days – October 12-14  ParisPortzamparc BNP Paribas Biotech & Santé – October 4  VirtualH.C.

The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signalling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA).ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux / Matthieu BenoistMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

This decision also triggered the automatic conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) issued by Technicolor on September 15  2022 into Technicolor shares which will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind.Main characteristics and timetable of the Distribution in KindA total of 355 343 245 outstanding Technicolor shares will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind  so that  in accordance with the distribution ratio of 1 TCS share for 1 outstanding Technicolor share  the same number of 355 343 245 TCS shares will be distributed  representing 65% of TCS’ outstanding share capital at the time of the Distribution in Kind.The timetable relating to the Distribution in Kind involves the following main steps:the admission of the TCS shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“ Euronext P aris ”) under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022;”) under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022; the date for determining the beneficiaries of the Distribution in kind will be September 28  2022; andthe payment of the Distribution in Kind (delivery of the TCS shares) will take place on September 29  2022.The Board of Directors confirmed that the Distribution in Kind would be charged to the additional paid-in capital account of Technicolor for an amount equal to €1.9539 per share. Such amount results from the global value of TCS  set by the Board of Directors of Technicolor taking into account the work and the conclusions of Finexsi  the independent expert appointed for the purpose of assessing TCS value  divided by the number of TCS shares actually outstanding (i.e.  546 681 915 shares).Considering the current composition of the shareholders’ equity which does not include any distributable profits and reserves other than those resulting from contributions  the Distribution in Kind will be characterized  from a French tax perspective  as a repayment of capital contributions  within the meaning of paragraph 1) of Article 112 of the French Tax Code which does not constitute distributed income.The technical reference price for each TCS share  communicated to Euronext Paris for the opening of the trading session of September 27  2022 also amounts to €1.9539 per share. The technical reference price is merely indicative and may not be relied on to determine the trading price of the TCS shares going forward. In addition  this price of €1.9539 per share should be retained by Technicolor shareholders to determine the tax value of the TCS shares received as part of the Distribution in Kind  in the event of a subsequent sale of these shares.Technicolor is pleased to announce this step which marks a major milestone in the spin-off process announced by the Group on February 24  2022.###Legal DisclaimerThis press release has been prepared by Technicolor SA (“TSA”) in the context of the contemplated spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios (“TCS” or the “Company”) as a result of which TSA ex-TCS is to become Vantiva.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN today announced the name of their joint-venture: Pantera SA/NV  whi…,English French DutchLouvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  22 September 2022 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN today announced the name of their joint-venture: Pantera SA/NV  which they believe will bring new hope for cancer patients. As indicated in the announcement of the R&D strategic partnership  this new company will aim to secure the large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  one of the most promising alpha-emitting radioisotopes to fight cancers. By working towards this large-scale production  Pantera’s ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility of a future innovative cancer therapy based on 225Ac.The complementarity of IBA and SCK CEN’s expertise has been demonstrated by the extensive and comprehensive R&D work that has been conducted during the last year as they work towards being able to produce large volumes of 225Ac. Pantera is now completing the technical feasibility studies before working on the final design and construction of its first facility in Mol  Belgium. Groundbreaking is expected to take place in 2024  with production starting in 2027.Sven Van den Berghe  former Director of the Nuclear Materials Science Institute at SCK CEN  has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer  and Samy Bertrand  former technical leader for theranostics applications at IBA  takes the position of Chief Technical Officer.Bruno Scutnaire  President of IBA RadioPharma Solutions and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pantera  said: “Actinium-225 offers great promise for the treatment of a large variety of cancers  but only very little of the material is available worldwide today. Once cancer treatments based on 225Ac receive approval  Pantera will focus on enabling access to a dependable supply of this promising isotope.”Peter Baeten  Deputy Director-General of SCK CEN and Board member of Pantera  commented: “Launching Pantera was a logical choice for SCK CEN and IBA  allowing the joint-venture to leverage the innovative capabilities of both organizations  whilst utilizing the speed of an autonomous startup necessary in this fast-evolving field.”Sven Van den Berghe  appointed Chief Executive Officer of Pantera  added: “I am excited about the opportunity to help advance the mission of Pantera to bring a new hope for cancer patients by enabling the widespread use of radioisotopes  such as actinium-225  as a basis for promising new radiopharmaceuticals. Pantera offers ’A better fight for life’  potentially bringing an effective and efficient treatment option while maximizing the quality of life of the patients  with the possibility to expand the production to other isotopes in the future.”***Actinium-225 possesses the resounding potential to treat cancers more effectively. Initial results show that the theranostic radioisotope completely eliminates cancer cells  rather than just inhibiting tumour growth. The risk of recurrence also appears to decrease. To date  extensive research and numerous studies are underway which aim to tackle both high prevalence cancers including prostate  lung  colon  breast  pancreatic  blood (leukemia and other rare forms) and kidney cancers  but also rarer forms of cancer like glioblastoma  the deadliest form of a very invasive brain cancer.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 30.06.2022 30.06.2021 Var. in % Revenue 491.0 487.6 0.7% EBITDA 42.3 64.7 (34.6)% Current operating income 17.7 50.0 (64.6)% Current operating margin 3.6% 10.3% -6.7 pts Operating income 17.2 50.7 (66.1)% Financial income (10.0) (0.6) - Net result (group share) 1.9 38.0 (95.0)% Net margin 0.4% 7.8% -7.4 ptsINCREASING ACTIVITY IN AN AUTOMOTIVE MARKET THAT REMAINS TURBULENTIn the first half of 2022  AKWEL posted a consolidated turnover of €491.0 m  stable compared to the first half of 2021  but up by 5% on a like-for-like basis  while global vehicle production has remained down over the period (-1.8%1). For the first time  the posted turnover includes the application of the IAS 29 standard (“financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies”) impacting the Turkish subsidiaries  generating a readjustment of +€2.9 m compared to the figure posted in July. In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).A MARKED DECREASE IN HALF-YEAR RESULTSAs noted by the Group when publishing its half-year turnover  the half-year results have seen a significant drop. They have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. For AKWEL  these substantial rises represent a cost increase of €31.6 m over the half year and are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices in line with negotiation periods and conditions.In this context  gross operating surplus was down 34.6% to €42.3 m  and current operating income fell by 64.6% to €17.7 m  i.e. a current operating margin of 3.6% of turnover  down by 6.7 points. Financial income fell by €9.4 m as a result of the application of the IAS 29 standard mentioned above. Tax charges accounted for €5.1 m compared to €12.2 m in the first half of 2021  leading to a net income Group share of €1.9 m (net margin of 0.4%).Free cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. After payment of the dividend and loan repayments totalling €22.1 m  the Group’s net cash position (including debts on lease obligations) at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.CREATION OF A THIRD AREA OF EXPERTISEAmong its priorities  the Group has set itself the target of accelerating the development of its product potential in 2022 as part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles while also continuing its existing development of the TAMIC brake particle recovery solution. In addition to fluid management and mechanisms  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts. As such  the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles while building on its existing technological expertise and resources  resulting in easier management of product and industrial risks.OUTLOOKS FOR THE 2022 FINANCIAL YEARIn a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year  with the third quarter expected to bring good performance. Against the backdrop of inflation and the continued impact of supply difficulties on manufacturers’ activities  the Group nonetheless remains cautious about forecasts for the sector  despite the fact that the first effects of sales price increases should be seen in the second half of the year.Next press release: turnover for the third quarter of 2022  10 November 2022  after markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles. The Group achieves this by relying on state-of-the-art industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Euronext Paris – Compartment B – ISIN: FR0000053027 – Reuters: AKW.PA – Bloomberg: AKW:FPContactsAKWELGrégory Voisin – Financial VP – Tel.: +33 4 50 56 99 25EKNO – Press RelationsJean-Marc Atlan – jean-marc.atlan@ekno.fr – Tel.: +33 6 07 37 20 44CALYPTUS – Investor RelationsMathieu Calleux – akwel@calyptus.net – Tel.: +33 1 53 65 68 681 Source: S&P Global MobilityAttachment,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,mixed,0.12,0.24,0.64,True,English,"['1st\xa0HALF', 'AKWEL', 'PUBLICATION', 'RESULTS', 'THE', 'TAMIC brake particle recovery solution', 'S&P Global Mobility Attachment', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'net income Group share', 'global vehicle production', 'A MARKED DECREASE', 'Free cash-flow generation', 'battery pack interiors', 'service battery casings', 'Grégory Voisin', 'gross operating surplus', 'net cash position', 'Current operating income', 'sales price increases', 'Next press release', 'Current operating margin', 'independent, family-owned group', 'significant price inflation', 'global automotive market', 'moderate turnover growth', 'existing technological expertise', 'Net margin', 'Financial income', 'strong growth', 'significant drop', 'sales prices', 'Press Relations', 'Net result', 'French English', '1st HALF', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'executive board', 'Audit reports', 'Consolidated data', 'INCREASING ACTIVITY', 'first half', 'first time', 'IAS 29 standard', 'financial reporting', 'hyperinflationary economies', 'Turkish subsidiaries', 'supply limitations', 'North America', 'raw materials', 'substantial rises', 'cost increase', 'negotiation periods', 'Tax charges', 'loan repayments', 'lease obligations', 'THIRD AREA', 'hydrogen-powered vehicles', 'existing development', 'fluid management', 'electric vehicles', 'electronic modules', 'EV flaps', 'cable ducts', 'many opportunities', 'rapid roll-out', 'easier management', 'third quarter', 'good performance', 'continued impact', 'supply difficulties', 'manufacturers’ activities', 'first effects', 'second half', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'Compartment B', 'Financial VP', 'Jean-Marc Atlan', 'Investor Relations', 'Mathieu Calleux', '2022 half-yearly results', 'HALF-YEAR RESULTS', 'half year', '2022 FINANCIAL YEAR', 'consolidated turnover', 'half-year turnover', 'structural components', 'product potential', 'industrial risks', 'AKW.PA', 'The Group', 'Thursday', 'PUBLICATION', 'AKWEL', 'PEA', '19 September', 'millions', 'Var.', 'Revenue', 'EBITDA', 'TURBULENT', 'basis', 'application', 'readjustment', 'figure', 'July', 'energy', 'transport', 'labour', 'line', 'conditions', 'context', '6.7 points', 'dividend', 'debts', '30 June', '31 December', 'CREATION', 'priorities', 'target', 'transition', 'addition', 'mechanisms', 'examples', 'resources', 'OUTLOOKS', 'forecast', 'backdrop', 'sector', 'markets', 'state', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'Contacts', 'Tel.', 'EKNO', 'marc.', 'CALYPTUS', '1 Source', '€', '33 4 50']",2022-09-22,2022-09-22,globenewswire.com

The vesting date is 1 July 2022  exactly 2 years after the options were granted. As a result of this first vesting  a total of 1.407 ordinary GeoJunxion shares will be granted to participants: 1.145 have been issued  262 will be issued at the latest in April 2023. Going forward quarterly vesting will take place on 1 October  1 January  1 April and 1 July.After the 2022 share options award and the first vesting per 1 July 2022  a total of 163.755 share options remains open.The Supervisory and Management boards believe that granting employees the possibility to benefit from the improved operating results of the Company  through the allocation of share options  will lead to stronger engagement and ultimately better performances. This aligns GeoJunxion employees' interests with those of the shareholders  to focus on long-term and sustainable value creation.GeoJunxion also takes this opportunity to communicate that the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the Accounting Year 2021-22 will be published without the opinion of an Auditor. All six PIE/OOB Licensed Auditing Firms in The Netherlands have declined the requests of the Company for auditing services. In view of the significant improvements the company has made in its financial performance  the simplification of its subsidiary structure  risk management and internal control processes  the Supervisory and Management boards were expecting favorable input from at least one auditing firm.GeoJunxion hopes that the proposed legislation regarding the future of the Dutch Accountancy Sector (voorstel voor de Wet toekomst accountancysector) will provide a timely resolution to ensure that next years’ annual accounts will be audited. This legislative initiative includes a proposed process whereby the NBA (Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants)  at the request of the company  can assign a PIE/OOB licensed auditor and determine a reasonable fee for the auditing activities.---END---About GeoJunxionGeoJunxion is the crossroads where fundamental  location-aware content connects with superior  customized intelligence and highly focused innovations to empower exceptional experiences.

First-half revenues temporarily grew less quickly than expenses  linked in part to the impact of inflation  but above all to absorb the strong growth that the Group expects to achieve over the coming half-year periods and particularly the second half of this year.Extract from the condensed half-year consolidated financial statements approved by the Board of Directors on September 22  2022At 30 June (€m)H1 2022H1 2021Change Value % Revenues 84.0 75.4 +8.6 +11% EBITDA 11.2 14.3 (3.1) -22% % revenues 13.3% 19.0% Current operating income 3.9 8.6 (4.7) -55% % revenues 4.6% 11.4% Operating income 2.5 8.0 (5.5) - Pre-tax income 2.1 6.9 (4.8) - Net income 1.2 5.1 (3.8) -Sustained growth maintained during the first half of 2022The LUMIBIRD Group’s consolidated revenues came to €84.0m at June 30  2022  up 11% (+9% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). This growth is split equally across the Photonics and Medical divisions  although with various deliveries deferred from one quarter to another depending on the business segments.For the Photonics division  the contrasting levels of progress do not necessarily reflect the overall trend. The Industrial and Scientific business lines recorded first-half growth of +2% (to €17.4m)  while the Lidar business climbed +48% to €11.0m  with an increase in sales for both Lidar and OEM systems. The Defense / Space business was stable during the first half of the year (+1% to €10.2m). On May 31  2022  Lumibird Photonics Sweden  which took on the laser rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  became operational. Its first-half contribution was marginal (€0.36m).The Medical division  with first-half growth of +11% (€45.4m)  benefited from an acceleration in sales  particularly in the United States and Japan  where the strengthening of the sales teams and the extension of the product range are reflected in very positive trends.Contrasting contributions for the two divisionsSummary of results for each division(€m)Photonics Medical 2021-H1 2022-H1 Change (%) 2021 –H1 2022-H2 Change (%) Revenues 34.7 38.7 +11.3% 40.7 45.4 +11.5% Gross margin 23.2 24.7 +6.4% 24.4 27.7 +13.6% % 66.9% 64.0% 60.0% 61.1% EBITDA 6.7 3.7 -43.8% 7.6 7.5 -2.4% % 19.2% 9.7% 18.8% 16.4% Current op. income 3.7 (0.8) -123% 4.9 4.7 -3.1% % 10.7% (2.2)% 11.9% 10.4%The Group’s gross margin rate is still high  at 62.4%  compared with 63.1% in H1 2021. However  this change shows differences for the two divisions  mainly as a result of a price effect  which was more favorable for the Medical division (61.1% gross margin vs 60.0% in H1 2021)  in which the price rises can be passed on almost immediately  while the Photonics division (64.0% vs 66.9%) is held back by a structure of longer-term contracts.During the first half of 2022  LUMIBIRD recorded €11.2m of EBITDA  representing 13.3% of revenues  compared with 19.0% one year earlier  linked to the structuring of the organization looking ahead to a higher level of business in 2022 and beyond. The structuring investments began during H2 2021 and continued in H1 2022. This will enable the Group to deliver the growth and operational performance expected.The temporary contraction in profitability can be seen more for the Photonics division (EBITDA margin of 9.7% vs 19.2% in H1 2021) than the Medical division (16.4% vs 18.8% in H1 2021). This mainly reflects the additional structural costs recorded by the Photonics division to prepare for future growth.First-half income from ordinary operations came to €3.9m  compared with €8.6m for the first half of 2021.Following -€0.4m of financial income and expenses (vs -€1.1m in H1 2021) and €0.9m of taxes (vs €1.8m in H1 2021)  net income totaled €1.2m  compared with €5.1m for the first half of 2021.Cash flow: capex and increase in inventory to prepare for the future(€m) 30/06/2021 30/06/2022 Net cash-flow from operations 8.1 (10.2) Operating cash-flow before interests and tax 14.5 11.0 Change in WCR (7.7) (20.1) Taxes paid 1.3 (1.0) Net cash-flow from investing activities (7.7) (18.2) Capital expenditures (4.8) (10.6) External growth (2.3) (7.2) Other financial assets investments (0.5) (0.4) Net cash-flow from financing activities (1.0) (0.7) Capital increase - - Net loans issuance (0.1) 1.3 Financing cost (0.8) (1.3) Other change (0.1) (0.7) NET CASH FLOW 1 (0.6) (29.1)The combined impacts of the component crisis and the preparations for a strong level of production in the second half of the year resulted in a significant increase in inventory levels (+€11.2m) at end-June. The investments in industrial facilities  including the expansion of the Lannion site  the creation of the Gothenburg site to incorporate the rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  and the preparation of the new site to take on the activities from Les Ulis (€5.2m)  also had a significant impact on first-half capex. During the first half of the year  total cash requirements  representing nearly €30m  were covered entirely by existing cash.Balance sheet positionBalance sheet highlights (€m) 31.12.2021 30.06.2022 Goodwill 70.3 71.1 Non-current assets (excl.

The investments made in the Group’s industrial facilities and the strengthening of its capacity are expected to support a strong level of commercial development over the coming half-year periods.In this context  the Group is confirming its objectives for 2023 reported revenues of €250m  driven by organic and external growth  with its EBITDA margin to continue increasing within a 20%-25% range.Next date:Q3 2022 revenues on October 24  2022 after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers.

This project brought together several European industries such as Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  with the objective of demonstrating the conversion of wood residues into sustainable high-performance components for road and aviation fuels  and thus participate to the decarbonization efforts of ground and air transportation. The project was coordinated by Global Bioenergies and received €13.8 million in funding from the European Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.The project  otherwise known by its full name  “Residual Wood Conversion to High-performance drop-in Biofuels”  was funded under contract n° 792104 through the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA). Beside Global Bioenergies  Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  the project also involved SkyNRG  Peab  Neste  IPSB  Technip FMC  Metex NoovistaGo and the Energie Institut JKU.For this project  sugars from wood were supplied by Sekab and Fibenol.Tino Lassmann  Project Manager at Sekab said: “Our technology to produce second generation sugars is considered to be among the best in the world  especially when it comes to wood as raw material. We are convinced of its many values and possibilities as a way to reducing our environmental footprint. We are proud to have been a part of REWOFUEL together with other leading players in the European bioeconomy and we will continue the cooperation towards a more sustainable world.”Peep Pitk  Chief Development Officer at Fibenol said: “We have been impressed by the performance of Global Bioenergies’ bio-isobutene process with our wood sugars. From 2023 we are producing these wood sugars at 20 000 tons per year capacity at our plant in Imavere  Estonia and looking forward to taking this collaboration to the next level.”These sugars were then processed into high performance sustainable biofuels.Bernard Chaud  Head of Industrial Strategy at Global Bioenergies  said: “We have shown that bio-isobutene produced from second generation sugars from wood can be used to produce both octane booster for road transportation as well as Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”As a result  batches of bio-isooctane  bio-ETBE and sustainable aviation fuel have been produced by Global Bioenergies and then tested by Repsol  Spain’s leading oil company.Javier Marcos González  Project Manager at Repsol said: “The initial tests we conducted were satisfactory. Having these isobutene derivatives from second-generation renewable resources would be a significant step forward for the fuel industry.”Batches of sustainable aviation fuel were produced and transferred to SkyNRG  leader in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Significant work has been coordinated by SkyNRG for the certification of these isobutene derivatives as a sustainable aviation fuel.Maarten van Dijk  Chief Development Officer at SkyNRG said: “For the aviation industry to lower its carbon footprint and meet European targets on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)  we need to keep developing new production pathways  with the aim to unlock new sustainable feedstock sources and increase conversion efficiencies. The REWOFUEL project has proven to be able to do exactly this. We have been impressed by the drive of all partners to make this project a success and by the innovative platform of Global Bioenergies in particular. We are looking forward to the next scale-up step and hope to see Global Bioenergies’ sustainable aviation fuel in commercial aircraft in the future.”Meanwhile  by-products from the ligneous part of wood chips have been incorporated by Peab into successfully implemented bitumen products. Producing bitumen with a better environmental footprint will help to optimise overall road transport performance.The proteins resulting from fermentation are intended to be used in animal feed. The experiments conducted by Metex NoovistaGo in this respect have produced positive results.Finally  the Energie Institut JKU has carried out life cycle analyses of the various segments of this value chain and has quantified the reduction in CO 2 emissions according to different configurations  which can lead to savings of up to 85% compared to the benchmark fossil solution.Meanwhile  engineering efforts have been conducted by Neste   Technip-FMC  and IPSB  a French engineering company specialized in agribusinesses.Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  added: “This REWOFUEL project has brought together players from different fields to assemble an industrial value chain aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of air and road transportation. These sectors are at the heart of the environmental debate: transportation based on thermal engines must switch to renewable energy if it wants to survive in the coming decades. Air transport must also reduce its environmental impact. The players of the REWOFUEL project will maintain relations beyond the project to make the prospects more concrete.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

Despite an estimated $17.1 trillion in ""sustainable"" investments at stake  there are few standards for marketing investments that consider environmental  social  and governance factors. Moreover  concerns around greenwashing and exaggerated ESG claims remain a top priority for the SEC as it has stepped up enforcement efforts on this score. Against this background  the SEC has issued two new rulemaking proposals and a request for comment. The comment period for these releases concluded in August.In a new Strategic Perspective entitled ""SEC targets ESG asset managers and fuels critics""  Wolters Kluwer legal experts consider the increasingly vocal opponents to ESG investing  as well as examine reactions to the SEC rule proposals  including the likelihood of adoption and legal challenges.Additionally  the Strategic Perspective includes the views and insights from two of today's leading legal practitioners in the asset management space  Gwen Williamson  partner in the Investment Management group at Perkins Coie  and Howard Sidman  partner in the Financial Markets practice at Jones Day.Who: Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; and Matthew Garza  J.D.  Managing EditorLike a nutrition label  the SEC's proposed ESG disclosures for advisers and funds aim to give investors greater confidence that ESG claims mean something real. There are disagreements as to specifics  but overall there appears to be broad support for the goal of improving ESG information for investors.- Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystThe wide range of public comments received in connection with the SEC's ""Names Rule"" demonstrates that the war over ESG investing and its regulation is alive and well. While supporters of the SEC's initiative see the proposals as a means to prevent greenwashing and enhancing investor understanding  opponents view the very same proposed rules as furthering confusion  complexity  and devoid of any corresponding benefits to the public.- Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystFinancial data providers like S&P  Morningstar  and Bloomberg have moved aggressively to meet investor demand for bespoke ESG indexes and other investment products. Their success has earned them attacks from state attorneys general  right-leaning media  Elon Musk  even some academic circles  and now they find the SEC's nose under their tent.- Matthew Garza  J.D.

WainwrightJeroen Van den Bossche - KBC SecuritiesAlex Cogut - Bryan  GarnierDelphine Le Louët - Société GénéraleOperatorGood day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Inventiva 2022 Half Year Results and Webcast. At this time  all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation  there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]Please note that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand over to your speaker  Mr. Frédéric Cren  CEO and Co-Founder. Please go ahead.Frédéric CrenThank you  and welcome  everybody  to this half year webcast. As usual  some disclaimer  we will be making forward-looking statements. So please have a look at our regulatory filings that are available on our website.In terms of speakers  I would say  we have the classical imperative team  myself and Pierre  the Co-Founder of the company; with Michael  our CMO; and Jean  our CFO. But today  it’s a special day for Inventiva given the recent partnership we signed with Sino Biopharm lanifibranor. We are very pleased to have with us Philip Duong  Head of Investment  who will give us an overview of Sino Biopharm activity.In terms of agenda  I will give an highlight of the activity over the past six months and then I will share the floor with Philip  with Pierre  with Michael to provide a pipeline update. We will move to the financial section with Jean  near-term catalyst and then we will open the floor for Q&A.So moving now to the highlight section  we will start first with lani  our Phase III drug in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH. Importantly  a lot of improvement  a lot of key important milestones has been reached in the past six months.In terms of NATiV3  we have expanded in 24 countries and we have now activated to 300 sites in the trial and in the presentation  we will give you a bit more detail on the improvement in terms of site.Very pleased  as I mentioned in my introduction of the very recent collaboration with signing with Sino Biopharm and the expansion of lani in Greater China  a country that we see is really promising from a commercial point of view  given the prevalence of NASH among the Chinese population.Some of the figures or the key figures of the collaboration I will highlight here  the upfront  the total milestone  the royalties and we will get a bit more in detail in the presentation.In terms of recruitment  we have had to announce a delay of the inclusion of the last patient to H2 2023  despite all the improvement in terms of site opening  country opening  site activation  but we see that all the actions that we have launched still have not fully paid out  especially we are still encountering a screening failure higher than expected and this has led to this delay.As you know  we have two other very important Phase II that are ongoing  one that we call LEGEND  which is a combination of lani with empagliflozin. We started the screening  opening sites and randomizing patients as planned  first in the United States  but we also secured the regulatory approval and activation in the other countries where this study is taking place.And then we are pleased with Professor Cusi ability to enroll the last patient in the trial over the summer  a bit later than anticipated. But in terms of results are not expected in H2  but in Q1 2023.Moving now to cedirogant  ABBV-157  there now  I would say  we -- we are expecting with a lot of excitement  the result of the Phase IIb in patients with psoriasis  which are expected in H1 2023.Odiparcil and this is  I would say  another or really an update on this conference. We have had over the summer an important meeting with the FDA  and we are very pleased with the outcome and the feedback provided with the FDA. We know that we can go directly now into children age of five to 15 -- five to 14 with MPS VI. We know that the design we presented to the FDA  which is a single Phase II/III trial can potentially support marketing application. This gives us confidence in the search of opportunities to find a new home for odiparcil and really seeing this feedback provided by the FDA really goes into the right direction for this project.Finally  on the financials  we have been continuing to reinforce our cash position both with dilutive and non-dilutive sources. We have had close to €50 million through a combination of At-The-Market program  which I will remind you is managed by Jefferies and it’s only made of rigorous inquiries and also some non-dilutive funding coming from state-backed financing from the French -- France.We also are very pleased from the European Investment Bank loan that we secured. €50 million loan award agreement of two tranches of 25% and 25%. And we are pleased by the fact that with the upfront that we are expected to receive from our partner Sino  we will be able to secure the first tranche from EIB and this would extend our cash run way in Q4 of 2023.And then  lastly  also the recognition of being selected by Euronext as part of the Euronext Tech Leaders. So in this important index is also a nice recognition of the work that has been done so far.Let’s now move to lani  I just would like first before entering into the details give a bit of an overview of the competitive landscape in NASH. It’s nice to see that positive news happening in the field with recent data from our peer [ph] and others.Now when we look at the landscape  I think all eyes are pointed to the part one of Phase III results that are expected from the waste material and then you see that from this slide  you see that lani really well positioned in terms of timing of when the results will be available and were really part of this limited number of promising compounds that are now in Phase III or planning to enter into Phase III.When we look at the competitor  actually we can divide them into two sections. We have the oral drug and the injectables. When we look at the oral drug  we are really extremely well positioned as the only oral drug that has met really the two important endpoints that are considered by FDA and NDA for approval for NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis.And there is another section where you have injectables with recent data from Cure  where they too have managed to secure hitting both end points with the difference that we highlight here. Our results are based on ITT population that  as you know  is a population that is considered by regulatory authority for approval and there we are going statistical significance on both endpoints  where the results presented by competitors are mostly based on per protocol population or even when you consider Europe from competitors.So now let’s move to lani  and before we get into NATiV3  I would like just to give some of the highlights of the licensing and commercialization agreement we signed recently and then I give the floor to Philip for the presentation of that.Why we decided buy this opportunity is because China and Greater China is in terms of national position very attractive. Of course  vast population  but it also when we look at the prevalence of NASH  there are publication and increasing number of publications that show that the prevalence of NASH among this population is close or sometimes even superior to what is experienced in the United States.Secondly  we are also excited because we -- when we look at who is currently in development in China  we see that only semaglutide out of the compound that I described before is present with a compound that is an injectable and that has not been able to show their Phase IIb in pre-cirrhotic patients  but also in the cirrhotic patients have not been able to show an anti-fibrotic activity. We really believe lani  especially with the partner of the quality of Sino Biopharm is really well positioned to be potentially a leader in this -- in the NASH field in China.In terms of financials  so these are the highlights that have been described in the press release  an upfront and expected upfront of $20 million  followed by short-term clinical milestone that could potentially trigger an additional $5 million. And then globally  the deal contemplates a total of $290 million of clinical  regulatory and commercial life.In terms of royalties  there is a first period of three years where to sustain -- to help on the launch  the royalty will go from high single-digit to mid single-digit and starting from the fourth year from low double-digit to mid single-digit.Then in terms of regulatory  in terms of development strategy  there are several large terms that needs to discussed  especially with regulatory authorities. Two main obviously we see viable. One would be for Sino Biopharm to join the global NATiV3study or the other alternative will be to run an independent study. Important to point out  of course  that all the costs lead to the development in Greater China will be borne by our partners.So  with that  I will give the floor to Philip that will give us a quick overview of Sino Biopharma and then  therefore  moving to page 14 of the presentation.Philip DuongThanks  Frédéric. Just to check if you can hear me.Frédéric CrenPerfectly.Philip DuongPerfect. Okay. Thanks  Frédéric  and thank you for the Inventiva team during the collaboration discussions and sort of a fruitful outcome and we look forward to sort of collaborating with Inventiva in the long-term going forward.So I will give a quick background on Sino Biopharm and I am currently looking at page 14. So Sino Biopharm  for those of you that don’t know Sino Biopharm  we are one of the largest  actually  if not the largest Chinese pharmaceutical group in China.We are listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2003. We currently have a market cap of slightly over US$10 billion and then last year  we had revenues of US$4 billion. Globally  we are ranked the 40th largest pharmaceutical globally by Pharm Exec’s  which is the largest in China  as I mentioned.So through our subsidiaries  we operate a fully integrated pharmaceutical operations from discovery to clinical development to manufacturing and sales. We started up as generics back in the ‘80s and we have moved towards innovation in the last decade. So we have significant R&D capabilities with over 68 innovative assets in the pipeline and seven of those are focused on liver diseases. We also have U.S. and EU qualified manufacturing capabilities in API  small molecules and biologics.I think from a commercialization perspective for lani  it’s quite important to note that we have the largest sales reps -- sales and marketing reps in China with over -- with almost 14 000 reps covering basically the entire Chinese or the entire China. And we both do it through traditional sales channels  so the hospital sales channels  as well as emerging channels such as online channels  as well as the pharmacy chains.In hepatology  we have a proven track record with over 17% market share  and this is from IMS data  and that’s more than double our closest competitor.Sino Biopharm  it’s run -- it’s a -- it’s privately owned by the Tse family. It’s currently run by the second generation. So it’s a very entrepreneurial and agile organization. And our family -- the family owners have their backgrounds from Thailand actually and they have been in the Chinese market since the 1980s.Next page  please  page 15. So the way to think about Sino Biopharm really is  we are a group of operating companies where together we form basically where we provide a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem to the Chinese market.On the top here  we have our pharmaceuticals. So the key partner for Inventiva will be CTTQ  which is on the top left corner and CTTQ itself is a fully integrated pharmaceutical company with key therapeutic areas in liver health and in addition to that oncology and respiratory. We also have a lot of other pharmaceuticals  but we listed our largest ones here.I think  importantly  for collaboration  we are also very large investors in the online health  for example  we are the largest investors in Medlinker. Medlinker is the leading online platform for chronic disease management in China and this is a key channel for liver products in China  where we have over 800 000 doctors on our platform or on this platform.We are also present globally through invoX  which we established in 2020  where we have done recent acquisitions in F-star  Softhale  Fion [ph] and also associated with the Karolinska Institute Group through Karolinska Development. And we are also present in vaccines where we work closely with Sinovac where they developed the corona back vaccine back in 2020.On to the next page  please. So this is basically an overview of the platform we have. I think there’s a couple of important points to note for lani and how we can bring success to this in China. So one  we have a very large clinical development team of over 500 people in China  which will help accelerate clinical enrollments.We also have a lot of manufacturing sites spread across the country in both API and small molecules. So we are quite confident we can lower the COGS  which is important for countries where pricing is not as high like China. And we also have one of -- we have the largest sales team in China with over 13 000 reps covering the entire China  covering about 90% of the hospital channels.And then if we move on to page 17. What I’d like to leave off is  Sino Biopharm through CTTQ has a very  very long history in the liver space starting with hepatitis  as well as liver protection  which is quite an Asian concept  but is quite big in China. Like I mentioned  we have market share that’s more than double our second largest competitor in the hepatology space.We have a lot of blockbusters in the liver space  which is  one is Entecavir Runzhong  which we did $4.6 billion of sales in 2018  which was basically unheard of for in this space. We also have an innovative product called Ganme [ph]  which is basically -- mostly used against -- usually for hepatitis B patients  but it’s the nation concept of liver protection  which is actually closely quite linked to NASH  where we did $20 -- $2 billion of sales last year and has been consistently growing since we have launched this product 10 years ago. We also have a healthy innovative pipeline within this space  where we think there could be potential opportunities to establish or to explore combination treatments in the future.With that being said  I think that’s the introduction on Sino Biopharm and I will pass it back to Frédéric for the rest.Frédéric CrenYes. Yeah. Thank you  Philip. So I think everybody can understand why we are very excited by this partnership and the opportunity that it opens up. So moving back to NATiV3. So where do we stand? The progress now  24 countries are included in operation and we have secured full regulatory approval on 23 out of that. We have closed activities in Ukraine and also decided not to move forward in Russia.Where we stand if this is a situation at the end of August? So we have qualified 463 sites and 297 are activated. So really strong progress there. However  if you follow my introduction  if we look at the impact from the war in Ukraine and Russia  the COVID pandemic  we see that despite the implementation of the measure that has led to the increase of the number of sites  we are still facing a recruitment that is behind our expectation and this is mainly due to a little of ray [ph] that is higher than anticipated and this really led to the communication last night that we see that now the last patient first visit for the Part 1 is now targeted for the second half of 2023 versus H1 2023 as previously commuted.That for NATiV3 and now -- I will now hand over to Michael  who will give you an update on the two phases that are ongoing  so the one led by Professor Cusi in the combo static called LEGEND.Michael CooremanThank you  Frédéric. As you mentioned  there are two studies that are in Phase II. One is on slide 20  a study that aims to provide more information on data on the mechanism of action of lanifibranor as a fund agonist in patients who have not only have type 2 diabetes to conditions that occur often in the same patient  given the similar underlying disease biology.Specifically  this study aims to show that lanifibranor decreases intrahepatic triglyceride content  improves any cirrhosis  specifically the insulin sensitivity thereof and also insulin sensitivity in hepatic and muscle tissue  which is a core mechanism of action of Hippo signaling  endogenous hepatic glucose production and markers of cardiometabolic health. The investing the principle is one type study and sponsor and principal investigators  Ken Cusi at University of Florida.The total of 34 patients with that of the type 2 diabetes are enrolled and to have reference values. There are also data from 10 healthy individuals who are non-obese and whose data will serve as reference. These volunteer participants do not receive investigational compounds. Sample size is calculated on the effect size of more than 50% reduction of intrahepatic fat  which is also based on data that are available for how [inaudible] work in this indication -- in this finding.The primary endpoint is a change in intrahepatic triglyceride 25 by MR spectroscopy and so baseline compared to 24. And in addition  there’s a lot of secondary endpoint that will provide a kind of a comprehensive picture on how lanifibranor improves metabolic health in these patients  starting from insilicosystems  NAFLD solution defined as patients with a very low intrahepatic triglyceride content  change in hepatic fibrosis measured with elastography  MRI-based and ultrasound based MRE and FibroScan  as well as biomarkers  and of course  also safety and tolerability markers. The results will be expected for early 2023. All patients are enrolled. Due to a little delay the last patient started  the results will be expected in the first quarter of 2023.So go to the next slide  slide 21. This is the so-called LEGEND study is an acronym and it is essentially a combination of lanifibranor and SGLT2 inhibitor  empagliflozin in patients who have NASH and type 2 diabetes.The rationale for the combination of these two compounds is very strong as SGLT2 inhibitors provide additional metabolic benefits to lanifibranor. And we  therefore  are a very attractive way to explore the additional benefits of this combination in the proof-of-concept setting.The study is done with two principal investigators  Dr. Dr. Michelle Lai  Harvard and Onno Holleboom from the University of Amsterdam. We have around 40 sites  which are in four countries in the U.S.  in the U.K.  in the Netherlands  Belgium or France of five countries. The FDA -- the IND is open. The study has started. The first site was activated in the first half of 2022 and we expect topline results in the second half of next year.Patients -- adult patients with type 2 diabetes and NASH are to be included in the primary efficacy outcome is HbA1c  which is a mark  of course  of insilicosystems and metabolism  which is also relevant for -- in the disease pathway of NASH in addition to type 2 diabetes.And here  also  we have a broad spectrum of secondary efficacy measures  including imaging -- MRI-based imaging  which will give information about the distribution of that adipose tissue naturally in the liver and also an overall composition of fat  which is quite important in evaluating to what extent that is related to insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity. In other words  metabolically unhealthy or healthy adipose tissue of glucose and lipid metabolism markers of inflammation  body weight and other safety and tolerability issues  of course.So wealth of data. The study will enroll 63 patients and the treatment is half a year. So randomized study  randomized double blind for lanifibranor and placebo  open label for the composition  lanifibranor plus empagliflozin is one ARM  lanifibranor alone is another arm and placebo is the third arm.Next slide  mentioned aside  run in these five countries in Europe and the United States. We have the study approved in France and U.S. and its running better and submissions are completed in the remaining countries. So we expect topline results in 2023 -- in the second half of 2023.So  overall  when you go to slide 23  in the next coming years  we will have a regular announcement of availability of data on the efficacy of lanifibranor in clinical settings to start with in the first quarter of next year  the data from the study run by Cusi in Florida  topline results from the Phase II trial in patients with NAFLD type 2 diabetes.Then the year thereafter in the second half of 2023  so the same year  in the results -- the topline results from the LEGEND study in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes  the combination of lanifibranor with impact lymphoid and then in the second half of 2025  the topline results of Part 1 of the current pivotal NATiV3 study currently ongoing  of course  and wells in its way in patients with NASH and significant fibrosis F2 and F3. And that’s it for me. So…Frédéric CrenThank you  Michael. And I will give a very brief update on ABBV-157  here again the -- our again [inaudible] security in Phase IIb with our partner AbbVie. We were last week in Chicago and we are extremely pleased with the progress of this molecule. You know that we are extremely excited by this mechanic of action. We are again has a possibility really to suppress IL-17F gene expression  but as you know  is a validated target in clinic.Clearly  the potential of a once-daily orally available ROR gamma with a target product profile that  as you know  that we have said in the past  what we are targeting is the Humira efficacy with better safety in the end of a company like AbbVie that has such a strong expertise in optimal disease  really something that really excites us and we really think we have a little to do here in our pipeline.The meeting with other day in Chicago was really great. We see that the real excitement around this molecule. Now we have to wait for the Phase IIb trial that is currently ongoing. This is 200 patients  15 weeks  a trial in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and that the primary end point  there is a measurement of 75.Also worthwhile noting that in parallel  AbbVie has launched a Phase I that is needed to start Phase III  so too positive to see that plans are in place to in the case of success. And then I would say that for us now just need to wait for the results of the Phase IIb  which as indicated in clinicaltrials.gov  the results -- the trial is expected to end in Q1 2023  so result -- we should have the results in the first half of next year.We also  of course  we are excited is also because we are financially rewarded by the mix of milestone  but especially royalties that start from mid-single digits and can reach double-digit level. And of course  this drug is approved. We are convinced  given making of action  given the potential of the market in the autoimmune space and the capabilities of our partner AbbVie that this product has the potential to really be a meaningful source of revenue in the future for Inventiva.So that was the very AbbVie update and let’s move to odiparcil and Pierre will give you latest on this program.Pierre BroquaYeah. Thank you  Frédéric. So  yes  we are very excited to update you on the odiparcil program. But I just like to start with a recap on MPS and [inaudible] action on Page 27. So as you know  MPS are innovative disorders that are characterized by the dysfunction of lysosomal enzymes  which are required for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans  the GAGs. Within this family of disorders  MPS VI is caused by mutation in ERT SBT [ph]  which encodes the enzyme leading or responsible for the degradation of DS and CS. So MPS is actually an accumulation of DS  dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in all cells of the body.So then  of course  MPS is a devastating multisystem disease  which is actually leading to a reduced life expectancy up to only the teens or early 20s in the more rapidly advancing cases up to 40 or 50 in slower progressing cases. So today  there is one treatment approved  an enzyme replacement therapy  Naglazyme  which  however  has several limitations due to its poor distribution in the body. And there is  therefore  still a very important medical need for treatment of MPS VI  even in patients that are actually treated with ERT.So the next slide  please. So we have odiparcil  odiparcil is a small orally available molecule that decreases the CS and DS type of GAGs accumulation in disease cells. And this  as you recall  a very unique GAG clearance mechanism of action.On top of that  odiparcil is  of course  all available  well distributed and can penetrate difficult to meet tissues including cartilage bone and cornea  offering  therefore  an opportunity to address the clinical manifestations that are currently not treated by ERT.So we now have conducted a Phase III study called iMProveS in adult MPS VI patients that were at an advanced stage of disease. And in this study  odiparcil found to be safe and to provide beneficial effects in both ERT treated and ERT-naive MPS VI patients and this only after a short treatment duration of six months. Therefore  we believe that there is a conversional for further assessment of odiparcil efficacy in younger patients.Next slide  please. So  overall  odiparcil has a favorable safety profile shown in multiple clinical trials. As you maybe remember  the component is developing previous indication where more than 1 500 patients have been exposed to the drug.On top of the  I would say  very clear efficacy data in MPS VI patients or mice model that we have also published. We see odiparcil will be a potential game changer  has being the first oral therapy with the ability to broadly address a wide range of clinical manifestations in MPS VI patients. This market  as you know  is close to a $400 million market. In addition to that  odiparcil has also the potential to treat other MPS  where CS and DS accumulate such as MPS I  MPS II  MPS IVA and MPS VII.So in MPS VI  next slide  odiparcil aims at improving the treatment options for both ERT eligible and ineligible patients  either as an add-on to ERT or as a monotherapy. We could potentially see the treatment as potential first-line therapy in combination with ERT in ERT eligible patients  also as a monotherapy in ineligible patients.So now let’s dive into the recent FDA discussion. As you recall also from a regulatory perspective  we have obtained odiparcil orphan drug  Fast Track and Rare Pediatric designations and today I would like to report on the recently held FDA meeting that took place last month to discuss the regulatory path for approval  including many objectives  patient population  endpoints  a clarification that we believe will be helpful for future partnership discussions.Next slide  please. So in short  the feedback from FDA was that the single Phase II/III study of one year duration in MPS VI patients five years to 15 years of age would support five-year filing. This pivotal study that we call Prodigy [ph] would be double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled  evaluating the ability of one dose of odiparcil administered in combination with ERT versus placebo in combination with ERT and this to enhance mobility is a primary objective and to improve entrance while reducing fatigue and pay. These are secondary objectives. Primary endpoint will therefore be a 6-minute resistance and secondary endpoints would be 3 minutes per line and pain assessment through a questionnaire.This first part will be followed by a 12-month safety expansion with all patients under odiparcil plus ERT. The study contemplates to enroll 15 pediatric patients for 12 months  potentially leading to the filing of odiparcil approval as ERT or in combination with ERT in patients five years of age 12. So following this feedback from FDA  we believe that odiparcil will represent an attractive partnering opportunity. Thank you.Frédéric CrenThank you  Pierre. Let’s move to the last slide before we wrap up. So we can move with Jean to the update on financials.Jean VolatierSo let’s go through the key financial figures. So -- and you will see it’s quite straightforward in continuity of the prior financial period. I will be happy to answer your question at the end of the meeting.On this slide  one important  obviously  information is the cash position. So as you can see  we maintained a reasonable level of cash versus the end of 2021. So we are at €87 million versus €95 million at the end of last year. So this prior to the consequences of the Chinese deal was allowing us to operate until Q2 2023  and as disclosed and explained the deal with the Sino Biopharm allowed to gather the conditions for reaching the first tranche of the EIB  and therefore  allow us to extend the cash runway through Q4 2023.Let’s go through next slide with the key evolution of the profit and loss account and cash flow. As I said  so no revenues for this semester. As a reminder  Inventiva recorded €4 million milestones from AbbVie in the accounts of last year. But we have been paid early this year and then have a positive effect on our cash flow for this semester.As usually  the key and stable information with regards to R&D investments  which represent more than 80%  still of our total OpEx is the increase in the R&D plus 56%  and it’s still due to the acceleration of the NATiV3 studies primarily and as you have seen some additional studies plus in a lesser extent.If you remember  we have this year a full semester of operation of our U.S. affiliate versus only one quarter in 2021  a reasonable increase [Technical Difficulty] due to the increase in personnel cost by due to the charge related to the share-based payment  which is non-cash payment and also a full semester [Technical Difficulty] last year.The most important impression  as you know  is the cash position  as I said  so €87.2 million without the consequence  as I said  of the Sino Biopharm deal and EIB first tranche. So the net operating cash flow reflects the evolution of the R&D expense essentially  and in a lesser extent  the G&A evolution.The net financing cash flow is very important for the semester. We have succeeded in activating for the third time our ATM program with close to €15 million and we have been able to mobilize soft -- what was soft loan in the back stage loans for €5.3 million. We also took benefit of the favorable evolution of the dollar versus euro with a positive cash impact of €2.4 million.I think this is the key information  again  if you have other questions at the end  I’d be happy to answer. Thank you.Frédéric CrenThank you  Jean. The last slide before we open to Q&A. So what are the next milestone  here is the list of what have been achieved so far. And I would say that we have in front of us two important clinical readouts  one concerning lani  at the beginning of the year  Q1  the results from the study led by Professor Cusi patients with type 2 diabetes in NAFLD and then  of course  the data from the Phase IIb that is currently carried out by our partner AbbVie this year is really  I would say  will be the -- very important event for our company next year.With that  let’s move to Q&A  as the operator will provide you the -- how to ask your question both via the platform or via the telephone.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question coming from the line of Ed Arce from H.C. Wainwright. Please ask your question. Your line is open.Ed ArceHi. Good morning. Can you hear me?Frédéric CrenPerfectly Ed.Ed ArceWonderful. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the deal with Sino Biopharm. I have three questions. First  you mentioned the recent results of Akero were a protocol versus ITT  which is more of a standard and the basis for your results in the Phase IIb. I was wondering if you could talk about how you view the differences of that data and as well your perspective on how the regulatory agencies view the differences of those two  that’s first? Second is  I wanted to ask if -- you mentioned with the Sino Biopharm deal that they could either join NATiV3 or decide to conduct its own Phase III trial. And I wanted to know if they -- if you and Sino decided to have that joined to NATiV3 trial  would that have any impact on the time line? And then lastly  the top line NASH results from NATiV3 looks like it’s still about three years away  second half of 2025  which based on your most recent runway creates about a two-year funding gap. So I am wondering if there are any additional opportunities for funding say from the results from AbbVie or perhaps initial funding from a future partnership on odiparcil? Thanks so much.Frédéric CrenThank you  Ed. So very  very cumulative question so oh I got to take off sorry. I will try again  sorry  can you hear me?Ed ArceYes. I can hear you fine.Frédéric CrenOkay. Sorry  we just had a terrible echo here. So  on the first question  maybe Pierre and Michael will complete for me  the difference protocol versus ITT. I just think it’s important just because of Akero produce some slides where they used and compared the Phase II data  I think it’s important also to have a complete picture. And from what they said in their own presentation is that if they had used an ITT approach  they would have lost statistical significance on -- I think  on the NASH resolution one.And therefore  in that case  we could claim to be the only drug that has made will lead to both a regulatory endpoint. But nevertheless  I just think it’s important that we retain that because on the Phase III  what the regulatory authorities will be looking is the data from the ITT and the fact that we were able in the Phase IIb to be sustained on that population give us more confident or even greater confidence that we will succeed in our Phase III.Then I will ask the second question and Philip don’t hesitate to complete my answer. So your question was  in the event biopharm joins the NATiV3 would that have an impact on the time line. I would say that it’s too soon to mention that. It will certainly contribute and help in our recruitment effort because the patient that would be recruited in China would account in the patient needed for Part 1. But we are prudent and therefore  we do not -- we don’t take this upside in our projection. And then last  I don’t know  Philip  anything you would like to add to this?Philip DuongYes. Thanks  Frédéric  and thanks for the question  Ed. I think in terms of our clinical enrollment capabilities  I think we can quite quickly enroll patients. Obviously  it’s subject to multiple factors  simply CD regulatory approval and such.But I think once or if we do go down the route of a global multicenter trial. I think we are quite confident that our capabilities to sort of quickly open sites as well as leverage scale networks to sort of recruit the patients quite quickly to sort of not delay the timetable from Inventiva site.Frédéric CrenThanks Philip and then last question about the two-year funding gap until the Part 1 read out. I think there are two ways to read it -- it’s a glass of LT. We can also read given the difficult times in the market if Inventiva secured financing until Q4 2023.And also as you mentioned  I think we have several opportunities so that are both dilutive and non-dilutive -- on the dilutive  we have an APM open  and we have always benefited from the support of front enrollment.And then on the non-dilutive side yes  we are excited by the discussion with the FDA for the feedback  which according to us reinforces the rationale for odiparcil  continue develop in MPS VI and we have not changed our strategy. We do not want to develop odiparcil on our own. We think it’s a good candidate for partnering. Will we succeed it too soon to say  but the FDA feedback gave us confidence.And then also  I think lani is a very attractive compound  and there are other geographic areas beyond China where the bartering would make a lot of sense. And then finally  as the partnership in the short-term  we -- if they decide to move into Phase III  of course  this will trigger a milestone. But always like to receive it  but you know that we have always said that in this contract  what is really material are the royalties and not the milestone.But if next year  the program moving to Phase III  Inventiva will have a very promising asset like lani NASH and the drug in Phase III in psoriasis  maybe potentially other [inaudible] disease indication finance and carried out by AbbVie  so I really think an interesting value proposition to investors.Ed ArceGreat. That’s all right. Thank you.Frédéric CrenThank you. And I think we were expecting a question from Jeroen and we don’t hear him?Jeroen Van den BosscheHello.Frédéric CrenYes. We can hear you now.Jeroen Van den BosscheHi. Sorry  there seems to be echo here on the line. Congrats also from KBC with regards to the Sino Biopharma deal and with the results for odiparcil  maybe from my end and following up on the Akero a little bit. NASH clearly has been a little bit more of a challenge over the past years? Do you see renewed interest from investors  do you believe that also with more and more people refocusing on it  there will be non-invasive  let’s say  like diagnostic methods coming online? And maybe one last question -- you guys can give me or us an estimate of the NASH size in China?Frédéric CrenAll right. On the first question  I would say yes  in the sense that good news from other competitors like Akero and other are a positive for the space. I think we -- the failures of other compounds have -- and I don’t think it was justified shed a negative light on the successes of other and include that learning that.So yes  it’s very positive to see other companies succeeding because this provides a positive sentiment on the space and they really hope that continues. And this is why we are looking and cheering for Madrigal success in their face. On the non-invasive  maybe  Michael  do you want to just give an update on the recent progress there?Michael CooremanAbsolutely. So  yes  and our focus on the FDA  the FDA this data requires histology as the target efficacy endpoint. I should say then that in the past  [inaudible] been quite some progress in the -- on data that are being generated  both from imaging and biomarkers and algorithms based on those as non-invasive markers for the disease and for response to treatment. And in these discussions to what extent they will be complementary to or in the future  be replacement for histology.We are all active part of that discussion  including our academic colleagues  R&D industry as well as the FDA  and I think that’s very good news. I think with regard to lanifibranor specifically  what gives us confidence is that lanifibranor given this mechanism of action has shown strong efficacy on the histology endpoint  but also in a broad range of biomarkers that reflect the disease as well. So I think in -- for both histology and IT  I think  lanifibranor has a very strong position.Frédéric CrenThank you. And the last question on the NASH size market in Greater China. Personally  I have not seen any forecast or any public data. The only data I have seen is what we mentioned before is about the prevalence that seems to be like higher or similar to the one in the U.S and then given the size of the Chinese population that makes it a very attractive market. I don’t know  Philip on your side  have you seen anything public on the market potential or anything you can disclose?Philip DuongYes. Sure. So  as you know  whenever we improved NASH treatments  a bit of an echo I will just go ahead. Yes  so without any NASH treatments  I think there’s quite a large range of numbers that we have seen from as low as sort of 2% to even as high as 6%  7%.But like Frédéric  like he mentioned  I think it’s just the sheer size of the population with over 1.3 billion population that translates to quite a high potential NASH patients. We have seen numbers being thrown about 50 million patients or so. But again  without sort of any approved treatments  those numbers are hard to verify. But it is quite a large market in China for NASH.Frédéric CrenWell  thank you. And then we have a question from Alex from Bryan  Garnier. The floor is yours.Alex CogutI hope you can hear me well. Yes thanks for taking my questions. So I was just wondering if you could share a bit more on the screening failure in the Phase III. Like what would be the rate of failure you are seeing and kind of what measures are you introducing to reduce that failure. And are you already seeing kind of results in terms of faster enrollment on the back of those measures?Frédéric CrenYes. Enrollment  thank you. The screen failure rate is high  and we have seen that  first of all  happening across the type field of NASH clinical studies. So I don’t think what I know actually that all data are not in aberration with others  which is reassuring.So NASH is as many other indications challenging. Having said that  we actually have advanced a lot of efforts to detail the reasons for the screen failure rates -- and basically from satisfied every individual case.And overall  there are a couple of reasons  which I have to do with lab values of course  and also with the histology reading  which as you know  seen quantitative scoring system. And we have three expert pathologists. I think they are among the very best  if not the best in the field. We spent a lot of time bringing it together in the formal sessions that they can align the reading before we start looking at biopsy in our part of the study.And we have now also vented that’s recent  so it’s not possible to say what the impact will be  but I can estimate that from our previous results  of course  a system whereby each biopsy is set by two of these pathologists independent of each other. And if there is a non-alignment  say one scores fibrosis stage 3 and the other one at 4 or at 2 and at 1  then there’s a tiebreak. When tiebreak automatically will then define what score is align.And if I look back to the data that we had previously that will alleviate or increase the screen failure rate to a certain extent. In addition to that  we pay a lot of attention to providing guidance to sites to diagnose prescreen patients so that the likelihood that when a patient enters the screening process that the patient ends up being a screen failure is reduced.And with that  I think we have looked at published data as well as our own data. What are the criteria that would have the highest effect and it’s not -- it’s well known that aminotransferase  specifically as C phase [ph] we call that. So we have adapted our inclusion criteria accordingly  and will implement that as an amendment. And we can anticipate that these measures will have a measurable effect on the screen failure rate going forward.Alex CogutGot it. That’s very helpful color. Thank you. And just a question on cedirogant if I may it seems like AbbVie is pretty excited about the compound given the speed of recruitment in the Phase IIb. But I don’t believe they have actually released Phase Ib results  which makes me believe there may be waiting it for AAD in March  but then they might also have the Phase IIb data. So do you have any insights into kind of their plan for releasing Phase Ib or Phase IIb data next year?Frédéric CrenWell  you are right  the Phase Ib data has not been that if they share. The next important congress is in the early AAD in March opposite of March. That could be a date where they could publish for the results until the abstract is available is difficult to confirm that. And in terms of plan of it look more education of the Phase IIb  I don’t think this has been decided yet.Alex CogutGot it. And on the back of the Phase IIb  are there any specific milestones you would expect in 2023  let’s say  maybe related to finalizing the study or relating to good results  obviously or is it related then to a start of Phase III? How can we think about that?Frédéric CrenNo. It’s related -- the milestones are -- directly combined for us will be beginning the initiation of the Phase III.Alex CogutOkay. Okay. That’s all from me.Frédéric CrenIn any indication -- we don’t need to be psoriasis if we -- first patient enrolled in the first Phase III.Alex CogutOkay. Understood. Thank you. That’s it from me.Frédéric CrenThank you. And then Delphine Le Louët from Société Générale is also online  and so very happy to.Delphine Le LouëtYes. Hello. Hi. Good afternoon  good morning  everyone. Different question from my side  can you Fred  can you let us know exactly how many patients have been screened and enrolled so far or as of end of August  just for us to get an idea of the rapidity of the inclusion. And what sort of effectively ramp up  we can expect till the end of the last patient first visit in order to prevent any further delay or just to get an idea of what’s your goal and how we position ourselves towards that? Second question  deals with according to your knowledge of your Chinese partner and the Chinese market  can you give us a sort of a probability of what would be the scenario choose by the -- let’s say  by the Chinese? Would that be to go for a Chinese study or to come up and add up ramp for Chinese patient within the NATiV trial? And finally  I was wondering  can you remind us the other condition that you have from the EIB to unlock the other €25 million envelope? Thank you very much.Frédéric CrenAll right. To your first question about figures in terms of number of screen  screen failure all of that  we are not communicating on that. This is not done by our competitors. So we want to preserve our competitive advantage versus others  because -- the competitive market  what we can say that if you look at the number of sites  countries  so that we are  we say -- online we have our expectation  and that was not the case.The last time we had a webcast where we were facing a delay in terms of regulatory approval and in terms of opening of sites. So that was not the case. So that how that has been sort. And now clearly  for our team and ICON  is to go back to what Michael said is  we need to improve this screen failure rate that is high for us it’s high for everybody in the market  but we are fully care about them and we need to bring it down.On your second question about what the feedback from the China regulatory authorities will be on the approach. I frankly do not know because I have no experience with them. Maybe  Philip  you want to comment on that  but maybe right now  it might be a bit too speculative I don’t know - what would you say?Philip DuongYes. Thanks  Frédéric  and thanks for the question. I think it’s a bit too early to tell  but I think we will do what’s best for the quickest launch in China as well.Delphine Le LouëtYes. I can imagine. But the idea is to know if Sino Biopharm has already been involved in such a deal. And so what was the solution chosen for the other company  if they were involved in such a deal partnering out-licensing  I mean licensing the right for Chinese market?Philip DuongApologies  I didn’t quite get the question. Is it how you would?Delphine Le LouëtNo. I was wondering if Sino Biopharm already shared with you some of their experience from the past from other licensing deal they may have or any view that they have or any confidence that they have towards the regulatory passing in China?Philip DuongYes. Sure. So I think global multi-centers are joining our Phase III trial in China is in other therapeutic areas has been done before. And it’s -- I won’t say it’s common  but it’s done before and it’s resulted in sort of good risk -- it’s done well.But unfortunately for NASH  not that it’s never -- not that it’s been done before  but it’s new. So I think it will be the first global multicenter trial in NASH where if we do it  I think it will be a landmark situation. So for other therapeutics there is -- it’s been done before we have experience with that.Delphine Le LouëtOkay. And Frédéric the last question regarding the financing  yes?Frédéric CrenYes. For AAD the second tranche I will let Jean describe the competition.Jean VolatierGood afternoon  Delphine.Delphine Le LouëtHi  Jean.Jean VolatierYes. We have disclosed all information with regards to the CPs and the -- CPs condition precedent. I will not go in state  but you can go in the disclosures that have been made. The total condition to reach the second tranche in one year  more than one year from now because the objective is to raise second tranche one year after the first one is to get a cash injection of €70 million  okay including the initial cash injection that is required for the first tranche.Clearly speaking  we match we are on the way to match -- we have matched €9.5 million with ATM. We will match the $12 million euro with China. So mathematically  we missed €50 million to bridge.And as we have explained in terms of financial strategy  we will get other opportunities to bridge this €50 million. There are also other CPs like  as you may know  the warrant side of the deal because there are some issuance -- of warrants for each tranche.And there are some operational conditions also relating to mix of -- activated sites at the time of the raising  or a number of randomized patients  which is quite first reasonable in terms of negotiation with AAD and attainable within the current plan of development.Frédéric CrenThe last CP  which we have met  was to sign a partnering that we have done or as we entering Phase III. And I think we are [inaudible]. We hope that we will be -- able to meet the second potential condition.Delphine Le LouëtThank you.Frédéric CrenVery good. And then we have no more question on the phone  but we have some questions on the platform. Some have been covered  one has not been covered -- that can we disclose what  are the milestones beyond the €5 million [inaudible] this unfortunately we can. And then there is a question about the YAP-TEAD program  where do we stand there? And then I will turn to Pierre for our…Pierre BroquaYes. Sure. Thank you for the question. So yes  we are also very excited with the progress made with this project. We are actually working on very specific molecules  three compounds that are now into -- in vivo evaluation phase. And this compound differentiates quite well from other competitors like from Viva  Akina [ph]  even Novartis in the middle inspection and the outcome being that those compounds are capable of inhibiting the proliferation of sales  the proliferation of which is dependent on the update.But also tested  and that makes a big difference our profiling and as it is something that’s communicated earlier this year. We have demonstrated that our Akina compounds acting on the small pockets of FTs are actually preventing the FTs association and preventing the proliferation of FT dependent sales  but are capable of preventing the proliferation of past-dependent sales. Our lead compounds do both  which opens the opportunity to address many more cancers and those are contact currently in vivo testing and looking forward for the in vivo data.Frédéric CrenThank you  Pierre. I think we have no more questions. Therefore  I would like to thank all of you for participating for your question. I would like to thank Philip for staying up late now because it’s -- more than 9 p.m. in China.Thank you and thank you for making yourself available. I think it was important to describe the capabilities Sino Biopharma. Otherwise of course  we will continue working and we look forward to the next meeting.I would also like to point out that today for us is a special day because we are actually just after this conference run to the celebration of the 10-year anniversary of Inventiva. We started this adventure 27th of August  2012.And today  we are really pleased to be in a position to celebrate this important landmark for Inventiva on the back of positive news for lanifibranor and for odiparcil and also for cedirogant.

Presentations include study results for its investigational treatments  zilucoplan  a self-administered  subcutaneous (SC) peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) and rozanolixizumab  an SC-infused monoclonal antibody targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  in adults with gMG. In addition  the company is also presenting real-world findings into the burden of the disease for society and the potential role of a digital application in improving care.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan have not been established and neither treatment is approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.""Patients living with gMG experience high disease and treatment burden resulting in a significant impact on their daily lives. The data being presented at AANEM and the MG Scientific Session reinforce the potential of UCB's two investigational medicines with different mechanisms of action to provide targeted treatment options to patients "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""We are committed to meeting patients' needs  regardless of antibody profile  including those with MuSK Ab+ gMG who have particularly limited treatment options. With our gMG pipeline  we hope to address both drivers of disease pathology and which account for approximately 95% of patients living with gMG.""Rozanolixizumab MycarinG Phase 3 ResultsA subgroup analysis presented from the Phase 3 MycarinG study (Poster 16  MGFA Scientific Session) 1 analyzes the efficacy of rozanolixizumab in patients with muscle specific kinase antibody-positive (MuSK-Ab+) gMG  which is often more severe and harder to treat than acetylcholine receptor antibody positive (AChR-Ab+) gMG.2 In the overall population analysis  rozanolixizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in MG-specific outcomes in patients with MuSK-Ab+ and AChR-Ab+ gMG  that were consistent with prior published results. Improvements in Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score for the overall population (n=200)  including MuSK-Ab+ patients  were -3.37 for 7mg/kg (n=66; 5 MuSK Ab+) and -3.40 for 10mg/kg (n=67) vs -0.78 (n=67) for placebo. In the MuSK-Ab+ specific subgroup  improvement in MG-ADL was –7.28 (7mg/kg; n=5)  –4.16 (10mg/kg; n=8)  and 2.28 (placebo; n=8). In the AChR-Ab+ specific subgroup  improvement in MG-ADL was –3.03 (7mg/kg; n=60)  –3.36  (10mg/kg; n=60)  and –1.10 (placebo; n=59).1In a responder analysis from MycarinG (Poster 204  AANEM)3  results presented demonstrated that rozanolixizumab significantly reduced MG-ADL from baseline to Day 43. In the primary endpoint  rozanolixizumab showed an LS mean difference vs placebo of 2.59 points at the 7mg/kg dose and 2.62 points at the 10mg/kg dose. Furthermore  a greater percentage of patients in the rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg and 10mg/kg arms than the placebo arm achieved a 2.0-point or greater improvement in MG-ADL  a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores and a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scores. Rozanolixizumab had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated with similar occurrences of TEAEs between both doses.3A further safety analysis of the MycarinG trial (Oral presentation  'Clinical Trials 2' session  MGFA Scientific Session) 4 showed that rozanolixizumab was generally well tolerated  with the majority of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) being mild to moderate in severity. A higher proportion of TEAEs occurred in the active treatment arms versus placebo (81.3% for 7 mg/kg  82.6% for 10 mg/kg and 67.2% for placebo) and were comparable between the rozanolixizumab groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache  diarrhea  pyrexia and nausea. A higher incidence of headache was reported in the rozanolixizumab groups versus placebo  with most cases mild to moderate and severe cases generally managed with non-opioid analgesics. There were no severe or serious infections in the rozanolixizumab groups. Treatment withdrawal due to TEAEs was low; the rate was similar in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg and placebo groups and higher in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group.4Zilucoplan Phase 3 RAISE and RAISE-XT ResultsAn interim analysis from RAISE-XT (data cut off 18 February 2022)  a Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension study (Poster 14  MGFA Scientific Session) is also being presented.5 This ongoing study recruited patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG who participated in randomized Phase 2 (NCT03315130) and Phase 3 (NCT04115293) zilucoplan studies. Building on the data seen in the double-blind Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies  results demonstrated a favorable long-term safety profile for zilucoplan over 24 weeks with no major safety findings  with efficacy in patients who had previously received zilucoplan continuing to improve  and efficacy demonstrated as early as week 1 in patients who switched from placebo. At extension study Week 12  after 24 weeks  the zilucoplan group achieved an LS mean improvement in MG-ADL score from the double-blind study baseline of −6.30. MG-ADL improvement for the placebo-switch group  after 12 weeks of zilucoplan  was −6.32.A presentation on the quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes with zilucoplan from the Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293) (Oral presentation  'Clinical Trials 2' session  MGFA Scientific Session)6 demonstrated that zilucoplan clinically meaningfully and highly statistically significantly improved MG-ADL at week 12 (LS mean difference v placebo –2.09; p<0.001) and showed consistently greater improvement in fatigue vs placebo (LS mean difference vs placebo at Week 12  –3.06; nominal p=0.0069). An overall Work Impairment due to problem score with zilucoplan vs placebo (LS mean difference vs placebo –12.83; p=0.0912) was also observed. Zilucoplan demonstrated a favorable safety profile  with a similar rate of TEAEs between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%)  and good tolerability. The most common TEAEs were injection-site reactions (26.7% zilucoplan vs 14.8% placebo); all were non-serious  and mild in severity  except for one instance of injection-site pain of moderate severity in the zilucoplan group and no patients discontinued due to an injection-site reaction. All patients in the zilucoplan arm who completed the 12-week treatment period have entered the ongoing RAISE-XT extension study (NCT04225871).Additionally  in a detailed responder analysis from Phase 3 RAISE trial being presented (Poster 200  AANEM)7 significantly higher proportions of patients receiving zilucoplan achieved ³3-point and ³5-point improvements in MG-ADL and QMG without rescue therapy vs placebo  respectively Zilucoplan demonstrated a clinically meaningful placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.09 points (p<0.001) in MG-ADL  with 73.1% (p<0.001) of patients receiving zilucoplan achieving a 3.0-point or greater reduction in MG-ADL compared to placebo (46.1%) and 58% (p=0.0012) of patients receiving zilucoplan achieving a 5.0-point or greater reduction in QMG compared to placebo (33.3%). Zilucoplan had a favorable safety profile with no major safety findings and good tolerability.7Real-world costs of gMG and digital application supporting patientsData from a study exploring the health care utilization and societal costs of MG in Norway (Poster 9  MGFA Scientific Session)8 highlighted the burden on both patients and society. It showed that societal costs such as lost life years  QoL  and productivity are significant and greater than direct treatment-related costs (estimated to be only 11.5% of societal costs).A further study on the real-world assessment of patient perceptions on an MG symptom-tracking application9 showed the potential of the smartphone application to equip patients with information that would allow them to better communicate their individual disease experience to their healthcare professional while also making behavioral changes to better manage their disease. Further assessment of this application is underway. (Oral presentation  'Outcomes' session  MGFA Scientific Session).""We are proudly and firmly committed to supporting the gMG community by increasing knowledge and understanding of the true burden of this disease to help improve outcomes "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology & Head of Europe/International Markets at UCB. ""By focusing on patients and reinforcing our gMG pipeline with a platform of support services and digital innovations  we aim to transform the lives of people living with this disease.""UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions in the European Union  Japan and the U.S. for both zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab later this year.For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01[email protected]U.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655[email protected]Corporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64[email protected]Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14[email protected]About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting almost 200 000 patients in the U.S.  EU and Japan.10 11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision and difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.12gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can inhibit synaptic transmission at the neuro-muscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.13 gMG can occur at any age and in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.12 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade. Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR Ab+ gMG.About the zilucoplan RAISE study 14The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12  time to rescue therapy  the proportion with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1)  the proportion with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG  all measured at Week 12. Secondary safety endpoint is incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open label extension study  RAISE-XT (NCT04225871).For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About the rozanolixizumab MycarinG study 15The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in the open label extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About ZilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily self-administered SC peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. Results from the RAISE study  a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with gMG  and regulatory submissions are planned in 2022. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.16 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.17The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About RozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is an SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.18 19Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.20 Orphan designation was granted in 202021 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

This decision also triggered the automatic conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) issued by Technicolor on September 15  2022 into Technicolor shares which will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind.Main characteristics and timetable of the Distribution in KindA total of 355 343 245 outstanding Technicolor shares will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind  so that  in accordance with the distribution ratio of 1 TCS share for 1 outstanding Technicolor share  the same number of 355 343 245 TCS shares will be distributed  representing 65% of TCS’ outstanding share capital at the time of the Distribution in Kind.The timetable relating to the Distribution in Kind involves the following main steps:the admission of the TCS shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“ Euronext P aris ”) under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022;the date for determining the beneficiaries of the Distribution in kind will be September 28  2022; andthe payment of the Distribution in Kind (delivery of the TCS shares) will take place on September 29  2022.The Board of Directors confirmed that the Distribution in Kind would be charged to the additional paid-in capital account of Technicolor for an amount equal to €1.9539 per share. Such amount results from the global value of TCS  set by the Board of Directors of Technicolor taking into account the work and the conclusions of Finexsi  the independent expert appointed for the purpose of assessing TCS value  divided by the number of TCS shares actually outstanding (i.e.  546 681 915 shares).Story continuesConsidering the current composition of the shareholders’ equity which does not include any distributable profits and reserves other than those resulting from contributions  the Distribution in Kind will be characterized  from a French tax perspective  as a repayment of capital contributions  within the meaning of paragraph 1) of Article 112 of the French Tax Code which does not constitute distributed income.The technical reference price for each TCS share  communicated to Euronext Paris for the opening of the trading session of September 27  2022 also amounts to €1.9539 per share. The technical reference price is merely indicative and may not be relied on to determine the trading price of the TCS shares going forward. In addition  this price of €1.9539 per share should be retained by Technicolor shareholders to determine the tax value of the TCS shares received as part of the Distribution in Kind  in the event of a subsequent sale of these shares.Technicolor is pleased to announce this step which marks a major milestone in the spin-off process announced by the Group on February 24  2022.###Legal DisclaimerThis press release has been prepared by Technicolor SA (“TSA”) in the context of the contemplated spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios (“TCS” or the “Company”) as a result of which TSA ex-TCS is to become Vantiva.

10399,EuroNext,Bing API,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/iba-sck-cen-launch-pantera-050000638.html,IBA and SCK CEN launch Pantera  a joint-venture to produce actinium-225,IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN today announced the name of their joint-venture: Pantera SA/NV ,IBA SALouvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  22 September 2022 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN today announced the name of their joint-venture: Pantera SA/NV  which they believe will bring new hope for cancer patients. As indicated in the announcement of the R&D strategic partnership  this new company will aim to secure the large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  one of the most promising alpha-emitting radioisotopes to fight cancers. By working towards this large-scale production  Pantera’s ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility of a future innovative cancer therapy based on 225Ac.The complementarity of IBA and SCK CEN’s expertise has been demonstrated by the extensive and comprehensive R&D work that has been conducted during the last year as they work towards being able to produce large volumes of 225Ac. Pantera is now completing the technical feasibility studies before working on the final design and construction of its first facility in Mol  Belgium. Groundbreaking is expected to take place in 2024  with production starting in 2027.Sven Van den Berghe  former Director of the Nuclear Materials Science Institute at SCK CEN  has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer  and Samy Bertrand  former technical leader for theranostics applications at IBA  takes the position of Chief Technical Officer.Bruno Scutnaire  President of IBA RadioPharma Solutions and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pantera  said: “Actinium-225 offers great promise for the treatment of a large variety of cancers  but only very little of the material is available worldwide today. Once cancer treatments based on 225Ac receive approval  Pantera will focus on enabling access to a dependable supply of this promising isotope.”Peter Baeten  Deputy Director-General of SCK CEN and Board member of Pantera  commented: “Launching Pantera was a logical choice for SCK CEN and IBA  allowing the joint-venture to leverage the innovative capabilities of both organizations  whilst utilizing the speed of an autonomous startup necessary in this fast-evolving field.”Story continuesSven Van den Berghe  appointed Chief Executive Officer of Pantera  added: “I am excited about the opportunity to help advance the mission of Pantera to bring a new hope for cancer patients by enabling the widespread use of radioisotopes  such as actinium-225  as a basis for promising new radiopharmaceuticals. Pantera offers ’A better fight for life’  potentially bringing an effective and efficient treatment option while maximizing the quality of life of the patients  with the possibility to expand the production to other isotopes in the future.”***Actinium-225 possesses the resounding potential to treat cancers more effectively. Initial results show that the theranostic radioisotope completely eliminates cancer cells  rather than just inhibiting tumour growth. The risk of recurrence also appears to decrease. To date  extensive research and numerous studies are underway which aim to tackle both high prevalence cancers including prostate  lung  colon  breast  pancreatic  blood (leukemia and other rare forms) and kidney cancers  but also rarer forms of cancer like glioblastoma  the deadliest form of a very invasive brain cancer.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.
