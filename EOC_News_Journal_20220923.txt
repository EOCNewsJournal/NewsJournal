Despite an estimated $17.1 trillion in ""sustainable"" investments at stake  there are few standards for marketing investments that consider environmental  social  and governance factors. Moreover  concerns around greenwashing and exaggerated ESG claims remain a top priority for the SEC as it has stepped up enforcement efforts on this score. Against this background  the SEC has issued two new rulemaking proposals and a request for comment. The comment period for these releases concluded in August.In a new Strategic Perspective entitled ""SEC targets ESG asset managers and fuels critics""  Wolters Kluwer legal experts consider the increasingly vocal opponents to ESG investing  as well as examine reactions to the SEC rule proposals  including the likelihood of adoption and legal challenges.Additionally  the Strategic Perspective includes the views and insights from two of today's leading legal practitioners in the asset management space  Gwen Williamson  partner in the Investment Management group at Perkins Coie  and Howard Sidman  partner in the Financial Markets practice at Jones Day.Who: Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; and Matthew Garza  J.D.  Managing EditorLike a nutrition label  the SEC's proposed ESG disclosures for advisers and funds aim to give investors greater confidence that ESG claims mean something real. There are disagreements as to specifics  but overall there appears to be broad support for the goal of improving ESG information for investors.- Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystStory continuesThe wide range of public comments received in connection with the SEC's ""Names Rule"" demonstrates that the war over ESG investing and its regulation is alive and well. While supporters of the SEC's initiative see the proposals as a means to prevent greenwashing and enhancing investor understanding  opponents view the very same proposed rules as furthering confusion  complexity  and devoid of any corresponding benefits to the public.- Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystFinancial data providers like S&P  Morningstar  and Bloomberg have moved aggressively to meet investor demand for bespoke ESG indexes and other investment products. Their success has earned them attacks from state attorneys general  right-leaning media  Elon Musk  even some academic circles  and now they find the SEC's nose under their tent.- Matthew Garza  J.D.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 30.06.2022 30.06.2021 Var. in % Revenue 491.0 487.6 0.7% EBITDA 42.3 64.7 (34.6)% Current operating income 17.7 50.0 (64.6)% Current operating margin 3.6% 10.3% -6.7 pts Operating income 17.2 50.7 (66.1)% Financial income (10.0) (0.6) - Net result (group share) 1.9 38.0 (95.0)% Net margin 0.4% 7.8% -7.4 ptsINCREASING ACTIVITY IN AN AUTOMOTIVE MARKET THAT REMAINS TURBULENTIn the first half of 2022  AKWEL posted a consolidated turnover of €491.0 m  stable compared to the first half of 2021  but up by 5% on a like-for-like basis  while global vehicle production has remained down over the period (-1.8%1). For the first time  the posted turnover includes the application of the IAS 29 standard (“financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies”) impacting the Turkish subsidiaries  generating a readjustment of +€2.9 m compared to the figure posted in July. In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).A MARKED DECREASE IN HALF-YEAR RESULTSAs noted by the Group when publishing its half-year turnover  the half-year results have seen a significant drop. They have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. For AKWEL  these substantial rises represent a cost increase of €31.6 m over the half year and are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices in line with negotiation periods and conditions.In this context  gross operating surplus was down 34.6% to €42.3 m  and current operating income fell by 64.6% to €17.7 m  i.e. a current operating margin of 3.6% of turnover  down by 6.7 points. Financial income fell by €9.4 m as a result of the application of the IAS 29 standard mentioned above. Tax charges accounted for €5.1 m compared to €12.2 m in the first half of 2021  leading to a net income Group share of €1.9 m (net margin of 0.4%).Story continuesFree cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. After payment of the dividend and loan repayments totalling €22.1 m  the Group’s net cash position (including debts on lease obligations) at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.CREATION OF A THIRD AREA OF EXPERTISEAmong its priorities  the Group has set itself the target of accelerating the development of its product potential in 2022 as part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles while also continuing its existing development of the TAMIC brake particle recovery solution. In addition to fluid management and mechanisms  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts. As such  the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles while building on its existing technological expertise and resources  resulting in easier management of product and industrial risks.OUTLOOKS FOR THE 2022 FINANCIAL YEARIn a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year  with the third quarter expected to bring good performance. Against the backdrop of inflation and the continued impact of supply difficulties on manufacturers’ activities  the Group nonetheless remains cautious about forecasts for the sector  despite the fact that the first effects of sales price increases should be seen in the second half of the year.Next press release: turnover for the third quarter of 2022  10 November 2022  after markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles. The Group achieves this by relying on state-of-the-art industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Euronext Paris – Compartment B – ISIN: FR0000053027 – Reuters: AKW.PA – Bloomberg: AKW:FPContactsAKWELGrégory Voisin – Financial VP – Tel.: +33 4 50 56 99 25EKNO – Press RelationsJean-Marc Atlan – jean-marc.atlan@ekno.fr – Tel.: +33 6 07 37 20 44CALYPTUS – Investor RelationsMathieu Calleux – akwel@calyptus.net – Tel.: +33 1 53 65 68 681 Source: S&P Global MobilityAttachment,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,mixed,0.17,0.25,0.58,True,English,"['1st\xa0HALF', 'AKWEL', 'PUBLICATION', 'RESULTS', 'THE', 'TAMIC brake particle recovery solution', 'S&P Global Mobility Attachment', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'net income Group share', 'global vehicle production', 'A MARKED DECREASE', 'Free cash-flow generation', 'battery pack interiors', 'service battery casings', 'Grégory Voisin', 'gross operating surplus', 'net cash position', 'Current operating income', 'sales price increases', 'Next press release', 'Current operating margin', 'independent, family-owned group', 'significant price inflation', 'global automotive market', 'moderate turnover growth', 'existing technological expertise', 'Net margin', 'Financial income', 'strong growth', 'significant drop', 'sales prices', 'Press Relations', 'Net result', '1st HALF', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'executive board', 'Audit reports', 'Consolidated data', 'INCREASING ACTIVITY', 'first half', 'first time', 'IAS 29 standard', 'financial reporting', 'hyperinflationary economies', 'Turkish subsidiaries', 'supply limitations', 'North America', 'raw materials', 'substantial rises', 'cost increase', 'negotiation periods', 'Tax charges', 'loan repayments', 'lease obligations', 'THIRD AREA', 'hydrogen-powered vehicles', 'existing development', 'fluid management', 'electric vehicles', 'electronic modules', 'EV flaps', 'cable ducts', 'many opportunities', 'rapid roll-out', 'easier management', 'third quarter', 'good performance', 'continued impact', 'supply difficulties', 'manufacturers’ activities', 'first effects', 'second half', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'Compartment B', 'Financial VP', 'Jean-Marc Atlan', 'Investor Relations', 'Mathieu Calleux', '2022 half-yearly results', 'HALF-YEAR RESULTS', 'half year', '2022 FINANCIAL YEAR', 'consolidated turnover', 'half-year turnover', 'structural components', 'product potential', 'industrial risks', 'ekno.fr', 'AKW.PA', 'The Group', 'Akwel', 'Thursday', 'PUBLICATION', 'PEA', '19 September', 'millions', 'Var.', 'Revenue', 'EBITDA', 'TURBULENT', 'basis', 'application', 'readjustment', 'figure', 'July', 'energy', 'transport', 'labour', 'line', 'conditions', 'context', '6.7 points', 'Story', 'dividend', 'debts', '30 June', '31 December', 'CREATION', 'priorities', 'target', 'transition', 'addition', 'mechanisms', 'examples', 'resources', 'OUTLOOKS', 'forecast', 'backdrop', 'sector', 'markets', 'state', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'Contacts', 'Tel.', 'marc.', 'CALYPTUS', '1 Source', '€', '33 4 50']",2022-09-22,2022-09-23,finance.yahoo.com

A total of 81.600 shares options were awarded at a strike price of Euro 1 787. The strike price corresponds to the 90 days moving average of the share price as per 1 July 2022. The share options have an average vesting period of 2 5 years and will vest in four equal quarterly portions  starting on 1 July 2024. They will vest at the 90 days average closing prices of the GOJXN stock in the period immediately preceding the vesting date. The settlement will be in ordinary shares of the company.This is the third time that share options have been granted under such a scheme. The initial grant was announced in a press release dated 29 October 2020 and then  a second grant announced on 1 November 2021.GeoJunxion also announces the first quarterly vesting of the share options awarded in 2020.

First-half revenues temporarily grew less quickly than expenses  linked in part to the impact of inflation  but above all to absorb the strong growth that the Group expects to achieve over the coming half-year periods and particularly the second half of this year.Extract from the condensed half-year consolidated financial statements approved by the Board of Directors on September 22  2022At 30 June (€m)H1 2022H1 2021Change Value % Revenues 84.0 75.4 +8.6 +11% EBITDA 11.2 14.3 (3.1) -22% % revenues 13.3% 19.0% Current operating income 3.9 8.6 (4.7) -55% % revenues 4.6% 11.4% Operating income 2.5 8.0 (5.5) - Pre-tax income 2.1 6.9 (4.8) - Net income 1.2 5.1 (3.8) -Sustained growth maintained during the first half of 2022The LUMIBIRD Group’s consolidated revenues came to €84.0m at June 30  2022  up 11% (+9% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). This growth is split equally across the Photonics and Medical divisions  although with various deliveries deferred from one quarter to another depending on the business segments.For the Photonics division  the contrasting levels of progress do not necessarily reflect the overall trend. The Industrial and Scientific business lines recorded first-half growth of +2% (to €17.4m)  while the Lidar business climbed +48% to €11.0m  with an increase in sales for both Lidar and OEM systems. The Defense / Space business was stable during the first half of the year (+1% to €10.2m). On May 31  2022  Lumibird Photonics Sweden  which took on the laser rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  became operational. Its first-half contribution was marginal (€0.36m).The Medical division  with first-half growth of +11% (€45.4m)  benefited from an acceleration in sales  particularly in the United States and Japan  where the strengthening of the sales teams and the extension of the product range are reflected in very positive trends.Story continuesContrasting contributions for the two divisionsSummary of results for each division(€m)Photonics Medical 2021-H1 2022-H1 Change (%) 2021 –H1 2022-H2 Change (%) Revenues 34.7 38.7 +11.3% 40.7 45.4 +11.5% Gross margin 23.2 24.7 +6.4% 24.4 27.7 +13.6% % 66.9% 64.0% 60.0% 61.1% EBITDA 6.7 3.7 -43.8% 7.6 7.5 -2.4% % 19.2% 9.7% 18.8% 16.4% Current op. income 3.7 (0.8) -123% 4.9 4.7 -3.1% % 10.7% (2.2)% 11.9% 10.4%The Group’s gross margin rate is still high  at 62.4%  compared with 63.1% in H1 2021. However  this change shows differences for the two divisions  mainly as a result of a price effect  which was more favorable for the Medical division (61.1% gross margin vs 60.0% in H1 2021)  in which the price rises can be passed on almost immediately  while the Photonics division (64.0% vs 66.9%) is held back by a structure of longer-term contracts.During the first half of 2022  LUMIBIRD recorded €11.2m of EBITDA  representing 13.3% of revenues  compared with 19.0% one year earlier  linked to the structuring of the organization looking ahead to a higher level of business in 2022 and beyond. The structuring investments began during H2 2021 and continued in H1 2022. This will enable the Group to deliver the growth and operational performance expected.The temporary contraction in profitability can be seen more for the Photonics division (EBITDA margin of 9.7% vs 19.2% in H1 2021) than the Medical division (16.4% vs 18.8% in H1 2021). This mainly reflects the additional structural costs recorded by the Photonics division to prepare for future growth.First-half income from ordinary operations came to €3.9m  compared with €8.6m for the first half of 2021.Following -€0.4m of financial income and expenses (vs -€1.1m in H1 2021) and €0.9m of taxes (vs €1.8m in H1 2021)  net income totaled €1.2m  compared with €5.1m for the first half of 2021.Cash flow: capex and increase in inventory to prepare for the future(€m) 30/06/2021 30/06/2022 Net cash-flow from operations 8.1 (10.2) Operating cash-flow before interests and tax 14.5 11.0 Change in WCR (7.7) (20.1) Taxes paid 1.3 (1.0) Net cash-flow from investing activities (7.7) (18.2) Capital expenditures (4.8) (10.6) External growth (2.3) (7.2) Other financial assets investments (0.5) (0.4) Net cash-flow from financing activities (1.0) (0.7) Capital increase - - Net loans issuance (0.1) 1.3 Financing cost (0.8) (1.3) Other change (0.1) (0.7) NET CASH FLOW 1 (0.6) (29.1)The combined impacts of the component crisis and the preparations for a strong level of production in the second half of the year resulted in a significant increase in inventory levels (+€11.2m) at end-June. The investments in industrial facilities  including the expansion of the Lannion site  the creation of the Gothenburg site to incorporate the rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  and the preparation of the new site to take on the activities from Les Ulis (€5.2m)  also had a significant impact on first-half capex. During the first half of the year  total cash requirements  representing nearly €30m  were covered entirely by existing cash.Balance sheet positionBalance sheet highlights (€m) 31.12.2021 30.06.2022 Goodwill 70.3 71.1 Non-current assets (excl.

The investments made in the Group’s industrial facilities and the strengthening of its capacity are expected to support a strong level of commercial development over the coming half-year periods.In this context  the Group is confirming its objectives for 2023 reported revenues of €250m  driven by organic and external growth  with its EBITDA margin to continue increasing within a 20%-25% range.Next date:Q3 2022 revenues on October 24  2022 after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers.

This project brought together several European industries such as Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  with the objective of demonstrating the conversion of wood residues into sustainable high-performance components for road and aviation fuels  and thus participate to the decarbonization efforts of ground and air transportation. The project was coordinated by Global Bioenergies and received €13.8 million in funding from the European Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.The project  otherwise known by its full name  “Residual Wood Conversion to High-performance drop-in Biofuels”  was funded under contract n° 792104 through the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA). Beside Global Bioenergies  Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  the project also involved SkyNRG  Peab  Neste  IPSB  Technip FMC  Metex NoovistaGo and the Energie Institut JKU.For this project  sugars from wood were supplied by Sekab and Fibenol.Tino Lassmann  Project Manager at Sekab said: “Our technology to produce second generation sugars is considered to be among the best in the world  especially when it comes to wood as raw material. We are convinced of its many values and possibilities as a way to reducing our environmental footprint. We are proud to have been a part of REWOFUEL together with other leading players in the European bioeconomy and we will continue the cooperation towards a more sustainable world.”Peep Pitk  Chief Development Officer at Fibenol said: “We have been impressed by the performance of Global Bioenergies’ bio-isobutene process with our wood sugars. From 2023 we are producing these wood sugars at 20 000 tons per year capacity at our plant in Imavere  Estonia and looking forward to taking this collaboration to the next level.”Story continuesThese sugars were then processed into high performance sustainable biofuels.Bernard Chaud  Head of Industrial Strategy at Global Bioenergies  said: “We have shown that bio-isobutene produced from second generation sugars from wood can be used to produce both octane booster for road transportation as well as Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”As a result  batches of bio-isooctane  bio-ETBE and sustainable aviation fuel have been produced by Global Bioenergies and then tested by Repsol  Spain’s leading oil company.Javier Marcos González  Project Manager at Repsol said: “The initial tests we conducted were satisfactory. Having these isobutene derivatives from second-generation renewable resources would be a significant step forward for the fuel industry.”Batches of sustainable aviation fuel were produced and transferred to SkyNRG  leader in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Significant work has been coordinated by SkyNRG for the certification of these isobutene derivatives as a sustainable aviation fuel.Maarten van Dijk  Chief Development Officer at SkyNRG said: “For the aviation industry to lower its carbon footprint and meet European targets on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)  we need to keep developing new production pathways  with the aim to unlock new sustainable feedstock sources and increase conversion efficiencies. The REWOFUEL project has proven to be able to do exactly this. We have been impressed by the drive of all partners to make this project a success and by the innovative platform of Global Bioenergies in particular. We are looking forward to the next scale-up step and hope to see Global Bioenergies’ sustainable aviation fuel in commercial aircraft in the future.”Meanwhile  by-products from the ligneous part of wood chips have been incorporated by Peab into successfully implemented bitumen products. Producing bitumen with a better environmental footprint will help to optimise overall road transport performance.The proteins resulting from fermentation are intended to be used in animal feed. The experiments conducted by Metex NoovistaGo in this respect have produced positive results.Finally  the Energie Institut JKU has carried out life cycle analyses of the various segments of this value chain and has quantified the reduction in CO 2 emissions according to different configurations  which can lead to savings of up to 85% compared to the benchmark fossil solution.Meanwhile  engineering efforts have been conducted by Neste   Technip-FMC  and IPSB  a French engineering company specialized in agribusinesses.Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  added: “This REWOFUEL project has brought together players from different fields to assemble an industrial value chain aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of air and road transportation. These sectors are at the heart of the environmental debate: transportation based on thermal engines must switch to renewable energy if it wants to survive in the coming decades. Air transport must also reduce its environmental impact. The players of the REWOFUEL project will maintain relations beyond the project to make the prospects more concrete.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

Our collaboration with AbbVie led to a new €4 million milestone payment following the initiation of the Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant which is expected to finish H1 2023. We estimate our current cash position  combined with the expected $12 million upfront payment from the agreement with Sino Biopharm and the anticipated first €25 million tranche under the EIB credit facility extends our cash runway through Q4 2023. This agreement with Sino Biopharm represents an important milestone and allows us to start the development of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH in a country where the prevalence of NASH is particularly high. We also continued to progress our NASH programs with the screening of the first patient in our LEGEND trial and the clearance of our IND application by the FDA. Looking ahead  we expect even more exciting developments  including with the results from our Phase II clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes planned for Q1 2023.

This significant increase was driven mostly by the costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH including a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and  to a lesser extent  with the Legend Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes.General and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to €6.8 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 18% compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2021  mainly due to personnel costs linked to the share-based payment expenses  a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and to a lesser extent an increase in compliance fees related to the dual listing of Inventiva securities.Other operating income (expenses) amounted to €0.1 million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€0.6) million in the first half of 2021.Net financial income amounted to €4.0 million in the first half of 2022  mainly linked to foreign exchange gains due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro during the period.The Company’s net loss stood at (€29.5) million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€23.1) million in the first half of 2021.Inventiva’s net cash flow (excluding any exchange rate effect) amounted to (€12.5) million in the six months ended June 30  2022  compared to (€15.0) million in the same period in 2021.Net cash used in operating activities amounted to €26.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €19.8 million for the same period in 2021. This increase in cash use is mainly due to higher R&D expenses. Cash flow from operating activities was also positively impacted in the first half of 2022 by the payment in January 2022 of €4 million milestone payment from AbbVie following the inclusion of the first patient in the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant (formerly ABBV-157) in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  and the 2021 French Research tax credit (“CIR”) for €3.6 million that was received in April 2022.Net cash generated used in investing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to (€0.3) million  compared to €4.7 million3 for the same period in 2021.Net cash generated from financing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to €14.0 million compared to no net cash generated from financing activities over the first half of 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s At-The-Market Program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) on June 15  2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million. One of the loans has been contracted as part of a French state-guaranteed loan facility (""Prêt Garanti par l’Etat"" or “PGE”) with Bpifrance and the two others obtained as part of a French State stimulus economic plan  (""Prêts Participatifs Relance"" or “PPR”) granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale.Over the first half of 2022  the Company recorded a positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of €2.4 million3 versus €3.0 million for the first half of 2021  due to the favourable evolution of USD versus Euro.As of June 30  2022  Inventiva’s cash and cash equivalent position was €76.4 million compared to €86.6 million as of December 31  2021. The cash position including short term deposits1 reach €87 2 million compared to €95.4 million as of December 31  2021.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs and excluding any potential proceeds from the EIB credit facility and any potential additional financial resources  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through Q4 2023 [including the expected €25 million upfront payment from Sino Biopharm and the €25 million from the EIB credit facility3.The financial statements of the first half of 2022 were approved by Inventiva’s Board of Directors on September 21  2022. The statutory auditors have issued a limited review report. For more details  the Half-Year Financial Report is available on the Company’s website at: www.inventivapharma.com .Financial information after closing the accountsOn July 1st  2022  in connection with the EIB credit facility  Inventiva agreed to issue warrants to EIB as a condition to the potential funding of each tranche of the credit facility. During July 2022  the Company rebalanced its foreign currency accounts by taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate of the euro against the dollar; it converted 25 million dollars from current and term accounts into euros.Main areas of progress in the R&D portfolioLanifibranor in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)Inventiva is now targeting the last patient first visit for NATiV3  the Company’s ongoing Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH  for H2 2023  subject to the continuing implementation of measures to accelerate the enrollment rate. The delay we face is primarily due to a higher than originally projected screen failure rate resulting in slower than anticipated enrollment rate. In addition  we continue to see slower than predicted site activation  screening and enrollment due to negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to be unable to conduct clinical trial activities at sites originally located in Ukraine and Russia. Inventiva has implemented and is planning further measures designed to accelerate enrollment and reduce screen failures in the NATiV3 trial  and additional sites have been identified to help compensate for the inability to use sites in Ukraine and Russia.Accordingly  the publication of the topline results of the part 1 of NATiV3 is now targeted for second half of 2025.Completion of the recruitment for the investigator-initiated Phase II trial of lanifibranor in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (“NAFLD”) and with type 2 diabetes (“T2D”)  conducted by Professor Cusi from the University of Florida.

The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signalling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA).ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux / Matthieu BenoistMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

Our collaboration with AbbVie led to a new €4 million milestone payment following the initiation of the Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant which is expected to finish H1 2023. We estimate our current cash position  combined with the expected $12 million upfront payment from the agreement with Sino Biopharm and the anticipated first €25 million tranche under the EIB credit facility extends our cash runway through Q4 2023. This agreement with Sino Biopharm represents an important milestone and allows us to start the development of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH in a country where the prevalence of NASH is particularly high. We also continued to progress our NASH programs with the screening of the first patient in our LEGEND trial and the clearance of our IND application by the FDA. Looking ahead  we expect even more exciting developments  including with the results from our Phase II clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes planned for Q1 2023. Finally  we are also very pleased to have feedback from the FDA that a single phase 2/3 trial could potentially support a marketing application for odiparcil.”Key financial results for the first half of 2022(in thousands of euros  except share and per share amounts) June 30  2022 June 30  2021 Revenues 67 139 Other income 3 325 2 009 Research and development expenses (29 866) (19 109) Marketing – business development expenses (278) (258) General and administrative expenses (6 847) (5 779) Other operating income (expenses) 131 (607) Net operating loss (33 468) (23 605) Net financial income 3 983 824 Income (expense) tax 19 (355) Net loss for the period (29 466) (23 136) Basic/diluted loss per share (euros/share) (0.72) (0.60) Weighted average number of outstanding shares used to calculate basic/diluted loss per share 40 864 457 38 677 187Revenues for the first half of 2022 reached €0.1 million in line with the same period in 2021.R&D expenses for the first half of 2022 amounted to €29.9 million  mainly driven by the development of lanifibranor in NASH  and were up 56% compared to the €19.1 million for the first half of 2021. This significant increase was driven mostly by the costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in NASH including a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and  to a lesser extent  with the Legend Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes.General and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to €6.8 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 18% compared to €5.8 million in the first half of 2021  mainly due to personnel costs linked to the share-based payment expenses  a full six months of operating for the U.S. affiliate and to a lesser extent an increase in compliance fees related to the dual listing of Inventiva securities.Other operating income (expenses) amounted to €0.1 million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€0.6) million in the first half of 2021.Net financial income amounted to €4.0 million in the first half of 2022  mainly linked to foreign exchange gains due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro during the period.The Company’s net loss stood at (€29.5) million in the first half of 2022 compared to (€23.1) million in the first half of 2021.Inventiva’s net cash flow (excluding any exchange rate effect) amounted to (€12.5) million in the six months ended June 30  2022  compared to (€15.0) million in the same period in 2021.Net cash used in operating activities amounted to €26.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €19.8 million for the same period in 2021. This increase in cash use is mainly due to higher R&D expenses. Cash flow from operating activities was also positively impacted in the first half of 2022 by the payment in January 2022 of €4 million milestone payment from AbbVie following the inclusion of the first patient in the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial with cedirogant (formerly ABBV-157) in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  and the 2021 French Research tax credit (“CIR”) for €3.6 million that was received in April 2022.Net cash generated used in investing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to (€0.3) million  compared to €4.7 million3 for the same period in 2021.Net cash generated from financing activities for the first half of 2022 amounted to €14.0 million compared to no net cash generated from financing activities over the first half of 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s At-The-Market Program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) on June 15  2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million. One of the loans has been contracted as part of a French state-guaranteed loan facility (""Prêt Garanti par l’Etat"" or “PGE”) with Bpifrance and the two others obtained as part of a French State stimulus economic plan  (""Prêts Participatifs Relance"" or “PPR”) granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale.Over the first half of 2022  the Company recorded a positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of €2.4 million3 versus €3.0 million for the first half of 2021  due to the favourable evolution of USD versus Euro.As of June 30  2022  Inventiva’s cash and cash equivalent position was €76.4 million compared to €86.6 million as of December 31  2021. The cash position including short term deposits1 reach €87 2 million compared to €95.4 million as of December 31  2021.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs and excluding any potential proceeds from the EIB credit facility and any potential additional financial resources  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through Q4 2023 [including the expected €25 million upfront payment from Sino Biopharm and the €25 million from the EIB credit facility3.The financial statements of the first half of 2022 were approved by Inventiva’s Board of Directors on September 21  2022. The statutory auditors have issued a limited review report. For more details  the Half-Year Financial Report is available on the Company’s website at: www.inventivapharma.com .Financial information after closing the accountsOn July 1st  2022  in connection with the EIB credit facility  Inventiva agreed to issue warrants to EIB as a condition to the potential funding of each tranche of the credit facility. During July 2022  the Company rebalanced its foreign currency accounts by taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate of the euro against the dollar; it converted 25 million dollars from current and term accounts into euros.Main areas of progress in the R&D portfolioLanifibranor in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)Inventiva is now targeting the last patient first visit for NATiV3  the Company’s ongoing Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in patients with NASH  for H2 2023  subject to the continuing implementation of measures to accelerate the enrollment rate. The delay we face is primarily due to a higher than originally projected screen failure rate resulting in slower than anticipated enrollment rate. In addition  we continue to see slower than predicted site activation  screening and enrollment due to negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to be unable to conduct clinical trial activities at sites originally located in Ukraine and Russia. Inventiva has implemented and is planning further measures designed to accelerate enrollment and reduce screen failures in the NATiV3 trial  and additional sites have been identified to help compensate for the inability to use sites in Ukraine and Russia.Accordingly  the publication of the topline results of the part 1 of NATiV3 is now targeted for second half of 2025.Completion of the recruitment for the investigator-initiated Phase II trial of lanifibranor in patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (“NAFLD”) and with type 2 diabetes (“T2D”)  conducted by Professor Cusi from the University of Florida. However due to a late enrollment of the last patient  the results are now expected in the first quarter 2023.Screening in the United States of the first patient in Inventiva’s LEGEND’s proof-of-concept Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin for the treatment of patients with NASH and T2D. All the 36 sites in France  the United Kingdom  Belgium  the Netherlands  and the United States anticipated to participate in the trial have been qualified. Topline results are expected to be published in the second half of 2023.Completion by the FDA of its safety review of Inventiva’s Investigational New Drug application (IND) for the LEGEND Phase II combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D.Collaboration with AbbVie on cedirogant in autoimmune diseasesReceipt of a €4 million milestone payment from AbbVie in January 2022.

Inventiva’s current plans not to pursue odiparcil development directly remain; however  the Company believes this feedback increases the potential for the development of odiparcil for the treatment of MPS VI and continues to review potential options to further development of odiparcil for the treatment of MPS VI  which may include pursuing a partnership – August  2022Entry of Inventiva in the Euronext Tech Leaders segment  a new Euronext segment which includes more than 100 high-growth and leading tech companies across Europe – June 7  2022Signature of a credit facility agreement for up to €50 million  subject to conditions precedent  with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) with the plan to use any potential borrowings under the facility towards Inventiva’s preclinical and clinical pipeline  including to help fund a portion of its Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH  subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent – May 16  2022Next key expected milestonesPublication of the results of the investigator-initiated study with lanifibranor in patients with NAFLD and T2D – now planned for the first quarter of 2023Study completion of Phase IIb trial with cedirogant in patients with psoriasis conducted by AbbVie – planned for first half of 2023Publication of the topline results of the Phase IIa LEGEND of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – planned for second half of 2023Last Patient First Visit of the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – now targeted for second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationGuggenheim Nantucket Therapeutics Conference – September 27-29  NantucketLyon Pôle Bourse – September 28  LyonHealthTech Innovation Days – October 12-14  ParisPortzamparc BNP Paribas Biotech & Santé – October 4  VirtualH.C.

This decision also triggered the automatic conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) issued by Technicolor on September 15  2022 into Technicolor shares which will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind.Main characteristics and timetable of the Distribution in KindA total of 355 343 245 outstanding Technicolor shares will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind  so that  in accordance with the distribution ratio of 1 TCS share for 1 outstanding Technicolor share  the same number of 355 343 245 TCS shares will be distributed  representing 65% of TCS’ outstanding share capital at the time of the Distribution in Kind.The timetable relating to the Distribution in Kind involves the following main steps:the admission of the TCS shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“ Euronext P aris ”) under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022;”) under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022; the date for determining the beneficiaries of the Distribution in kind will be September 28  2022; andthe payment of the Distribution in Kind (delivery of the TCS shares) will take place on September 29  2022.The Board of Directors confirmed that the Distribution in Kind would be charged to the additional paid-in capital account of Technicolor for an amount equal to €1.9539 per share. Such amount results from the global value of TCS  set by the Board of Directors of Technicolor taking into account the work and the conclusions of Finexsi  the independent expert appointed for the purpose of assessing TCS value  divided by the number of TCS shares actually outstanding (i.e.  546 681 915 shares).Considering the current composition of the shareholders’ equity which does not include any distributable profits and reserves other than those resulting from contributions  the Distribution in Kind will be characterized  from a French tax perspective  as a repayment of capital contributions  within the meaning of paragraph 1) of Article 112 of the French Tax Code which does not constitute distributed income.The technical reference price for each TCS share  communicated to Euronext Paris for the opening of the trading session of September 27  2022 also amounts to €1.9539 per share. The technical reference price is merely indicative and may not be relied on to determine the trading price of the TCS shares going forward. In addition  this price of €1.9539 per share should be retained by Technicolor shareholders to determine the tax value of the TCS shares received as part of the Distribution in Kind  in the event of a subsequent sale of these shares.Technicolor is pleased to announce this step which marks a major milestone in the spin-off process announced by the Group on February 24  2022.###Legal DisclaimerThis press release has been prepared by Technicolor SA (“TSA”) in the context of the contemplated spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios (“TCS” or the “Company”) as a result of which TSA ex-TCS is to become Vantiva.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN today announced the name of their joint-venture: Pantera SA/NV  whi…,English French DutchLouvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  22 September 2022 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN today announced the name of their joint-venture: Pantera SA/NV  which they believe will bring new hope for cancer patients. As indicated in the announcement of the R&D strategic partnership  this new company will aim to secure the large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  one of the most promising alpha-emitting radioisotopes to fight cancers. By working towards this large-scale production  Pantera’s ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility of a future innovative cancer therapy based on 225Ac.The complementarity of IBA and SCK CEN’s expertise has been demonstrated by the extensive and comprehensive R&D work that has been conducted during the last year as they work towards being able to produce large volumes of 225Ac. Pantera is now completing the technical feasibility studies before working on the final design and construction of its first facility in Mol  Belgium. Groundbreaking is expected to take place in 2024  with production starting in 2027.Sven Van den Berghe  former Director of the Nuclear Materials Science Institute at SCK CEN  has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer  and Samy Bertrand  former technical leader for theranostics applications at IBA  takes the position of Chief Technical Officer.Bruno Scutnaire  President of IBA RadioPharma Solutions and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pantera  said: “Actinium-225 offers great promise for the treatment of a large variety of cancers  but only very little of the material is available worldwide today. Once cancer treatments based on 225Ac receive approval  Pantera will focus on enabling access to a dependable supply of this promising isotope.”Peter Baeten  Deputy Director-General of SCK CEN and Board member of Pantera  commented: “Launching Pantera was a logical choice for SCK CEN and IBA  allowing the joint-venture to leverage the innovative capabilities of both organizations  whilst utilizing the speed of an autonomous startup necessary in this fast-evolving field.”Sven Van den Berghe  appointed Chief Executive Officer of Pantera  added: “I am excited about the opportunity to help advance the mission of Pantera to bring a new hope for cancer patients by enabling the widespread use of radioisotopes  such as actinium-225  as a basis for promising new radiopharmaceuticals. Pantera offers ’A better fight for life’  potentially bringing an effective and efficient treatment option while maximizing the quality of life of the patients  with the possibility to expand the production to other isotopes in the future.”***Actinium-225 possesses the resounding potential to treat cancers more effectively. Initial results show that the theranostic radioisotope completely eliminates cancer cells  rather than just inhibiting tumour growth. The risk of recurrence also appears to decrease. To date  extensive research and numerous studies are underway which aim to tackle both high prevalence cancers including prostate  lung  colon  breast  pancreatic  blood (leukemia and other rare forms) and kidney cancers  but also rarer forms of cancer like glioblastoma  the deadliest form of a very invasive brain cancer.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 30.06.2022 30.06.2021 Var. in % Revenue 491.0 487.6 0.7% EBITDA 42.3 64.7 (34.6)% Current operating income 17.7 50.0 (64.6)% Current operating margin 3.6% 10.3% -6.7 pts Operating income 17.2 50.7 (66.1)% Financial income (10.0) (0.6) - Net result (group share) 1.9 38.0 (95.0)% Net margin 0.4% 7.8% -7.4 ptsINCREASING ACTIVITY IN AN AUTOMOTIVE MARKET THAT REMAINS TURBULENTIn the first half of 2022  AKWEL posted a consolidated turnover of €491.0 m  stable compared to the first half of 2021  but up by 5% on a like-for-like basis  while global vehicle production has remained down over the period (-1.8%1). For the first time  the posted turnover includes the application of the IAS 29 standard (“financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies”) impacting the Turkish subsidiaries  generating a readjustment of +€2.9 m compared to the figure posted in July. In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).A MARKED DECREASE IN HALF-YEAR RESULTSAs noted by the Group when publishing its half-year turnover  the half-year results have seen a significant drop. They have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. For AKWEL  these substantial rises represent a cost increase of €31.6 m over the half year and are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices in line with negotiation periods and conditions.In this context  gross operating surplus was down 34.6% to €42.3 m  and current operating income fell by 64.6% to €17.7 m  i.e. a current operating margin of 3.6% of turnover  down by 6.7 points. Financial income fell by €9.4 m as a result of the application of the IAS 29 standard mentioned above. Tax charges accounted for €5.1 m compared to €12.2 m in the first half of 2021  leading to a net income Group share of €1.9 m (net margin of 0.4%).Free cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. After payment of the dividend and loan repayments totalling €22.1 m  the Group’s net cash position (including debts on lease obligations) at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.CREATION OF A THIRD AREA OF EXPERTISEAmong its priorities  the Group has set itself the target of accelerating the development of its product potential in 2022 as part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles while also continuing its existing development of the TAMIC brake particle recovery solution. In addition to fluid management and mechanisms  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts. As such  the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles while building on its existing technological expertise and resources  resulting in easier management of product and industrial risks.OUTLOOKS FOR THE 2022 FINANCIAL YEARIn a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year  with the third quarter expected to bring good performance. Against the backdrop of inflation and the continued impact of supply difficulties on manufacturers’ activities  the Group nonetheless remains cautious about forecasts for the sector  despite the fact that the first effects of sales price increases should be seen in the second half of the year.Next press release: turnover for the third quarter of 2022  10 November 2022  after markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles. The Group achieves this by relying on state-of-the-art industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Euronext Paris – Compartment B – ISIN: FR0000053027 – Reuters: AKW.PA – Bloomberg: AKW:FPContactsAKWELGrégory Voisin – Financial VP – Tel.: +33 4 50 56 99 25EKNO – Press RelationsJean-Marc Atlan – jean-marc.atlan@ekno.fr – Tel.: +33 6 07 37 20 44CALYPTUS – Investor RelationsMathieu Calleux – akwel@calyptus.net – Tel.: +33 1 53 65 68 681 Source: S&P Global MobilityAttachment,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,mixed,0.12,0.24,0.64,True,English,"['1st\xa0HALF', 'AKWEL', 'PUBLICATION', 'RESULTS', 'THE', 'TAMIC brake particle recovery solution', 'S&P Global Mobility Attachment', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'net income Group share', 'global vehicle production', 'A MARKED DECREASE', 'Free cash-flow generation', 'battery pack interiors', 'service battery casings', 'Grégory Voisin', 'gross operating surplus', 'net cash position', 'Current operating income', 'sales price increases', 'Next press release', 'Current operating margin', 'independent, family-owned group', 'significant price inflation', 'global automotive market', 'moderate turnover growth', 'existing technological expertise', 'Net margin', 'Financial income', 'strong growth', 'significant drop', 'sales prices', 'Press Relations', 'Net result', 'French English', '1st HALF', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'executive board', 'Audit reports', 'Consolidated data', 'INCREASING ACTIVITY', 'first half', 'first time', 'IAS 29 standard', 'financial reporting', 'hyperinflationary economies', 'Turkish subsidiaries', 'supply limitations', 'North America', 'raw materials', 'substantial rises', 'cost increase', 'negotiation periods', 'Tax charges', 'loan repayments', 'lease obligations', 'THIRD AREA', 'hydrogen-powered vehicles', 'existing development', 'fluid management', 'electric vehicles', 'electronic modules', 'EV flaps', 'cable ducts', 'many opportunities', 'rapid roll-out', 'easier management', 'third quarter', 'good performance', 'continued impact', 'supply difficulties', 'manufacturers’ activities', 'first effects', 'second half', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'Compartment B', 'Financial VP', 'Jean-Marc Atlan', 'Investor Relations', 'Mathieu Calleux', '2022 half-yearly results', 'HALF-YEAR RESULTS', 'half year', '2022 FINANCIAL YEAR', 'consolidated turnover', 'half-year turnover', 'structural components', 'product potential', 'industrial risks', 'AKW.PA', 'The Group', 'Thursday', 'PUBLICATION', 'AKWEL', 'PEA', '19 September', 'millions', 'Var.', 'Revenue', 'EBITDA', 'TURBULENT', 'basis', 'application', 'readjustment', 'figure', 'July', 'energy', 'transport', 'labour', 'line', 'conditions', 'context', '6.7 points', 'dividend', 'debts', '30 June', '31 December', 'CREATION', 'priorities', 'target', 'transition', 'addition', 'mechanisms', 'examples', 'resources', 'OUTLOOKS', 'forecast', 'backdrop', 'sector', 'markets', 'state', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'Contacts', 'Tel.', 'EKNO', 'marc.', 'CALYPTUS', '1 Source', '€', '33 4 50']",2022-09-22,2022-09-23,globenewswire.com

A …,English DutchCapelle aan den IJssel  The Netherlands – 22 September 2022 – GeoJunxion (GOJXN.AS) announces it has granted share options to all its employees and to a limited selection of its long-standing contractors as incentive award towards long term value creation. A total of 81.600 shares options were awarded at a strike price of Euro 1 787. The strike price corresponds to the 90 days moving average of the share price as per 1 July 2022. The share options have an average vesting period of 2 5 years and will vest in four equal quarterly portions  starting on 1 July 2024. They will vest at the 90 days average closing prices of the GOJXN stock in the period immediately preceding the vesting date. The settlement will be in ordinary shares of the company.This is the third time that share options have been granted under such a scheme. The initial grant was announced in a press release dated 29 October 2020 and then  a second grant announced on 1 November 2021.GeoJunxion also announces the first quarterly vesting of the share options awarded in 2020. The vesting date is 1 July 2022  exactly 2 years after the options were granted. As a result of this first vesting  a total of 1.407 ordinary GeoJunxion shares will be granted to participants: 1.145 have been issued  262 will be issued at the latest in April 2023. Going forward quarterly vesting will take place on 1 October  1 January  1 April and 1 July.After the 2022 share options award and the first vesting per 1 July 2022  a total of 163.755 share options remains open.The Supervisory and Management boards believe that granting employees the possibility to benefit from the improved operating results of the Company  through the allocation of share options  will lead to stronger engagement and ultimately better performances. This aligns GeoJunxion employees' interests with those of the shareholders  to focus on long-term and sustainable value creation.GeoJunxion also takes this opportunity to communicate that the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the Accounting Year 2021-22 will be published without the opinion of an Auditor. All six PIE/OOB Licensed Auditing Firms in The Netherlands have declined the requests of the Company for auditing services. In view of the significant improvements the company has made in its financial performance  the simplification of its subsidiary structure  risk management and internal control processes  the Supervisory and Management boards were expecting favorable input from at least one auditing firm.GeoJunxion hopes that the proposed legislation regarding the future of the Dutch Accountancy Sector (voorstel voor de Wet toekomst accountancysector) will provide a timely resolution to ensure that next years’ annual accounts will be audited. This legislative initiative includes a proposed process whereby the NBA (Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants)  at the request of the company  can assign a PIE/OOB licensed auditor and determine a reasonable fee for the auditing activities.---END---About GeoJunxionGeoJunxion is the crossroads where fundamental  location-aware content connects with superior  customized intelligence and highly focused innovations to empower exceptional experiences.

First-half revenues temporarily grew less quickly than expenses  linked in part to the impact of inflation  but above all to absorb the strong growth that the Group expects to achieve over the coming half-year periods and particularly the second half of this year.Extract from the condensed half-year consolidated financial statements approved by the Board of Directors on September 22  2022At 30 June (€m)H1 2022H1 2021Change Value % Revenues 84.0 75.4 +8.6 +11% EBITDA 11.2 14.3 (3.1) -22% % revenues 13.3% 19.0% Current operating income 3.9 8.6 (4.7) -55% % revenues 4.6% 11.4% Operating income 2.5 8.0 (5.5) - Pre-tax income 2.1 6.9 (4.8) - Net income 1.2 5.1 (3.8) -Sustained growth maintained during the first half of 2022The LUMIBIRD Group’s consolidated revenues came to €84.0m at June 30  2022  up 11% (+9% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). This growth is split equally across the Photonics and Medical divisions  although with various deliveries deferred from one quarter to another depending on the business segments.For the Photonics division  the contrasting levels of progress do not necessarily reflect the overall trend. The Industrial and Scientific business lines recorded first-half growth of +2% (to €17.4m)  while the Lidar business climbed +48% to €11.0m  with an increase in sales for both Lidar and OEM systems. The Defense / Space business was stable during the first half of the year (+1% to €10.2m). On May 31  2022  Lumibird Photonics Sweden  which took on the laser rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  became operational. Its first-half contribution was marginal (€0.36m).The Medical division  with first-half growth of +11% (€45.4m)  benefited from an acceleration in sales  particularly in the United States and Japan  where the strengthening of the sales teams and the extension of the product range are reflected in very positive trends.Contrasting contributions for the two divisionsSummary of results for each division(€m)Photonics Medical 2021-H1 2022-H1 Change (%) 2021 –H1 2022-H2 Change (%) Revenues 34.7 38.7 +11.3% 40.7 45.4 +11.5% Gross margin 23.2 24.7 +6.4% 24.4 27.7 +13.6% % 66.9% 64.0% 60.0% 61.1% EBITDA 6.7 3.7 -43.8% 7.6 7.5 -2.4% % 19.2% 9.7% 18.8% 16.4% Current op. income 3.7 (0.8) -123% 4.9 4.7 -3.1% % 10.7% (2.2)% 11.9% 10.4%The Group’s gross margin rate is still high  at 62.4%  compared with 63.1% in H1 2021. However  this change shows differences for the two divisions  mainly as a result of a price effect  which was more favorable for the Medical division (61.1% gross margin vs 60.0% in H1 2021)  in which the price rises can be passed on almost immediately  while the Photonics division (64.0% vs 66.9%) is held back by a structure of longer-term contracts.During the first half of 2022  LUMIBIRD recorded €11.2m of EBITDA  representing 13.3% of revenues  compared with 19.0% one year earlier  linked to the structuring of the organization looking ahead to a higher level of business in 2022 and beyond. The structuring investments began during H2 2021 and continued in H1 2022. This will enable the Group to deliver the growth and operational performance expected.The temporary contraction in profitability can be seen more for the Photonics division (EBITDA margin of 9.7% vs 19.2% in H1 2021) than the Medical division (16.4% vs 18.8% in H1 2021). This mainly reflects the additional structural costs recorded by the Photonics division to prepare for future growth.First-half income from ordinary operations came to €3.9m  compared with €8.6m for the first half of 2021.Following -€0.4m of financial income and expenses (vs -€1.1m in H1 2021) and €0.9m of taxes (vs €1.8m in H1 2021)  net income totaled €1.2m  compared with €5.1m for the first half of 2021.Cash flow: capex and increase in inventory to prepare for the future(€m) 30/06/2021 30/06/2022 Net cash-flow from operations 8.1 (10.2) Operating cash-flow before interests and tax 14.5 11.0 Change in WCR (7.7) (20.1) Taxes paid 1.3 (1.0) Net cash-flow from investing activities (7.7) (18.2) Capital expenditures (4.8) (10.6) External growth (2.3) (7.2) Other financial assets investments (0.5) (0.4) Net cash-flow from financing activities (1.0) (0.7) Capital increase - - Net loans issuance (0.1) 1.3 Financing cost (0.8) (1.3) Other change (0.1) (0.7) NET CASH FLOW 1 (0.6) (29.1)The combined impacts of the component crisis and the preparations for a strong level of production in the second half of the year resulted in a significant increase in inventory levels (+€11.2m) at end-June. The investments in industrial facilities  including the expansion of the Lannion site  the creation of the Gothenburg site to incorporate the rangefinder activities (previously SAAB)  and the preparation of the new site to take on the activities from Les Ulis (€5.2m)  also had a significant impact on first-half capex.

The investments made in the Group’s industrial facilities and the strengthening of its capacity are expected to support a strong level of commercial development over the coming half-year periods.In this context  the Group is confirming its objectives for 2023 reported revenues of €250m  driven by organic and external growth  with its EBITDA margin to continue increasing within a 20%-25% range.Next date:Q3 2022 revenues on October 24  2022 after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers.

This project brought together several European industries such as Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  with the objective of demonstrating the conversion of wood residues into sustainable high-performance components for road and aviation fuels  and thus participate to the decarbonization efforts of ground and air transportation. The project was coordinated by Global Bioenergies and received €13.8 million in funding from the European Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.The project  otherwise known by its full name  “Residual Wood Conversion to High-performance drop-in Biofuels”  was funded under contract n° 792104 through the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA). Beside Global Bioenergies  Repsol  Sekab and Fibenol  the project also involved SkyNRG  Peab  Neste  IPSB  Technip FMC  Metex NoovistaGo and the Energie Institut JKU.For this project  sugars from wood were supplied by Sekab and Fibenol.Tino Lassmann  Project Manager at Sekab said: “Our technology to produce second generation sugars is considered to be among the best in the world  especially when it comes to wood as raw material. We are convinced of its many values and possibilities as a way to reducing our environmental footprint. We are proud to have been a part of REWOFUEL together with other leading players in the European bioeconomy and we will continue the cooperation towards a more sustainable world.”Peep Pitk  Chief Development Officer at Fibenol said: “We have been impressed by the performance of Global Bioenergies’ bio-isobutene process with our wood sugars. From 2023 we are producing these wood sugars at 20 000 tons per year capacity at our plant in Imavere  Estonia and looking forward to taking this collaboration to the next level.”These sugars were then processed into high performance sustainable biofuels.Bernard Chaud  Head of Industrial Strategy at Global Bioenergies  said: “We have shown that bio-isobutene produced from second generation sugars from wood can be used to produce both octane booster for road transportation as well as Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”As a result  batches of bio-isooctane  bio-ETBE and sustainable aviation fuel have been produced by Global Bioenergies and then tested by Repsol  Spain’s leading oil company.Javier Marcos González  Project Manager at Repsol said: “The initial tests we conducted were satisfactory. Having these isobutene derivatives from second-generation renewable resources would be a significant step forward for the fuel industry.”Batches of sustainable aviation fuel were produced and transferred to SkyNRG  leader in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Significant work has been coordinated by SkyNRG for the certification of these isobutene derivatives as a sustainable aviation fuel.Maarten van Dijk  Chief Development Officer at SkyNRG said: “For the aviation industry to lower its carbon footprint and meet European targets on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)  we need to keep developing new production pathways  with the aim to unlock new sustainable feedstock sources and increase conversion efficiencies. The REWOFUEL project has proven to be able to do exactly this. We have been impressed by the drive of all partners to make this project a success and by the innovative platform of Global Bioenergies in particular. We are looking forward to the next scale-up step and hope to see Global Bioenergies’ sustainable aviation fuel in commercial aircraft in the future.”Meanwhile  by-products from the ligneous part of wood chips have been incorporated by Peab into successfully implemented bitumen products. Producing bitumen with a better environmental footprint will help to optimise overall road transport performance.The proteins resulting from fermentation are intended to be used in animal feed. The experiments conducted by Metex NoovistaGo in this respect have produced positive results.Finally  the Energie Institut JKU has carried out life cycle analyses of the various segments of this value chain and has quantified the reduction in CO 2 emissions according to different configurations  which can lead to savings of up to 85% compared to the benchmark fossil solution.Meanwhile  engineering efforts have been conducted by Neste   Technip-FMC  and IPSB  a French engineering company specialized in agribusinesses.Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  added: “This REWOFUEL project has brought together players from different fields to assemble an industrial value chain aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of air and road transportation. These sectors are at the heart of the environmental debate: transportation based on thermal engines must switch to renewable energy if it wants to survive in the coming decades. Air transport must also reduce its environmental impact. The players of the REWOFUEL project will maintain relations beyond the project to make the prospects more concrete.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST® in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane® 12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint.

Despite an estimated $17.1 trillion in ""sustainable"" investments at stake  there are few standards for marketing investments that consider environmental  social  and governance factors. Moreover  concerns around greenwashing and exaggerated ESG claims remain a top priority for the SEC as it has stepped up enforcement efforts on this score. Against this background  the SEC has issued two new rulemaking proposals and a request for comment. The comment period for these releases concluded in August.In a new Strategic Perspective entitled ""SEC targets ESG asset managers and fuels critics""  Wolters Kluwer legal experts consider the increasingly vocal opponents to ESG investing  as well as examine reactions to the SEC rule proposals  including the likelihood of adoption and legal challenges.Additionally  the Strategic Perspective includes the views and insights from two of today's leading legal practitioners in the asset management space  Gwen Williamson  partner in the Investment Management group at Perkins Coie  and Howard Sidman  partner in the Financial Markets practice at Jones Day.Who: Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; and Matthew Garza  J.D.  Managing EditorLike a nutrition label  the SEC's proposed ESG disclosures for advisers and funds aim to give investors greater confidence that ESG claims mean something real. There are disagreements as to specifics  but overall there appears to be broad support for the goal of improving ESG information for investors.- Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystThe wide range of public comments received in connection with the SEC's ""Names Rule"" demonstrates that the war over ESG investing and its regulation is alive and well. While supporters of the SEC's initiative see the proposals as a means to prevent greenwashing and enhancing investor understanding  opponents view the very same proposed rules as furthering confusion  complexity  and devoid of any corresponding benefits to the public.- Brad Rosen  J.D.

WainwrightJeroen Van den Bossche - KBC SecuritiesAlex Cogut - Bryan  GarnierDelphine Le Louët - Société GénéraleOperatorGood day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Inventiva 2022 Half Year Results and Webcast. At this time  all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation  there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]Please note that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand over to your speaker  Mr. Frédéric Cren  CEO and Co-Founder. Please go ahead.Frédéric CrenThank you  and welcome  everybody  to this half year webcast. As usual  some disclaimer  we will be making forward-looking statements. So please have a look at our regulatory filings that are available on our website.In terms of speakers  I would say  we have the classical imperative team  myself and Pierre  the Co-Founder of the company; with Michael  our CMO; and Jean  our CFO. But today  it’s a special day for Inventiva given the recent partnership we signed with Sino Biopharm lanifibranor. We are very pleased to have with us Philip Duong  Head of Investment  who will give us an overview of Sino Biopharm activity.In terms of agenda  I will give an highlight of the activity over the past six months and then I will share the floor with Philip  with Pierre  with Michael to provide a pipeline update. We will move to the financial section with Jean  near-term catalyst and then we will open the floor for Q&A.So moving now to the highlight section  we will start first with lani  our Phase III drug in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH. Importantly  a lot of improvement  a lot of key important milestones has been reached in the past six months.In terms of NATiV3  we have expanded in 24 countries and we have now activated to 300 sites in the trial and in the presentation  we will give you a bit more detail on the improvement in terms of site.Very pleased  as I mentioned in my introduction of the very recent collaboration with signing with Sino Biopharm and the expansion of lani in Greater China  a country that we see is really promising from a commercial point of view  given the prevalence of NASH among the Chinese population.Some of the figures or the key figures of the collaboration I will highlight here  the upfront  the total milestone  the royalties and we will get a bit more in detail in the presentation.In terms of recruitment  we have had to announce a delay of the inclusion of the last patient to H2 2023  despite all the improvement in terms of site opening  country opening  site activation  but we see that all the actions that we have launched still have not fully paid out  especially we are still encountering a screening failure higher than expected and this has led to this delay.As you know  we have two other very important Phase II that are ongoing  one that we call LEGEND  which is a combination of lani with empagliflozin. We started the screening  opening sites and randomizing patients as planned  first in the United States  but we also secured the regulatory approval and activation in the other countries where this study is taking place.And then we are pleased with Professor Cusi ability to enroll the last patient in the trial over the summer  a bit later than anticipated. But in terms of results are not expected in H2  but in Q1 2023.Moving now to cedirogant  ABBV-157  there now  I would say  we -- we are expecting with a lot of excitement  the result of the Phase IIb in patients with psoriasis  which are expected in H1 2023.Odiparcil and this is  I would say  another or really an update on this conference. We have had over the summer an important meeting with the FDA  and we are very pleased with the outcome and the feedback provided with the FDA. We know that we can go directly now into children age of five to 15 -- five to 14 with MPS VI. We know that the design we presented to the FDA  which is a single Phase II/III trial can potentially support marketing application. This gives us confidence in the search of opportunities to find a new home for odiparcil and really seeing this feedback provided by the FDA really goes into the right direction for this project.Finally  on the financials  we have been continuing to reinforce our cash position both with dilutive and non-dilutive sources. We have had close to €50 million through a combination of At-The-Market program  which I will remind you is managed by Jefferies and it’s only made of rigorous inquiries and also some non-dilutive funding coming from state-backed financing from the French -- France.We also are very pleased from the European Investment Bank loan that we secured. €50 million loan award agreement of two tranches of 25% and 25%. And we are pleased by the fact that with the upfront that we are expected to receive from our partner Sino  we will be able to secure the first tranche from EIB and this would extend our cash run way in Q4 of 2023.And then  lastly  also the recognition of being selected by Euronext as part of the Euronext Tech Leaders. So in this important index is also a nice recognition of the work that has been done so far.Let’s now move to lani  I just would like first before entering into the details give a bit of an overview of the competitive landscape in NASH. It’s nice to see that positive news happening in the field with recent data from our peer [ph] and others.Now when we look at the landscape  I think all eyes are pointed to the part one of Phase III results that are expected from the waste material and then you see that from this slide  you see that lani really well positioned in terms of timing of when the results will be available and were really part of this limited number of promising compounds that are now in Phase III or planning to enter into Phase III.When we look at the competitor  actually we can divide them into two sections. We have the oral drug and the injectables. When we look at the oral drug  we are really extremely well positioned as the only oral drug that has met really the two important endpoints that are considered by FDA and NDA for approval for NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis.And there is another section where you have injectables with recent data from Cure  where they too have managed to secure hitting both end points with the difference that we highlight here. Our results are based on ITT population that  as you know  is a population that is considered by regulatory authority for approval and there we are going statistical significance on both endpoints  where the results presented by competitors are mostly based on per protocol population or even when you consider Europe from competitors.So now let’s move to lani  and before we get into NATiV3  I would like just to give some of the highlights of the licensing and commercialization agreement we signed recently and then I give the floor to Philip for the presentation of that.Why we decided buy this opportunity is because China and Greater China is in terms of national position very attractive. Of course  vast population  but it also when we look at the prevalence of NASH  there are publication and increasing number of publications that show that the prevalence of NASH among this population is close or sometimes even superior to what is experienced in the United States.Secondly  we are also excited because we -- when we look at who is currently in development in China  we see that only semaglutide out of the compound that I described before is present with a compound that is an injectable and that has not been able to show their Phase IIb in pre-cirrhotic patients  but also in the cirrhotic patients have not been able to show an anti-fibrotic activity. We really believe lani  especially with the partner of the quality of Sino Biopharm is really well positioned to be potentially a leader in this -- in the NASH field in China.In terms of financials  so these are the highlights that have been described in the press release  an upfront and expected upfront of $20 million  followed by short-term clinical milestone that could potentially trigger an additional $5 million. And then globally  the deal contemplates a total of $290 million of clinical  regulatory and commercial life.In terms of royalties  there is a first period of three years where to sustain -- to help on the launch  the royalty will go from high single-digit to mid single-digit and starting from the fourth year from low double-digit to mid single-digit.Then in terms of regulatory  in terms of development strategy  there are several large terms that needs to discussed  especially with regulatory authorities. Two main obviously we see viable. One would be for Sino Biopharm to join the global NATiV3study or the other alternative will be to run an independent study. Important to point out  of course  that all the costs lead to the development in Greater China will be borne by our partners.So  with that  I will give the floor to Philip that will give us a quick overview of Sino Biopharma and then  therefore  moving to page 14 of the presentation.Philip DuongThanks  Frédéric. Just to check if you can hear me.Frédéric CrenPerfectly.Philip DuongPerfect. Okay. Thanks  Frédéric  and thank you for the Inventiva team during the collaboration discussions and sort of a fruitful outcome and we look forward to sort of collaborating with Inventiva in the long-term going forward.So I will give a quick background on Sino Biopharm and I am currently looking at page 14. So Sino Biopharm  for those of you that don’t know Sino Biopharm  we are one of the largest  actually  if not the largest Chinese pharmaceutical group in China.We are listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2003. We currently have a market cap of slightly over US$10 billion and then last year  we had revenues of US$4 billion. Globally  we are ranked the 40th largest pharmaceutical globally by Pharm Exec’s  which is the largest in China  as I mentioned.So through our subsidiaries  we operate a fully integrated pharmaceutical operations from discovery to clinical development to manufacturing and sales. We started up as generics back in the ‘80s and we have moved towards innovation in the last decade. So we have significant R&D capabilities with over 68 innovative assets in the pipeline and seven of those are focused on liver diseases. We also have U.S. and EU qualified manufacturing capabilities in API  small molecules and biologics.I think from a commercialization perspective for lani  it’s quite important to note that we have the largest sales reps -- sales and marketing reps in China with over -- with almost 14 000 reps covering basically the entire Chinese or the entire China. And we both do it through traditional sales channels  so the hospital sales channels  as well as emerging channels such as online channels  as well as the pharmacy chains.In hepatology  we have a proven track record with over 17% market share  and this is from IMS data  and that’s more than double our closest competitor.Sino Biopharm  it’s run -- it’s a -- it’s privately owned by the Tse family. It’s currently run by the second generation. So it’s a very entrepreneurial and agile organization. And our family -- the family owners have their backgrounds from Thailand actually and they have been in the Chinese market since the 1980s.Next page  please  page 15. So the way to think about Sino Biopharm really is  we are a group of operating companies where together we form basically where we provide a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem to the Chinese market.On the top here  we have our pharmaceuticals. So the key partner for Inventiva will be CTTQ  which is on the top left corner and CTTQ itself is a fully integrated pharmaceutical company with key therapeutic areas in liver health and in addition to that oncology and respiratory. We also have a lot of other pharmaceuticals  but we listed our largest ones here.I think  importantly  for collaboration  we are also very large investors in the online health  for example  we are the largest investors in Medlinker. Medlinker is the leading online platform for chronic disease management in China and this is a key channel for liver products in China  where we have over 800 000 doctors on our platform or on this platform.We are also present globally through invoX  which we established in 2020  where we have done recent acquisitions in F-star  Softhale  Fion [ph] and also associated with the Karolinska Institute Group through Karolinska Development. And we are also present in vaccines where we work closely with Sinovac where they developed the corona back vaccine back in 2020.On to the next page  please. So this is basically an overview of the platform we have. I think there’s a couple of important points to note for lani and how we can bring success to this in China. So one  we have a very large clinical development team of over 500 people in China  which will help accelerate clinical enrollments.We also have a lot of manufacturing sites spread across the country in both API and small molecules. So we are quite confident we can lower the COGS  which is important for countries where pricing is not as high like China. And we also have one of -- we have the largest sales team in China with over 13 000 reps covering the entire China  covering about 90% of the hospital channels.And then if we move on to page 17. What I’d like to leave off is  Sino Biopharm through CTTQ has a very  very long history in the liver space starting with hepatitis  as well as liver protection  which is quite an Asian concept  but is quite big in China. Like I mentioned  we have market share that’s more than double our second largest competitor in the hepatology space.We have a lot of blockbusters in the liver space  which is  one is Entecavir Runzhong  which we did $4.6 billion of sales in 2018  which was basically unheard of for in this space. We also have an innovative product called Ganme [ph]  which is basically -- mostly used against -- usually for hepatitis B patients  but it’s the nation concept of liver protection  which is actually closely quite linked to NASH  where we did $20 -- $2 billion of sales last year and has been consistently growing since we have launched this product 10 years ago. We also have a healthy innovative pipeline within this space  where we think there could be potential opportunities to establish or to explore combination treatments in the future.With that being said  I think that’s the introduction on Sino Biopharm and I will pass it back to Frédéric for the rest.Frédéric CrenYes. Yeah. Thank you  Philip. So I think everybody can understand why we are very excited by this partnership and the opportunity that it opens up. So moving back to NATiV3. So where do we stand? The progress now  24 countries are included in operation and we have secured full regulatory approval on 23 out of that. We have closed activities in Ukraine and also decided not to move forward in Russia.Where we stand if this is a situation at the end of August? So we have qualified 463 sites and 297 are activated. So really strong progress there. However  if you follow my introduction  if we look at the impact from the war in Ukraine and Russia  the COVID pandemic  we see that despite the implementation of the measure that has led to the increase of the number of sites  we are still facing a recruitment that is behind our expectation and this is mainly due to a little of ray [ph] that is higher than anticipated and this really led to the communication last night that we see that now the last patient first visit for the Part 1 is now targeted for the second half of 2023 versus H1 2023 as previously commuted.That for NATiV3 and now -- I will now hand over to Michael  who will give you an update on the two phases that are ongoing  so the one led by Professor Cusi in the combo static called LEGEND.Michael CooremanThank you  Frédéric. As you mentioned  there are two studies that are in Phase II. One is on slide 20  a study that aims to provide more information on data on the mechanism of action of lanifibranor as a fund agonist in patients who have not only have type 2 diabetes to conditions that occur often in the same patient  given the similar underlying disease biology.Specifically  this study aims to show that lanifibranor decreases intrahepatic triglyceride content  improves any cirrhosis  specifically the insulin sensitivity thereof and also insulin sensitivity in hepatic and muscle tissue  which is a core mechanism of action of Hippo signaling  endogenous hepatic glucose production and markers of cardiometabolic health. The investing the principle is one type study and sponsor and principal investigators  Ken Cusi at University of Florida.The total of 34 patients with that of the type 2 diabetes are enrolled and to have reference values. There are also data from 10 healthy individuals who are non-obese and whose data will serve as reference. These volunteer participants do not receive investigational compounds. Sample size is calculated on the effect size of more than 50% reduction of intrahepatic fat  which is also based on data that are available for how [inaudible] work in this indication -- in this finding.The primary endpoint is a change in intrahepatic triglyceride 25 by MR spectroscopy and so baseline compared to 24. And in addition  there’s a lot of secondary endpoint that will provide a kind of a comprehensive picture on how lanifibranor improves metabolic health in these patients  starting from insilicosystems  NAFLD solution defined as patients with a very low intrahepatic triglyceride content  change in hepatic fibrosis measured with elastography  MRI-based and ultrasound based MRE and FibroScan  as well as biomarkers  and of course  also safety and tolerability markers. The results will be expected for early 2023. All patients are enrolled. Due to a little delay the last patient started  the results will be expected in the first quarter of 2023.So go to the next slide  slide 21. This is the so-called LEGEND study is an acronym and it is essentially a combination of lanifibranor and SGLT2 inhibitor  empagliflozin in patients who have NASH and type 2 diabetes.The rationale for the combination of these two compounds is very strong as SGLT2 inhibitors provide additional metabolic benefits to lanifibranor. And we  therefore  are a very attractive way to explore the additional benefits of this combination in the proof-of-concept setting.The study is done with two principal investigators  Dr. Dr. Michelle Lai  Harvard and Onno Holleboom from the University of Amsterdam. We have around 40 sites  which are in four countries in the U.S.  in the U.K.  in the Netherlands  Belgium or France of five countries. The FDA -- the IND is open. The study has started. The first site was activated in the first half of 2022 and we expect topline results in the second half of next year.Patients -- adult patients with type 2 diabetes and NASH are to be included in the primary efficacy outcome is HbA1c  which is a mark  of course  of insilicosystems and metabolism  which is also relevant for -- in the disease pathway of NASH in addition to type 2 diabetes.And here  also  we have a broad spectrum of secondary efficacy measures  including imaging -- MRI-based imaging  which will give information about the distribution of that adipose tissue naturally in the liver and also an overall composition of fat  which is quite important in evaluating to what extent that is related to insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity. In other words  metabolically unhealthy or healthy adipose tissue of glucose and lipid metabolism markers of inflammation  body weight and other safety and tolerability issues  of course.So wealth of data. The study will enroll 63 patients and the treatment is half a year. So randomized study  randomized double blind for lanifibranor and placebo  open label for the composition  lanifibranor plus empagliflozin is one ARM  lanifibranor alone is another arm and placebo is the third arm.Next slide  mentioned aside  run in these five countries in Europe and the United States. We have the study approved in France and U.S. and its running better and submissions are completed in the remaining countries. So we expect topline results in 2023 -- in the second half of 2023.So  overall  when you go to slide 23  in the next coming years  we will have a regular announcement of availability of data on the efficacy of lanifibranor in clinical settings to start with in the first quarter of next year  the data from the study run by Cusi in Florida  topline results from the Phase II trial in patients with NAFLD type 2 diabetes.Then the year thereafter in the second half of 2023  so the same year  in the results -- the topline results from the LEGEND study in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes  the combination of lanifibranor with impact lymphoid and then in the second half of 2025  the topline results of Part 1 of the current pivotal NATiV3 study currently ongoing  of course  and wells in its way in patients with NASH and significant fibrosis F2 and F3. And that’s it for me. So…Frédéric CrenThank you  Michael. And I will give a very brief update on ABBV-157  here again the -- our again [inaudible] security in Phase IIb with our partner AbbVie. We were last week in Chicago and we are extremely pleased with the progress of this molecule. You know that we are extremely excited by this mechanic of action. We are again has a possibility really to suppress IL-17F gene expression  but as you know  is a validated target in clinic.Clearly  the potential of a once-daily orally available ROR gamma with a target product profile that  as you know  that we have said in the past  what we are targeting is the Humira efficacy with better safety in the end of a company like AbbVie that has such a strong expertise in optimal disease  really something that really excites us and we really think we have a little to do here in our pipeline.The meeting with other day in Chicago was really great. We see that the real excitement around this molecule. Now we have to wait for the Phase IIb trial that is currently ongoing. This is 200 patients  15 weeks  a trial in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and that the primary end point  there is a measurement of 75.Also worthwhile noting that in parallel  AbbVie has launched a Phase I that is needed to start Phase III  so too positive to see that plans are in place to in the case of success. And then I would say that for us now just need to wait for the results of the Phase IIb  which as indicated in clinicaltrials.gov  the results -- the trial is expected to end in Q1 2023  so result -- we should have the results in the first half of next year.We also  of course  we are excited is also because we are financially rewarded by the mix of milestone  but especially royalties that start from mid-single digits and can reach double-digit level. And of course  this drug is approved. We are convinced  given making of action  given the potential of the market in the autoimmune space and the capabilities of our partner AbbVie that this product has the potential to really be a meaningful source of revenue in the future for Inventiva.So that was the very AbbVie update and let’s move to odiparcil and Pierre will give you latest on this program.Pierre BroquaYeah. Thank you  Frédéric. So  yes  we are very excited to update you on the odiparcil program. But I just like to start with a recap on MPS and [inaudible] action on Page 27. So as you know  MPS are innovative disorders that are characterized by the dysfunction of lysosomal enzymes  which are required for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans  the GAGs. Within this family of disorders  MPS VI is caused by mutation in ERT SBT [ph]  which encodes the enzyme leading or responsible for the degradation of DS and CS. So MPS is actually an accumulation of DS  dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in all cells of the body.So then  of course  MPS is a devastating multisystem disease  which is actually leading to a reduced life expectancy up to only the teens or early 20s in the more rapidly advancing cases up to 40 or 50 in slower progressing cases. So today  there is one treatment approved  an enzyme replacement therapy  Naglazyme  which  however  has several limitations due to its poor distribution in the body. And there is  therefore  still a very important medical need for treatment of MPS VI  even in patients that are actually treated with ERT.So the next slide  please. So we have odiparcil  odiparcil is a small orally available molecule that decreases the CS and DS type of GAGs accumulation in disease cells. And this  as you recall  a very unique GAG clearance mechanism of action.On top of that  odiparcil is  of course  all available  well distributed and can penetrate difficult to meet tissues including cartilage bone and cornea  offering  therefore  an opportunity to address the clinical manifestations that are currently not treated by ERT.So we now have conducted a Phase III study called iMProveS in adult MPS VI patients that were at an advanced stage of disease. And in this study  odiparcil found to be safe and to provide beneficial effects in both ERT treated and ERT-naive MPS VI patients and this only after a short treatment duration of six months. Therefore  we believe that there is a conversional for further assessment of odiparcil efficacy in younger patients.Next slide  please. So  overall  odiparcil has a favorable safety profile shown in multiple clinical trials. As you maybe remember  the component is developing previous indication where more than 1 500 patients have been exposed to the drug.On top of the  I would say  very clear efficacy data in MPS VI patients or mice model that we have also published. We see odiparcil will be a potential game changer  has being the first oral therapy with the ability to broadly address a wide range of clinical manifestations in MPS VI patients. This market  as you know  is close to a $400 million market. In addition to that  odiparcil has also the potential to treat other MPS  where CS and DS accumulate such as MPS I  MPS II  MPS IVA and MPS VII.So in MPS VI  next slide  odiparcil aims at improving the treatment options for both ERT eligible and ineligible patients  either as an add-on to ERT or as a monotherapy. We could potentially see the treatment as potential first-line therapy in combination with ERT in ERT eligible patients  also as a monotherapy in ineligible patients.So now let’s dive into the recent FDA discussion. As you recall also from a regulatory perspective  we have obtained odiparcil orphan drug  Fast Track and Rare Pediatric designations and today I would like to report on the recently held FDA meeting that took place last month to discuss the regulatory path for approval  including many objectives  patient population  endpoints  a clarification that we believe will be helpful for future partnership discussions.Next slide  please. So in short  the feedback from FDA was that the single Phase II/III study of one year duration in MPS VI patients five years to 15 years of age would support five-year filing. This pivotal study that we call Prodigy [ph] would be double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled  evaluating the ability of one dose of odiparcil administered in combination with ERT versus placebo in combination with ERT and this to enhance mobility is a primary objective and to improve entrance while reducing fatigue and pay. These are secondary objectives. Primary endpoint will therefore be a 6-minute resistance and secondary endpoints would be 3 minutes per line and pain assessment through a questionnaire.This first part will be followed by a 12-month safety expansion with all patients under odiparcil plus ERT. The study contemplates to enroll 15 pediatric patients for 12 months  potentially leading to the filing of odiparcil approval as ERT or in combination with ERT in patients five years of age 12. So following this feedback from FDA  we believe that odiparcil will represent an attractive partnering opportunity. Thank you.Frédéric CrenThank you  Pierre. Let’s move to the last slide before we wrap up. So we can move with Jean to the update on financials.Jean VolatierSo let’s go through the key financial figures. So -- and you will see it’s quite straightforward in continuity of the prior financial period. I will be happy to answer your question at the end of the meeting.On this slide  one important  obviously  information is the cash position. So as you can see  we maintained a reasonable level of cash versus the end of 2021. So we are at €87 million versus €95 million at the end of last year. So this prior to the consequences of the Chinese deal was allowing us to operate until Q2 2023  and as disclosed and explained the deal with the Sino Biopharm allowed to gather the conditions for reaching the first tranche of the EIB  and therefore  allow us to extend the cash runway through Q4 2023.Let’s go through next slide with the key evolution of the profit and loss account and cash flow. As I said  so no revenues for this semester. As a reminder  Inventiva recorded €4 million milestones from AbbVie in the accounts of last year. But we have been paid early this year and then have a positive effect on our cash flow for this semester.As usually  the key and stable information with regards to R&D investments  which represent more than 80%  still of our total OpEx is the increase in the R&D plus 56%  and it’s still due to the acceleration of the NATiV3 studies primarily and as you have seen some additional studies plus in a lesser extent.If you remember  we have this year a full semester of operation of our U.S. affiliate versus only one quarter in 2021  a reasonable increase [Technical Difficulty] due to the increase in personnel cost by due to the charge related to the share-based payment  which is non-cash payment and also a full semester [Technical Difficulty] last year.The most important impression  as you know  is the cash position  as I said  so €87.2 million without the consequence  as I said  of the Sino Biopharm deal and EIB first tranche. So the net operating cash flow reflects the evolution of the R&D expense essentially  and in a lesser extent  the G&A evolution.The net financing cash flow is very important for the semester. We have succeeded in activating for the third time our ATM program with close to €15 million and we have been able to mobilize soft -- what was soft loan in the back stage loans for €5.3 million. We also took benefit of the favorable evolution of the dollar versus euro with a positive cash impact of €2.4 million.I think this is the key information  again  if you have other questions at the end  I’d be happy to answer. Thank you.Frédéric CrenThank you  Jean. The last slide before we open to Q&A. So what are the next milestone  here is the list of what have been achieved so far. And I would say that we have in front of us two important clinical readouts  one concerning lani  at the beginning of the year  Q1  the results from the study led by Professor Cusi patients with type 2 diabetes in NAFLD and then  of course  the data from the Phase IIb that is currently carried out by our partner AbbVie this year is really  I would say  will be the -- very important event for our company next year.With that  let’s move to Q&A  as the operator will provide you the -- how to ask your question both via the platform or via the telephone.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question coming from the line of Ed Arce from H.C. Wainwright. Please ask your question. Your line is open.Ed ArceHi. Good morning. Can you hear me?Frédéric CrenPerfectly Ed.Ed ArceWonderful. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the deal with Sino Biopharm. I have three questions. First  you mentioned the recent results of Akero were a protocol versus ITT  which is more of a standard and the basis for your results in the Phase IIb. I was wondering if you could talk about how you view the differences of that data and as well your perspective on how the regulatory agencies view the differences of those two  that’s first? Second is  I wanted to ask if -- you mentioned with the Sino Biopharm deal that they could either join NATiV3 or decide to conduct its own Phase III trial. And I wanted to know if they -- if you and Sino decided to have that joined to NATiV3 trial  would that have any impact on the time line? And then lastly  the top line NASH results from NATiV3 looks like it’s still about three years away  second half of 2025  which based on your most recent runway creates about a two-year funding gap. So I am wondering if there are any additional opportunities for funding say from the results from AbbVie or perhaps initial funding from a future partnership on odiparcil? Thanks so much.Frédéric CrenThank you  Ed. So very  very cumulative question so oh I got to take off sorry. I will try again  sorry  can you hear me?Ed ArceYes. I can hear you fine.Frédéric CrenOkay. Sorry  we just had a terrible echo here. So  on the first question  maybe Pierre and Michael will complete for me  the difference protocol versus ITT. I just think it’s important just because of Akero produce some slides where they used and compared the Phase II data  I think it’s important also to have a complete picture. And from what they said in their own presentation is that if they had used an ITT approach  they would have lost statistical significance on -- I think  on the NASH resolution one.And therefore  in that case  we could claim to be the only drug that has made will lead to both a regulatory endpoint. But nevertheless  I just think it’s important that we retain that because on the Phase III  what the regulatory authorities will be looking is the data from the ITT and the fact that we were able in the Phase IIb to be sustained on that population give us more confident or even greater confidence that we will succeed in our Phase III.Then I will ask the second question and Philip don’t hesitate to complete my answer. So your question was  in the event biopharm joins the NATiV3 would that have an impact on the time line. I would say that it’s too soon to mention that. It will certainly contribute and help in our recruitment effort because the patient that would be recruited in China would account in the patient needed for Part 1. But we are prudent and therefore  we do not -- we don’t take this upside in our projection. And then last  I don’t know  Philip  anything you would like to add to this?Philip DuongYes. Thanks  Frédéric  and thanks for the question  Ed. I think in terms of our clinical enrollment capabilities  I think we can quite quickly enroll patients. Obviously  it’s subject to multiple factors  simply CD regulatory approval and such.But I think once or if we do go down the route of a global multicenter trial. I think we are quite confident that our capabilities to sort of quickly open sites as well as leverage scale networks to sort of recruit the patients quite quickly to sort of not delay the timetable from Inventiva site.Frédéric CrenThanks Philip and then last question about the two-year funding gap until the Part 1 read out. I think there are two ways to read it -- it’s a glass of LT. We can also read given the difficult times in the market if Inventiva secured financing until Q4 2023.And also as you mentioned  I think we have several opportunities so that are both dilutive and non-dilutive -- on the dilutive  we have an APM open  and we have always benefited from the support of front enrollment.And then on the non-dilutive side yes  we are excited by the discussion with the FDA for the feedback  which according to us reinforces the rationale for odiparcil  continue develop in MPS VI and we have not changed our strategy. We do not want to develop odiparcil on our own. We think it’s a good candidate for partnering. Will we succeed it too soon to say  but the FDA feedback gave us confidence.And then also  I think lani is a very attractive compound  and there are other geographic areas beyond China where the bartering would make a lot of sense. And then finally  as the partnership in the short-term  we -- if they decide to move into Phase III  of course  this will trigger a milestone. But always like to receive it  but you know that we have always said that in this contract  what is really material are the royalties and not the milestone.But if next year  the program moving to Phase III  Inventiva will have a very promising asset like lani NASH and the drug in Phase III in psoriasis  maybe potentially other [inaudible] disease indication finance and carried out by AbbVie  so I really think an interesting value proposition to investors.Ed ArceGreat. That’s all right. Thank you.Frédéric CrenThank you. And I think we were expecting a question from Jeroen and we don’t hear him?Jeroen Van den BosscheHello.Frédéric CrenYes. We can hear you now.Jeroen Van den BosscheHi. Sorry  there seems to be echo here on the line. Congrats also from KBC with regards to the Sino Biopharma deal and with the results for odiparcil  maybe from my end and following up on the Akero a little bit. NASH clearly has been a little bit more of a challenge over the past years? Do you see renewed interest from investors  do you believe that also with more and more people refocusing on it  there will be non-invasive  let’s say  like diagnostic methods coming online? And maybe one last question -- you guys can give me or us an estimate of the NASH size in China?Frédéric CrenAll right. On the first question  I would say yes  in the sense that good news from other competitors like Akero and other are a positive for the space. I think we -- the failures of other compounds have -- and I don’t think it was justified shed a negative light on the successes of other and include that learning that.So yes  it’s very positive to see other companies succeeding because this provides a positive sentiment on the space and they really hope that continues. And this is why we are looking and cheering for Madrigal success in their face. On the non-invasive  maybe  Michael  do you want to just give an update on the recent progress there?Michael CooremanAbsolutely. So  yes  and our focus on the FDA  the FDA this data requires histology as the target efficacy endpoint. I should say then that in the past  [inaudible] been quite some progress in the -- on data that are being generated  both from imaging and biomarkers and algorithms based on those as non-invasive markers for the disease and for response to treatment. And in these discussions to what extent they will be complementary to or in the future  be replacement for histology.We are all active part of that discussion  including our academic colleagues  R&D industry as well as the FDA  and I think that’s very good news. I think with regard to lanifibranor specifically  what gives us confidence is that lanifibranor given this mechanism of action has shown strong efficacy on the histology endpoint  but also in a broad range of biomarkers that reflect the disease as well. So I think in -- for both histology and IT  I think  lanifibranor has a very strong position.Frédéric CrenThank you. And the last question on the NASH size market in Greater China. Personally  I have not seen any forecast or any public data. The only data I have seen is what we mentioned before is about the prevalence that seems to be like higher or similar to the one in the U.S and then given the size of the Chinese population that makes it a very attractive market. I don’t know  Philip on your side  have you seen anything public on the market potential or anything you can disclose?Philip DuongYes. Sure. So  as you know  whenever we improved NASH treatments  a bit of an echo I will just go ahead. Yes  so without any NASH treatments  I think there’s quite a large range of numbers that we have seen from as low as sort of 2% to even as high as 6%  7%.But like Frédéric  like he mentioned  I think it’s just the sheer size of the population with over 1.3 billion population that translates to quite a high potential NASH patients. We have seen numbers being thrown about 50 million patients or so. But again  without sort of any approved treatments  those numbers are hard to verify. But it is quite a large market in China for NASH.Frédéric CrenWell  thank you. And then we have a question from Alex from Bryan  Garnier. The floor is yours.Alex CogutI hope you can hear me well. Yes thanks for taking my questions. So I was just wondering if you could share a bit more on the screening failure in the Phase III. Like what would be the rate of failure you are seeing and kind of what measures are you introducing to reduce that failure. And are you already seeing kind of results in terms of faster enrollment on the back of those measures?Frédéric CrenYes. Enrollment  thank you. The screen failure rate is high  and we have seen that  first of all  happening across the type field of NASH clinical studies. So I don’t think what I know actually that all data are not in aberration with others  which is reassuring.So NASH is as many other indications challenging. Having said that  we actually have advanced a lot of efforts to detail the reasons for the screen failure rates -- and basically from satisfied every individual case.And overall  there are a couple of reasons  which I have to do with lab values of course  and also with the histology reading  which as you know  seen quantitative scoring system. And we have three expert pathologists. I think they are among the very best  if not the best in the field. We spent a lot of time bringing it together in the formal sessions that they can align the reading before we start looking at biopsy in our part of the study.And we have now also vented that’s recent  so it’s not possible to say what the impact will be  but I can estimate that from our previous results  of course  a system whereby each biopsy is set by two of these pathologists independent of each other. And if there is a non-alignment  say one scores fibrosis stage 3 and the other one at 4 or at 2 and at 1  then there’s a tiebreak. When tiebreak automatically will then define what score is align.And if I look back to the data that we had previously that will alleviate or increase the screen failure rate to a certain extent. In addition to that  we pay a lot of attention to providing guidance to sites to diagnose prescreen patients so that the likelihood that when a patient enters the screening process that the patient ends up being a screen failure is reduced.And with that  I think we have looked at published data as well as our own data. What are the criteria that would have the highest effect and it’s not -- it’s well known that aminotransferase  specifically as C phase [ph] we call that. So we have adapted our inclusion criteria accordingly  and will implement that as an amendment. And we can anticipate that these measures will have a measurable effect on the screen failure rate going forward.Alex CogutGot it. That’s very helpful color. Thank you. And just a question on cedirogant if I may it seems like AbbVie is pretty excited about the compound given the speed of recruitment in the Phase IIb. But I don’t believe they have actually released Phase Ib results  which makes me believe there may be waiting it for AAD in March  but then they might also have the Phase IIb data. So do you have any insights into kind of their plan for releasing Phase Ib or Phase IIb data next year?Frédéric CrenWell  you are right  the Phase Ib data has not been that if they share. The next important congress is in the early AAD in March opposite of March. That could be a date where they could publish for the results until the abstract is available is difficult to confirm that. And in terms of plan of it look more education of the Phase IIb  I don’t think this has been decided yet.Alex CogutGot it. And on the back of the Phase IIb  are there any specific milestones you would expect in 2023  let’s say  maybe related to finalizing the study or relating to good results  obviously or is it related then to a start of Phase III? How can we think about that?Frédéric CrenNo. It’s related -- the milestones are -- directly combined for us will be beginning the initiation of the Phase III.Alex CogutOkay. Okay. That’s all from me.Frédéric CrenIn any indication -- we don’t need to be psoriasis if we -- first patient enrolled in the first Phase III.Alex CogutOkay. Understood. Thank you. That’s it from me.Frédéric CrenThank you. And then Delphine Le Louët from Société Générale is also online  and so very happy to.Delphine Le LouëtYes. Hello. Hi. Good afternoon  good morning  everyone. Different question from my side  can you Fred  can you let us know exactly how many patients have been screened and enrolled so far or as of end of August  just for us to get an idea of the rapidity of the inclusion. And what sort of effectively ramp up  we can expect till the end of the last patient first visit in order to prevent any further delay or just to get an idea of what’s your goal and how we position ourselves towards that? Second question  deals with according to your knowledge of your Chinese partner and the Chinese market  can you give us a sort of a probability of what would be the scenario choose by the -- let’s say  by the Chinese? Would that be to go for a Chinese study or to come up and add up ramp for Chinese patient within the NATiV trial? And finally  I was wondering  can you remind us the other condition that you have from the EIB to unlock the other €25 million envelope? Thank you very much.Frédéric CrenAll right. To your first question about figures in terms of number of screen  screen failure all of that  we are not communicating on that. This is not done by our competitors. So we want to preserve our competitive advantage versus others  because -- the competitive market  what we can say that if you look at the number of sites  countries  so that we are  we say -- online we have our expectation  and that was not the case.The last time we had a webcast where we were facing a delay in terms of regulatory approval and in terms of opening of sites. So that was not the case. So that how that has been sort. And now clearly  for our team and ICON  is to go back to what Michael said is  we need to improve this screen failure rate that is high for us it’s high for everybody in the market  but we are fully care about them and we need to bring it down.On your second question about what the feedback from the China regulatory authorities will be on the approach. I frankly do not know because I have no experience with them. Maybe  Philip  you want to comment on that  but maybe right now  it might be a bit too speculative I don’t know - what would you say?Philip DuongYes. Thanks  Frédéric  and thanks for the question. I think it’s a bit too early to tell  but I think we will do what’s best for the quickest launch in China as well.Delphine Le LouëtYes. I can imagine. But the idea is to know if Sino Biopharm has already been involved in such a deal. And so what was the solution chosen for the other company  if they were involved in such a deal partnering out-licensing  I mean licensing the right for Chinese market?Philip DuongApologies  I didn’t quite get the question. Is it how you would?Delphine Le LouëtNo. I was wondering if Sino Biopharm already shared with you some of their experience from the past from other licensing deal they may have or any view that they have or any confidence that they have towards the regulatory passing in China?Philip DuongYes. Sure. So I think global multi-centers are joining our Phase III trial in China is in other therapeutic areas has been done before. And it’s -- I won’t say it’s common  but it’s done before and it’s resulted in sort of good risk -- it’s done well.But unfortunately for NASH  not that it’s never -- not that it’s been done before  but it’s new. So I think it will be the first global multicenter trial in NASH where if we do it  I think it will be a landmark situation. So for other therapeutics there is -- it’s been done before we have experience with that.Delphine Le LouëtOkay. And Frédéric the last question regarding the financing  yes?Frédéric CrenYes. For AAD the second tranche I will let Jean describe the competition.Jean VolatierGood afternoon  Delphine.Delphine Le LouëtHi  Jean.Jean VolatierYes. We have disclosed all information with regards to the CPs and the -- CPs condition precedent. I will not go in state  but you can go in the disclosures that have been made. The total condition to reach the second tranche in one year  more than one year from now because the objective is to raise second tranche one year after the first one is to get a cash injection of €70 million  okay including the initial cash injection that is required for the first tranche.Clearly speaking  we match we are on the way to match -- we have matched €9.5 million with ATM. We will match the $12 million euro with China. So mathematically  we missed €50 million to bridge.And as we have explained in terms of financial strategy  we will get other opportunities to bridge this €50 million. There are also other CPs like  as you may know  the warrant side of the deal because there are some issuance -- of warrants for each tranche.And there are some operational conditions also relating to mix of -- activated sites at the time of the raising  or a number of randomized patients  which is quite first reasonable in terms of negotiation with AAD and attainable within the current plan of development.Frédéric CrenThe last CP  which we have met  was to sign a partnering that we have done or as we entering Phase III. And I think we are [inaudible]. We hope that we will be -- able to meet the second potential condition.Delphine Le LouëtThank you.Frédéric CrenVery good. And then we have no more question on the phone  but we have some questions on the platform. Some have been covered  one has not been covered -- that can we disclose what  are the milestones beyond the €5 million [inaudible] this unfortunately we can. And then there is a question about the YAP-TEAD program  where do we stand there? And then I will turn to Pierre for our…Pierre BroquaYes. Sure. Thank you for the question. So yes  we are also very excited with the progress made with this project. We are actually working on very specific molecules  three compounds that are now into -- in vivo evaluation phase. And this compound differentiates quite well from other competitors like from Viva  Akina [ph]  even Novartis in the middle inspection and the outcome being that those compounds are capable of inhibiting the proliferation of sales  the proliferation of which is dependent on the update.But also tested  and that makes a big difference our profiling and as it is something that’s communicated earlier this year. We have demonstrated that our Akina compounds acting on the small pockets of FTs are actually preventing the FTs association and preventing the proliferation of FT dependent sales  but are capable of preventing the proliferation of past-dependent sales. Our lead compounds do both  which opens the opportunity to address many more cancers and those are contact currently in vivo testing and looking forward for the in vivo data.Frédéric CrenThank you  Pierre. I think we have no more questions. Therefore  I would like to thank all of you for participating for your question. I would like to thank Philip for staying up late now because it’s -- more than 9 p.m. in China.Thank you and thank you for making yourself available. I think it was important to describe the capabilities Sino Biopharma. Otherwise of course  we will continue working and we look forward to the next meeting.I would also like to point out that today for us is a special day because we are actually just after this conference run to the celebration of the 10-year anniversary of Inventiva. We started this adventure 27th of August  2012.And today  we are really pleased to be in a position to celebrate this important landmark for Inventiva on the back of positive news for lanifibranor and for odiparcil and also for cedirogant. Thank all of you for your participation  and I look forward to seeing you very soon.

Presentations include study results for its investigational treatments  zilucoplan  a self-administered  subcutaneous (SC) peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) and rozanolixizumab  an SC-infused monoclonal antibody targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  in adults with gMG. In addition  the company is also presenting real-world findings into the burden of the disease for society and the potential role of a digital application in improving care.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan have not been established and neither treatment is approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.""Patients living with gMG experience high disease and treatment burden resulting in a significant impact on their daily lives. The data being presented at AANEM and the MG Scientific Session reinforce the potential of UCB's two investigational medicines with different mechanisms of action to provide targeted treatment options to patients "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""We are committed to meeting patients' needs  regardless of antibody profile  including those with MuSK Ab+ gMG who have particularly limited treatment options. With our gMG pipeline  we hope to address both drivers of disease pathology and which account for approximately 95% of patients living with gMG.""Rozanolixizumab MycarinG Phase 3 ResultsA subgroup analysis presented from the Phase 3 MycarinG study (Poster 16  MGFA Scientific Session) 1 analyzes the efficacy of rozanolixizumab in patients with muscle specific kinase antibody-positive (MuSK-Ab+) gMG  which is often more severe and harder to treat than acetylcholine receptor antibody positive (AChR-Ab+) gMG.2 In the overall population analysis  rozanolixizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in MG-specific outcomes in patients with MuSK-Ab+ and AChR-Ab+ gMG  that were consistent with prior published results. Improvements in Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score for the overall population (n=200)  including MuSK-Ab+ patients  were -3.37 for 7mg/kg (n=66; 5 MuSK Ab+) and -3.40 for 10mg/kg (n=67) vs -0.78 (n=67) for placebo. In the MuSK-Ab+ specific subgroup  improvement in MG-ADL was –7.28 (7mg/kg; n=5)  –4.16 (10mg/kg; n=8)  and 2.28 (placebo; n=8). In the AChR-Ab+ specific subgroup  improvement in MG-ADL was –3.03 (7mg/kg; n=60)  –3.36  (10mg/kg; n=60)  and –1.10 (placebo; n=59).1In a responder analysis from MycarinG (Poster 204  AANEM)3  results presented demonstrated that rozanolixizumab significantly reduced MG-ADL from baseline to Day 43. In the primary endpoint  rozanolixizumab showed an LS mean difference vs placebo of 2.59 points at the 7mg/kg dose and 2.62 points at the 10mg/kg dose. Furthermore  a greater percentage of patients in the rozanolixizumab 7mg/kg and 10mg/kg arms than the placebo arm achieved a 2.0-point or greater improvement in MG-ADL  a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores and a 3.0-point or greater improvement in Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scores. Rozanolixizumab had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated with similar occurrences of TEAEs between both doses.3A further safety analysis of the MycarinG trial (Oral presentation  'Clinical Trials 2' session  MGFA Scientific Session) 4 showed that rozanolixizumab was generally well tolerated  with the majority of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) being mild to moderate in severity. A higher proportion of TEAEs occurred in the active treatment arms versus placebo (81.3% for 7 mg/kg  82.6% for 10 mg/kg and 67.2% for placebo) and were comparable between the rozanolixizumab groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache  diarrhea  pyrexia and nausea. A higher incidence of headache was reported in the rozanolixizumab groups versus placebo  with most cases mild to moderate and severe cases generally managed with non-opioid analgesics. There were no severe or serious infections in the rozanolixizumab groups. Treatment withdrawal due to TEAEs was low; the rate was similar in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg and placebo groups and higher in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group.4Zilucoplan Phase 3 RAISE and RAISE-XT ResultsAn interim analysis from RAISE-XT (data cut off 18 February 2022)  a Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension study (Poster 14  MGFA Scientific Session) is also being presented.5 This ongoing study recruited patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG who participated in randomized Phase 2 (NCT03315130) and Phase 3 (NCT04115293) zilucoplan studies. Building on the data seen in the double-blind Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies  results demonstrated a favorable long-term safety profile for zilucoplan over 24 weeks with no major safety findings  with efficacy in patients who had previously received zilucoplan continuing to improve  and efficacy demonstrated as early as week 1 in patients who switched from placebo. At extension study Week 12  after 24 weeks  the zilucoplan group achieved an LS mean improvement in MG-ADL score from the double-blind study baseline of −6.30. MG-ADL improvement for the placebo-switch group  after 12 weeks of zilucoplan  was −6.32.A presentation on the quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes with zilucoplan from the Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293) (Oral presentation  'Clinical Trials 2' session  MGFA Scientific Session)6 demonstrated that zilucoplan clinically meaningfully and highly statistically significantly improved MG-ADL at week 12 (LS mean difference v placebo –2.09; p<0.001) and showed consistently greater improvement in fatigue vs placebo (LS mean difference vs placebo at Week 12  –3.06; nominal p=0.0069). An overall Work Impairment due to problem score with zilucoplan vs placebo (LS mean difference vs placebo –12.83; p=0.0912) was also observed. Zilucoplan demonstrated a favorable safety profile  with a similar rate of TEAEs between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%)  and good tolerability. The most common TEAEs were injection-site reactions (26.7% zilucoplan vs 14.8% placebo); all were non-serious  and mild in severity  except for one instance of injection-site pain of moderate severity in the zilucoplan group and no patients discontinued due to an injection-site reaction. All patients in the zilucoplan arm who completed the 12-week treatment period have entered the ongoing RAISE-XT extension study (NCT04225871).Additionally  in a detailed responder analysis from Phase 3 RAISE trial being presented (Poster 200  AANEM)7 significantly higher proportions of patients receiving zilucoplan achieved ³3-point and ³5-point improvements in MG-ADL and QMG without rescue therapy vs placebo  respectively Zilucoplan demonstrated a clinically meaningful placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.09 points (p<0.001) in MG-ADL  with 73.1% (p<0.001) of patients receiving zilucoplan achieving a 3.0-point or greater reduction in MG-ADL compared to placebo (46.1%) and 58% (p=0.0012) of patients receiving zilucoplan achieving a 5.0-point or greater reduction in QMG compared to placebo (33.3%). Zilucoplan had a favorable safety profile with no major safety findings and good tolerability.7Real-world costs of gMG and digital application supporting patientsData from a study exploring the health care utilization and societal costs of MG in Norway (Poster 9  MGFA Scientific Session)8 highlighted the burden on both patients and society. It showed that societal costs such as lost life years  QoL  and productivity are significant and greater than direct treatment-related costs (estimated to be only 11.5% of societal costs).A further study on the real-world assessment of patient perceptions on an MG symptom-tracking application9 showed the potential of the smartphone application to equip patients with information that would allow them to better communicate their individual disease experience to their healthcare professional while also making behavioral changes to better manage their disease. Further assessment of this application is underway. (Oral presentation  'Outcomes' session  MGFA Scientific Session).""We are proudly and firmly committed to supporting the gMG community by increasing knowledge and understanding of the true burden of this disease to help improve outcomes "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology & Head of Europe/International Markets at UCB. ""By focusing on patients and reinforcing our gMG pipeline with a platform of support services and digital innovations  we aim to transform the lives of people living with this disease.""UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions in the European Union  Japan and the U.S. for both zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab later this year.For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01[email protected]U.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655[email protected]Corporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64[email protected]Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14[email protected]About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting almost 200 000 patients in the U.S.  EU and Japan.10 11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision and difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.12gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can inhibit synaptic transmission at the neuro-muscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.13 gMG can occur at any age and in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.12 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade. Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR Ab+ gMG.About the zilucoplan RAISE study 14The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12  time to rescue therapy  the proportion with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1)  the proportion with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG  all measured at Week 12. Secondary safety endpoint is incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open label extension study  RAISE-XT (NCT04225871).For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About the rozanolixizumab MycarinG study 15The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in the open label extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About ZilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily self-administered SC peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. Results from the RAISE study  a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with gMG  and regulatory submissions are planned in 2022. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.16 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.17The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About RozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is an SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.18 19Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.20 Orphan designation was granted in 202021 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

But this Sunday  businesses and EU institutions will open their doors to the public to display their art collections.From paintings to sculptures  photography or even architecture  the Private Art Kirchberg initiative is back after being postponed twice because of the pandemic. Visitors can take a look at the private art collection of firms such as Allen & Overy  Arendt  Clearstream  Deutsche Bank  the European Investment Bank  Fonds Kirchberg and UBS on Sunday between 11am and 6pm.Some of the pieces  such as those at Fonds Kirchberg  are outdoors and while they may have gone unnoticed in the past  it will now be possible to view them alongside a guided tour. There will also be several activities for children as well as guided tours  in English and in French  at different locations.If you’re unsure where to begin  why not follow the recommendations of MUDAM Director Bettina Steinbrügge. At Clearstream  she highlights the collection Faces and Phases by Zanele Muholi  a self-proclaimed visual activist. These photographs are part of the Female Perspectives collection  on show at Clearstream  which include powerful shots.Visitors watching a video demonstration LW archiveAnother of her recommendations can be found at UBS – artwork by Luxembourgish artist Su Mei Tse that combines sound  nature and art. Steinbrügge was also “deeply touched” by the untitled portrait by Lyle Ashton Harris at Arendt  which explores the theme of equal rights. Arendt houses both a permanent collection and temporary exhibitions  and visitors will be able to view both. Their current temporary exhibition focuses on contemporary photography with well-known artists such as David LaChapelle.If visitors’ appetite for art is not satiated after a tour of the private collections  they may also head to MUDAM. In partnership with the event on Sunday  visitors will benefit from a discount on entry tickets and on items at the museum shop.A photography display at one of the companies in Kirchberg LW archiveSince 2013  law firm Allen & Overy and MUDAM have teamed up  focusing on donations of video works as well as offering a curatorial fellowship in the field of moving images and new technologies at MUDAM. Four of the video artworks that have been donated to MUDAM over the years will be shown at Allen & Overy this weekend.Visitors to Deutsche Bank can enjoy an exhibition called We are Part of Culture created by the non-profit Project 100% Human. It exhibits portraits of “people from past to present times  who had a major impact on European culture” and celebrates the LGBTQ+ community.Doors will be open on Sunday between 11am and 6pm LW archiveThe EIB offers the so-called Unravelling  which includes 32 works acquired in the past four years and focuses on climate-conscious and socially engaged art.Private Art Kirchberg started in 2006 and is held biannually and its aim is to unveil companies’ private art collections which are usually not accessible to the public and invite people for a different experience in an area normally dedicated to business  shopping or dining.For more information and to view the full programme  click here.The Luxembourg Times has a new mobile app  download here!

The stock exchange is writing the bill on the behalf of the Russian Central Bank  which does not have the power to introduce legislation  Vedomosti newspaper reported on Thursday.Speaking at a banking conference  MOEX supervisory board chair Sergei Shvetsov said the bill in preparation foresees trading in both DFAs and DFA certificates that would trade like securities. “The exchange and its subsidiaries will apply to the regulator and I hope that they will receive the status of exchange operators” to trade in DFAs  Shvetsov said. He added:“We want the market to make its own choice between blockchain accounting and depositary accounting  and if the law is passed  Russian depositories will be able to hold DFAs in their accounts on the blockchain — as soon as the client needs the underlying asset  they redeem the certificate and receive the asset in their account on the blockchain.”Lack of familiarity is an impediment to distributed ledger technology in Russia  according to Shvetsov. “When you don’t know who to call and who to sue  many people don’t want to participate ” he said  but “It’s a blank sheet that we can draw whatever we want on  according to the needs of the economy and investors.”Related: Drawbacks of centralization: Moscow Stock Exchange remains offline amid ongoing Russo-Ukrainian warShvetsov said that the bill is currently under review by the Russian Central Bank. State Duma finance committee chair and head of the Russian Banking Association Anatoly Aksakov suggested in July that MOEX become a crypto exchange  following the examples of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse.A MOEX spokesman said in August that the exchange expects to be permitted to trade DFAs. “It’s in the interests of our clients ” MOEX International managing director of strategy Artem Zheleznov said.,neutral,0.03,0.77,0.19,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['digital financial assets', 'Moscow Exchange', 'securities trading', 'bill', 'Report', 'State Duma finance committee chair', 'MOEX supervisory board chair', 'MOEX International managing director', 'ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war Shvetsov', 'digital financial assets', 'Russian Central Bank', 'A MOEX spokesman', 'The Moscow Exchange', 'Russian Banking Association', 'Moscow Stock Exchange', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'Russian press', 'Russian depositories', 'banking conference', 'exchange operators', 'crypto exchange', 'Vedomosti newspaper', 'Sergei Shvetsov', 'preparation foresees', 'DFA certificates', 'depositary accounting', 'ledger technology', 'many people', 'blank sheet', 'Anatoly Aksakov', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Artem Zheleznov', 'underlying asset', 'blockchain accounting', 'bill', 'trading', 'DFAs', 'securities', 'report', 'behalf', 'power', 'legislation', 'Thursday', 'subsidiaries', 'regulator', 'status', 'market', 'choice', 'law', 'accounts', 'client', 'Lack', 'familiarity', 'impediment', 'needs', 'economy', 'investors', 'Drawbacks', 'centralization', 'review', 'head', 'July', 'examples', 'August', 'interests', 'strategy']",2022-09-23,2022-09-23,cointelegraph.com

They will thus green their energy consumption  avoiding the emission of more than 46 685 tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere each year.The Garrido projects  totalling 50.6 megawatts of capacity  also address the concerns of European countries facing high energy price inflation and possible energy rationing for large industrial consumers.Voltalia now has 71 megawatts of capacity in operation or under construction in Portugal  including its subsidiary Helexia  which specialises in on-site energy production and energy efficiency. Voltalia is also developing a 33-megawatt floating solar project located near the Cabril dam in Serta  which was awarded in April 20221.Voltalia is also a leader in Portugal for solar construction  equipment supply and maintenance services for third-party customers  with  for example  147.3 megawatts recently completed or under construction  and 129 megawatts currently under operation-maintenance contracts. Voltalia's team of photovoltaic specialists in Portugal is also very active internationally  with construction projects recently completed or underway in countries such as Ireland  the Netherlands  Greece  Albania  Mauritania  Kenya  Burundi and Zimbabwe.""Against the backdrop of energy price tensions in Europe  the launch of new project construction in Portugal supports the production of renewable and competitive electricity. Portugal is constantly improving the share of renewable energy in the country's energy consumption  with more than 65% of the electricity consumed in the country coming from renewable energy.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the...,IBA SALouvain-La-Neuve  Belgium  22 September 2022 – IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  and the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN today announced the name of their joint-venture: Pantera SA/NV  which they believe will bring new hope for cancer patients. As indicated in the announcement of the R&D strategic partnership  this new company will aim to secure the large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  one of the most promising alpha-emitting radioisotopes to fight cancers. By working towards this large-scale production  Pantera’s ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility of a future innovative cancer therapy based on 225Ac.The complementarity of IBA and SCK CEN’s expertise has been demonstrated by the extensive and comprehensive R&D work that has been conducted during the last year as they work towards being able to produce large volumes of 225Ac. Pantera is now completing the technical feasibility studies before working on the final design and construction of its first facility in Mol  Belgium. Groundbreaking is expected to take place in 2024  with production starting in 2027.Sven Van den Berghe  former Director of the Nuclear Materials Science Institute at SCK CEN  has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer  and Samy Bertrand  former technical leader for theranostics applications at IBA  takes the position of Chief Technical Officer.Bruno Scutnaire  President of IBA RadioPharma Solutions and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pantera  said: “Actinium-225 offers great promise for the treatment of a large variety of cancers  but only very little of the material is available worldwide today. Once cancer treatments based on 225Ac receive approval  Pantera will focus on enabling access to a dependable supply of this promising isotope.”Peter Baeten  Deputy Director-General of SCK CEN and Board member of Pantera  commented: “Launching Pantera was a logical choice for SCK CEN and IBA  allowing the joint-venture to leverage the innovative capabilities of both organizations  whilst utilizing the speed of an autonomous startup necessary in this fast-evolving field.”Story continuesSven Van den Berghe  appointed Chief Executive Officer of Pantera  added: “I am excited about the opportunity to help advance the mission of Pantera to bring a new hope for cancer patients by enabling the widespread use of radioisotopes  such as actinium-225  as a basis for promising new radiopharmaceuticals. Pantera offers ’A better fight for life’  potentially bringing an effective and efficient treatment option while maximizing the quality of life of the patients  with the possibility to expand the production to other isotopes in the future.”***Actinium-225 possesses the resounding potential to treat cancers more effectively. Initial results show that the theranostic radioisotope completely eliminates cancer cells  rather than just inhibiting tumour growth. The risk of recurrence also appears to decrease. To date  extensive research and numerous studies are underway which aim to tackle both high prevalence cancers including prostate  lung  colon  breast  pancreatic  blood (leukemia and other rare forms) and kidney cancers  but also rarer forms of cancer like glioblastoma  the deadliest form of a very invasive brain cancer.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

This decision also triggered the automatic conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) issued by Technicolor on September 15  2022 into Technicolor shares which will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind.Main characteristics and timetable of the Distribution in KindA total of 355 343 245 outstanding Technicolor shares will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind  so that  in accordance with the distribution ratio of 1 TCS share for 1 outstanding Technicolor share  the same number of 355 343 245 TCS shares will be distributed  representing 65% of TCS’ outstanding share capital at the time of the Distribution in Kind.The timetable relating to the Distribution in Kind involves the following main steps:the admission of the TCS shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“ Euronext P aris ”) under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022;the date for determining the beneficiaries of the Distribution in kind will be September 28  2022; andthe payment of the Distribution in Kind (delivery of the TCS shares) will take place on September 29  2022.The Board of Directors confirmed that the Distribution in Kind would be charged to the additional paid-in capital account of Technicolor for an amount equal to €1.9539 per share. Such amount results from the global value of TCS  set by the Board of Directors of Technicolor taking into account the work and the conclusions of Finexsi  the independent expert appointed for the purpose of assessing TCS value  divided by the number of TCS shares actually outstanding (i.e.  546 681 915 shares).Story continuesConsidering the current composition of the shareholders’ equity which does not include any distributable profits and reserves other than those resulting from contributions  the Distribution in Kind will be characterized  from a French tax perspective  as a repayment of capital contributions  within the meaning of paragraph 1) of Article 112 of the French Tax Code which does not constitute distributed income.The technical reference price for each TCS share  communicated to Euronext Paris for the opening of the trading session of September 27  2022 also amounts to €1.9539 per share. The technical reference price is merely indicative and may not be relied on to determine the trading price of the TCS shares going forward. In addition  this price of €1.9539 per share should be retained by Technicolor shareholders to determine the tax value of the TCS shares received as part of the Distribution in Kind  in the event of a subsequent sale of these shares.Technicolor is pleased to announce this step which marks a major milestone in the spin-off process announced by the Group on February 24  2022.###Legal DisclaimerThis press release has been prepared by Technicolor SA (“TSA”) in the context of the contemplated spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios (“TCS” or the “Company”) as a result of which TSA ex-TCS is to become Vantiva.

Martine Bagot  Head of the Dermatology Department  Saint Louis Hospital  Paris.As of the March 4  2022 data cutoff  patients in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF patients (cohort 2) received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies  and had a median follow-up of 12.2 months. In the KIR3DL2 non-expressing cohort (cohort 3)  patients received a median of 4.5 prior systemic therapies and had a median follow-up of 13.8 months.Results showed that lacutamab produced a global objective response rate (ORR) of 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]  13.8-50.0) in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF patients (n=21)  including 2 complete responses and 4 partial responses. Results from the KIR3DL2 non-expressing cohort 3 are also presented.“We are pleased to see that lacutamab continues to show clinical activity in these heavily-pretreated patients with mycosis fungoides  confirming our hypothesis that lacutamab  a KIR3DL2 targeted agent  could provide benefit to patients with tumors expressing the target ” said Joyson Karakunnel  M.D.  MSc  FACP  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. “ We look forward to sharing final data from the TELLOMAK Phase 2 trial in both Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides in 2023 and progressing the two additional trials that are ongoing with lacutamab in Peripheral T cell lymphoma.”“Treatment options are limited for patients with advanced stage mycosis fungoides  and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas ” said Pr. Martine Bagot  Head of the Dermatology Department  Saint Louis Hospital  Paris  and investigator in the TELLOMAK study. “The clinical responses and favorable safety profile observed in the TELLOMAK Phase 2 study  along with the skin responses  make lacutamab a very exciting potential treatment option for the patients. We look forward to the final results of the TELLOMAK study.”Summary of Stage 1 results2 3:Cohort 2 KIR3DL2 expressing MF patients (n=21) Cohort 3 KIR3DL2 non-expressing MF patients (n=18) N prior systemic therapies  median (range) 4 (2-8) 4.5 (2-15) Global ORR [95% CI] 28.6% [13.8-50.0] 11.1% [3.1-32.8] Skin [95% CI] 57.1% [36.5-75.5] 16.7% [5.8-39.2] Blood [95% CI] 62.5% [30.6-86.3] 25% [4.6-69.9] Lymph node [95% CI] 7.7% [1.4-33.3] 0% Median PFS4 [95% CI] 12.0 mo [4.6-15.4] 8.5 mo [4.1-NA] PFS at 12mo [95% CI] 53.6% [29.4-72.8] 39.6% [13.6-65.0]In line with previous observations  lacutamab demonstrated a favorable safety profile in MF also in the skin. Grade ≥ 3 Treatment-related (TR) Treatment-Emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 2/39 (5.1%) pts and 1/39 (2.6%) patients discontinued study drug due to adverse events. Most common TR TEAEs were asthenia (N=5  12.8%)  arthralgia (N=4  10.3%)  and nausea (N=3  7.7%).About Lacutamab:Lacutamab (IPH4102) is a first-in-class anti-KIR3DL2 humanized cytotoxicity-inducing antibody that is currently in clinical trials for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)  an orphan disease  and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes has a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  Sézary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.About TELLOMAK:TELLOMAK is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial recruiting patients with Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.Overall  MF cohorts (cohort 2  cohort 3 and all comers) will enroll approximately 100 patients.The MF cohorts 2 and 3 follow a Simon 2-stage design that will terminate early if treatment is considered futile. The Sézary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.Global response in cutaneous lymphoma is measured by the guidelines published by Olsen et. al in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2011.5About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of Natural Killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).The half-year results have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. These rises are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices.Free cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. The Group’s net cash position at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.As part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts. As such  the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles.In a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year  with the third quarter expected to bring good performance. The Group nonetheless remains cautious about forecasts for the sector  despite the fact that the first effects of sales price increases should be seen in the second half of the year.Story continuesAn independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles.

In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).The half-year results have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. These rises are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices.Free cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. The Group’s net cash position at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.As part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts. As such  the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles.In a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year  with the third quarter expected to bring good performance. The Group nonetheless remains cautious about forecasts for the sector  despite the fact that the first effects of sales price increases should be seen in the second half of the year.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles. The Group achieves this by relying on state-of-the-art industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Attachment,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.28,0.18,0.54,True,English,"['Akwel', 'RESULTS', 'THE', 'HY 2022', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'global vehicle production', 'significant price inflation', 'Free cash-flow generation', 'battery pack interiors', 'service battery casings', 'sales price increases', 'net cash position', 'Current operating margin', 'Current operating income', 'independent, family-owned group', 'moderate turnover growth', 'global automotive market', 'Net margin', 'strong growth', 'sales prices', 'Financial income', 'Net result', 'English Chinese', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'Consolidated data', 'first half', 'supply limitations', 'North America', 'raw materials', 'hydrogen-powered vehicles', 'electric vehicles', 'electronic modules', 'EV flaps', 'cable ducts', 'many opportunities', 'rapid roll-out', 'third quarter', 'good performance', 'first effects', 'second half', 'fluid management', 'technological expertise', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'group share', '2022 half-yearly results', 'half-year results', 'structural components', 'The Group', '2022 financial year', 'Thursday', 'September', 'AKWEL', 'PEA', 'millions', 'Var.', 'Revenue', 'EBITDA', 'basis', 'period', 'energy', 'transport', 'labour', 'rises', '30 June', '31 December', 'part', 'transition', 'examples', 'forecast', 'sector', 'mechanisms', 'state', 'industrial', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Attachment', '€']",2022-09-23,2022-09-23,globenewswire.com

The BSE closed 1 021 points lower at 58 099  settling 1.26 per cent  or 742 points  down for the week. This was its lowest level since August 29. The NSE Nifty  meanwhile  shed 302 points on Friday to end at 17 327. The index lost 200 points or 1.16 per cent on a weekly basis.Today's decline was the third consecutive fall for the two indices after US Fed’s 75 bps rate hike on Wednesday night.""The global risk-off is gaining strength aided by the steadily rising dollar. The dollar is rising against all currencies and this will impact capital flows into emerging including India. The resumption of FPI buying since July has been supporting the rally in India. Now  this is under threat with FPIs turning sellers in 5 out of the last 7 days. FPIs are unlikely to buy consistently when the US 10-year bond yield is above 3.7 per cent and the dollar index is above 111. The near-term market outlook is bearish. Investors may wait and watch before committing more money "" said V K Vijayakumar  Chief Investment Strategist  Geojit Financial Services.Here’s deep dive into factors that sent the into a tailspin on Friday:No respite from rate hikes: The global mood has turned extremely bearish after the US Fed on Wednesday delivered a 75 bps hike and indicated that such large rate increases are set to continue this year. Other global central banks also remain on a rate-hiking spree  as they swiftly raise interest rates. As per reports  as many as seven central banks increased rates on Thursday  which included those of Hong Kong  the UK and Norway.Global stocks: As the Fed laid out plans to continue its aggressive rate hike cycle  equity in the US dropped up to 1.4 per cent Thursday night. At the time of this report  the US stock futures were also down by up to 0.8 per cent. European indices also treaded lower with FTSE 100 and Euronext 100 shedding nearly 1.3 per cent each. In Asia  Kospi led Friday’s losses and closed 1.8 per cent down.hits 81/$ for the first time: A sharp blow to domestic sentiment in the last two days has followed a slump in the rupee  which fell to a fresh low of over 81.2 against the US dollar on Friday in the face of a rapidly strengthening greenback. Such a severe downfall in the currency continues to raise risks of fiscal slippage as fertiliser  petroleum products and others become costlier to import.Besides  weakening of the domestic currency makes investments into Indian securities less attractive for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). They sold equities worth Rs 2 509 crore on Thursday  and Rs 461 crore on Wednesday.Mounting recession fears: With the US Fed admitting that there could be economic pain ahead as it moves to raise rates  fears of a recession are gaining strength in the world's biggest economy. Meanwhile  Bank of Engalnd said on Thursday the UK might already be in a recession. In the Eurozone  the services and manufacturing PMI for September slowed to 48.9 (vs 49.8 MoM) and 48.5 (vs 49.6 MoM)Renewed Russia-Ukraine tensions: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered a partial mobilization of military reservists (who formerly served in the army) to bolster his forces in Ukraine as his troops are reportedly facing setbacks in the war. Putin also warned the West that he will not shy away from using his nuclear arsenal to protect Russia.
