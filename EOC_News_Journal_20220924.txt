The stock exchange is writing the bill on the behalf of the Russian Central Bank  which does not have the power to introduce legislation  Vedomosti newspaper reported on Thursday.Speaking at a banking conference  MOEX supervisory board chair Sergei Shvetsov said the bill in preparation foresees trading in both DFAs and DFA certificates that would trade like securities. “The exchange and its subsidiaries will apply to the regulator and I hope that they will receive the status of exchange operators” to trade in DFAs  Shvetsov said. He added:“We want the market to make its own choice between blockchain accounting and depositary accounting  and if the law is passed  Russian depositories will be able to hold DFAs in their accounts on the blockchain — as soon as the client needs the underlying asset  they redeem the certificate and receive the asset in their account on the blockchain.”Lack of familiarity is an impediment to distributed ledger technology in Russia  according to Shvetsov. “When you don’t know who to call and who to sue  many people don’t want to participate ” he said  but “It’s a blank sheet that we can draw whatever we want on  according to the needs of the economy and investors.”Related: Drawbacks of centralization: Moscow Stock Exchange remains offline amid ongoing Russo-Ukrainian warShvetsov said that the bill is currently under review by the Russian Central Bank. State Duma finance committee chair and head of the Russian Banking Association Anatoly Aksakov suggested in July that MOEX become a crypto exchange  following the examples of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse.A MOEX spokesman said in August that the exchange expects to be permitted to trade DFAs. “It’s in the interests of our clients ” MOEX International managing director of strategy Artem Zheleznov said.,neutral,0.03,0.77,0.19,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['digital financial assets', 'Moscow Exchange', 'securities trading', 'bill', 'Report', 'State Duma finance committee chair', 'MOEX supervisory board chair', 'MOEX International managing director', 'ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war Shvetsov', 'digital financial assets', 'Russian Central Bank', 'A MOEX spokesman', 'The Moscow Exchange', 'Russian Banking Association', 'Moscow Stock Exchange', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'Russian press', 'Russian depositories', 'banking conference', 'exchange operators', 'crypto exchange', 'Vedomosti newspaper', 'Sergei Shvetsov', 'preparation foresees', 'DFA certificates', 'depositary accounting', 'ledger technology', 'many people', 'blank sheet', 'Anatoly Aksakov', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Artem Zheleznov', 'underlying asset', 'blockchain accounting', 'bill', 'trading', 'DFAs', 'securities', 'report', 'behalf', 'power', 'legislation', 'Thursday', 'subsidiaries', 'regulator', 'status', 'market', 'choice', 'law', 'accounts', 'client', 'Lack', 'familiarity', 'impediment', 'needs', 'economy', 'investors', 'Drawbacks', 'centralization', 'review', 'head', 'July', 'examples', 'August', 'interests', 'strategy']",2022-09-23,2022-09-24,cointelegraph.com

Martine Bagot  Head of the Dermatology Department  Saint Louis Hospital  Paris.As of the March 4  2022 data cutoff  patients in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF patients (cohort 2) received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies  and had a median follow-up of 12.2 months. In the KIR3DL2 non-expressing cohort (cohort 3)  patients received a median of 4.5 prior systemic therapies and had a median follow-up of 13.8 months.Results showed that lacutamab produced a global objective response rate (ORR) of 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]  13.8-50.0) in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF patients (n=21)  including 2 complete responses and 4 partial responses. Results from the KIR3DL2 non-expressing cohort 3 are also presented.“We are pleased to see that lacutamab continues to show clinical activity in these heavily-pretreated patients with mycosis fungoides  confirming our hypothesis that lacutamab  a KIR3DL2 targeted agent  could provide benefit to patients with tumors expressing the target ” said Joyson Karakunnel  M.D.  MSc  FACP  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. “ We look forward to sharing final data from the TELLOMAK Phase 2 trial in both Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides in 2023 and progressing the two additional trials that are ongoing with lacutamab in Peripheral T cell lymphoma.”“Treatment options are limited for patients with advanced stage mycosis fungoides  and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas ” said Pr. Martine Bagot  Head of the Dermatology Department  Saint Louis Hospital  Paris  and investigator in the TELLOMAK study. “The clinical responses and favorable safety profile observed in the TELLOMAK Phase 2 study  along with the skin responses  make lacutamab a very exciting potential treatment option for the patients. We look forward to the final results of the TELLOMAK study.”Summary of Stage 1 results2 3:Cohort 2 KIR3DL2 expressing MF patients (n=21) Cohort 3 KIR3DL2 non-expressing MF patients (n=18) N prior systemic therapies  median (range) 4 (2-8) 4.5 (2-15) Global ORR [95% CI] 28.6% [13.8-50.0] 11.1% [3.1-32.8] Skin [95% CI] 57.1% [36.5-75.5] 16.7% [5.8-39.2] Blood [95% CI] 62.5% [30.6-86.3] 25% [4.6-69.9] Lymph node [95% CI] 7.7% [1.4-33.3] 0% Median PFS4 [95% CI] 12.0 mo [4.6-15.4] 8.5 mo [4.1-NA] PFS at 12mo [95% CI] 53.6% [29.4-72.8] 39.6% [13.6-65.0]In line with previous observations  lacutamab demonstrated a favorable safety profile in MF also in the skin. Grade ≥ 3 Treatment-related (TR) Treatment-Emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 2/39 (5.1%) pts and 1/39 (2.6%) patients discontinued study drug due to adverse events. Most common TR TEAEs were asthenia (N=5  12.8%)  arthralgia (N=4  10.3%)  and nausea (N=3  7.7%).About Lacutamab:Lacutamab (IPH4102) is a first-in-class anti-KIR3DL2 humanized cytotoxicity-inducing antibody that is currently in clinical trials for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)  an orphan disease  and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes has a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  Sézary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.About TELLOMAK:TELLOMAK is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial recruiting patients with Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.Overall  MF cohorts (cohort 2  cohort 3 and all comers) will enroll approximately 100 patients.The MF cohorts 2 and 3 follow a Simon 2-stage design that will terminate early if treatment is considered futile. The Sézary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.Global response in cutaneous lymphoma is measured by the guidelines published by Olsen et. al in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2011.5About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of Natural Killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).The half-year results have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. These rises are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices.Free cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. The Group’s net cash position at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.As part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts. As such  the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles.In a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year  with the third quarter expected to bring good performance.

In a market that remains widely disrupted by supply limitations  the Group has achieved strong growth in North America (+18.4%).The half-year results have been affected by the significant price inflation undergone by raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour. These rises are partially and gradually reflected in sales prices.Free cash-flow generation was €16.9 m compared to €44.4 m in the first half of 2021. The Group’s net cash position at 30 June 2022 was €105.7 m  compared with €98.2 m at 31 December 2021.As part of the transition to new electric- or hydrogen-powered vehicles  AKWEL also develops structural components for electric vehicles  with examples including electronic modules  battery pack interiors  EV flaps  service battery casings  and cable ducts. As such  the Group will be able to seize the many opportunities linked to the rapid roll-out of electric vehicles.In a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its forecast of moderate turnover growth for the 2022 financial year  with the third quarter expected to bring good performance. The Group nonetheless remains cautious about forecasts for the sector  despite the fact that the first effects of sales price increases should be seen in the second half of the year.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles. The Group achieves this by relying on state-of-the-art industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Attachment,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.28,0.18,0.54,True,English,"['Akwel', 'RESULTS', 'THE', 'HY 2022', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'global vehicle production', 'significant price inflation', 'Free cash-flow generation', 'battery pack interiors', 'service battery casings', 'sales price increases', 'net cash position', 'Current operating margin', 'Current operating income', 'independent, family-owned group', 'moderate turnover growth', 'global automotive market', 'Net margin', 'strong growth', 'sales prices', 'Financial income', 'Net result', 'English Chinese', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'Consolidated data', 'first half', 'supply limitations', 'North America', 'raw materials', 'hydrogen-powered vehicles', 'electric vehicles', 'electronic modules', 'EV flaps', 'cable ducts', 'many opportunities', 'rapid roll-out', 'third quarter', 'good performance', 'first effects', 'second half', 'fluid management', 'technological expertise', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'group share', '2022 half-yearly results', 'half-year results', 'structural components', 'The Group', '2022 financial year', 'Thursday', 'September', 'AKWEL', 'PEA', 'millions', 'Var.', 'Revenue', 'EBITDA', 'basis', 'period', 'energy', 'transport', 'labour', 'rises', '30 June', '31 December', 'part', 'transition', 'examples', 'forecast', 'sector', 'mechanisms', 'state', 'industrial', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Attachment', '€']",2022-09-23,2022-09-24,globenewswire.com

The BSE closed 1 021 points lower at 58 099  settling 1.26 per cent  or 742 points  down for the week. This was its lowest level since August 29. The NSE Nifty  meanwhile  shed 302 points on Friday to end at 17 327. The index lost 200 points or 1.16 per cent on a weekly basis.Today's decline was the third consecutive fall for the two indices after US Fed’s 75 bps rate hike on Wednesday night.""The global risk-off is gaining strength aided by the steadily rising dollar. The dollar is rising against all currencies and this will impact capital flows into emerging including India. The resumption of FPI buying since July has been supporting the rally in India. Now  this is under threat with FPIs turning sellers in 5 out of the last 7 days. FPIs are unlikely to buy consistently when the US 10-year bond yield is above 3.7 per cent and the dollar index is above 111. The near-term market outlook is bearish. Investors may wait and watch before committing more money "" said V K Vijayakumar  Chief Investment Strategist  Geojit Financial Services.Here’s deep dive into factors that sent the into a tailspin on Friday:No respite from rate hikes: The global mood has turned extremely bearish after the US Fed on Wednesday delivered a 75 bps hike and indicated that such large rate increases are set to continue this year. Other global central banks also remain on a rate-hiking spree  as they swiftly raise interest rates. As per reports  as many as seven central banks increased rates on Thursday  which included those of Hong Kong  the UK and Norway.Global stocks: As the Fed laid out plans to continue its aggressive rate hike cycle  equity in the US dropped up to 1.4 per cent Thursday night. At the time of this report  the US stock futures were also down by up to 0.8 per cent. European indices also treaded lower with FTSE 100 and Euronext 100 shedding nearly 1.3 per cent each. In Asia  Kospi led Friday’s losses and closed 1.8 per cent down.hits 81/$ for the first time: A sharp blow to domestic sentiment in the last two days has followed a slump in the rupee  which fell to a fresh low of over 81.2 against the US dollar on Friday in the face of a rapidly strengthening greenback. Such a severe downfall in the currency continues to raise risks of fiscal slippage as fertiliser  petroleum products and others become costlier to import.Besides  weakening of the domestic currency makes investments into Indian securities less attractive for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). They sold equities worth Rs 2 509 crore on Thursday  and Rs 461 crore on Wednesday.Mounting recession fears: With the US Fed admitting that there could be economic pain ahead as it moves to raise rates  fears of a recession are gaining strength in the world's biggest economy. Meanwhile  Bank of Engalnd said on Thursday the UK might already be in a recession. In the Eurozone  the services and manufacturing PMI for September slowed to 48.9 (vs 49.8 MoM) and 48.5 (vs 49.6 MoM)Renewed Russia-Ukraine tensions: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered a partial mobilization of military reservists (who formerly served in the army) to bolster his forces in Ukraine as his troops are reportedly facing setbacks in the war. Putin also warned the West that he will not shy away from using his nuclear arsenal to protect Russia.

This decision also triggered the automatic conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Notes (""MCN"") issued by Technicolor on September 15  2022 into Technicolor shares which will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind.Main characteristics and timetable of the Distribution in KindA total of 355 343 245 outstanding Technicolor shares will be entitled to the Distribution in Kind  so that  in accordance with the distribution ratio of 1 TCS share for 1 outstanding Technicolor share  the same number of 355 343 245 TCS shares will be distributed  representing 65% of TCS' outstanding share capital at the time of the Distribution in Kind.The timetable relating to the Distribution in Kind involves the following main steps:the admission of the TCS shares to trading on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris ("" Euronext P aris "") under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022;"") under the ticker symbol TCHCS and the ex-date of the Distribution in Kind will take place on September 27  2022; the date for determining the beneficiaries of the Distribution in kind will be September 28  2022; andthe payment of the Distribution in Kind (delivery of the TCS shares) will take place on September 29  2022.The Board of Directors confirmed that the Distribution in Kind would be charged to the additional paid-in capital account of Technicolor for an amount equal to €1.9539 per share. Such amount results from the global value of TCS  set by the Board of Directors of Technicolor taking into account the work and the conclusions of Finexsi  the independent expert appointed for the purpose of assessing TCS value  divided by the number of TCS shares actually outstanding (i.e.  546 681 915 shares).Considering the current composition of the shareholders' equity which does not include any distributable profits and reserves other than those resulting from contributions  the Distribution in Kind will be characterized  from a French tax perspective  as a repayment of capital contributions  within the meaning of paragraph 1) of Article 112 of the French Tax Code which does not constitute distributed income.The technical reference price for each TCS share  communicated to Euronext Paris for the opening of the trading session of September 27  2022 also amounts to €1.9539 per share. The technical reference price is merely indicative and may not be relied on to determine the trading price of the TCS shares going forward. In addition  this price of €1.9539 per share should be retained by Technicolor shareholders to determine the tax value of the TCS shares received as part of the Distribution in Kind  in the event of a subsequent sale of these shares.Technicolor is pleased to announce this step which marks a major milestone in the spin-off process announced by the Group on February 24  2022.###Legal DisclaimerThis press release has been prepared by Technicolor SA (""TSA"") in the context of the contemplated spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios (""TCS"" or the ""Company"") as a result of which TSA ex-TCS is to become Vantiva.
