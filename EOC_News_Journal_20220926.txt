If the bill receives approval  Russian depositories will be able to hold DFAs in their accounts on the blockchain and redeem the certificate to withdraw the underlying asset whenever the client requests the same.The behavioural habits of Russian business and the population are “dragged” into centralized structures  the chairman stated  adding that the lack of familiarity with distributed ledger technology becomes a barrier:“When you don’t know who to call and who to sue  many people don’t want to participate. [but ] It’s a blank sheet that we can draw whatever we want on  according to the needs of the economy and investors.”In July  State Duma finance committee chair and head of the Russian Banking Association Anatoly Aksakov called for MOEX to follow in the footsteps of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse to become a cryptocurrency exchange.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.0,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['registered digital asset exchange', 'New bill', 'MOEX', 'State Duma finance committee chair', 'MOEX supervisory board chair', 'The Moscow Stock Exchange', 'digital financial assets', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'Russian newspaper Vedomosti', 'Russian Central Bank', 'distributed ledger technology', 'Russian Banking Association', 'Russian depositories', 'Russian business', 'banking forum', 'distributed registries', 'exchange operator', 'cryptocurrency exchange', 'depositary accounting', 'XXI century', 'custodial risks', 'accounting infrastructure', 'direct release', 'underlying asset', 'behavioural habits', 'centralized structures', 'many people', 'blank sheet', 'Anatoly Aksakov', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'blockchain accounting', 'Sergei Shvetsov', 'market', 'choice', 'Chairman', 'bill', 'depositaries', 'receipts', 'trade', 'DFAs', 'consideration', 'legislation', 'reporters', 'Banks', 'trading', 'securities', 'investors', 'accounts', 'subsidiaries', 'regulator', 'status', 'approval', 'certificate', 'client', 'population', 'lack', 'familiarity', 'barrier', 'needs', 'economy', 'July', 'head', 'footsteps']",2022-09-25,2022-09-26,coinjournal.net

Furthermore  the Board of Directors believes that it is beneficial for the company and the shareholders that the incentive program's participants thus are given a personal and long-term ownership commitment. Such ownership commitment is expected to stimulate increased interest in the company's business and earnings development as a whole  as well as to achieve increased community of interest between the participants and the company's shareholders.In light of the terms  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the Board of Directors considers that the proposed warrant program as follows below is reasonable and beneficial for the company and its shareholders.A. Issue of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a directed issue of no more than 160 000 warrants of series 2022/2025  meaning the share capital upon full exercise may increase by no more than SEK 4 083.59. The following conditions shall otherwise apply to the resolution.The right to subscribe warrants is  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  given to Re:NewCell AB with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to two key persons within the company in accordance with the proposal under item B below. The company shall have no right to dispose of the warrants in any other way than as follows from the proposal under item B below. Over-subscription is not allowed. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants shall be used within the framework of the warrant program. The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the company. Subscription of the warrants shall take place within two weeks from the day of the resolution on the issue. The Board of Directors has the right to prolong the subscription period. Each (1) warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) share in the company. Subscription of new shares by support of the warrants may take place during the period commencing on 15 November 2025 (however not earlier than the day after the publication of the company's interim report for the period Q3 2025) up to and including the date that falls 30 calendar days thereafter. Under the terms and conditions of the warrants  the period during which the warrants may be exercised may be extended if participants are prevented from exercising their subscription rights due to applicable laws on insider trading or any equivalents. The subscription price for each new share subscribed by support of the warrants shall be determined to an amount equivalent to 160 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period from and including 12 October 2022 up to and including 25 October 2022. In connection with subscription of shares exercised through warrants  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quotient value shall be added to the non-restricted share premium reserve. The newly issued shares following exercise of the warrants shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividend that takes place after the shares have been registered and recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. Warrants held by the company and which have not been transferred in accordance with item B below or which have been repurchased from the participants may be canceled by the company following a resolution by the Board of Directors. Cancellation must be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available on the company's website  renewcell.com. As set forth in the terms and conditions for the warrants  the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitle to subscription of may be recalculated in certain cases.B. Approval of transfer of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve that the company  within the framework of the warrant program  transfers no more than 160 000 warrants of series 2022/2025 to two key persons in the company on the following terms:1. The warrant program will include no more than the following number of warrants for the following participants (the ""participants""):Category Maximum number of options Incoming CFO (1 person) 80 000 warrants Incoming CCO (1 person) 80 000 warrantsOver-allotment is not allowed.Right to acquire warrants from the company presupposes that the participants by the end of the subscription period have not resigned or been dismissed. Warrants that are not acquired as above or that are repurchased from participants may be offered future new key persons. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution.Transfers to the participants presupposes that the warrants can be acquired legally and that the Board of Directors assesses that it can be made against reasonable administrative and financial efforts.2. Notice of acquisition of warrants shall take place during the period from and including 26 October 2022 up to and including 14 November 2022. The Board of Directors shall however have a right to prolong the notice period of acquisition as well as to specify a corresponding notice period for new key persons whose acquisitions take place after the end of the initial notice period. The company's Board of Directors resolves on the final allotment  in accordance with the principles established by the general meeting.The reason why persons may be granted warrants at such a time that the time between the allotment and the beginning of the period for subscription of new shares by support of the warrants may be less than three years is that the Board of Directors deems it important that such new employees  for the reasons that apply to the program as a whole  are given an opportunity to take part in the value growth of Re:NewCell's share already at the beginning of the employment. No transfers may  however  take place after the 2023 Annual General Meeting.3. The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price established in accordance with a calculated market value for the warrants by application of Black & Scholes valuation model.Payment for allotted warrants shall be made in cash no later than ten days after the notice of acquisition.The warrants shall otherwise be subject to market terms.4. A prerequisite for being allotted warrants is that the participants have signed a special post-transfer purchase rights agreement on customary terms and conditions set by the Board of Directors. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement  the company  or its designee  has the right to repurchase warrants from the participants under certain conditions  subject to such limitations as may be imposed by law.DilutionAs of the day of the proposal there are 33 943 003 shares in the company. If all warrants that may be issued and transferred are exercised for subscription of shares  the number of shares and votes in the company will increase by no more than 160 000 (subject to possible recalculation of the number of shares according to the terms and conditions of the warrants)  corresponding to a dilution of the share capital and votes in the company of approximately 0.47 percent.Preliminary valuation  costs for the company and effect on key ratiosThe market value of a warrant of series 2022/2025 is  pursuant to preliminary valuation in accordance with Black & Scholes valuation model  SEK 9.9. The preliminary valuation is based on the assumption that the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period from and including 12 October 2022 up to and including 25 October 2022 will amount to SEK 90  resulting in a subscription price of SEK 144 per share upon exercise of the warrants  and the assumption of a volatility of 35 percent  a risk-free interest rate of 2.3 percent  a dividend yield of 0 percent and a term of three years. In connection with transfers of warrants to participants  the market value will be established based on updated assumptions and then-known parameters.As the warrants are to be transferred the key person at an estimated market value  the incentive program is not deemed to entail any costs in addition to certain minor costs for the preparation and administration. Assuming issue and full allotment of the proposed warrants  the proceeds from the transfers of warrants are estimated to exceed the costs of creating the program.The warrants are expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key ratio earnings per share.Preparation of the proposalThe proposed resolution on adoption of the incentive program and the proposals under item A and B above have been prepared by the Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors.OtherThe Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make the minor adjustment to the above resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Existing incentive programsAt the time of this proposal  there are four outstanding share-based incentive programs in the company.Employee options (Warrants series 2019/2027)Under 2018  the company's Board of Directors resolved on the introduction of an employee option program. Delivery of shares under the employee option program of series 2019/2027 is secured through the issue of warrants. As of the date of this proposal  there are 1 400 options under this employee option program  which after recalculation  entitles subscription for 91 000 shares during the period from 15 December 2021 to 31 December 2025.Warrants series 2018/2022The program encompasses 11 772 warrants of series 2018/2022 that grant the right  after recalculation  to subscribe for 765 180 shares during the period from 20 December 2021 to 31 December 2022. All warrants are held by PEEL AB  a company wholly owned by the company's CEO Patrik Lundström.Warrants series 2019/2023The program encompasses 10 464 warrants of series 2019/2023 that grant the right  after recalculation  to subscribe for 680 160 shares during the period from 3 September 2022 to 3 September 2023. All warrants are held by the company's CEO Patrik Lundström.Warrants series 2021/2024The series encompasses a maximum of 554 391 warrants that grant the right to subscribe for 554 391 shares at a price of 287.53 SEK per share during the period from 8 November 2024 until 30 days thereafter.

He has been co-president of the firm for more than two years and has worked on some of the firm’s largest transactions. Bednar  who joined the investment bank at the time of the firm’s founding  also helped shepherd Perella Weinberg’s long-awaited initial public offering last year.“Andrew really distinguished himself as a leader and a manager ” Weinberg said in an interview. “It’s been two and a half years in the making.”Weinberg  65  will remain chairman of the board and focus more on working with clients. Fellow co-founder Joe Perella is partner of the firm and a board member. Dietrich Becker  the firm’s co-president and a founding partner  will be the sole president.Bednar will become Perella Weinberg’s fourth CEO since its 2006 founding. He follows in the footsteps of Perella and Bob Steel  with Weinberg taking over in recent years as the firm planned its IPO.Last year  the firm had record revenue of more than $800 million. But 2022 has brought about a more challenging dealmaking environment across the industry  and Perella Weinberg’s stock has slumped nearly 43% this year.“We have a long-term growth strategy that really transcends any market environment ” Weinberg said  adding that the firm does not plan to reduce headcount. “The firm is doing well. We have very specific growth plans going forward. And we’re as excited today  if not more so with Andrew now becoming CEO  of those plans in the future.”Bednar said he will continue to grow headcount in areas where the firm intends to expand. He pointed to the dealmakers hired by the investment bank during the market turmoil of 2008  2009 and 2020  saying that this time is similar.“We will continue growth that is critical to the firm ” he said. “These types of markets where there is disruption  where people look at a really hard year of work at one of the bigger financial institutions and say  ‘How did this all play out? And am I in the right place?’ tend to be a tremendous opportunity.”Weinberg and Bednar first met in 1998 while they both worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The younger banker was still a vice president and Weinberg was addressing his class of dealmakers. Bednar became a managing director at the bank  then went on to work at Bank of America Corp. where he was head of US mergers and acquisitions before joining Perella Weinberg. He started his career as a corporate attorney at Cravath  Swaine & Moore.Bednar helped the New York Stock Exchange in its more than $10 billion sale to Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and also worked with Deutsche Boerse on its attempted merger with LSE. In the consumer industry  he has involved in landmark transactions including Kate Spade & Co.’s $2.4 billion sale to Coach Inc.  the $11.6 billion sale of US Tobacco to Altria Group Inc. and the nearly $3 billion sale of J.Crew Group Inc. to a group of buyout firms.Weinberg himself was a top banker at Morgan Stanley and Goldman before starting his own venture. A member of generations of banking scions  his family ran Goldman for decades. His grandfather  Sidney Weinberg  began as a janitor in the early 1900s and rose to become the head of the firm.Still  Peter Weinberg is the sole member of his family to have his name on an investment bank’s masthead. His cousin  John S. Weinberg  is the chief executive of a key rival  Evercore Inc.“I don’t think of Perella Weinberg as anything Weinberg. I think of Perella Weinberg as a firm with 60-plus partners around the world and working with clients around the world ” Weinberg said. “I’m not going anywhere. But I think it’s a great compliment  frankly  to the firm and to the board  that we are orchestrating this transition.”©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.54,0.06,0.4,True,English,"['Investment Bank', 'Perella Weinberg', 'New CEO', 'Founder', 'Hands', 'Reins', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'J.Crew Group Inc.', 'next chief executive officer', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc', 'Intercontinental Exchange Inc.', 'initial public offering', 'bigger financial institutions', 'Altria Group Inc.', 'challenging dealmaking environment', 'a half years', 'long-term growth strategy', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'John S.

The Company is in active discussions with a prospective partner for potentially funding the development of a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine. These ongoing discussions may continue for several months and may not lead to an agreement.In parallel  Valneva is continuing discussions with various governments and has initiated regulatory processes with additional regulatory authorities  with the aim to deploy remaining inventory into international markets in the next twelve months. The Company also expects to report additional clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2022  notably heterologous booster data  which may potentially support the positioning of its inventory.Thomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “As we are near the end of the third quarter 2022  we are engaged in active discussions that are likely to continue into the coming months. We therefore plan to continue exploring these potential funding opportunities and will provide future updates if and when we enter into an agreement for further development of our COVID-19 vaccine program.”About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).Story continuesVLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe2 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom3 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates4 and Kingdom of Bahrain5. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain6. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA20017. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine. Valneva is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP  Global Communications and European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099investors@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP  Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the development and commercialization plans for VLA2001 and agreements with potential partners and purchasers.

It has its own 10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring throughout the state of Illinois built using the Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system  allowing it to reach any customer by extending its network from the nearest Point-of-Presence (PoP) to the customer facility.Stratus is now also using the Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device (EAD) to provide wholesale  MEF-compliant  EPL (E-Access Ethernet Private Line) services to a third-party wireless network operator for mobile backhaul connectivity. Stratus chose the 1651 EAD primarily because of its support for wire-speed service activation testing (SAT) at 10Gbps (gigabit per second). Using IETF RFC-2544 and ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards  the 1651 acts as both the SAT generator & reflector  saving the cost of a second testing device while also speeding the SAT process.With this capability  Stratus now has the tool it needs to not only validate its service level agreements with real-time data  but also to show by how much it exceeded its contracted performance.""We are extremely pleased by the operational efficiency that the 1651 remote SAT testing has provided. Instead of rolling a truck to each site and using dedicated test equipment  we can use the built-in generator/reflector validate SLA on demand. I anticipate future cost savings as we upgrade cellular backhaul to 10Gbps line-rate without deploying any additional equipment or field techs for manual SAT testing. "" said Ben Russell  Chief Technology Officer  Stratus networks. Another reason for selecting the 1651 was Ekinops' ability to deliver within the required timeframe  the only vendor to make that commitment of those Stratus considered""Story continues""The 1651 is ideal for what Stratus is doing "" says Kevin Antill  Ekinops' group vice president of sales for North America. ""10G is the new currency for these types of backhaul applications  especially with the far greater bandwidth 5G demands. The ability to test quickly and provide SLA reporting ensures Stratus customers that they have chosen the best partner.""Stratus becomes one of the first service providers in North America to operate a combined Ekinops network of Layer 2 Ethernet and Layer 1 WDM platforms.For more information about the Ekinops portfolio  please visit https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/productsPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1907456/Ekinops.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgAll press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74adugast@actus.frEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-delivers-mobile-backhaul-connectivity-with-wire-speed-testing-to-stratus-networks-301633233.htmlSOURCE Ekinops France SA",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.8,0.16,0.04,True,English,"['Mobile Backhaul Connectivity', 'Wire-speed Testing', 'Stratus Networks', 'Ekinops', 'Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device', 'Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system', '10Gb/s Ethernet Access Device', '10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring', 'E-Access Ethernet Private Line', 'greater bandwidth 5G demands', 'ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards', 'private fiber network solutions', 'third-party wireless network operator', ""Ekinops' group vice president"", 'wire-speed service activation testing', 'SOURCE Ekinops France SA', 'optical transport systems', 'access network solutions', 'PRNewsfoto/Ekinops France SA', 'second testing device', 'service level agreements', 'first service providers', 'wireless backhaul connectivity', 'strong business model', 'Chief Technology Officer', 'Didier Brédy', 'Mobile Backhaul Connectivity', 'dedicated test equipment', 'Layer 1 WDM platforms', '1651 remote SAT testing', 'manual SAT testing', 'wholesale, MEF-compliant, EPL', 'future cost savings', 'combined Ekinops network', 'Layer 2 Ethernet', 'Wire-speed Testing', 'cellular backhaul', 'backhaul applications', 'additional equipment', 'SAT generator', 'SAT process', 'network services', 'Ekinops portfolio', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'leading supplier', 'leading provider', 'Peoria Heights', 'other carriers', 'small businesses', 'education customers', 'nearest Point', 'IETF RFC', 'real-time data', 'operational efficiency', 'field techs', 'Ben Russell', 'required timeframe', 'Kevin Antill', 'North America', 'new currency', 'best partner', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'Amaury Dugast', 'original content', 'EURONEXT PARIS', 'press releases', 'Press relation', 'Ekinops Logo', 'customer facility', '10Gbps line-rate', 'SLA reporting', 'products Photo', 'Stratus Networks', 'Stratus customers', 'PRNewswire', 'Illinois', 'USA', 'entities', 'sizes', 'government', 'state', 'Presence', 'PoP', '1651 EAD', 'support', 'gigabit', 'reflector', 'capability', 'tool', 'contracted', 'performance', 'truck', 'site', 'reason', 'vendor', 'commitment', 'Story', 'sales', 'types', 'information', 'Ekinops_Logo', 'close', 'trading', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'momnes', 'actus', 'adugast', 'Cision', 'multimedia', 'news-releases', 'delivers', 'mobile-backhaul-connectivity', 'wire-speed-testing', 'stratus-networks', '33', '1 53']",2022-09-26,2022-09-26,finance.yahoo.com

The Company is in active discussions with a prospective partner for potentially funding the development of a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine. These ongoing discussions may continue for several months and may not lead to an agreement.In parallel  Valneva is continuing discussions with various governments and has initiated regulatory processes with additional regulatory authorities  with the aim to deploy remaining inventory into international markets in the next twelve months. The Company also expects to report additional clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2022  notably heterologous booster data  which may potentially support the positioning of its inventory.Thomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “As we are near the end of the third quarter 2022  we are engaged in active discussions that are likely to continue into the coming months. We therefore plan to continue exploring these potential funding opportunities and will provide future updates if and when we enter into an agreement for further development of our COVID-19 vaccine program.”About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe2 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom3 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates4 and Kingdom of Bahrain5. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain6. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA20017. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine. Valneva is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

As a result  the rate of institutional adoption and investor access to high-quality digital assets has been limited up until now.Ownera brought the industry together to develop the FinP2P open-source routing protocol to solve this problem by orchestrating the instant exchange of digital assets held on any blockchain platform  for digital cash held on any ledger. It supports primary issuance  secondary trading and DeFi-style instant borrowing against assets pledged as collateral. This routing network has the power to open up digital distribution for the private markets and unlock global liquidity in a way that no single institution or exchange can achieve on its own.As the market leader in tokenization solutions  Tokeny’s technology has enabled direct transfers and settlements of tokenized assets in a compliant manner  by default. Its infrastructure uses the market standard ERC-3643 to ensure each transfer can only be triggered between eligible investors through ONCHAINID  a digital identity system  enabling the transferability of tokenized assets. The integration of Ownera FinP2P distribution network enables its clients to further improve the liquidity of their tokenized assets by reaching a broader investor base across the globe.Daniel Coheur  Chief Strategy Officer of Tokeny said  “Tokenization is the first step to unlock the full potential of assets using blockchain technology. When assets are brought onchain  they can be transferred and managed by their owners  at a lower cost  and in real-time. As the compliance is built in at the token level  visibility and interoperability is the key to maximize asset liquidity. By integrating Ownera’s FinP2P  we allow our clients and their investors to connect to additional distribution networks  and use tokenized assets for collateralization.”“Institutions have been faced with the challenge of deploying multiple blockchain technologies if they want to access different isolated pools of assets and investors ” adds Anthony Woolley  the Head of Business Development and Marketing at Ownera. “The adoption of FinP2P will result in higher liquidity and better access to capital and assets by providing regulated firms with one secure point of connection to multiple digital asset networks across the globe. Any institution deploying a Tokeny solution now has the potential to access the added distribution capabilities of the Ownera FinP2P network.”About Tokeny:Tokeny provides an enterprise-grade infrastructure to allow companies and financial actors to compliantly issue  transfer  and manage digital assets on blockchains  enabling them to apply control and compliance on the decentralized infrastructure without technical hurdles. Tokeny is recognized by CB Insights and KPMG as a Top 50 Blockchain and Top 100 Global Fintech company. The company is backed by Euronext Group  Inveniam  Apex Group  and K20 Funds.

The company led the creation of the open-source specifications of the FinP2P protocol and delivers FinP2P based network nodes and digital assets solutions to the financial industry  thus enabling global distribution and liquidity for digital securities.

The early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is a major public health concern. The presentation of the work of Guerbet's Artificial Intelligence (AI) research team  which could potentially offer a promising response to a medical need  convinced the jury to support this project with public fundingPancreatic cancer represents 496 000 cases per year  of which 14 500 are in France and 56 700 in the USAi. The number of patients suffering from this disease has doubled over the last 25 years. The mortality rate of patients is high with survival ranging from one to five years depending on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosisii. By 2040  pancreatic cancer will constitute the third cause of death by cancer in the EUiii and the fourth in the USAiv.“Today  far too many patients are diagnosed at a late stage due to the silent progression of the disease and the huge difficulty in distinguishing the early stages in routine medical imaging. Artificial Intelligence offers a new tool which could support radiologists in their mission”.Professor Vuillerme  Hospital Practitioner  Associate Professor at the Paris-Cité University  RadiologistUnfortunately  few therapeutic options are currently available to treat pancreatic cancer. Surgery is the only treatment which may potentially cure the disease  but it can only be considered during the early stages of the diseasev. Less than 20% of patients are eligible for surgery  as a result of the late detectionsvi.The early stages of pancreatic cancer are often asymptomatic  and the detection is often fortuitous and late. “Earlier detection would enable more patients to be eligible for surgery  which could lead to considerably higher survival rates.6 viiStory continuesCT scans of the pancreas are often difficult to interpret for radiologists who are not specialized in digestive diseasesviii. With effective algorithms and solutions already under development for the detection of liver and prostate cancers  Guerbet continues to innovate and will thus potentially increase chance of surviving from this “silent” cancer. The solution developed by Guerbet will permit the automatic analysis of scanners and will provide radiologists with an alert when pancreatic cancer is suspected from the very first stages of the disease.“Every year the lives of thousands of families are disrupted by the announcement of a pancreatic cancer for which no one is prepared! Since 2016  Espoir Pancréas has been fighting for early detection of pancreatic cancer. We truly hope that in the future Artificial Intelligence solutions will offer improved diagnosis and prognosis for patients suffering from these cancers.”Philippe François-Steininger  Chairman of the association Espoir PancréasConnections with the project’s clinical partners are already in progress and certain French and international partnerships are already under discussion. Furthermore  a large database has already been constituted.This financial support will enable the acceleration of the development of the solution and the recognition provides great incentive for the project team.“BPI’s financial support is a great acknowledgement of the quality of Guerbet’s work in the field of Artificial Intelligence at the service of healthcare. This support will enable the development of the project to be accelerated and give it the dimension necessary to develop a commercial product by 2025. We are convinced that these promising Artificial Intelligence solutions will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of cancers with a high mortality rate. Guerbet is thus demonstrating once again the ability to provide professionals with a major innovation for the benefit of patients.”François Nicolas  Vice-President in charge of R&D at GuerbetAbout France 2030The France 2030 investment plan:Translates a dual ambition : to sustainably transform key sectors of our economy (energy  automobile  aeronautics and space) by technological innovation  and position France not only as an actor but as a leader in tomorrow’s world.

Shah  MD  Neurologist who said: “I am very happy with this first patient inclusion in the United States in ACTISAVE study. Glenzocimab has significant potential for improvement in patients with ischemic stroke  especially those undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. We urgently need new drugs in this indication  and glenzocimab presents an innovative and promising mechanism of action on recanalization and on the downstream microcirculation. Chattanooga CHI Memorial is a state-of-the-art stroke unit that receives 1 400 stroke patients per year in unprecedented medical conditions  with a large part given to research. ""ACTICOR had obtained an IND1 for this study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2021 and had initiated enrollment in Europe in the third quarter of 2021. To date  the study has enrolled 130 patients.The clinical trial is planned for 1 000 patients treated at approximately 80 centers in the USA  Europe (France  Germany  Belgium  Spain  Slovakia  Denmark  Czech Republic)  Great Britain and Israel. A first futility analysis is planned after the inclusion of the first 200 patients to confirm the initial hypotheses.Dr. Yannick PLETAN  Chief Operating Officer  and Chief Medical Officer of Acticor Biotech added: ""The opening of the first U.S. centers  in addition to those already active in Europe  marks another important milestone for our ACTISAVE Phase 2/3 study. The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke in the USA  Europe  Japan  and China will approach 4 million patients by 20262  highlighting the urgent need for an effective treatment to address this major public health problem with a strong societal and economic impact.”In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) status by the European Medicines Agency for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke  recognizing the potential clinical benefit of glenzocimab and its relevance to the unmet medical need in this disease. Because efficacy data were a secondary endpoint of the Phase 1b/2a ACTIMIS study  glenzocimab was not eligible for Breakthrough Therapy status despite significant data on mortality and reduction of cerebral hemorrhage. Nevertheless  these data and the inclusion of patients in the USA will allow Acticor Biotech to apply for Fast Track status with the FDA in the coming weeks.About ACTISAVEACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients. In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

10510,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quadient-sa-solid-q2-growth-154500900.html,Quadient SA: Solid Q2 growth momentum supports an expected strong H2 performance,Solid Q2 growth momentum supports an expected strong H2 performance Solid business trends confirmed Group revenue of €524 million in H1 2022  up 4.0% on a...,QUADIENTSolid Q2 growth momentum supports an expected strong H2 performanceSolid business trends confirmedGroup revenue of € 524 million in H 1 2022  up 4 .0 % on a reported basis and 0. 7 % 1 organically vs. H1 2021. The Group continues to build a stronger and more resilient business model with growing subscription-related revenue now reaching 70% of total revenue in H1 2022 versus 67% in H1 2021.Revenue for Q2 2022 was up 5.4% on a reported basis and up 2.0%1 on an organic basis to €271 million at Group level  confirming the positive trend expected after Q1.At Major Operations level:Intelligent Communication Automation revenue was up 4.7% organically in H1 with growth in subscription-related revenue continues to accelerate with an 18.1% organic increase in Q2 and a strong Annual Recurring Revenue annualized organic growth at 28% (€173 million 2 at end of H1 2022)Mail-Related Solutions delivered organic growth in Q2 with a 1.2% increase bringing the H1 performance to a remarkable -0.3% organic change despite the high comparison basis in H1 2021.Parcel Locker Solutions returned to double digit organic growth in Q2 2022 at +15.8% as contract deployments fueled the growth and with the comparison basis no longer impacted by the large US retail deal as it was the case in Q1.European product launches and inflation weighted on H1 profitabilityCurrent EBIT 1F 3 reached €65 million vs €70 million in H1 2021. The current inflation environment weighted on the Group’s profitability  as the Company increased salaries to attract and retain talents and also adapted its marketing and travel expenses to a normalized post-covid level.Mail-Related Solutions delivered a high level of profitability with a 44.8% Solution Profit Margin as a result of dynamic pricing offsetting both supply chain and salaries increases while Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions profitability were impacted by European products launches and go-to-market acceleration costs.Net attributable income came in at €29 million for the period.Free cash flow2F4 was €13 million in H1 2022  reinforcing a solid liquidity position of €531 million3F5 as of 31 July 2022. The company’s financial position remained healthy with its net debt at €779 million and a leverage of 1.95x (EBITDA excluding leasing6) as of 31 July 2022 after the repayment of the ODIRNANE in June.Story continuesStrong H2 performance expected  FY 2022 guidance confirmedExpected organic growth in revenue is confirmed above 2% 7 compared to FY 2021. After a first quarter impacted by a high comparison basis  the solid business performance achieved in Q2 confirms the improving trend expected to materialize in the second half of the year.Current EBIT3 organic growth confirmed at low to mid-single digit compared to FY 2021. A significant increase in profitability is expected in H2  to be driven by the phasing of price increases through the year  the improvement in profitability from a growing installed base for both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions and the significant contribution of the high profitability of Mail-Related Solutions.Paris  26 September 2022 Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 second-quarter consolidated sales and half-year results (period ended on 31 July 2022).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  stated: “As evidenced by the top line growth achieved in the second quarter  we delivered solid business trends across all our solutions. In Intelligent Communication Automation  the accelerated growth in Annual Recurring Revenue together with the recent signature of our two largest cloud subscription deals further demonstrate the successful transition of our business model from on-premise software licenses to SaaS/Cloud solution  a success which is now also being well recognized by industry analysts. Moreover  revenue from parcel lockers went back to double-digit growth  and the growth achieved in Mail-Related business shows how Quadient is successfully managing its installed base  benefitting from the appeal of recently launched products.In the current inflationary environment  we maintained a stable gross margin as we have been able to offset higher year-over-year impact of increased supply chain costs with positive impact from higher prices. Nevertheless  profitability  as expected  was lower in the first part of the year as we increased our spendings to launch our products into new regions capitalizing on strong cross-selling opportunities and developing new territories.With over 70% of growing recurring revenue and more than 58% of our revenues in North America at the end of H1  Quadient is well equipped to face adverse macro conditions. In addition  taking into account our strong backlog across all three Solutions at the end of the period  we expect the positive business momentum to support higher growth in H2. Combining this growth with the full benefits from price indexation and increase in our already profitable installed bases  we are confident that profitability will significantly increase in the second part of the year. We are therefore confirming our full-year guidance.”POSITIVE UNDERLYING TRENDS SUPPORTIVE OF ORGANIC GROWTH ACCELERATIONGroup sales stood at €524 million in H1 2022  a 0.7% organic growth. On a reported basis  Group sales went up 4.0% compared to H1 2021  including a positive currency impact of +6.1% and a negative scope effect of -2.8%. In details  changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic business in the Nordics and the Shipping activities in France (both in June 2022).Consolidated salesIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% Intelligent Communication Automation 108 97 +11.5% +4.7% Mail-Related Solutions 342 320 +6.9% (0.3)% Parcel Locker Solutions 42 41 +3.2% (2.5)% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7%In € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% North America 287 250 +14.5% +2.5% Main European countries(a) 179 183 (2.2)% (3.0)% International(b) 27 25 +8.7% +7.7% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan and of Intelligent Communication Automation outside of North America and the Main European countries.Major OperationsSales from Major Operations reached €492 million (94% of total sales) in H1 2022  a 0.6% year-over-year organic growth and a 7.5% increase on a reported basis. Transition towards an increasingly subscription-based model continues to materialize with subscription-related revenues up 2.9% on an organic basis versus H1 2021 and now accounting for 71% of the Major Operations sales vs 69% in H1 2021.Sales in North America (58% of Major Operations) were up 2.5% organically to €287 million. This solid performance was driven by organic growth from Mail Related Solutions with strong hardware sales in the period and a double-digit organic increase in revenues from Intelligent Communication Automation cloud-based solutions  supported by strong cross-sell and the deployment of recently acquired SaaS fintech companies (Beanworks and YayPay). The contribution from Parcel Locker Solutions suffered from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (36% of Major Operations) were down 3.0% organically to €179 million  reflecting different trends with  on the one hand  a contained decline from Mail-Related Solutions and a relatively muted performance at Intelligent Communication Automation. And  on the other hand  organic growth from Parcel Locker Solutions was very strong mostly driven by the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts in the region.The International segment (5% of Major Operations) delivered a solid organic sales growth (+7.7% to €27 million)  driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation were up 4.7% organically  with double digit growth on a reported basis  at €108 million. Driven by the growing demand for cloud-based solutions  Quadient signed its two largest subscription deals in North America (>€1 million/year each). Growth in subscription-related revenue continued to accelerate with +18.1% organic growth in Q2 2022 after +15.7% in Q1 2022 and +9.2% in Q4 2021. Overall  subscription-related revenue went up 16.9% organically in H1 2022  now representing 74% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 66% in H1 2021 and 59% in FY 2020. Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 78% at the end of H1 2022 and annual recurring revenue stood at €173 million at the end of H1 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 2021(2). The solid increase in annual recurring revenue (+28% organically on an annualized basis vs the end of last year) should continue to fuel future subscription-related revenue growth.Conversely  license sales went down 45.3% organically  due  on the one hand to a comparison basis effect  with one large deal (c.$4 million) booked in the second quarter of 2021 and  on the other hand  to the progress of the transition to SaaS model. License sales now account for only 7% of the Solution’s total sales. Professional services were slightly down organically (-1.5%) due to the evolution in product mix and demanding comparison basis.The Solution profit margin6F8 for Intelligent Communication Automation was down 8.2 points year-over-year on an organic basis to 7.3%. The profitability of the solution in the first half 2022 was mainly impacted by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to higher marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of YayPay and Beanworks in selected European countries. In addition  the change of business model also weighed on the profitability of the Solution while the large license deal signed in Q2 2021 created a demanding comparison basis.Accelerating revenue growth  rising profitability of the installed base as well as phasing of the prices increases should support a significant improvement in profitability.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €342 million in H1 2022  up 6.9% on a reported basis and virtually flat organically (-0.3%) compared to H1 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+5.1% organic growth in H1 2021 vs H1 2020). This strong performance was driven by the organic growth of North America’s subscription related revenue and high single digit growth in license & hardware sales. Main European countries proved resilient with limited organic declines.In addition  despite the high comparison basis  the positive momentum in hardware sales continued with a 3.8% organic growth in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021. The performance was particularly strong in Q2 2022 with an 8.7% organic growth thanks to double digit organic growth in North America with further penetration of well received new generation of products.Meanwhile  Mail Related Solutions recorded a limited 1.8% organic decrease in subscription-related revenues (71% of Mail-Related Solutions sales). The resilience of both the installed base and subscription-related revenues remains strong  thanks to multi-year largely indexed contracts.The Solution Profit Margin8 for Mail-Related Solutions was remarkably stable on an organic basis to 44.8% despite the challenging conditions. The inflationary context and higher year-on-year freight costs weighted on profitability but proactive and tight cost control  benefits from remanufacturing as well as a largely indexed installed base led to this solid performance.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €42 million in H1 2022  a 2.5% organic decrease compared to H1 2021 and a 3.2% increase on a reported basis.Growth in hardware sales was impacted in Q1 2022 by the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021 while Q2 performance was no longer impacted by this base effect and hardware sales went up 25.1% organically vs Q2 2021. These differentiated performances brought the H1 2022 hardware decline to 19.8% compared to H1 2021.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.2% organically thanks to the continuous on-going roll-out of existing contracts  solid usage rate and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue now accounts for 61% of total revenue.In June 2022  Quadient announced the roll-out of a large open network of parcel lockers in the UK. The aim is to have a network of 5 000 lockers installed in the coming years with a target of 500 installations to be deployed by the end of 2022. Two leading international carriers DPD and DHL have already announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes and a third international carrier has recently joined the network. The Group expects this open network to continue to attract additional carriers and retailers.Quadient closed the semester with over 16 900 lockers installed globally  on track to deliver the Company’s 2023 target to reach 25 000 lockers thanks to a high level of backlog and a solid pipeline of projects which continue to progress despite some projects being delayed into 2023.Solution profit margin8 for Parcel Locker Solutions stood at -10.7% in H1 2022  a 10.5 points year-over-year organic decline. On the one hand  this was due to the significant impact of the completion of the deployment of the large US retail contract in Q1 2021  as well as the costs associated with new product and European network launches. On the other hand  the higher year-on-year supply chain costs were compensated by higher prices and the profitability of the installed base  which continue to improve at 28.4%.Profitability is expected to increase in H2 2022 with no further impact from supply and freight costs  rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €31 million in H1 2022  up 1.7% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 31.7% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packing Systems in 2021 and the partial impact of the divestments from Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and from the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022  marking the completion of the divestment programme as part of the portfolio reshaping initiated early 2019 with the launch of Back to Growth strategic plan. Additional Operations only accounted for 6% of total sales in H1 2022.Since June 2022  Additional Operations are only comprising Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of the Company’s main geographies  which represent revenue of around €50 million on an annual basis (based on FY 2021 figures  i.e. 4.9% of FY 2021 total revenue).Q2 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €271 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 5.4% on a reported basis and 2.0% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.9% organic growth in the quarter  with growth from Parcel Locker Solutions benefiting from a strong rebound after the high comparison basis from the deployment of a large retail contract in the region impacted the growth in Q1 and Mail-Related Solutions posting a positive performance as it grew organically. International grew +5.6% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained 2.6% organic decline mostly due to a lower contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Major Operations sales stood at €256 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 2.0% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Intelligent Communication Automation sales were down 0.5% organically to €55 million even though Subscription-related revenue continue to increase only partially offsetting the decline in license (high comparison basis from the large license deal (c. $4 million) signed in Q2 2021). Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €177 million  up by 1.2% on an organic basis. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €23 million in second quarter of 2022  with a +15.8% organic growth compared to Q2 2021 thanks to the on-going deployment of existing contracts in France and the UK and solid product placements.Additional Operations sales stood at €15 million in the second quarter of 2022  down 41.0% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 1.7% on an organic basis.REVIEW OF 2022 HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Sales 524 504 +4.0% Gross profit 385 366 Gross margin 73.5% 72.7% EBITDA 111 118 (5.8)% EBITDA margin 21.3% 23.5% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 65 70 (7.1)% Current operating income margin (before acquisitionrelated expenses) 12.5% 14.0% Current operating income 61 65 (6.3)% Net attributable income 29 45 (35.6)% Earnings per share 0.75 1.19 Diluted earnings per share 0.75 1.12Current operating income82223H1 2022 H1 2021 In € million MajorOperations Additional Operations Group total Major Operations Additional Operations Group total Revenue 492 31 524 458 46 504 Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 66 (1) 65 71 (1) 70Gross margin stood at 73.5% in H1 2022 compared to 72.7% in H1 2021. A solid performance considering the higher year-over-year freight and supply costs. The gross margin benefited from higher activity  higher prices  and a tight control over costs of sales.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses stood at €65 million in H1 2022 compared to €70 million in H1 2021  down 17.0% on an organic basis. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 12.5% of sales in H1 2022 compared to 14.0% in H1 2021.The lower current profitability reflects the impact from higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings  as well as investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers.However  profitability is expected to step up in H2 2022 supported by the expected strong activity level  the rising profitability of the installed base  the full benefits from recent price increases as well as the continuous focus on costs control.Acquisition-related expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  virtually stable compared to €6 million in H1 2021 as there were no significant fees related to M&A. Consequently  current operating income stood at €61 million in H1 2022  compared to €65 million in H1 2021.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  a much lower amount than in H1 2021  which stood at €12 million. As a reminder  H1 2021 was impacted by the divestment of the Drachten factory in the Netherlands and the Automated Packaging System. As a result  operating income stood at €56 million in H1 2022  a slight improvement on the €53 million recorded in H1 2021.Net attributable incomeH1 2022 net cost of debt was slightly up year-on-year at €12 million with the increase being linked with the refinancing of the ODIRNANE through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021 and the increase in interest rates.The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €2 million in H1 2022. As a reminder  currency gains and other financial items in H1 2021 benefited from the increase in the fair value of the investments made by Quadient in professional private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs.Overall  net financial result was a loss of €14 million in H1 2022 compared to a gain of €3 million in H1 2021.Income tax was €12 million in H1 2022 versus €10 million in H1 2021. This is mainly due to an increase in the tax charge in the United States as a result of the US tax group being subject to the BEAT tax in 2022. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 28.8% in H1 2022 compared to 17.6% in H1 2021.Net attributable income therefore amounted to €29 million in H1 2022 compared to €45 million in H1 2021.Earnings per share9 stood at €0.75 in H1 2022 compared to €1.19 in H1 2021  while fully diluted earnings per share was €0.75 in H1 2022 (€1.12 in H1 2021).Cash flow generationEBITDA9F10 stood at €111 million in H1 2022 compared to €118 million in H1 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.5% in H1 2021 to 21.3% in H1 2022 impacted by the increase in go-to-market for the Group’s growth engines.The change in working capital was negative by €53 million in H1 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €6 million in H1 2021. This is due to a higher level of inventories to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions as well as a slower collection of receivables compared to an exceptional collection rate in H1 2021 (catch-up effect after the 2020 Covid year).Lease receivables decreased by €18 million in H1 2022 compared to a decrease of €32 million in H1 2021  thanks to a better placement of hardware for Mail-Related Solutions lowering the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services increased to €613 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €595 million as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a decrease of 3.0% compared to the end of FY 2021. At the end of H1 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.8% compared to 1.7% at the end of the financial year 2021.Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €15 million in H1 2022 versus €41 million in H1 2021. This variation in H1 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US  an exceptional measure that was implemented during the Covid-19 related crisis.Capital expenditure was slightly up at €44 million in H1 2022 compared to €39 million in H1 2021. Development capex was up to €19 million in H1 2022 (vs €16 million in H1 2021) focusing on R&D investments for software developments. Rented equipment capex was slightly down year-over-year at €13 million in H1 2022  compared to €15 million in H1 2021  due to lower Mail-Related Solutions placement compared to H1 2021  which benefited from a post-Covid rebound  and in spite of on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan. The increase in maintenance capex was mostly linked to one-off projects  especially higher capitalized accounting finance projects as well as IT equipment spendings.Cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €13 million in H1 2022 compared to €54 million in H1 2021.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €779 million as of 31 July 2022 up from €504 million as of 31 January 2022. Whilst the overall financial structure remains stable  this increase in debt level is due to the repayment of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022 for €265 million. As a reminder  according to IFRS  ODIRNANE bonds were booked in equity. This repayment was allowed thanks to the issuance in November 2021 of a €270 Schuldschein. The Group has no other significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained almost stable at 3.3x6 as at 31 July 2022 vs 3.1x10F6 as at 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusting for the ODIRNANE in the calculation at 31 January 2022  the leverage ratio was also stable at 1.95x6 as of 31 July 2022 vs 1.9x6 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022).As of 31 July 2022  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €531 million  split between €131 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024. In order to manage the working capital needs  Quadient issued €46 million NEUCP in July 2022.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 132 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio12F11 went up to 68.4% from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt).OUTLOOKPositive momentum for revenues and expected step up in profitabilityFundamentals for the three solutions remain solid and organic growth in revenue is expected to accelerate in H2 supported by:i) the full impact of the acceleration in ARR bookings in Intelligent Communication Automation recorded at the end of H1 ii) full benefits from recent price increases across all activities iii) strong penetration of newly launched products and high backlog for Mail-Related Solutions as well as solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics at Intelligent Communication Automation andiv) deployment of existing contracts and delivery of the high backlog for Parcel Locker Solutions.2022 Guidance confirmedAt Group level  full-year 2022 organic sales growth is expected over 2%. Organic revenue growth trend seen in Q2 vs Q1 is expected to accelerate thanks to solid business fundamentals for all three solutions and despite the current challenging macro environment.Low to mid-single digit current EBIT3 organic growth112 is also confirmed with H2 expected to mark a significant improvement in profitability vs H1. The profitability of the installed base is expected to continue to increase for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  whilst Mail-Related profit margin should remain high. Acceleration in revenue growth  benefits from increased prices flowing through  focus on continuous costs optimization as well as an easier comparison basis should all contribute to this expected increase in current EBIT and an improved current EBIT margin in H2.2023 guidance unchangedBoth sales and current EBIT3 organic growth CAGR guidance over 2021-2023 are confirmed i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient and Decathlon Reaffirm Partnership on Parcel LockersOn 3 May 2022  Quadient announced that Decathlon  a leading global sporting goods retailer  will equip dozens of additional stores with Quadient’s automated parcel lockers in 2022. Since the adoption of the first Quadient locker solutions in 2015  Decathlon has equipped 62 stores in France with the lockers.

This increase reflects the need to anticipate potential one-off shortages and take recurring logistical challenges into account  in addition to the impact of the substantial and widespread price increases already mentioned (in particular for glass).OutlookAs expected  the trends discussed at the 30 June 2022 General Meeting  namely increases in raw material and energy prices and the variable availability of supplier production  continued over the summer  and appear likely to persist over the coming months.The Group therefore continues to be attentive to the impact of this volatile environment on its ability to supply all its customers worldwide  and to the strength of consumer demand  given the need to adapt its pricing policies. Against this background the Group maintains its cautious stance on business forecasts for 2022 year-end.In this context  even if the efforts deployed within the framework of the strategic plan are generating the expected returns  the Group remains cautious regarding the outlook for the balance of the 2022 year.Shareholder informationIn view of the forthcoming expiry date of the share warrants issued by the Company (the 2022 warrants)  COFEPP  the Company's controlling shareholder with 78.52% of its share capital  has indicated to the Company that it does not currently intend to initiate a public takeover bid for the remainder of the Company's capital.

The first half was a period of transition for the Group between the end of production at Leuna and the construction of the new Pomacle unit. The revenue generated by these activities will be recognised upon delivery of the first batch of Isonaturane® 12 in the first quarter of 2023. Delivery of two further batches is already foreseen for 2023: Global Bioenergies is fully committed to the commercialisation of its process.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: “Every tonne of Isonaturane® 12 produced and sold will bring naturalness to nearly 500 000 make-up products. This market offers ideal conditions for the roll-out of our technology: prices are high and there is a strong appetite for natural ingredients. We are already working towards the next horizon of building a plant capable of producing 2 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year by 2025  which will enable us to reach all cosmetics markets  and also to explore opportunities in the road and aviation fuel markets  among others.”Group Profit & Loss Account€ thousands from 01/01/22 from 01/01/21 from 01/01/20 Consolidated financial statements to 30/06/22 to 30/06/21 to 30/06/20 Operating income 1 059 1 903 1 728 Operating expenses 6 632 9 455 8 603 Operating profit (loss) -5 573 -7 552 -6 875 EBITDA -5 014 -6 515 -5 300 Financial profit (loss) -61 -79 -128 Exceptional profit (loss) -124 10 67 Income tax (research tax credit) NA* NA* NA* Net profit (loss) -5 759 -7 621 -6 936* By convention  the Group does not record a research tax credit in its half-year financial statements at the end of June.Story continuesOperating income mainly consists of:€144 000 of revenue  including €50 000 relating to the LAST ® brand  with the remainder primarily corresponding to the invoicing of samples sent to manufacturers  particularly in the make-up market;€894 000 in subsidies under various European programmes aimed at broadening the range of feedstocks that can be used in the process.The greatest changes in operating expenses can be found in the “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” line  details of which are provided below:€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of operating expenses Personnel costs 2 309 2 079 2 223 Industrialisation/Commercialisation 2 597 4 886 2 418 Change in inventory* -584 -520 - Laboratory 185 322 587 Rent and maintenance 423 413 511 Intellectual Property 137 326 270 Depreciation/Amortisation 559 1 038 1 576 Other 1 006 911 1 018 Total 6 632 9 455 8 603* a negative sign “–” here indicates a rise in inventory value€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” item INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION Industrial scaling up 1 301 332 695 Fermentation runs 753 3 203 3 258 Historical 1-step process - 2 062 1 607 New 2-step process 753 410 - Conversion of isobutene into Isonaturane® 12 64 747 - Product Development 243 - - LAST ® BRAND ACTIVITY Testing and production - 345 116 Brand development 235 990 - Total 2 597 4 886 2 418The Leuna demo plant was dismantled when the operating agreement ended in July 2021 after4 years in service. The main units were relocated to the Pomacle site in France for the second step of the new production process  while the first step  which consists of producing DMA - the precursor of isobutene - was carried out by tollers  leading to an increase in inventories of more than half a million euros.A smaller quantity of isobutene was converted into Isonaturane® 12 compared to the first half of 2021  the period during which the conversion process was developed.Work also focused on the development of products for marketing  including regulatory aspects. LAST® brand expenses relate to sales and marketing activities only.Group Balance SheetAssets (€ thousands) 30/06/22 31/12/21 Liabilities (€ thousands) 30/06/22 31/12/21 Intangible assets 658 800 Capital 743 743 Tangible assets 819 637 Share premium 29 289 29 289 Assets under construction 2 641 1 897 Balance carried forward -16 321 -4 697 Financial assets 1 547 1 544 Profit (loss) -5 759 -11 773 NON-CURRENT ASSETS 5 665 4 879 EQUITY 7 952 13 562 Industrialisation inventories 2 122 1 793 PROVISIONS 71 61 R&D consumables inventories 381 250 Receivables 3 502 3 524 Conditional advances and loans 11 678 12 454 Cash 11 706 20 931 Trade payables 2 962 3 520 Marketable securities 156 147 Tax and social security liabilities 561 1 185 Prepaid expenses 376 261 Other debts and deferred income 683 1 003 CURRENT ASSETS 18 242 26 907 PAYABLES and DEFERRED INCOME 15 884 18 163 TOTAL ASSETS 23 907 31 785 TOTAL LIABILITIES 23 907 31 785Assets: fixed assets increased due to the work carried out at the Pomacle site. Inventories increased mainly as a result of DMA production operations.Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €9.3 million during the period. Cash flow from operations changed by €7.3 million  including an increase of just under €2 million in working capital (increase in inventories  flat receivables  reduction in payables). The additional outflows of€2 million correspond to works at the Pomacle site and debt repayment.Liabilities: all liability items decreased. The Group no longer has any deferred income from publicly funded projects.Highlights of the first half of 2022  recent events and outlookThe very first orders for Isonaturane® 12 placed in June by several major cosmetics companies  including L’Oréal  were undoubtedly the most significant development of the first half of the year.A commercially focused process was implemented for the first time since the creation of the Company: this is a major step forward for Global Bioenergies  reflecting the desire of industry players to find ever more environmentally friendly solutions. These orders follow a customer referencing process carried out over several months  which included sending out samples for testing. Delivery of these initial orders is scheduled for early next year.Global Bioenergies’ Isonaturane® 12 stands out in the world of cosmetic ingredients for its particularly high selling price. The fact that it is the first cosmetic grade isododecane of natural origin gives it a very high added value. This molecule  traditionally derived from oil  is essential for longwear  water-resistant and low transfer make-up. When incorporated to achieve these characteristics  it is the main ingredient  representing between 25% and 50% of the formulation.Isonaturane® 12 thus opens the way to naturalness in the so-called “longwear” make-up segment  which represents a quarter of the global make-up market. The selling price of Isonaturane® 12 benefits from the specific characteristics of the make-up sector:Limited volumes compared to other cosmetic applications - a make-up product represents only a few grams of formulated ingredients. A single tonne of Isonaturane ® 12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to naturalness. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations.Very small proportion (less than 1%) of the cost of ingredients in the selling price of a finished make-up product.The business model for the upcoming periods will therefore be based on an operating chain capable of producing several dozen tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 per year from plant-derived and renewable resources  corresponding to annual revenue of several million euros.Horizon 1: Organisation of the LAST ® businessThe development and launch in June 2021 of the LAST® brand - the first make-up brand in the world to incorporate Isonaturane® 12 and thereby enable the combination of naturalness and longwear performance - required the enlisting of external expertise.After witnessing a successful launch  the choice was made to bring the functions required for the deployment of the brand in-house: sales  communication  digital marketing  and so on. A director was hired to lead this team of five people  increase awareness of the LAST® brand  boost sales and balance the ratio of expenses to revenue. This organisation resulted in a significant reduction in costs compared to 2021.In February  the team was awarded the prestigious Prix d’Excellence France award in the “Research and Innovation” category by Marie-Claire magazine  whose jury chose to recognise LAST® for its make-up combining performance and naturalness.Horizon 2: Construction of the new isobutene production unit in PomacleIn 2021  Global Bioenergies switched to using generic fermenters for the majority of its process that were much larger than the two fermenters it had previously used. Only the final step  the conversion of the isobutene precursor - DMA - into isobutene  still requires a specific fermenter.The decision was therefore taken to develop a commercial production chain at the Pomacle site using this so-called “two-step” process. The engineering studies and preparatory work carried out at the end of 2021 gave way to the actual construction and integration work  which took place in the first half of 2022. The very first batches of “two-step” isobutene were produced in March using the 0.5 m3 fermenter installed on site since 2015  prior to the connection of the 5 m3 fermenter from Leuna  which will soon increase the unit’s production capacity tenfold.A portion of the isobutene derived from this new process will then be converted into Isonaturane® 12 by a chain of tollers  with the remainder being used to explore other applications  including road and aviation fuels.Horizon 3 : Engineering work for the 2 000-tonne plant projectEngineering studies were carried out simultaneously during the first half of 2022 in order to define the industrial process for the 2 000-tonne plant and ensure its robustness. Experimental validation work was carried out for the key steps. A model was developed to ensure that they could be extrapolated to a larger scale.The mass and energy balances of the process were developed  challenged and optimised. This entailed a sequence of unit operations  selected on the basis of technical and environmental performance criteria. The Company has hired an engineering firm to carry out the preliminary design of the plant.Horizon 4: Breaking into the fuel marketsThe commercial opportunities for isobutene and its derivatives are not limited to Isonaturane® 12. Of course  this route offers the greatest potential in terms of pricing. However  isobutene was identified at the time of the Company’s creation because of the many markets in which it could be used: cosmetics  fuels  plastics  rubbers  fine chemicals  etc. The economic equation only functions today in the cosmetics market  we can nonetheless see a growing interest among all industry sectors in accessing raw materials with a better environmental profile.The huge fuel market - characterised by both high volumes and low prices - also has a need to limit its carbon footprint  particularly in the aviation sector. The Company expects to have its aviation process certified within the next six months. There are very few solutions in this field: only seven technologies worldwide have been certified to date. Several oil companies have approached Global Bioenergies in recent months  including giants Shell and Repsol  reflecting a growing interest in the Company’s solutions and potential. Efforts to improve the process will still be necessary in order to bring it to the level of cost required in the fuels sector.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

It has its own 10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring throughout the state of Illinois built using the Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system  allowing it to reach any customer by extending its network from the nearest Point-of-Presence (PoP) to the customer facility.Stratus is now also using the Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device (EAD) to provide wholesale  MEF-compliant  EPL (E-Access Ethernet Private Line) services to a third-party wireless network operator for mobile backhaul connectivity. Stratus chose the 1651 EAD primarily because of its support for wire-speed service activation testing (SAT) at 10Gbps (gigabit per second). Using IETF RFC-2544 and ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards  the 1651 acts as both the SAT generator & reflector  saving the cost of a second testing device while also speeding the SAT process.With this capability  Stratus now has the tool it needs to not only validate its service level agreements with real-time data  but also to show by how much it exceeded its contracted performance.""We are extremely pleased by the operational efficiency that the 1651 remote SAT testing has provided. Instead of rolling a truck to each site and using dedicated test equipment  we can use the built-in generator/reflector validate SLA on demand. I anticipate future cost savings as we upgrade cellular backhaul to 10Gbps line-rate without deploying any additional equipment or field techs for manual SAT testing. "" said Ben Russell  Chief Technology Officer  Stratus networks. Another reason for selecting the 1651 was Ekinops' ability to deliver within the required timeframe  the only vendor to make that commitment of those Stratus considered""""The 1651 is ideal for what Stratus is doing "" says Kevin Antill  Ekinops' group vice president of sales for North America.

The early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is a major public health concern. The presentation of the work of Guerbet's Artificial Intelligence (AI) research team  which could potentially offer a promising response to a medical need  convinced the jury to support this project with public fundingPancreatic cancer represents 496 000 cases per year  of which 14 500 are in France and 56 700 in the USAi. The number of patients suffering from this disease has doubled over the last 25 years. The mortality rate of patients is high with survival ranging from one to five years depending on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosisii. By 2040  pancreatic cancer will constitute the third cause of death by cancer in the EUiii and the fourth in the USAiv.“Today  far too many patients are diagnosed at a late stage due to the silent progression of the disease and the huge difficulty in distinguishing the early stages in routine medical imaging. Artificial Intelligence offers a new tool which could support radiologists in their mission”.Professor Vuillerme  Hospital Practitioner  Associate Professor at the Paris-Cité University  RadiologistUnfortunately  few therapeutic options are currently available to treat pancreatic cancer. Surgery is the only treatment which may potentially cure the disease  but it can only be considered during the early stages of the diseasev. Less than 20% of patients are eligible for surgery  as a result of the late detectionsvi.The early stages of pancreatic cancer are often asymptomatic  and the detection is often fortuitous and late. “Earlier detection would enable more patients to be eligible for surgery  which could lead to considerably higher survival rates.6 viiCT scans of the pancreas are often difficult to interpret for radiologists who are not specialized in digestive diseasesviii. With effective algorithms and solutions already under development for the detection of liver and prostate cancers  Guerbet continues to innovate and will thus potentially increase chance of surviving from this “silent” cancer. The solution developed by Guerbet will permit the automatic analysis of scanners and will provide radiologists with an alert when pancreatic cancer is suspected from the very first stages of the disease.“Every year the lives of thousands of families are disrupted by the announcement of a pancreatic cancer for which no one is prepared! Since 2016  Espoir Pancréas has been fighting for early detection of pancreatic cancer. We truly hope that in the future Artificial Intelligence solutions will offer improved diagnosis and prognosis for patients suffering from these cancers.”Philippe François-Steininger  Chairman of the association Espoir PancréasConnections with the project’s clinical partners are already in progress and certain French and international partnerships are already under discussion. Furthermore  a large database has already been constituted.This financial support will enable the acceleration of the development of the solution and the recognition provides great incentive for the project team.“BPI’s financial support is a great acknowledgement of the quality of Guerbet’s work in the field of Artificial Intelligence at the service of healthcare. This support will enable the development of the project to be accelerated and give it the dimension necessary to develop a commercial product by 2025. We are convinced that these promising Artificial Intelligence solutions will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of cancers with a high mortality rate. Guerbet is thus demonstrating once again the ability to provide professionals with a major innovation for the benefit of patients.”François Nicolas  Vice-President in charge of R&D at GuerbetAbout France 2030The France 2030 investment plan:Translates a dual ambition : to sustainably transform key sectors of our economy (energy  automobile  aeronautics and space) by technological innovation  and position France not only as an actor but as a leader in tomorrow’s world.

Current EBIT3 organic growth confirmed at low to mid-single digit compared to FY 2021. A significant increase in profitability is expected in H2  to be driven by the phasing of price increases through the year  the improvement in profitability from a growing installed base for both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions and the significant contribution of the high profitability of Mail-Related Solutions.Paris  26 September 2022 Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 second-quarter consolidated sales and half-year results (period ended on 31 July 2022).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  stated: “As evidenced by the top line growth achieved in the second quarter  we delivered solid business trends across all our solutions. In Intelligent Communication Automation  the accelerated growth in Annual Recurring Revenue together with the recent signature of our two largest cloud subscription deals further demonstrate the successful transition of our business model from on-premise software licenses to SaaS/Cloud solution  a success which is now also being well recognized by industry analysts. Moreover  revenue from parcel lockers went back to double-digit growth  and the growth achieved in Mail-Related business shows how Quadient is successfully managing its installed base  benefitting from the appeal of recently launched products.In the current inflationary environment  we maintained a stable gross margin as we have been able to offset higher year-over-year impact of increased supply chain costs with positive impact from higher prices. Nevertheless  profitability  as expected  was lower in the first part of the year as we increased our spendings to launch our products into new regions capitalizing on strong cross-selling opportunities and developing new territories.With over 70% of growing recurring revenue and more than 58% of our revenues in North America at the end of H1  Quadient is well equipped to face adverse macro conditions. In addition  taking into account our strong backlog across all three Solutions at the end of the period  we expect the positive business momentum to support higher growth in H2. Combining this growth with the full benefits from price indexation and increase in our already profitable installed bases  we are confident that profitability will significantly increase in the second part of the year. We are therefore confirming our full-year guidance.”POSITIVE UNDERLYING TRENDS SUPPORTIVE OF ORGANIC GROWTH ACCELERATIONGroup sales stood at €524 million in H1 2022  a 0.7% organic growth. On a reported basis  Group sales went up 4.0% compared to H1 2021  including a positive currency impact of +6.1% and a negative scope effect of -2.8%. In details  changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic business in the Nordics and the Shipping activities in France (both in June 2022).Consolidated salesIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% Intelligent Communication Automation 108 97 +11.5% +4.7% Mail-Related Solutions 342 320 +6.9% (0.3)% Parcel Locker Solutions 42 41 +3.2% (2.5)% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7%In € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% North America 287 250 +14.5% +2.5% Main European countries(a) 179 183 (2.2)% (3.0)% International(b) 27 25 +8.7% +7.7% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan and of Intelligent Communication Automation outside of North America and the Main European countries.Major OperationsSales from Major Operations reached €492 million (94% of total sales) in H1 2022  a 0.6% year-over-year organic growth and a 7.5% increase on a reported basis. Transition towards an increasingly subscription-based model continues to materialize with subscription-related revenues up 2.9% on an organic basis versus H1 2021 and now accounting for 71% of the Major Operations sales vs 69% in H1 2021.Sales in North America (58% of Major Operations) were up 2.5% organically to €287 million. This solid performance was driven by organic growth from Mail Related Solutions with strong hardware sales in the period and a double-digit organic increase in revenues from Intelligent Communication Automation cloud-based solutions  supported by strong cross-sell and the deployment of recently acquired SaaS fintech companies (Beanworks and YayPay). The contribution from Parcel Locker Solutions suffered from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (36% of Major Operations) were down 3.0% organically to €179 million  reflecting different trends with  on the one hand  a contained decline from Mail-Related Solutions and a relatively muted performance at Intelligent Communication Automation. And  on the other hand  organic growth from Parcel Locker Solutions was very strong mostly driven by the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts in the region.The International segment (5% of Major Operations) delivered a solid organic sales growth (+7.7% to €27 million)  driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation were up 4.7% organically  with double digit growth on a reported basis  at €108 million. Driven by the growing demand for cloud-based solutions  Quadient signed its two largest subscription deals in North America (>€1 million/year each). Growth in subscription-related revenue continued to accelerate with +18.1% organic growth in Q2 2022 after +15.7% in Q1 2022 and +9.2% in Q4 2021. Overall  subscription-related revenue went up 16.9% organically in H1 2022  now representing 74% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 66% in H1 2021 and 59% in FY 2020. Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 78% at the end of H1 2022 and annual recurring revenue stood at €173 million at the end of H1 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 2021(2). The solid increase in annual recurring revenue (+28% organically on an annualized basis vs the end of last year) should continue to fuel future subscription-related revenue growth.Conversely  license sales went down 45.3% organically  due  on the one hand to a comparison basis effect  with one large deal (c.$4 million) booked in the second quarter of 2021 and  on the other hand  to the progress of the transition to SaaS model. License sales now account for only 7% of the Solution’s total sales. Professional services were slightly down organically (-1.5%) due to the evolution in product mix and demanding comparison basis.The Solution profit margin6F8 for Intelligent Communication Automation was down 8.2 points year-over-year on an organic basis to 7.3%. The profitability of the solution in the first half 2022 was mainly impacted by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to higher marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of YayPay and Beanworks in selected European countries. In addition  the change of business model also weighed on the profitability of the Solution while the large license deal signed in Q2 2021 created a demanding comparison basis.Accelerating revenue growth  rising profitability of the installed base as well as phasing of the prices increases should support a significant improvement in profitability.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €342 million in H1 2022  up 6.9% on a reported basis and virtually flat organically (-0.3%) compared to H1 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+5.1% organic growth in H1 2021 vs H1 2020). This strong performance was driven by the organic growth of North America’s subscription related revenue and high single digit growth in license & hardware sales. Main European countries proved resilient with limited organic declines.In addition  despite the high comparison basis  the positive momentum in hardware sales continued with a 3.8% organic growth in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021. The performance was particularly strong in Q2 2022 with an 8.7% organic growth thanks to double digit organic growth in North America with further penetration of well received new generation of products.Meanwhile  Mail Related Solutions recorded a limited 1.8% organic decrease in subscription-related revenues (71% of Mail-Related Solutions sales). The resilience of both the installed base and subscription-related revenues remains strong  thanks to multi-year largely indexed contracts.The Solution Profit Margin8 for Mail-Related Solutions was remarkably stable on an organic basis to 44.8% despite the challenging conditions. The inflationary context and higher year-on-year freight costs weighted on profitability but proactive and tight cost control  benefits from remanufacturing as well as a largely indexed installed base led to this solid performance.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €42 million in H1 2022  a 2.5% organic decrease compared to H1 2021 and a 3.2% increase on a reported basis.Growth in hardware sales was impacted in Q1 2022 by the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021 while Q2 performance was no longer impacted by this base effect and hardware sales went up 25.1% organically vs Q2 2021. These differentiated performances brought the H1 2022 hardware decline to 19.8% compared to H1 2021.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.2% organically thanks to the continuous on-going roll-out of existing contracts  solid usage rate and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue now accounts for 61% of total revenue.In June 2022  Quadient announced the roll-out of a large open network of parcel lockers in the UK. The aim is to have a network of 5 000 lockers installed in the coming years with a target of 500 installations to be deployed by the end of 2022. Two leading international carriers DPD and DHL have already announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes and a third international carrier has recently joined the network. The Group expects this open network to continue to attract additional carriers and retailers.Quadient closed the semester with over 16 900 lockers installed globally  on track to deliver the Company’s 2023 target to reach 25 000 lockers thanks to a high level of backlog and a solid pipeline of projects which continue to progress despite some projects being delayed into 2023.Solution profit margin8 for Parcel Locker Solutions stood at -10.7% in H1 2022  a 10.5 points year-over-year organic decline. On the one hand  this was due to the significant impact of the completion of the deployment of the large US retail contract in Q1 2021  as well as the costs associated with new product and European network launches. On the other hand  the higher year-on-year supply chain costs were compensated by higher prices and the profitability of the installed base  which continue to improve at 28.4%.Profitability is expected to increase in H2 2022 with no further impact from supply and freight costs  rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €31 million in H1 2022  up 1.7% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 31.7% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packing Systems in 2021 and the partial impact of the divestments from Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and from the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022  marking the completion of the divestment programme as part of the portfolio reshaping initiated early 2019 with the launch of Back to Growth strategic plan. Additional Operations only accounted for 6% of total sales in H1 2022.Since June 2022  Additional Operations are only comprising Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of the Company’s main geographies  which represent revenue of around €50 million on an annual basis (based on FY 2021 figures  i.e. 4.9% of FY 2021 total revenue).Q2 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €271 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 5.4% on a reported basis and 2.0% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.9% organic growth in the quarter  with growth from Parcel Locker Solutions benefiting from a strong rebound after the high comparison basis from the deployment of a large retail contract in the region impacted the growth in Q1 and Mail-Related Solutions posting a positive performance as it grew organically. International grew +5.6% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained 2.6% organic decline mostly due to a lower contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Major Operations sales stood at €256 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 2.0% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Intelligent Communication Automation sales were down 0.5% organically to €55 million even though Subscription-related revenue continue to increase only partially offsetting the decline in license (high comparison basis from the large license deal (c. $4 million) signed in Q2 2021). Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €177 million  up by 1.2% on an organic basis. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €23 million in second quarter of 2022  with a +15.8% organic growth compared to Q2 2021 thanks to the on-going deployment of existing contracts in France and the UK and solid product placements.Additional Operations sales stood at €15 million in the second quarter of 2022  down 41.0% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 1.7% on an organic basis.REVIEW OF 2022 HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Sales 524 504 +4.0% Gross profit 385 366 Gross margin 73.5% 72.7% EBITDA 111 118 (5.8)% EBITDA margin 21.3% 23.5% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 65 70 (7.1)% Current operating income margin (before acquisitionrelated expenses) 12.5% 14.0% Current operating income 61 65 (6.3)% Net attributable income 29 45 (35.6)% Earnings per share 0.75 1.19 Diluted earnings per share 0.75 1.12Current operating income82223H1 2022 H1 2021 In € million MajorOperations Additional Operations Group total Major Operations Additional Operations Group total Revenue 492 31 524 458 46 504 Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 66 (1) 65 71 (1) 70Gross margin stood at 73.5% in H1 2022 compared to 72.7% in H1 2021. A solid performance considering the higher year-over-year freight and supply costs. The gross margin benefited from higher activity  higher prices  and a tight control over costs of sales.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses stood at €65 million in H1 2022 compared to €70 million in H1 2021  down 17.0% on an organic basis. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 12.5% of sales in H1 2022 compared to 14.0% in H1 2021.The lower current profitability reflects the impact from higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings  as well as investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers.However  profitability is expected to step up in H2 2022 supported by the expected strong activity level  the rising profitability of the installed base  the full benefits from recent price increases as well as the continuous focus on costs control.Acquisition-related expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  virtually stable compared to €6 million in H1 2021 as there were no significant fees related to M&A. Consequently  current operating income stood at €61 million in H1 2022  compared to €65 million in H1 2021.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  a much lower amount than in H1 2021  which stood at €12 million. As a reminder  H1 2021 was impacted by the divestment of the Drachten factory in the Netherlands and the Automated Packaging System. As a result  operating income stood at €56 million in H1 2022  a slight improvement on the €53 million recorded in H1 2021.Net attributable incomeH1 2022 net cost of debt was slightly up year-on-year at €12 million with the increase being linked with the refinancing of the ODIRNANE through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021 and the increase in interest rates.The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €2 million in H1 2022. As a reminder  currency gains and other financial items in H1 2021 benefited from the increase in the fair value of the investments made by Quadient in professional private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs.Overall  net financial result was a loss of €14 million in H1 2022 compared to a gain of €3 million in H1 2021.Income tax was €12 million in H1 2022 versus €10 million in H1 2021. This is mainly due to an increase in the tax charge in the United States as a result of the US tax group being subject to the BEAT tax in 2022. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 28.8% in H1 2022 compared to 17.6% in H1 2021.Net attributable income therefore amounted to €29 million in H1 2022 compared to €45 million in H1 2021.Earnings per share9 stood at €0.75 in H1 2022 compared to €1.19 in H1 2021  while fully diluted earnings per share was €0.75 in H1 2022 (€1.12 in H1 2021).Cash flow generationEBITDA9F10 stood at €111 million in H1 2022 compared to €118 million in H1 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.5% in H1 2021 to 21.3% in H1 2022 impacted by the increase in go-to-market for the Group’s growth engines.The change in working capital was negative by €53 million in H1 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €6 million in H1 2021. This is due to a higher level of inventories to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions as well as a slower collection of receivables compared to an exceptional collection rate in H1 2021 (catch-up effect after the 2020 Covid year).Lease receivables decreased by €18 million in H1 2022 compared to a decrease of €32 million in H1 2021  thanks to a better placement of hardware for Mail-Related Solutions lowering the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services increased to €613 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €595 million as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a decrease of 3.0% compared to the end of FY 2021. At the end of H1 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.8% compared to 1.7% at the end of the financial year 2021.Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €15 million in H1 2022 versus €41 million in H1 2021. This variation in H1 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US  an exceptional measure that was implemented during the Covid-19 related crisis.Capital expenditure was slightly up at €44 million in H1 2022 compared to €39 million in H1 2021. Development capex was up to €19 million in H1 2022 (vs €16 million in H1 2021) focusing on R&D investments for software developments. Rented equipment capex was slightly down year-over-year at €13 million in H1 2022  compared to €15 million in H1 2021  due to lower Mail-Related Solutions placement compared to H1 2021  which benefited from a post-Covid rebound  and in spite of on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan. The increase in maintenance capex was mostly linked to one-off projects  especially higher capitalized accounting finance projects as well as IT equipment spendings.Cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €13 million in H1 2022 compared to €54 million in H1 2021.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €779 million as of 31 July 2022 up from €504 million as of 31 January 2022. Whilst the overall financial structure remains stable  this increase in debt level is due to the repayment of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022 for €265 million. As a reminder  according to IFRS  ODIRNANE bonds were booked in equity. This repayment was allowed thanks to the issuance in November 2021 of a €270 Schuldschein. The Group has no other significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained almost stable at 3.3x6 as at 31 July 2022 vs 3.1x10F6 as at 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusting for the ODIRNANE in the calculation at 31 January 2022  the leverage ratio was also stable at 1.95x6 as of 31 July 2022 vs 1.9x6 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022).As of 31 July 2022  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €531 million  split between €131 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024. In order to manage the working capital needs  Quadient issued €46 million NEUCP in July 2022.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 132 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio12F11 went up to 68.4% from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt).OUTLOOKPositive momentum for revenues and expected step up in profitabilityFundamentals for the three solutions remain solid and organic growth in revenue is expected to accelerate in H2 supported by:i) the full impact of the acceleration in ARR bookings in Intelligent Communication Automation recorded at the end of H1 ii) full benefits from recent price increases across all activities iii) strong penetration of newly launched products and high backlog for Mail-Related Solutions as well as solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics at Intelligent Communication Automation andiv) deployment of existing contracts and delivery of the high backlog for Parcel Locker Solutions.2022 Guidance confirmedAt Group level  full-year 2022 organic sales growth is expected over 2%.

The profitability of the installed base is expected to continue to increase for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  whilst Mail-Related profit margin should remain high. Acceleration in revenue growth  benefits from increased prices flowing through  focus on continuous costs optimization as well as an easier comparison basis should all contribute to this expected increase in current EBIT and an improved current EBIT margin in H2.2023 guidance unchangedBoth sales and current EBIT3 organic growth CAGR guidance over 2021-2023 are confirmed i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient and Decathlon Reaffirm Partnership on Parcel LockersOn 3 May 2022  Quadient announced that Decathlon  a leading global sporting goods retailer  will equip dozens of additional stores with Quadient’s automated parcel lockers in 2022.

The audit procedures have been carried out.Simplified income statement - H1 2022€m except EPS H1 2021 H1 2022 Change2022 vs 2021 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 81.0 86.4 +5.9% Gross margin 32.2 34.4 +€2.2m Gross margin ratio 39.7% 39.9% +0.2 pts EBITDA 6.0 7.6 +€1.6m Underlying operating profit 2.5 5.5 +€3.0m Net profit (Group share) 1.5 2.5 +€1.0m Net earnings per share 0.02 0.02 -First half 2022 revenuesFirst half 2022 revenues excluding excise duties came to €86.4 million in the first half of 2022  up 5.9% versus H1 2021 (excl. currency impact). This improvement  largely driven by on-trade business  is due in particular to the recovery of a number of markets following the reopening of bars and restaurants.The France cluster posted first half 2022 revenues of €40.1m  up 2.5% versus H1 2021  mainly due to a significant recovery in the on-trade business  albeit less pronounced in the second quarter  and flat sales in the off-trade market. The Group’s main brands posted a resilient performance in the first half of 2022.Commercial policy adjustments across all distribution channels have been and may continue to be necessary in order to adapt to the current volatile context.The International cluster posted H1 2022 revenues of €46.3m  up 9.2% from the first half of 2021 at constant exchange rates  reflecting contrasting trends across regions:confirmed recovery in Europe  particularly in the UK following health restrictions in 2021  despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict  which led to a limited decline in certain export regions;strong performances across all of the Group’s strategic brands  particularly Marie Brizard and Gautier  in Canada  South Korea  Australia and Poland;decline in US sales of Sobieski vodka in a highly competitive market segment.EarningsAmid significant volatility and increasing prices  the H1 2022 gross margin of 39.9% was stable compared to last year at €34.4 million.EBITDA rose to €7.6 million in H1 2022  up from €6.0 million last year.A €1.5 million decline in EBITDA in France  related to the recognition in the first half of 2021 of part of a one-off €1.7 million discount granted by a supplier at the end of the year  was offset by a solid performance in the International cluster (up €2.3m). H1 2022 saw the recovery of several direct export markets (UK  Canada  South Korea and Australia) and subsidiaries (MBWS Baltics).Group EBITDA was also boosted by a decrease in the holding company’s structural costs  following the reorganisation initiated in 2021.H1 2022 EBITDA by cluster€m H1 2021 LFLchange Currency impact H1 2022 LFL change(excl. currency impact) Reported growth (incl. currency impact) France 6.5 (1.5) - 5.0 -22.9% -22.9% International 3.3 2.2 0.1 5.6 +67.8% +70.1% Holding company (3.8) 0.8 - (3.0) +21.3% +21.3% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 6.0 1.5 0.1 7.6 +25.9% +27.2%Net profit (Group share) amounted to €2.5 million in the first half of 2022  up €1.0 million compared to H1 2021  which included a net loss from discontinued operations of €0.9 million.Balance sheet at 30 June 2022Shareholders’ equity (Group share) amounted to €178.3 million at 30 June 2022  up from €173.6 million at 31 December 2021  while gross debt remained stable at €6.0 million in the first half of 2022  as did positive Group cash balances of €53.4 million at 30 June 2022.There was a substantial temporary increase in inventories and work-in-progress to €46.1 million at 30 June 2022  up €11 million from 30 June 2021  including +€7.3 million for raw materials. This increase reflects the need to anticipate potential one-off shortages and take recurring logistical challenges into account  in addition to the impact of the substantial and widespread price increases already mentioned (in particular for glass).OutlookAs expected  the trends discussed at the 30 June 2022 General Meeting  namely increases in raw material and energy prices and the variable availability of supplier production  continued over the summer  and appear likely to persist over the coming months.The Group therefore continues to be attentive to the impact of this volatile environment on its ability to supply all its customers worldwide  and to the strength of consumer demand  given the need to adapt its pricing policies. Against this background the Group maintains its cautious stance on business forecasts for 2022 year-end.In this context  even if the efforts deployed within the framework of the strategic plan are generating the expected returns  the Group remains cautious regarding the outlook for the balance of the 2022 year.Shareholder informationIn view of the forthcoming expiry date of the share warrants issued by the Company (the 2022 warrants)  COFEPP  the Company's controlling shareholder with 78.52% of its share capital  has indicated to the Company that it does not currently intend to initiate a public takeover bid for the remainder of the Company's capital.

The first half was a period of transition for the Group between the end of production at Leuna and the construction of the new Pomacle unit. The revenue generated by these activities will be recognised upon delivery of the first batch of Isonaturane® 12 in the first quarter of 2023. Delivery of two further batches is already foreseen for 2023: Global Bioenergies is fully committed to the commercialisation of its process.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: “Every tonne of Isonaturane® 12 produced and sold will bring naturalness to nearly 500 000 make-up products. This market offers ideal conditions for the roll-out of our technology: prices are high and there is a strong appetite for natural ingredients. We are already working towards the next horizon of building a plant capable of producing 2 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year by 2025  which will enable us to reach all cosmetics markets  and also to explore opportunities in the road and aviation fuel markets  among others.”Group Profit & Loss Account€ thousands from 01/01/22 from 01/01/21 from 01/01/20 Consolidated financial statements to 30/06/22 to 30/06/21 to 30/06/20 Operating income 1 059 1 903 1 728 Operating expenses 6 632 9 455 8 603 Operating profit (loss) -5 573 -7 552 -6 875 EBITDA -5 014 -6 515 -5 300 Financial profit (loss) -61 -79 -128 Exceptional profit (loss) -124 10 67 Income tax (research tax credit) NA* NA* NA* Net profit (loss) -5 759 -7 621 -6 936* By convention  the Group does not record a research tax credit in its half-year financial statements at the end of June.Operating income mainly consists of:€144 000 of revenue  including €50 000 relating to the LAST ® brand  with the remainder primarily corresponding to the invoicing of samples sent to manufacturers  particularly in the make-up market;brand  with the remainder primarily corresponding to the invoicing of samples sent to manufacturers  particularly in the make-up market; €894 000 in subsidies under various European programmes aimed at broadening the range of feedstocks that can be used in the process.The greatest changes in operating expenses can be found in the “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” line  details of which are provided below:€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of operating expenses Personnel costs 2 309 2 079 2 223 Industrialisation/Commercialisation 2 597 4 886 2 418 Change in inventory* -584 -520 - Laboratory 185 322 587 Rent and maintenance 423 413 511 Intellectual Property 137 326 270 Depreciation/Amortisation 559 1 038 1 576 Other 1 006 911 1 018 Total 6 632 9 455 8 603* a negative sign “–” here indicates a rise in inventory value€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” item INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION Industrial scaling up 1 301 332 695 Fermentation runs 753 3 203 3 258 Historical 1-step process - 2 062 1 607 New 2-step process 753 410 - Conversion of isobutene into Isonaturane® 12 64 747 - Product Development 243 - - LAST ® BRAND ACTIVITY Testing and production - 345 116 Brand development 235 990 - Total 2 597 4 886 2 418The Leuna demo plant was dismantled when the operating agreement ended in July 2021 after4 years in service. The main units were relocated to the Pomacle site in France for the second step of the new production process  while the first step  which consists of producing DMA - the precursor of isobutene - was carried out by tollers  leading to an increase in inventories of more than half a million euros.A smaller quantity of isobutene was converted into Isonaturane® 12 compared to the first half of 2021  the period during which the conversion process was developed.Work also focused on the development of products for marketing  including regulatory aspects.

Inventories increased mainly as a result of DMA production operations.Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €9.3 million during the period. Cash flow from operations changed by €7.3 million  including an increase of just under €2 million in working capital (increase in inventories  flat receivables  reduction in payables). The additional outflows of€2 million correspond to works at the Pomacle site and debt repayment.Liabilities: all liability items decreased. The Group no longer has any deferred income from publicly funded projects.Highlights of the first half of 2022  recent events and outlookThe very first orders for Isonaturane® 12 placed in June by several major cosmetics companies  including L’Oréal  were undoubtedly the most significant development of the first half of the year.A commercially focused process was implemented for the first time since the creation of the Company: this is a major step forward for Global Bioenergies  reflecting the desire of industry players to find ever more environmentally friendly solutions. These orders follow a customer referencing process carried out over several months  which included sending out samples for testing. Delivery of these initial orders is scheduled for early next year.Global Bioenergies’ Isonaturane® 12 stands out in the world of cosmetic ingredients for its particularly high selling price. The fact that it is the first cosmetic grade isododecane of natural origin gives it a very high added value. This molecule  traditionally derived from oil  is essential for longwear  water-resistant and low transfer make-up. When incorporated to achieve these characteristics  it is the main ingredient  representing between 25% and 50% of the formulation.Isonaturane® 12 thus opens the way to naturalness in the so-called “longwear” make-up segment  which represents a quarter of the global make-up market. The selling price of Isonaturane® 12 benefits from the specific characteristics of the make-up sector:Limited volumes compared to other cosmetic applications - a make-up product represents only a few grams of formulated ingredients. A single tonne of Isonaturane ® 12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to naturalness. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations.12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to naturalness. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations. Very small proportion (less than 1%) of the cost of ingredients in the selling price of a finished make-up product.The business model for the upcoming periods will therefore be based on an operating chain capable of producing several dozen tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 per year from plant-derived and renewable resources  corresponding to annual revenue of several million euros.Horizon 1: Organisation of the LAST ® businessThe development and launch in June 2021 of the LAST® brand - the first make-up brand in the world to incorporate Isonaturane® 12 and thereby enable the combination of naturalness and longwear performance - required the enlisting of external expertise.After witnessing a successful launch  the choice was made to bring the functions required for the deployment of the brand in-house: sales  communication  digital marketing  and so on. A director was hired to lead this team of five people  increase awareness of the LAST® brand  boost sales and balance the ratio of expenses to revenue. This organisation resulted in a significant reduction in costs compared to 2021.In February  the team was awarded the prestigious Prix d’Excellence France award in the “Research and Innovation” category by Marie-Claire magazine  whose jury chose to recognise LAST® for its make-up combining performance and naturalness.Horizon 2: Construction of the new isobutene production unit in PomacleIn 2021  Global Bioenergies switched to using generic fermenters for the majority of its process that were much larger than the two fermenters it had previously used. Only the final step  the conversion of the isobutene precursor - DMA - into isobutene  still requires a specific fermenter.The decision was therefore taken to develop a commercial production chain at the Pomacle site using this so-called “two-step” process. The engineering studies and preparatory work carried out at the end of 2021 gave way to the actual construction and integration work  which took place in the first half of 2022. The very first batches of “two-step” isobutene were produced in March using the 0.5 m3 fermenter installed on site since 2015  prior to the connection of the 5 m3 fermenter from Leuna  which will soon increase the unit’s production capacity tenfold.A portion of the isobutene derived from this new process will then be converted into Isonaturane® 12 by a chain of tollers  with the remainder being used to explore other applications  including road and aviation fuels.Horizon 3 : Engineering work for the 2 000-tonne plant projectEngineering studies were carried out simultaneously during the first half of 2022 in order to define the industrial process for the 2 000-tonne plant and ensure its robustness. Experimental validation work was carried out for the key steps. A model was developed to ensure that they could be extrapolated to a larger scale.The mass and energy balances of the process were developed  challenged and optimised. This entailed a sequence of unit operations  selected on the basis of technical and environmental performance criteria. The Company has hired an engineering firm to carry out the preliminary design of the plant.Horizon 4: Breaking into the fuel marketsThe commercial opportunities for isobutene and its derivatives are not limited to Isonaturane® 12. Of course  this route offers the greatest potential in terms of pricing. However  isobutene was identified at the time of the Company’s creation because of the many markets in which it could be used: cosmetics  fuels  plastics  rubbers  fine chemicals  etc. The economic equation only functions today in the cosmetics market  we can nonetheless see a growing interest among all industry sectors in accessing raw materials with a better environmental profile.The huge fuel market - characterised by both high volumes and low prices - also has a need to limit its carbon footprint  particularly in the aviation sector. The Company expects to have its aviation process certified within the next six months. There are very few solutions in this field: only seven technologies worldwide have been certified to date. Several oil companies have approached Global Bioenergies in recent months  including giants Shell and Repsol  reflecting a growing interest in the Company’s solutions and potential. Efforts to improve the process will still be necessary in order to bring it to the level of cost required in the fuels sector.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

Part of the company's global inspace project  the new Warehouse is designed to reshape employees' work environment to stimulate innovation  reimagine collaboration  and create and deliver value for patients living with severe diseases.“Leaders from the International WELL Building Institute and U.S. Green Building Council joined UCB executives to present the plaques certifying the Atlanta Warehouse on UCB’s campus as LEED Gold and WELL Platinum. Pictured L to R: Jean-Christophe Tellier  CEO  UCB; Dustin Mason  Associate Director  U.S. Market Transformation & Development  U.S. Green Building Council; Judith Webb  Executive Vice President  International WELL Building Institute; Patty Fritz  Vice President  Corporate Affairs  UCB; Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President and Head of Immunology and U.S. Solutions  UCB.First launched and implemented in UCB's Brussels  Belgium  headquarters in 2018  the inspace model offers employees four main work environments with unique design elements and functions. From quiet workspaces that promote individual tasks and confidential discussions  to open workspaces that foster connectivity  the four distinctly designed areas within inspace allow employees to tailor their environment to best suit their work activities and goals.""Everything we do at UCB is to keep people living with severe and rare diseases in mind – ensuring they can live their best lives  whatever that means for them – and the inspace reimagined work environment invests in our employees and facilitates collaboration as they pursue this mission "" said Patty Fritz  UCB's Vice President of U.S. Corporate Affairs. ""We are already seeing the positive impact the Atlanta Warehouse is delivering for our patients  employees  the environment  and the greater Atlanta community as it is the first building in UCB's network of almost 40 countries to receive this level of distinction.""The Atlanta Warehouse inspace project achieved LEED Gold certification for implementing practical and measurable strategies and solutions in areas including sustainable site development  water savings  energy efficiency  materials selection  and indoor environmental quality. In the U.S. alone  buildings account for almost 40 percent of national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; LEED-certified buildings create 34 percent lower CO2 emissions  consume 25 percent less energy and 11 percent less water  and divert more than 80 million tons of waste from landfills. UCB's Atlanta Warehouse is one of only 50 buildings in the pharmaceutical industry globally to achieve LEED Gold certification.In addition to LEED Gold  the Atlanta Warehouse project also achieved WELL certification at the Platinum level by the IWBI and is one of only two WELL Platinum certified pharmaceutical projects in the world. The Warehouse is also the first project to be awarded WELL Platinum certification in the state of Georgia.The UCB Warehouse inspace project is developed and designed to reflect UCB's sustainable business approach  creating healthy work environments  and minimizing the company's environmental impact on the greater Atlanta area. Key features achieved by the inspace project include:Diverting more than 85 percent of Warehouse waste generated during construction – equating to more than 1 500 tons of waste and saving 60 loaded standard garbage trucks from the landfill.Reducing the Warehouse's total energy consumption by 30 percent against the American Society of Heating  Refrigerating and Air-Condition Engineers (ASHRAE) 90.1-2010 baseline and without using any fossil fuel energy sources  in support of UCB's commitment to reduce its overall Green House Gas (GHG) CO2 emissions by 35 percent by 2030.Offsetting approximately 20 percent of the buildings' anticipated total annual energy use by installing a 223-kWh photovoltaic array (solar panels) for supplemental power generation located on the roof.Installing two 8 000-gallon cisterns to capture rainwater for landscape irrigation serving both the Warehouse project site and elsewhere on campus which is sufficient to serve 100 percent of the annual irrigation needs for the landscape served by this system.""Sustainability is an integral part of our business approach. UCB is dedicated to improving technology and energy efficiency in its facilities. Implementing the inspace model is one step of many as we work toward a more sustainable model for our Atlanta campus and beyond "" Fritz stated.The Atlanta Warehouse project was initiated in 2018 and Phase II of the project  which involved finalization of the building  and was completed in the second half of 2021. Phase III of the project is expected to begin in early 2023 with a planned redesign and renovation for an additional building on the campus.To learn more about the UCB Atlanta Warehouse inspace project  please visit https://ucbusa.news/3StKeMj.About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including but not limited to  the ability of UCB to successfully integrate the operations of Zogenix as planned or at all  estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.
