Furthermore  the Board of Directors believes that it is beneficial for the company and the shareholders that the incentive program's participants thus are given a personal and long-term ownership commitment. Such ownership commitment is expected to stimulate increased interest in the company's business and earnings development as a whole  as well as to achieve increased community of interest between the participants and the company's shareholders.In light of the terms  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the Board of Directors considers that the proposed warrant program as follows below is reasonable and beneficial for the company and its shareholders.A. Issue of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a directed issue of no more than 160 000 warrants of series 2022/2025  meaning the share capital upon full exercise may increase by no more than SEK 4 083.59. The following conditions shall otherwise apply to the resolution.The right to subscribe warrants is  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  given to Re:NewCell AB with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to two key persons within the company in accordance with the proposal under item B below. The company shall have no right to dispose of the warrants in any other way than as follows from the proposal under item B below. Over-subscription is not allowed. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants shall be used within the framework of the warrant program. The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the company. Subscription of the warrants shall take place within two weeks from the day of the resolution on the issue. The Board of Directors has the right to prolong the subscription period. Each (1) warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) share in the company. Subscription of new shares by support of the warrants may take place during the period commencing on 15 November 2025 (however not earlier than the day after the publication of the company's interim report for the period Q3 2025) up to and including the date that falls 30 calendar days thereafter. Under the terms and conditions of the warrants  the period during which the warrants may be exercised may be extended if participants are prevented from exercising their subscription rights due to applicable laws on insider trading or any equivalents. The subscription price for each new share subscribed by support of the warrants shall be determined to an amount equivalent to 160 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period from and including 12 October 2022 up to and including 25 October 2022. In connection with subscription of shares exercised through warrants  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quotient value shall be added to the non-restricted share premium reserve. The newly issued shares following exercise of the warrants shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividend that takes place after the shares have been registered and recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. Warrants held by the company and which have not been transferred in accordance with item B below or which have been repurchased from the participants may be canceled by the company following a resolution by the Board of Directors. Cancellation must be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available on the company's website  renewcell.com. As set forth in the terms and conditions for the warrants  the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitle to subscription of may be recalculated in certain cases.B. Approval of transfer of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve that the company  within the framework of the warrant program  transfers no more than 160 000 warrants of series 2022/2025 to two key persons in the company on the following terms:1. The warrant program will include no more than the following number of warrants for the following participants (the ""participants""):Category Maximum number of options Incoming CFO (1 person) 80 000 warrants Incoming CCO (1 person) 80 000 warrantsOver-allotment is not allowed.Right to acquire warrants from the company presupposes that the participants by the end of the subscription period have not resigned or been dismissed. Warrants that are not acquired as above or that are repurchased from participants may be offered future new key persons. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution.Transfers to the participants presupposes that the warrants can be acquired legally and that the Board of Directors assesses that it can be made against reasonable administrative and financial efforts.2. Notice of acquisition of warrants shall take place during the period from and including 26 October 2022 up to and including 14 November 2022. The Board of Directors shall however have a right to prolong the notice period of acquisition as well as to specify a corresponding notice period for new key persons whose acquisitions take place after the end of the initial notice period. The company's Board of Directors resolves on the final allotment  in accordance with the principles established by the general meeting.The reason why persons may be granted warrants at such a time that the time between the allotment and the beginning of the period for subscription of new shares by support of the warrants may be less than three years is that the Board of Directors deems it important that such new employees  for the reasons that apply to the program as a whole  are given an opportunity to take part in the value growth of Re:NewCell's share already at the beginning of the employment. No transfers may  however  take place after the 2023 Annual General Meeting.3. The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price established in accordance with a calculated market value for the warrants by application of Black & Scholes valuation model.Payment for allotted warrants shall be made in cash no later than ten days after the notice of acquisition.The warrants shall otherwise be subject to market terms.4. A prerequisite for being allotted warrants is that the participants have signed a special post-transfer purchase rights agreement on customary terms and conditions set by the Board of Directors. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement  the company  or its designee  has the right to repurchase warrants from the participants under certain conditions  subject to such limitations as may be imposed by law.DilutionAs of the day of the proposal there are 33 943 003 shares in the company. If all warrants that may be issued and transferred are exercised for subscription of shares  the number of shares and votes in the company will increase by no more than 160 000 (subject to possible recalculation of the number of shares according to the terms and conditions of the warrants)  corresponding to a dilution of the share capital and votes in the company of approximately 0.47 percent.Preliminary valuation  costs for the company and effect on key ratiosThe market value of a warrant of series 2022/2025 is  pursuant to preliminary valuation in accordance with Black & Scholes valuation model  SEK 9.9. The preliminary valuation is based on the assumption that the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period from and including 12 October 2022 up to and including 25 October 2022 will amount to SEK 90  resulting in a subscription price of SEK 144 per share upon exercise of the warrants  and the assumption of a volatility of 35 percent  a risk-free interest rate of 2.3 percent  a dividend yield of 0 percent and a term of three years. In connection with transfers of warrants to participants  the market value will be established based on updated assumptions and then-known parameters.As the warrants are to be transferred the key person at an estimated market value  the incentive program is not deemed to entail any costs in addition to certain minor costs for the preparation and administration. Assuming issue and full allotment of the proposed warrants  the proceeds from the transfers of warrants are estimated to exceed the costs of creating the program.The warrants are expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key ratio earnings per share.Preparation of the proposalThe proposed resolution on adoption of the incentive program and the proposals under item A and B above have been prepared by the Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors.OtherThe Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make the minor adjustment to the above resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Existing incentive programsAt the time of this proposal  there are four outstanding share-based incentive programs in the company.Employee options (Warrants series 2019/2027)Under 2018  the company's Board of Directors resolved on the introduction of an employee option program. Delivery of shares under the employee option program of series 2019/2027 is secured through the issue of warrants. As of the date of this proposal  there are 1 400 options under this employee option program  which after recalculation  entitles subscription for 91 000 shares during the period from 15 December 2021 to 31 December 2025.Warrants series 2018/2022The program encompasses 11 772 warrants of series 2018/2022 that grant the right  after recalculation  to subscribe for 765 180 shares during the period from 20 December 2021 to 31 December 2022. All warrants are held by PEEL AB  a company wholly owned by the company's CEO Patrik Lundström.Warrants series 2019/2023The program encompasses 10 464 warrants of series 2019/2023 that grant the right  after recalculation  to subscribe for 680 160 shares during the period from 3 September 2022 to 3 September 2023.

The Company is in active discussions with a prospective partner for potentially funding the development of a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine. These ongoing discussions may continue for several months and may not lead to an agreement.In parallel  Valneva is continuing discussions with various governments and has initiated regulatory processes with additional regulatory authorities  with the aim to deploy remaining inventory into international markets in the next twelve months. The Company also expects to report additional clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2022  notably heterologous booster data  which may potentially support the positioning of its inventory.Thomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “As we are near the end of the third quarter 2022  we are engaged in active discussions that are likely to continue into the coming months. We therefore plan to continue exploring these potential funding opportunities and will provide future updates if and when we enter into an agreement for further development of our COVID-19 vaccine program.”About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).Story continuesVLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe2 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom3 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates4 and Kingdom of Bahrain5. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain6. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA20017. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine. Valneva is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Valneva Investor and Media ContactsLaetitia Bachelot-FontaineVP  Global Communications and European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099investors@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP  Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the development and commercialization plans for VLA2001 and agreements with potential partners and purchasers.

It has its own 10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring throughout the state of Illinois built using the Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system  allowing it to reach any customer by extending its network from the nearest Point-of-Presence (PoP) to the customer facility.Stratus is now also using the Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device (EAD) to provide wholesale  MEF-compliant  EPL (E-Access Ethernet Private Line) services to a third-party wireless network operator for mobile backhaul connectivity. Stratus chose the 1651 EAD primarily because of its support for wire-speed service activation testing (SAT) at 10Gbps (gigabit per second). Using IETF RFC-2544 and ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards  the 1651 acts as both the SAT generator & reflector  saving the cost of a second testing device while also speeding the SAT process.With this capability  Stratus now has the tool it needs to not only validate its service level agreements with real-time data  but also to show by how much it exceeded its contracted performance.""We are extremely pleased by the operational efficiency that the 1651 remote SAT testing has provided. Instead of rolling a truck to each site and using dedicated test equipment  we can use the built-in generator/reflector validate SLA on demand. I anticipate future cost savings as we upgrade cellular backhaul to 10Gbps line-rate without deploying any additional equipment or field techs for manual SAT testing. "" said Ben Russell  Chief Technology Officer  Stratus networks. Another reason for selecting the 1651 was Ekinops' ability to deliver within the required timeframe  the only vendor to make that commitment of those Stratus considered""Story continues""The 1651 is ideal for what Stratus is doing "" says Kevin Antill  Ekinops' group vice president of sales for North America. ""10G is the new currency for these types of backhaul applications  especially with the far greater bandwidth 5G demands. The ability to test quickly and provide SLA reporting ensures Stratus customers that they have chosen the best partner.""Stratus becomes one of the first service providers in North America to operate a combined Ekinops network of Layer 2 Ethernet and Layer 1 WDM platforms.For more information about the Ekinops portfolio  please visit https://www.ekinops.com/products-services/productsPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1907456/Ekinops.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgAll press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74adugast@actus.frEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-delivers-mobile-backhaul-connectivity-with-wire-speed-testing-to-stratus-networks-301633233.htmlSOURCE Ekinops France SA",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.8,0.16,0.04,True,English,"['Mobile Backhaul Connectivity', 'Wire-speed Testing', 'Stratus Networks', 'Ekinops', 'Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device', 'Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system', '10Gb/s Ethernet Access Device', '10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring', 'E-Access Ethernet Private Line', 'greater bandwidth 5G demands', 'ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards', 'private fiber network solutions', 'third-party wireless network operator', ""Ekinops' group vice president"", 'wire-speed service activation testing', 'SOURCE Ekinops France SA', 'optical transport systems', 'access network solutions', 'PRNewsfoto/Ekinops France SA', 'second testing device', 'service level agreements', 'first service providers', 'wireless backhaul connectivity', 'strong business model', 'Chief Technology Officer', 'Didier Brédy', 'Mobile Backhaul Connectivity', 'dedicated test equipment', 'Layer 1 WDM platforms', '1651 remote SAT testing', 'manual SAT testing', 'wholesale, MEF-compliant, EPL', 'future cost savings', 'combined Ekinops network', 'Layer 2 Ethernet', 'Wire-speed Testing', 'cellular backhaul', 'backhaul applications', 'additional equipment', 'SAT generator', 'SAT process', 'network services', 'Ekinops portfolio', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'leading supplier', 'leading provider', 'Peoria Heights', 'other carriers', 'small businesses', 'education customers', 'nearest Point', 'IETF RFC', 'real-time data', 'operational efficiency', 'field techs', 'Ben Russell', 'required timeframe', 'Kevin Antill', 'North America', 'new currency', 'best partner', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'Amaury Dugast', 'original content', 'EURONEXT PARIS', 'press releases', 'Press relation', 'Ekinops Logo', 'customer facility', '10Gbps line-rate', 'SLA reporting', 'products Photo', 'Stratus Networks', 'Stratus customers', 'PRNewswire', 'Illinois', 'USA', 'entities', 'sizes', 'government', 'state', 'Presence', 'PoP', '1651 EAD', 'support', 'gigabit', 'reflector', 'capability', 'tool', 'contracted', 'performance', 'truck', 'site', 'reason', 'vendor', 'commitment', 'Story', 'sales', 'types', 'information', 'Ekinops_Logo', 'close', 'trading', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'momnes', 'actus', 'adugast', 'Cision', 'multimedia', 'news-releases', 'delivers', 'mobile-backhaul-connectivity', 'wire-speed-testing', 'stratus-networks', '33', '1 53']",2022-09-26,2022-09-27,finance.yahoo.com

The Company is in active discussions with a prospective partner for potentially funding the development of a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine. These ongoing discussions may continue for several months and may not lead to an agreement.In parallel  Valneva is continuing discussions with various governments and has initiated regulatory processes with additional regulatory authorities  with the aim to deploy remaining inventory into international markets in the next twelve months. The Company also expects to report additional clinical data in the fourth quarter of 2022  notably heterologous booster data  which may potentially support the positioning of its inventory.Thomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “As we are near the end of the third quarter 2022  we are engaged in active discussions that are likely to continue into the coming months. We therefore plan to continue exploring these potential funding opportunities and will provide future updates if and when we enter into an agreement for further development of our COVID-19 vaccine program.”About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe2 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom3 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates4 and Kingdom of Bahrain5. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain6. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA20017. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine. Valneva is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

As a result  the rate of institutional adoption and investor access to high-quality digital assets has been limited up until now.Ownera brought the industry together to develop the FinP2P open-source routing protocol to solve this problem by orchestrating the instant exchange of digital assets held on any blockchain platform  for digital cash held on any ledger. It supports primary issuance  secondary trading and DeFi-style instant borrowing against assets pledged as collateral. This routing network has the power to open up digital distribution for the private markets and unlock global liquidity in a way that no single institution or exchange can achieve on its own.As the market leader in tokenization solutions  Tokeny’s technology has enabled direct transfers and settlements of tokenized assets in a compliant manner  by default. Its infrastructure uses the market standard ERC-3643 to ensure each transfer can only be triggered between eligible investors through ONCHAINID  a digital identity system  enabling the transferability of tokenized assets. The integration of Ownera FinP2P distribution network enables its clients to further improve the liquidity of their tokenized assets by reaching a broader investor base across the globe.Daniel Coheur  Chief Strategy Officer of Tokeny said  “Tokenization is the first step to unlock the full potential of assets using blockchain technology. When assets are brought onchain  they can be transferred and managed by their owners  at a lower cost  and in real-time. As the compliance is built in at the token level  visibility and interoperability is the key to maximize asset liquidity. By integrating Ownera’s FinP2P  we allow our clients and their investors to connect to additional distribution networks  and use tokenized assets for collateralization.”“Institutions have been faced with the challenge of deploying multiple blockchain technologies if they want to access different isolated pools of assets and investors ” adds Anthony Woolley  the Head of Business Development and Marketing at Ownera. “The adoption of FinP2P will result in higher liquidity and better access to capital and assets by providing regulated firms with one secure point of connection to multiple digital asset networks across the globe. Any institution deploying a Tokeny solution now has the potential to access the added distribution capabilities of the Ownera FinP2P network.”About Tokeny:Tokeny provides an enterprise-grade infrastructure to allow companies and financial actors to compliantly issue  transfer  and manage digital assets on blockchains  enabling them to apply control and compliance on the decentralized infrastructure without technical hurdles. Tokeny is recognized by CB Insights and KPMG as a Top 50 Blockchain and Top 100 Global Fintech company. The company is backed by Euronext Group  Inveniam  Apex Group  and K20 Funds.

The company led the creation of the open-source specifications of the FinP2P protocol and delivers FinP2P based network nodes and digital assets solutions to the financial industry  thus enabling global distribution and liquidity for digital securities.

The early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is a major public health concern. The presentation of the work of Guerbet's Artificial Intelligence (AI) research team  which could potentially offer a promising response to a medical need  convinced the jury to support this project with public fundingPancreatic cancer represents 496 000 cases per year  of which 14 500 are in France and 56 700 in the USAi. The number of patients suffering from this disease has doubled over the last 25 years. The mortality rate of patients is high with survival ranging from one to five years depending on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosisii. By 2040  pancreatic cancer will constitute the third cause of death by cancer in the EUiii and the fourth in the USAiv.“Today  far too many patients are diagnosed at a late stage due to the silent progression of the disease and the huge difficulty in distinguishing the early stages in routine medical imaging. Artificial Intelligence offers a new tool which could support radiologists in their mission”.Professor Vuillerme  Hospital Practitioner  Associate Professor at the Paris-Cité University  RadiologistUnfortunately  few therapeutic options are currently available to treat pancreatic cancer. Surgery is the only treatment which may potentially cure the disease  but it can only be considered during the early stages of the diseasev. Less than 20% of patients are eligible for surgery  as a result of the late detectionsvi.The early stages of pancreatic cancer are often asymptomatic  and the detection is often fortuitous and late. “Earlier detection would enable more patients to be eligible for surgery  which could lead to considerably higher survival rates.6 viiStory continuesCT scans of the pancreas are often difficult to interpret for radiologists who are not specialized in digestive diseasesviii. With effective algorithms and solutions already under development for the detection of liver and prostate cancers  Guerbet continues to innovate and will thus potentially increase chance of surviving from this “silent” cancer. The solution developed by Guerbet will permit the automatic analysis of scanners and will provide radiologists with an alert when pancreatic cancer is suspected from the very first stages of the disease.“Every year the lives of thousands of families are disrupted by the announcement of a pancreatic cancer for which no one is prepared! Since 2016  Espoir Pancréas has been fighting for early detection of pancreatic cancer. We truly hope that in the future Artificial Intelligence solutions will offer improved diagnosis and prognosis for patients suffering from these cancers.”Philippe François-Steininger  Chairman of the association Espoir PancréasConnections with the project’s clinical partners are already in progress and certain French and international partnerships are already under discussion. Furthermore  a large database has already been constituted.This financial support will enable the acceleration of the development of the solution and the recognition provides great incentive for the project team.“BPI’s financial support is a great acknowledgement of the quality of Guerbet’s work in the field of Artificial Intelligence at the service of healthcare. This support will enable the development of the project to be accelerated and give it the dimension necessary to develop a commercial product by 2025. We are convinced that these promising Artificial Intelligence solutions will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of cancers with a high mortality rate. Guerbet is thus demonstrating once again the ability to provide professionals with a major innovation for the benefit of patients.”François Nicolas  Vice-President in charge of R&D at GuerbetAbout France 2030The France 2030 investment plan:Translates a dual ambition : to sustainably transform key sectors of our economy (energy  automobile  aeronautics and space) by technological innovation  and position France not only as an actor but as a leader in tomorrow’s world.

Shah  MD  Neurologist who said: “I am very happy with this first patient inclusion in the United States in ACTISAVE study. Glenzocimab has significant potential for improvement in patients with ischemic stroke  especially those undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. We urgently need new drugs in this indication  and glenzocimab presents an innovative and promising mechanism of action on recanalization and on the downstream microcirculation. Chattanooga CHI Memorial is a state-of-the-art stroke unit that receives 1 400 stroke patients per year in unprecedented medical conditions  with a large part given to research. ""ACTICOR had obtained an IND1 for this study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2021 and had initiated enrollment in Europe in the third quarter of 2021. To date  the study has enrolled 130 patients.The clinical trial is planned for 1 000 patients treated at approximately 80 centers in the USA  Europe (France  Germany  Belgium  Spain  Slovakia  Denmark  Czech Republic)  Great Britain and Israel. A first futility analysis is planned after the inclusion of the first 200 patients to confirm the initial hypotheses.Dr. Yannick PLETAN  Chief Operating Officer  and Chief Medical Officer of Acticor Biotech added: ""The opening of the first U.S. centers  in addition to those already active in Europe  marks another important milestone for our ACTISAVE Phase 2/3 study. The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke in the USA  Europe  Japan  and China will approach 4 million patients by 20262  highlighting the urgent need for an effective treatment to address this major public health problem with a strong societal and economic impact.”In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) status by the European Medicines Agency for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke  recognizing the potential clinical benefit of glenzocimab and its relevance to the unmet medical need in this disease. Because efficacy data were a secondary endpoint of the Phase 1b/2a ACTIMIS study  glenzocimab was not eligible for Breakthrough Therapy status despite significant data on mortality and reduction of cerebral hemorrhage. Nevertheless  these data and the inclusion of patients in the USA will allow Acticor Biotech to apply for Fast Track status with the FDA in the coming weeks.About ACTISAVEACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients. In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

10510,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quadient-sa-solid-q2-growth-154500900.html,Quadient SA: Solid Q2 growth momentum supports an expected strong H2 performance,Solid Q2 growth momentum supports an expected strong H2 performance Solid business trends confirmed Group revenue of €524 million in H1 2022  up 4.0% on a...,QUADIENTSolid Q2 growth momentum supports an expected strong H2 performanceSolid business trends confirmedGroup revenue of € 524 million in H 1 2022  up 4 .0 % on a reported basis and 0. 7 % 1 organically vs. H1 2021. The Group continues to build a stronger and more resilient business model with growing subscription-related revenue now reaching 70% of total revenue in H1 2022 versus 67% in H1 2021.Revenue for Q2 2022 was up 5.4% on a reported basis and up 2.0%1 on an organic basis to €271 million at Group level  confirming the positive trend expected after Q1.At Major Operations level:Intelligent Communication Automation revenue was up 4.7% organically in H1 with growth in subscription-related revenue continues to accelerate with an 18.1% organic increase in Q2 and a strong Annual Recurring Revenue annualized organic growth at 28% (€173 million 2 at end of H1 2022)Mail-Related Solutions delivered organic growth in Q2 with a 1.2% increase bringing the H1 performance to a remarkable -0.3% organic change despite the high comparison basis in H1 2021.Parcel Locker Solutions returned to double digit organic growth in Q2 2022 at +15.8% as contract deployments fueled the growth and with the comparison basis no longer impacted by the large US retail deal as it was the case in Q1.European product launches and inflation weighted on H1 profitabilityCurrent EBIT 1F 3 reached €65 million vs €70 million in H1 2021. The current inflation environment weighted on the Group’s profitability  as the Company increased salaries to attract and retain talents and also adapted its marketing and travel expenses to a normalized post-covid level.Mail-Related Solutions delivered a high level of profitability with a 44.8% Solution Profit Margin as a result of dynamic pricing offsetting both supply chain and salaries increases while Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions profitability were impacted by European products launches and go-to-market acceleration costs.Net attributable income came in at €29 million for the period.Free cash flow2F4 was €13 million in H1 2022  reinforcing a solid liquidity position of €531 million3F5 as of 31 July 2022. The company’s financial position remained healthy with its net debt at €779 million and a leverage of 1.95x (EBITDA excluding leasing6) as of 31 July 2022 after the repayment of the ODIRNANE in June.Story continuesStrong H2 performance expected  FY 2022 guidance confirmedExpected organic growth in revenue is confirmed above 2% 7 compared to FY 2021. After a first quarter impacted by a high comparison basis  the solid business performance achieved in Q2 confirms the improving trend expected to materialize in the second half of the year.Current EBIT3 organic growth confirmed at low to mid-single digit compared to FY 2021. A significant increase in profitability is expected in H2  to be driven by the phasing of price increases through the year  the improvement in profitability from a growing installed base for both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions and the significant contribution of the high profitability of Mail-Related Solutions.Paris  26 September 2022 Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 second-quarter consolidated sales and half-year results (period ended on 31 July 2022).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  stated: “As evidenced by the top line growth achieved in the second quarter  we delivered solid business trends across all our solutions. In Intelligent Communication Automation  the accelerated growth in Annual Recurring Revenue together with the recent signature of our two largest cloud subscription deals further demonstrate the successful transition of our business model from on-premise software licenses to SaaS/Cloud solution  a success which is now also being well recognized by industry analysts. Moreover  revenue from parcel lockers went back to double-digit growth  and the growth achieved in Mail-Related business shows how Quadient is successfully managing its installed base  benefitting from the appeal of recently launched products.In the current inflationary environment  we maintained a stable gross margin as we have been able to offset higher year-over-year impact of increased supply chain costs with positive impact from higher prices. Nevertheless  profitability  as expected  was lower in the first part of the year as we increased our spendings to launch our products into new regions capitalizing on strong cross-selling opportunities and developing new territories.With over 70% of growing recurring revenue and more than 58% of our revenues in North America at the end of H1  Quadient is well equipped to face adverse macro conditions. In addition  taking into account our strong backlog across all three Solutions at the end of the period  we expect the positive business momentum to support higher growth in H2. Combining this growth with the full benefits from price indexation and increase in our already profitable installed bases  we are confident that profitability will significantly increase in the second part of the year. We are therefore confirming our full-year guidance.”POSITIVE UNDERLYING TRENDS SUPPORTIVE OF ORGANIC GROWTH ACCELERATIONGroup sales stood at €524 million in H1 2022  a 0.7% organic growth. On a reported basis  Group sales went up 4.0% compared to H1 2021  including a positive currency impact of +6.1% and a negative scope effect of -2.8%. In details  changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic business in the Nordics and the Shipping activities in France (both in June 2022).Consolidated salesIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% Intelligent Communication Automation 108 97 +11.5% +4.7% Mail-Related Solutions 342 320 +6.9% (0.3)% Parcel Locker Solutions 42 41 +3.2% (2.5)% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7%In € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% North America 287 250 +14.5% +2.5% Main European countries(a) 179 183 (2.2)% (3.0)% International(b) 27 25 +8.7% +7.7% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan and of Intelligent Communication Automation outside of North America and the Main European countries.Major OperationsSales from Major Operations reached €492 million (94% of total sales) in H1 2022  a 0.6% year-over-year organic growth and a 7.5% increase on a reported basis. Transition towards an increasingly subscription-based model continues to materialize with subscription-related revenues up 2.9% on an organic basis versus H1 2021 and now accounting for 71% of the Major Operations sales vs 69% in H1 2021.Sales in North America (58% of Major Operations) were up 2.5% organically to €287 million. This solid performance was driven by organic growth from Mail Related Solutions with strong hardware sales in the period and a double-digit organic increase in revenues from Intelligent Communication Automation cloud-based solutions  supported by strong cross-sell and the deployment of recently acquired SaaS fintech companies (Beanworks and YayPay). The contribution from Parcel Locker Solutions suffered from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (36% of Major Operations) were down 3.0% organically to €179 million  reflecting different trends with  on the one hand  a contained decline from Mail-Related Solutions and a relatively muted performance at Intelligent Communication Automation. And  on the other hand  organic growth from Parcel Locker Solutions was very strong mostly driven by the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts in the region.The International segment (5% of Major Operations) delivered a solid organic sales growth (+7.7% to €27 million)  driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation were up 4.7% organically  with double digit growth on a reported basis  at €108 million. Driven by the growing demand for cloud-based solutions  Quadient signed its two largest subscription deals in North America (>€1 million/year each). Growth in subscription-related revenue continued to accelerate with +18.1% organic growth in Q2 2022 after +15.7% in Q1 2022 and +9.2% in Q4 2021. Overall  subscription-related revenue went up 16.9% organically in H1 2022  now representing 74% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 66% in H1 2021 and 59% in FY 2020. Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 78% at the end of H1 2022 and annual recurring revenue stood at €173 million at the end of H1 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 2021(2). The solid increase in annual recurring revenue (+28% organically on an annualized basis vs the end of last year) should continue to fuel future subscription-related revenue growth.Conversely  license sales went down 45.3% organically  due  on the one hand to a comparison basis effect  with one large deal (c.$4 million) booked in the second quarter of 2021 and  on the other hand  to the progress of the transition to SaaS model. License sales now account for only 7% of the Solution’s total sales. Professional services were slightly down organically (-1.5%) due to the evolution in product mix and demanding comparison basis.The Solution profit margin6F8 for Intelligent Communication Automation was down 8.2 points year-over-year on an organic basis to 7.3%. The profitability of the solution in the first half 2022 was mainly impacted by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to higher marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of YayPay and Beanworks in selected European countries. In addition  the change of business model also weighed on the profitability of the Solution while the large license deal signed in Q2 2021 created a demanding comparison basis.Accelerating revenue growth  rising profitability of the installed base as well as phasing of the prices increases should support a significant improvement in profitability.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €342 million in H1 2022  up 6.9% on a reported basis and virtually flat organically (-0.3%) compared to H1 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+5.1% organic growth in H1 2021 vs H1 2020). This strong performance was driven by the organic growth of North America’s subscription related revenue and high single digit growth in license & hardware sales. Main European countries proved resilient with limited organic declines.In addition  despite the high comparison basis  the positive momentum in hardware sales continued with a 3.8% organic growth in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021. The performance was particularly strong in Q2 2022 with an 8.7% organic growth thanks to double digit organic growth in North America with further penetration of well received new generation of products.Meanwhile  Mail Related Solutions recorded a limited 1.8% organic decrease in subscription-related revenues (71% of Mail-Related Solutions sales). The resilience of both the installed base and subscription-related revenues remains strong  thanks to multi-year largely indexed contracts.The Solution Profit Margin8 for Mail-Related Solutions was remarkably stable on an organic basis to 44.8% despite the challenging conditions. The inflationary context and higher year-on-year freight costs weighted on profitability but proactive and tight cost control  benefits from remanufacturing as well as a largely indexed installed base led to this solid performance.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €42 million in H1 2022  a 2.5% organic decrease compared to H1 2021 and a 3.2% increase on a reported basis.Growth in hardware sales was impacted in Q1 2022 by the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021 while Q2 performance was no longer impacted by this base effect and hardware sales went up 25.1% organically vs Q2 2021. These differentiated performances brought the H1 2022 hardware decline to 19.8% compared to H1 2021.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.2% organically thanks to the continuous on-going roll-out of existing contracts  solid usage rate and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue now accounts for 61% of total revenue.In June 2022  Quadient announced the roll-out of a large open network of parcel lockers in the UK. The aim is to have a network of 5 000 lockers installed in the coming years with a target of 500 installations to be deployed by the end of 2022. Two leading international carriers DPD and DHL have already announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes and a third international carrier has recently joined the network. The Group expects this open network to continue to attract additional carriers and retailers.Quadient closed the semester with over 16 900 lockers installed globally  on track to deliver the Company’s 2023 target to reach 25 000 lockers thanks to a high level of backlog and a solid pipeline of projects which continue to progress despite some projects being delayed into 2023.Solution profit margin8 for Parcel Locker Solutions stood at -10.7% in H1 2022  a 10.5 points year-over-year organic decline. On the one hand  this was due to the significant impact of the completion of the deployment of the large US retail contract in Q1 2021  as well as the costs associated with new product and European network launches. On the other hand  the higher year-on-year supply chain costs were compensated by higher prices and the profitability of the installed base  which continue to improve at 28.4%.Profitability is expected to increase in H2 2022 with no further impact from supply and freight costs  rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €31 million in H1 2022  up 1.7% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 31.7% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packing Systems in 2021 and the partial impact of the divestments from Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and from the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022  marking the completion of the divestment programme as part of the portfolio reshaping initiated early 2019 with the launch of Back to Growth strategic plan. Additional Operations only accounted for 6% of total sales in H1 2022.Since June 2022  Additional Operations are only comprising Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of the Company’s main geographies  which represent revenue of around €50 million on an annual basis (based on FY 2021 figures  i.e. 4.9% of FY 2021 total revenue).Q2 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €271 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 5.4% on a reported basis and 2.0% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.9% organic growth in the quarter  with growth from Parcel Locker Solutions benefiting from a strong rebound after the high comparison basis from the deployment of a large retail contract in the region impacted the growth in Q1 and Mail-Related Solutions posting a positive performance as it grew organically. International grew +5.6% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained 2.6% organic decline mostly due to a lower contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Major Operations sales stood at €256 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 2.0% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Intelligent Communication Automation sales were down 0.5% organically to €55 million even though Subscription-related revenue continue to increase only partially offsetting the decline in license (high comparison basis from the large license deal (c. $4 million) signed in Q2 2021). Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €177 million  up by 1.2% on an organic basis. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €23 million in second quarter of 2022  with a +15.8% organic growth compared to Q2 2021 thanks to the on-going deployment of existing contracts in France and the UK and solid product placements.Additional Operations sales stood at €15 million in the second quarter of 2022  down 41.0% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 1.7% on an organic basis.REVIEW OF 2022 HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Sales 524 504 +4.0% Gross profit 385 366 Gross margin 73.5% 72.7% EBITDA 111 118 (5.8)% EBITDA margin 21.3% 23.5% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 65 70 (7.1)% Current operating income margin (before acquisitionrelated expenses) 12.5% 14.0% Current operating income 61 65 (6.3)% Net attributable income 29 45 (35.6)% Earnings per share 0.75 1.19 Diluted earnings per share 0.75 1.12Current operating income82223H1 2022 H1 2021 In € million MajorOperations Additional Operations Group total Major Operations Additional Operations Group total Revenue 492 31 524 458 46 504 Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 66 (1) 65 71 (1) 70Gross margin stood at 73.5% in H1 2022 compared to 72.7% in H1 2021. A solid performance considering the higher year-over-year freight and supply costs. The gross margin benefited from higher activity  higher prices  and a tight control over costs of sales.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses stood at €65 million in H1 2022 compared to €70 million in H1 2021  down 17.0% on an organic basis. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 12.5% of sales in H1 2022 compared to 14.0% in H1 2021.The lower current profitability reflects the impact from higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings  as well as investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers.However  profitability is expected to step up in H2 2022 supported by the expected strong activity level  the rising profitability of the installed base  the full benefits from recent price increases as well as the continuous focus on costs control.Acquisition-related expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  virtually stable compared to €6 million in H1 2021 as there were no significant fees related to M&A. Consequently  current operating income stood at €61 million in H1 2022  compared to €65 million in H1 2021.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  a much lower amount than in H1 2021  which stood at €12 million. As a reminder  H1 2021 was impacted by the divestment of the Drachten factory in the Netherlands and the Automated Packaging System. As a result  operating income stood at €56 million in H1 2022  a slight improvement on the €53 million recorded in H1 2021.Net attributable incomeH1 2022 net cost of debt was slightly up year-on-year at €12 million with the increase being linked with the refinancing of the ODIRNANE through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021 and the increase in interest rates.The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €2 million in H1 2022. As a reminder  currency gains and other financial items in H1 2021 benefited from the increase in the fair value of the investments made by Quadient in professional private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs.Overall  net financial result was a loss of €14 million in H1 2022 compared to a gain of €3 million in H1 2021.Income tax was €12 million in H1 2022 versus €10 million in H1 2021. This is mainly due to an increase in the tax charge in the United States as a result of the US tax group being subject to the BEAT tax in 2022. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 28.8% in H1 2022 compared to 17.6% in H1 2021.Net attributable income therefore amounted to €29 million in H1 2022 compared to €45 million in H1 2021.Earnings per share9 stood at €0.75 in H1 2022 compared to €1.19 in H1 2021  while fully diluted earnings per share was €0.75 in H1 2022 (€1.12 in H1 2021).Cash flow generationEBITDA9F10 stood at €111 million in H1 2022 compared to €118 million in H1 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.5% in H1 2021 to 21.3% in H1 2022 impacted by the increase in go-to-market for the Group’s growth engines.The change in working capital was negative by €53 million in H1 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €6 million in H1 2021. This is due to a higher level of inventories to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions as well as a slower collection of receivables compared to an exceptional collection rate in H1 2021 (catch-up effect after the 2020 Covid year).Lease receivables decreased by €18 million in H1 2022 compared to a decrease of €32 million in H1 2021  thanks to a better placement of hardware for Mail-Related Solutions lowering the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services increased to €613 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €595 million as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a decrease of 3.0% compared to the end of FY 2021. At the end of H1 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.8% compared to 1.7% at the end of the financial year 2021.Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €15 million in H1 2022 versus €41 million in H1 2021. This variation in H1 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US  an exceptional measure that was implemented during the Covid-19 related crisis.Capital expenditure was slightly up at €44 million in H1 2022 compared to €39 million in H1 2021. Development capex was up to €19 million in H1 2022 (vs €16 million in H1 2021) focusing on R&D investments for software developments. Rented equipment capex was slightly down year-over-year at €13 million in H1 2022  compared to €15 million in H1 2021  due to lower Mail-Related Solutions placement compared to H1 2021  which benefited from a post-Covid rebound  and in spite of on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan. The increase in maintenance capex was mostly linked to one-off projects  especially higher capitalized accounting finance projects as well as IT equipment spendings.Cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €13 million in H1 2022 compared to €54 million in H1 2021.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €779 million as of 31 July 2022 up from €504 million as of 31 January 2022. Whilst the overall financial structure remains stable  this increase in debt level is due to the repayment of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022 for €265 million. As a reminder  according to IFRS  ODIRNANE bonds were booked in equity. This repayment was allowed thanks to the issuance in November 2021 of a €270 Schuldschein. The Group has no other significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained almost stable at 3.3x6 as at 31 July 2022 vs 3.1x10F6 as at 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusting for the ODIRNANE in the calculation at 31 January 2022  the leverage ratio was also stable at 1.95x6 as of 31 July 2022 vs 1.9x6 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022).As of 31 July 2022  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €531 million  split between €131 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024. In order to manage the working capital needs  Quadient issued €46 million NEUCP in July 2022.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 132 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio12F11 went up to 68.4% from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt).OUTLOOKPositive momentum for revenues and expected step up in profitabilityFundamentals for the three solutions remain solid and organic growth in revenue is expected to accelerate in H2 supported by:i) the full impact of the acceleration in ARR bookings in Intelligent Communication Automation recorded at the end of H1 ii) full benefits from recent price increases across all activities iii) strong penetration of newly launched products and high backlog for Mail-Related Solutions as well as solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics at Intelligent Communication Automation andiv) deployment of existing contracts and delivery of the high backlog for Parcel Locker Solutions.2022 Guidance confirmedAt Group level  full-year 2022 organic sales growth is expected over 2%. Organic revenue growth trend seen in Q2 vs Q1 is expected to accelerate thanks to solid business fundamentals for all three solutions and despite the current challenging macro environment.Low to mid-single digit current EBIT3 organic growth112 is also confirmed with H2 expected to mark a significant improvement in profitability vs H1. The profitability of the installed base is expected to continue to increase for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  whilst Mail-Related profit margin should remain high. Acceleration in revenue growth  benefits from increased prices flowing through  focus on continuous costs optimization as well as an easier comparison basis should all contribute to this expected increase in current EBIT and an improved current EBIT margin in H2.2023 guidance unchangedBoth sales and current EBIT3 organic growth CAGR guidance over 2021-2023 are confirmed i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient and Decathlon Reaffirm Partnership on Parcel LockersOn 3 May 2022  Quadient announced that Decathlon  a leading global sporting goods retailer  will equip dozens of additional stores with Quadient’s automated parcel lockers in 2022. Since the adoption of the first Quadient locker solutions in 2015  Decathlon has equipped 62 stores in France with the lockers.

This increase reflects the need to anticipate potential one-off shortages and take recurring logistical challenges into account  in addition to the impact of the substantial and widespread price increases already mentioned (in particular for glass).OutlookAs expected  the trends discussed at the 30 June 2022 General Meeting  namely increases in raw material and energy prices and the variable availability of supplier production  continued over the summer  and appear likely to persist over the coming months.The Group therefore continues to be attentive to the impact of this volatile environment on its ability to supply all its customers worldwide  and to the strength of consumer demand  given the need to adapt its pricing policies. Against this background the Group maintains its cautious stance on business forecasts for 2022 year-end.In this context  even if the efforts deployed within the framework of the strategic plan are generating the expected returns  the Group remains cautious regarding the outlook for the balance of the 2022 year.Shareholder informationIn view of the forthcoming expiry date of the share warrants issued by the Company (the 2022 warrants)  COFEPP  the Company's controlling shareholder with 78.52% of its share capital  has indicated to the Company that it does not currently intend to initiate a public takeover bid for the remainder of the Company's capital.

The first half was a period of transition for the Group between the end of production at Leuna and the construction of the new Pomacle unit. The revenue generated by these activities will be recognised upon delivery of the first batch of Isonaturane® 12 in the first quarter of 2023. Delivery of two further batches is already foreseen for 2023: Global Bioenergies is fully committed to the commercialisation of its process.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: “Every tonne of Isonaturane® 12 produced and sold will bring naturalness to nearly 500 000 make-up products. This market offers ideal conditions for the roll-out of our technology: prices are high and there is a strong appetite for natural ingredients. We are already working towards the next horizon of building a plant capable of producing 2 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year by 2025  which will enable us to reach all cosmetics markets  and also to explore opportunities in the road and aviation fuel markets  among others.”Group Profit & Loss Account€ thousands from 01/01/22 from 01/01/21 from 01/01/20 Consolidated financial statements to 30/06/22 to 30/06/21 to 30/06/20 Operating income 1 059 1 903 1 728 Operating expenses 6 632 9 455 8 603 Operating profit (loss) -5 573 -7 552 -6 875 EBITDA -5 014 -6 515 -5 300 Financial profit (loss) -61 -79 -128 Exceptional profit (loss) -124 10 67 Income tax (research tax credit) NA* NA* NA* Net profit (loss) -5 759 -7 621 -6 936* By convention  the Group does not record a research tax credit in its half-year financial statements at the end of June.Story continuesOperating income mainly consists of:€144 000 of revenue  including €50 000 relating to the LAST ® brand  with the remainder primarily corresponding to the invoicing of samples sent to manufacturers  particularly in the make-up market;€894 000 in subsidies under various European programmes aimed at broadening the range of feedstocks that can be used in the process.The greatest changes in operating expenses can be found in the “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” line  details of which are provided below:€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of operating expenses Personnel costs 2 309 2 079 2 223 Industrialisation/Commercialisation 2 597 4 886 2 418 Change in inventory* -584 -520 - Laboratory 185 322 587 Rent and maintenance 423 413 511 Intellectual Property 137 326 270 Depreciation/Amortisation 559 1 038 1 576 Other 1 006 911 1 018 Total 6 632 9 455 8 603* a negative sign “–” here indicates a rise in inventory value€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” item INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION Industrial scaling up 1 301 332 695 Fermentation runs 753 3 203 3 258 Historical 1-step process - 2 062 1 607 New 2-step process 753 410 - Conversion of isobutene into Isonaturane® 12 64 747 - Product Development 243 - - LAST ® BRAND ACTIVITY Testing and production - 345 116 Brand development 235 990 - Total 2 597 4 886 2 418The Leuna demo plant was dismantled when the operating agreement ended in July 2021 after4 years in service. The main units were relocated to the Pomacle site in France for the second step of the new production process  while the first step  which consists of producing DMA - the precursor of isobutene - was carried out by tollers  leading to an increase in inventories of more than half a million euros.A smaller quantity of isobutene was converted into Isonaturane® 12 compared to the first half of 2021  the period during which the conversion process was developed.Work also focused on the development of products for marketing  including regulatory aspects. LAST® brand expenses relate to sales and marketing activities only.Group Balance SheetAssets (€ thousands) 30/06/22 31/12/21 Liabilities (€ thousands) 30/06/22 31/12/21 Intangible assets 658 800 Capital 743 743 Tangible assets 819 637 Share premium 29 289 29 289 Assets under construction 2 641 1 897 Balance carried forward -16 321 -4 697 Financial assets 1 547 1 544 Profit (loss) -5 759 -11 773 NON-CURRENT ASSETS 5 665 4 879 EQUITY 7 952 13 562 Industrialisation inventories 2 122 1 793 PROVISIONS 71 61 R&D consumables inventories 381 250 Receivables 3 502 3 524 Conditional advances and loans 11 678 12 454 Cash 11 706 20 931 Trade payables 2 962 3 520 Marketable securities 156 147 Tax and social security liabilities 561 1 185 Prepaid expenses 376 261 Other debts and deferred income 683 1 003 CURRENT ASSETS 18 242 26 907 PAYABLES and DEFERRED INCOME 15 884 18 163 TOTAL ASSETS 23 907 31 785 TOTAL LIABILITIES 23 907 31 785Assets: fixed assets increased due to the work carried out at the Pomacle site. Inventories increased mainly as a result of DMA production operations.Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €9.3 million during the period. Cash flow from operations changed by €7.3 million  including an increase of just under €2 million in working capital (increase in inventories  flat receivables  reduction in payables). The additional outflows of€2 million correspond to works at the Pomacle site and debt repayment.Liabilities: all liability items decreased. The Group no longer has any deferred income from publicly funded projects.Highlights of the first half of 2022  recent events and outlookThe very first orders for Isonaturane® 12 placed in June by several major cosmetics companies  including L’Oréal  were undoubtedly the most significant development of the first half of the year.A commercially focused process was implemented for the first time since the creation of the Company: this is a major step forward for Global Bioenergies  reflecting the desire of industry players to find ever more environmentally friendly solutions. These orders follow a customer referencing process carried out over several months  which included sending out samples for testing. Delivery of these initial orders is scheduled for early next year.Global Bioenergies’ Isonaturane® 12 stands out in the world of cosmetic ingredients for its particularly high selling price. The fact that it is the first cosmetic grade isododecane of natural origin gives it a very high added value. This molecule  traditionally derived from oil  is essential for longwear  water-resistant and low transfer make-up. When incorporated to achieve these characteristics  it is the main ingredient  representing between 25% and 50% of the formulation.Isonaturane® 12 thus opens the way to naturalness in the so-called “longwear” make-up segment  which represents a quarter of the global make-up market. The selling price of Isonaturane® 12 benefits from the specific characteristics of the make-up sector:Limited volumes compared to other cosmetic applications - a make-up product represents only a few grams of formulated ingredients. A single tonne of Isonaturane ® 12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to naturalness. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations.Very small proportion (less than 1%) of the cost of ingredients in the selling price of a finished make-up product.The business model for the upcoming periods will therefore be based on an operating chain capable of producing several dozen tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 per year from plant-derived and renewable resources  corresponding to annual revenue of several million euros.Horizon 1: Organisation of the LAST ® businessThe development and launch in June 2021 of the LAST® brand - the first make-up brand in the world to incorporate Isonaturane® 12 and thereby enable the combination of naturalness and longwear performance - required the enlisting of external expertise.After witnessing a successful launch  the choice was made to bring the functions required for the deployment of the brand in-house: sales  communication  digital marketing  and so on. A director was hired to lead this team of five people  increase awareness of the LAST® brand  boost sales and balance the ratio of expenses to revenue. This organisation resulted in a significant reduction in costs compared to 2021.In February  the team was awarded the prestigious Prix d’Excellence France award in the “Research and Innovation” category by Marie-Claire magazine  whose jury chose to recognise LAST® for its make-up combining performance and naturalness.Horizon 2: Construction of the new isobutene production unit in PomacleIn 2021  Global Bioenergies switched to using generic fermenters for the majority of its process that were much larger than the two fermenters it had previously used. Only the final step  the conversion of the isobutene precursor - DMA - into isobutene  still requires a specific fermenter.The decision was therefore taken to develop a commercial production chain at the Pomacle site using this so-called “two-step” process. The engineering studies and preparatory work carried out at the end of 2021 gave way to the actual construction and integration work  which took place in the first half of 2022. The very first batches of “two-step” isobutene were produced in March using the 0.5 m3 fermenter installed on site since 2015  prior to the connection of the 5 m3 fermenter from Leuna  which will soon increase the unit’s production capacity tenfold.A portion of the isobutene derived from this new process will then be converted into Isonaturane® 12 by a chain of tollers  with the remainder being used to explore other applications  including road and aviation fuels.Horizon 3 : Engineering work for the 2 000-tonne plant projectEngineering studies were carried out simultaneously during the first half of 2022 in order to define the industrial process for the 2 000-tonne plant and ensure its robustness. Experimental validation work was carried out for the key steps. A model was developed to ensure that they could be extrapolated to a larger scale.The mass and energy balances of the process were developed  challenged and optimised. This entailed a sequence of unit operations  selected on the basis of technical and environmental performance criteria. The Company has hired an engineering firm to carry out the preliminary design of the plant.Horizon 4: Breaking into the fuel marketsThe commercial opportunities for isobutene and its derivatives are not limited to Isonaturane® 12. Of course  this route offers the greatest potential in terms of pricing. However  isobutene was identified at the time of the Company’s creation because of the many markets in which it could be used: cosmetics  fuels  plastics  rubbers  fine chemicals  etc. The economic equation only functions today in the cosmetics market  we can nonetheless see a growing interest among all industry sectors in accessing raw materials with a better environmental profile.The huge fuel market - characterised by both high volumes and low prices - also has a need to limit its carbon footprint  particularly in the aviation sector. The Company expects to have its aviation process certified within the next six months. There are very few solutions in this field: only seven technologies worldwide have been certified to date. Several oil companies have approached Global Bioenergies in recent months  including giants Shell and Repsol  reflecting a growing interest in the Company’s solutions and potential. Efforts to improve the process will still be necessary in order to bring it to the level of cost required in the fuels sector.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

It has its own 10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring throughout the state of Illinois built using the Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system  allowing it to reach any customer by extending its network from the nearest Point-of-Presence (PoP) to the customer facility.Stratus is now also using the Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device (EAD) to provide wholesale  MEF-compliant  EPL (E-Access Ethernet Private Line) services to a third-party wireless network operator for mobile backhaul connectivity. Stratus chose the 1651 EAD primarily because of its support for wire-speed service activation testing (SAT) at 10Gbps (gigabit per second). Using IETF RFC-2544 and ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards  the 1651 acts as both the SAT generator & reflector  saving the cost of a second testing device while also speeding the SAT process.With this capability  Stratus now has the tool it needs to not only validate its service level agreements with real-time data  but also to show by how much it exceeded its contracted performance.""We are extremely pleased by the operational efficiency that the 1651 remote SAT testing has provided. Instead of rolling a truck to each site and using dedicated test equipment  we can use the built-in generator/reflector validate SLA on demand. I anticipate future cost savings as we upgrade cellular backhaul to 10Gbps line-rate without deploying any additional equipment or field techs for manual SAT testing. "" said Ben Russell  Chief Technology Officer  Stratus networks. Another reason for selecting the 1651 was Ekinops' ability to deliver within the required timeframe  the only vendor to make that commitment of those Stratus considered""""The 1651 is ideal for what Stratus is doing "" says Kevin Antill  Ekinops' group vice president of sales for North America.

The early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is a major public health concern. The presentation of the work of Guerbet's Artificial Intelligence (AI) research team  which could potentially offer a promising response to a medical need  convinced the jury to support this project with public fundingPancreatic cancer represents 496 000 cases per year  of which 14 500 are in France and 56 700 in the USAi. The number of patients suffering from this disease has doubled over the last 25 years. The mortality rate of patients is high with survival ranging from one to five years depending on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosisii. By 2040  pancreatic cancer will constitute the third cause of death by cancer in the EUiii and the fourth in the USAiv.“Today  far too many patients are diagnosed at a late stage due to the silent progression of the disease and the huge difficulty in distinguishing the early stages in routine medical imaging. Artificial Intelligence offers a new tool which could support radiologists in their mission”.Professor Vuillerme  Hospital Practitioner  Associate Professor at the Paris-Cité University  RadiologistUnfortunately  few therapeutic options are currently available to treat pancreatic cancer. Surgery is the only treatment which may potentially cure the disease  but it can only be considered during the early stages of the diseasev. Less than 20% of patients are eligible for surgery  as a result of the late detectionsvi.The early stages of pancreatic cancer are often asymptomatic  and the detection is often fortuitous and late. “Earlier detection would enable more patients to be eligible for surgery  which could lead to considerably higher survival rates.6 viiCT scans of the pancreas are often difficult to interpret for radiologists who are not specialized in digestive diseasesviii. With effective algorithms and solutions already under development for the detection of liver and prostate cancers  Guerbet continues to innovate and will thus potentially increase chance of surviving from this “silent” cancer. The solution developed by Guerbet will permit the automatic analysis of scanners and will provide radiologists with an alert when pancreatic cancer is suspected from the very first stages of the disease.“Every year the lives of thousands of families are disrupted by the announcement of a pancreatic cancer for which no one is prepared! Since 2016  Espoir Pancréas has been fighting for early detection of pancreatic cancer. We truly hope that in the future Artificial Intelligence solutions will offer improved diagnosis and prognosis for patients suffering from these cancers.”Philippe François-Steininger  Chairman of the association Espoir PancréasConnections with the project’s clinical partners are already in progress and certain French and international partnerships are already under discussion. Furthermore  a large database has already been constituted.This financial support will enable the acceleration of the development of the solution and the recognition provides great incentive for the project team.“BPI’s financial support is a great acknowledgement of the quality of Guerbet’s work in the field of Artificial Intelligence at the service of healthcare. This support will enable the development of the project to be accelerated and give it the dimension necessary to develop a commercial product by 2025. We are convinced that these promising Artificial Intelligence solutions will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of cancers with a high mortality rate. Guerbet is thus demonstrating once again the ability to provide professionals with a major innovation for the benefit of patients.”François Nicolas  Vice-President in charge of R&D at GuerbetAbout France 2030The France 2030 investment plan:Translates a dual ambition : to sustainably transform key sectors of our economy (energy  automobile  aeronautics and space) by technological innovation  and position France not only as an actor but as a leader in tomorrow’s world.

Current EBIT3 organic growth confirmed at low to mid-single digit compared to FY 2021. A significant increase in profitability is expected in H2  to be driven by the phasing of price increases through the year  the improvement in profitability from a growing installed base for both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions and the significant contribution of the high profitability of Mail-Related Solutions.Paris  26 September 2022 Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 second-quarter consolidated sales and half-year results (period ended on 31 July 2022).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  stated: “As evidenced by the top line growth achieved in the second quarter  we delivered solid business trends across all our solutions. In Intelligent Communication Automation  the accelerated growth in Annual Recurring Revenue together with the recent signature of our two largest cloud subscription deals further demonstrate the successful transition of our business model from on-premise software licenses to SaaS/Cloud solution  a success which is now also being well recognized by industry analysts. Moreover  revenue from parcel lockers went back to double-digit growth  and the growth achieved in Mail-Related business shows how Quadient is successfully managing its installed base  benefitting from the appeal of recently launched products.In the current inflationary environment  we maintained a stable gross margin as we have been able to offset higher year-over-year impact of increased supply chain costs with positive impact from higher prices. Nevertheless  profitability  as expected  was lower in the first part of the year as we increased our spendings to launch our products into new regions capitalizing on strong cross-selling opportunities and developing new territories.With over 70% of growing recurring revenue and more than 58% of our revenues in North America at the end of H1  Quadient is well equipped to face adverse macro conditions. In addition  taking into account our strong backlog across all three Solutions at the end of the period  we expect the positive business momentum to support higher growth in H2. Combining this growth with the full benefits from price indexation and increase in our already profitable installed bases  we are confident that profitability will significantly increase in the second part of the year. We are therefore confirming our full-year guidance.”POSITIVE UNDERLYING TRENDS SUPPORTIVE OF ORGANIC GROWTH ACCELERATIONGroup sales stood at €524 million in H1 2022  a 0.7% organic growth. On a reported basis  Group sales went up 4.0% compared to H1 2021  including a positive currency impact of +6.1% and a negative scope effect of -2.8%. In details  changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic business in the Nordics and the Shipping activities in France (both in June 2022).Consolidated salesIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% Intelligent Communication Automation 108 97 +11.5% +4.7% Mail-Related Solutions 342 320 +6.9% (0.3)% Parcel Locker Solutions 42 41 +3.2% (2.5)% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7%In € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 492 458 +7.5% +0.6% North America 287 250 +14.5% +2.5% Main European countries(a) 179 183 (2.2)% (3.0)% International(b) 27 25 +8.7% +7.7% Additional Operations 31 46 (31.7)% +1.7% Group total 524 504 +4.0% +0.7% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan and of Intelligent Communication Automation outside of North America and the Main European countries.Major OperationsSales from Major Operations reached €492 million (94% of total sales) in H1 2022  a 0.6% year-over-year organic growth and a 7.5% increase on a reported basis. Transition towards an increasingly subscription-based model continues to materialize with subscription-related revenues up 2.9% on an organic basis versus H1 2021 and now accounting for 71% of the Major Operations sales vs 69% in H1 2021.Sales in North America (58% of Major Operations) were up 2.5% organically to €287 million. This solid performance was driven by organic growth from Mail Related Solutions with strong hardware sales in the period and a double-digit organic increase in revenues from Intelligent Communication Automation cloud-based solutions  supported by strong cross-sell and the deployment of recently acquired SaaS fintech companies (Beanworks and YayPay). The contribution from Parcel Locker Solutions suffered from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (36% of Major Operations) were down 3.0% organically to €179 million  reflecting different trends with  on the one hand  a contained decline from Mail-Related Solutions and a relatively muted performance at Intelligent Communication Automation. And  on the other hand  organic growth from Parcel Locker Solutions was very strong mostly driven by the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts in the region.The International segment (5% of Major Operations) delivered a solid organic sales growth (+7.7% to €27 million)  driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation were up 4.7% organically  with double digit growth on a reported basis  at €108 million. Driven by the growing demand for cloud-based solutions  Quadient signed its two largest subscription deals in North America (>€1 million/year each). Growth in subscription-related revenue continued to accelerate with +18.1% organic growth in Q2 2022 after +15.7% in Q1 2022 and +9.2% in Q4 2021. Overall  subscription-related revenue went up 16.9% organically in H1 2022  now representing 74% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 66% in H1 2021 and 59% in FY 2020. Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 78% at the end of H1 2022 and annual recurring revenue stood at €173 million at the end of H1 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 2021(2). The solid increase in annual recurring revenue (+28% organically on an annualized basis vs the end of last year) should continue to fuel future subscription-related revenue growth.Conversely  license sales went down 45.3% organically  due  on the one hand to a comparison basis effect  with one large deal (c.$4 million) booked in the second quarter of 2021 and  on the other hand  to the progress of the transition to SaaS model. License sales now account for only 7% of the Solution’s total sales. Professional services were slightly down organically (-1.5%) due to the evolution in product mix and demanding comparison basis.The Solution profit margin6F8 for Intelligent Communication Automation was down 8.2 points year-over-year on an organic basis to 7.3%. The profitability of the solution in the first half 2022 was mainly impacted by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to higher marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of YayPay and Beanworks in selected European countries. In addition  the change of business model also weighed on the profitability of the Solution while the large license deal signed in Q2 2021 created a demanding comparison basis.Accelerating revenue growth  rising profitability of the installed base as well as phasing of the prices increases should support a significant improvement in profitability.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €342 million in H1 2022  up 6.9% on a reported basis and virtually flat organically (-0.3%) compared to H1 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+5.1% organic growth in H1 2021 vs H1 2020). This strong performance was driven by the organic growth of North America’s subscription related revenue and high single digit growth in license & hardware sales. Main European countries proved resilient with limited organic declines.In addition  despite the high comparison basis  the positive momentum in hardware sales continued with a 3.8% organic growth in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021. The performance was particularly strong in Q2 2022 with an 8.7% organic growth thanks to double digit organic growth in North America with further penetration of well received new generation of products.Meanwhile  Mail Related Solutions recorded a limited 1.8% organic decrease in subscription-related revenues (71% of Mail-Related Solutions sales). The resilience of both the installed base and subscription-related revenues remains strong  thanks to multi-year largely indexed contracts.The Solution Profit Margin8 for Mail-Related Solutions was remarkably stable on an organic basis to 44.8% despite the challenging conditions. The inflationary context and higher year-on-year freight costs weighted on profitability but proactive and tight cost control  benefits from remanufacturing as well as a largely indexed installed base led to this solid performance.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €42 million in H1 2022  a 2.5% organic decrease compared to H1 2021 and a 3.2% increase on a reported basis.Growth in hardware sales was impacted in Q1 2022 by the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021 while Q2 performance was no longer impacted by this base effect and hardware sales went up 25.1% organically vs Q2 2021. These differentiated performances brought the H1 2022 hardware decline to 19.8% compared to H1 2021.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.2% organically thanks to the continuous on-going roll-out of existing contracts  solid usage rate and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue now accounts for 61% of total revenue.In June 2022  Quadient announced the roll-out of a large open network of parcel lockers in the UK. The aim is to have a network of 5 000 lockers installed in the coming years with a target of 500 installations to be deployed by the end of 2022. Two leading international carriers DPD and DHL have already announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes and a third international carrier has recently joined the network. The Group expects this open network to continue to attract additional carriers and retailers.Quadient closed the semester with over 16 900 lockers installed globally  on track to deliver the Company’s 2023 target to reach 25 000 lockers thanks to a high level of backlog and a solid pipeline of projects which continue to progress despite some projects being delayed into 2023.Solution profit margin8 for Parcel Locker Solutions stood at -10.7% in H1 2022  a 10.5 points year-over-year organic decline. On the one hand  this was due to the significant impact of the completion of the deployment of the large US retail contract in Q1 2021  as well as the costs associated with new product and European network launches. On the other hand  the higher year-on-year supply chain costs were compensated by higher prices and the profitability of the installed base  which continue to improve at 28.4%.Profitability is expected to increase in H2 2022 with no further impact from supply and freight costs  rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €31 million in H1 2022  up 1.7% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 31.7% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packing Systems in 2021 and the partial impact of the divestments from Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and from the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022  marking the completion of the divestment programme as part of the portfolio reshaping initiated early 2019 with the launch of Back to Growth strategic plan. Additional Operations only accounted for 6% of total sales in H1 2022.Since June 2022  Additional Operations are only comprising Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of the Company’s main geographies  which represent revenue of around €50 million on an annual basis (based on FY 2021 figures  i.e. 4.9% of FY 2021 total revenue).Q2 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €271 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 5.4% on a reported basis and 2.0% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.9% organic growth in the quarter  with growth from Parcel Locker Solutions benefiting from a strong rebound after the high comparison basis from the deployment of a large retail contract in the region impacted the growth in Q1 and Mail-Related Solutions posting a positive performance as it grew organically. International grew +5.6% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained 2.6% organic decline mostly due to a lower contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Major Operations sales stood at €256 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 2.0% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Intelligent Communication Automation sales were down 0.5% organically to €55 million even though Subscription-related revenue continue to increase only partially offsetting the decline in license (high comparison basis from the large license deal (c. $4 million) signed in Q2 2021). Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €177 million  up by 1.2% on an organic basis. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €23 million in second quarter of 2022  with a +15.8% organic growth compared to Q2 2021 thanks to the on-going deployment of existing contracts in France and the UK and solid product placements.Additional Operations sales stood at €15 million in the second quarter of 2022  down 41.0% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 1.7% on an organic basis.REVIEW OF 2022 HALF-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Sales 524 504 +4.0% Gross profit 385 366 Gross margin 73.5% 72.7% EBITDA 111 118 (5.8)% EBITDA margin 21.3% 23.5% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 65 70 (7.1)% Current operating income margin (before acquisitionrelated expenses) 12.5% 14.0% Current operating income 61 65 (6.3)% Net attributable income 29 45 (35.6)% Earnings per share 0.75 1.19 Diluted earnings per share 0.75 1.12Current operating income82223H1 2022 H1 2021 In € million MajorOperations Additional Operations Group total Major Operations Additional Operations Group total Revenue 492 31 524 458 46 504 Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 66 (1) 65 71 (1) 70Gross margin stood at 73.5% in H1 2022 compared to 72.7% in H1 2021. A solid performance considering the higher year-over-year freight and supply costs. The gross margin benefited from higher activity  higher prices  and a tight control over costs of sales.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses stood at €65 million in H1 2022 compared to €70 million in H1 2021  down 17.0% on an organic basis. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 12.5% of sales in H1 2022 compared to 14.0% in H1 2021.The lower current profitability reflects the impact from higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings  as well as investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers.However  profitability is expected to step up in H2 2022 supported by the expected strong activity level  the rising profitability of the installed base  the full benefits from recent price increases as well as the continuous focus on costs control.Acquisition-related expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  virtually stable compared to €6 million in H1 2021 as there were no significant fees related to M&A. Consequently  current operating income stood at €61 million in H1 2022  compared to €65 million in H1 2021.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €5 million in H1 2022  a much lower amount than in H1 2021  which stood at €12 million. As a reminder  H1 2021 was impacted by the divestment of the Drachten factory in the Netherlands and the Automated Packaging System. As a result  operating income stood at €56 million in H1 2022  a slight improvement on the €53 million recorded in H1 2021.Net attributable incomeH1 2022 net cost of debt was slightly up year-on-year at €12 million with the increase being linked with the refinancing of the ODIRNANE through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021 and the increase in interest rates.The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €2 million in H1 2022. As a reminder  currency gains and other financial items in H1 2021 benefited from the increase in the fair value of the investments made by Quadient in professional private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs.Overall  net financial result was a loss of €14 million in H1 2022 compared to a gain of €3 million in H1 2021.Income tax was €12 million in H1 2022 versus €10 million in H1 2021. This is mainly due to an increase in the tax charge in the United States as a result of the US tax group being subject to the BEAT tax in 2022. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 28.8% in H1 2022 compared to 17.6% in H1 2021.Net attributable income therefore amounted to €29 million in H1 2022 compared to €45 million in H1 2021.Earnings per share9 stood at €0.75 in H1 2022 compared to €1.19 in H1 2021  while fully diluted earnings per share was €0.75 in H1 2022 (€1.12 in H1 2021).Cash flow generationEBITDA9F10 stood at €111 million in H1 2022 compared to €118 million in H1 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.5% in H1 2021 to 21.3% in H1 2022 impacted by the increase in go-to-market for the Group’s growth engines.The change in working capital was negative by €53 million in H1 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €6 million in H1 2021. This is due to a higher level of inventories to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions as well as a slower collection of receivables compared to an exceptional collection rate in H1 2021 (catch-up effect after the 2020 Covid year).Lease receivables decreased by €18 million in H1 2022 compared to a decrease of €32 million in H1 2021  thanks to a better placement of hardware for Mail-Related Solutions lowering the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services increased to €613 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €595 million as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a decrease of 3.0% compared to the end of FY 2021. At the end of H1 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.8% compared to 1.7% at the end of the financial year 2021.Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €15 million in H1 2022 versus €41 million in H1 2021. This variation in H1 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US  an exceptional measure that was implemented during the Covid-19 related crisis.Capital expenditure was slightly up at €44 million in H1 2022 compared to €39 million in H1 2021. Development capex was up to €19 million in H1 2022 (vs €16 million in H1 2021) focusing on R&D investments for software developments. Rented equipment capex was slightly down year-over-year at €13 million in H1 2022  compared to €15 million in H1 2021  due to lower Mail-Related Solutions placement compared to H1 2021  which benefited from a post-Covid rebound  and in spite of on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan. The increase in maintenance capex was mostly linked to one-off projects  especially higher capitalized accounting finance projects as well as IT equipment spendings.Cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €13 million in H1 2022 compared to €54 million in H1 2021.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €779 million as of 31 July 2022 up from €504 million as of 31 January 2022. Whilst the overall financial structure remains stable  this increase in debt level is due to the repayment of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022 for €265 million. As a reminder  according to IFRS  ODIRNANE bonds were booked in equity. This repayment was allowed thanks to the issuance in November 2021 of a €270 Schuldschein. The Group has no other significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained almost stable at 3.3x6 as at 31 July 2022 vs 3.1x10F6 as at 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusting for the ODIRNANE in the calculation at 31 January 2022  the leverage ratio was also stable at 1.95x6 as of 31 July 2022 vs 1.9x6 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022).As of 31 July 2022  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €531 million  split between €131 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024. In order to manage the working capital needs  Quadient issued €46 million NEUCP in July 2022.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 132 million as of 31 July 2022 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio12F11 went up to 68.4% from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt).OUTLOOKPositive momentum for revenues and expected step up in profitabilityFundamentals for the three solutions remain solid and organic growth in revenue is expected to accelerate in H2 supported by:i) the full impact of the acceleration in ARR bookings in Intelligent Communication Automation recorded at the end of H1 ii) full benefits from recent price increases across all activities iii) strong penetration of newly launched products and high backlog for Mail-Related Solutions as well as solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics at Intelligent Communication Automation andiv) deployment of existing contracts and delivery of the high backlog for Parcel Locker Solutions.2022 Guidance confirmedAt Group level  full-year 2022 organic sales growth is expected over 2%.

The profitability of the installed base is expected to continue to increase for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  whilst Mail-Related profit margin should remain high. Acceleration in revenue growth  benefits from increased prices flowing through  focus on continuous costs optimization as well as an easier comparison basis should all contribute to this expected increase in current EBIT and an improved current EBIT margin in H2.2023 guidance unchangedBoth sales and current EBIT3 organic growth CAGR guidance over 2021-2023 are confirmed i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient and Decathlon Reaffirm Partnership on Parcel LockersOn 3 May 2022  Quadient announced that Decathlon  a leading global sporting goods retailer  will equip dozens of additional stores with Quadient’s automated parcel lockers in 2022.

The audit procedures have been carried out.Simplified income statement - H1 2022€m except EPS H1 2021 H1 2022 Change2022 vs 2021 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 81.0 86.4 +5.9% Gross margin 32.2 34.4 +€2.2m Gross margin ratio 39.7% 39.9% +0.2 pts EBITDA 6.0 7.6 +€1.6m Underlying operating profit 2.5 5.5 +€3.0m Net profit (Group share) 1.5 2.5 +€1.0m Net earnings per share 0.02 0.02 -First half 2022 revenuesFirst half 2022 revenues excluding excise duties came to €86.4 million in the first half of 2022  up 5.9% versus H1 2021 (excl. currency impact). This improvement  largely driven by on-trade business  is due in particular to the recovery of a number of markets following the reopening of bars and restaurants.The France cluster posted first half 2022 revenues of €40.1m  up 2.5% versus H1 2021  mainly due to a significant recovery in the on-trade business  albeit less pronounced in the second quarter  and flat sales in the off-trade market. The Group’s main brands posted a resilient performance in the first half of 2022.Commercial policy adjustments across all distribution channels have been and may continue to be necessary in order to adapt to the current volatile context.The International cluster posted H1 2022 revenues of €46.3m  up 9.2% from the first half of 2021 at constant exchange rates  reflecting contrasting trends across regions:confirmed recovery in Europe  particularly in the UK following health restrictions in 2021  despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict  which led to a limited decline in certain export regions;strong performances across all of the Group’s strategic brands  particularly Marie Brizard and Gautier  in Canada  South Korea  Australia and Poland;decline in US sales of Sobieski vodka in a highly competitive market segment.EarningsAmid significant volatility and increasing prices  the H1 2022 gross margin of 39.9% was stable compared to last year at €34.4 million.EBITDA rose to €7.6 million in H1 2022  up from €6.0 million last year.A €1.5 million decline in EBITDA in France  related to the recognition in the first half of 2021 of part of a one-off €1.7 million discount granted by a supplier at the end of the year  was offset by a solid performance in the International cluster (up €2.3m). H1 2022 saw the recovery of several direct export markets (UK  Canada  South Korea and Australia) and subsidiaries (MBWS Baltics).Group EBITDA was also boosted by a decrease in the holding company’s structural costs  following the reorganisation initiated in 2021.H1 2022 EBITDA by cluster€m H1 2021 LFLchange Currency impact H1 2022 LFL change(excl. currency impact) Reported growth (incl. currency impact) France 6.5 (1.5) - 5.0 -22.9% -22.9% International 3.3 2.2 0.1 5.6 +67.8% +70.1% Holding company (3.8) 0.8 - (3.0) +21.3% +21.3% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 6.0 1.5 0.1 7.6 +25.9% +27.2%Net profit (Group share) amounted to €2.5 million in the first half of 2022  up €1.0 million compared to H1 2021  which included a net loss from discontinued operations of €0.9 million.Balance sheet at 30 June 2022Shareholders’ equity (Group share) amounted to €178.3 million at 30 June 2022  up from €173.6 million at 31 December 2021  while gross debt remained stable at €6.0 million in the first half of 2022  as did positive Group cash balances of €53.4 million at 30 June 2022.There was a substantial temporary increase in inventories and work-in-progress to €46.1 million at 30 June 2022  up €11 million from 30 June 2021  including +€7.3 million for raw materials. This increase reflects the need to anticipate potential one-off shortages and take recurring logistical challenges into account  in addition to the impact of the substantial and widespread price increases already mentioned (in particular for glass).OutlookAs expected  the trends discussed at the 30 June 2022 General Meeting  namely increases in raw material and energy prices and the variable availability of supplier production  continued over the summer  and appear likely to persist over the coming months.The Group therefore continues to be attentive to the impact of this volatile environment on its ability to supply all its customers worldwide  and to the strength of consumer demand  given the need to adapt its pricing policies. Against this background the Group maintains its cautious stance on business forecasts for 2022 year-end.In this context  even if the efforts deployed within the framework of the strategic plan are generating the expected returns  the Group remains cautious regarding the outlook for the balance of the 2022 year.Shareholder informationIn view of the forthcoming expiry date of the share warrants issued by the Company (the 2022 warrants)  COFEPP  the Company's controlling shareholder with 78.52% of its share capital  has indicated to the Company that it does not currently intend to initiate a public takeover bid for the remainder of the Company's capital.

The first half was a period of transition for the Group between the end of production at Leuna and the construction of the new Pomacle unit. The revenue generated by these activities will be recognised upon delivery of the first batch of Isonaturane® 12 in the first quarter of 2023. Delivery of two further batches is already foreseen for 2023: Global Bioenergies is fully committed to the commercialisation of its process.”Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: “Every tonne of Isonaturane® 12 produced and sold will bring naturalness to nearly 500 000 make-up products. This market offers ideal conditions for the roll-out of our technology: prices are high and there is a strong appetite for natural ingredients. We are already working towards the next horizon of building a plant capable of producing 2 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year by 2025  which will enable us to reach all cosmetics markets  and also to explore opportunities in the road and aviation fuel markets  among others.”Group Profit & Loss Account€ thousands from 01/01/22 from 01/01/21 from 01/01/20 Consolidated financial statements to 30/06/22 to 30/06/21 to 30/06/20 Operating income 1 059 1 903 1 728 Operating expenses 6 632 9 455 8 603 Operating profit (loss) -5 573 -7 552 -6 875 EBITDA -5 014 -6 515 -5 300 Financial profit (loss) -61 -79 -128 Exceptional profit (loss) -124 10 67 Income tax (research tax credit) NA* NA* NA* Net profit (loss) -5 759 -7 621 -6 936* By convention  the Group does not record a research tax credit in its half-year financial statements at the end of June.Operating income mainly consists of:€144 000 of revenue  including €50 000 relating to the LAST ® brand  with the remainder primarily corresponding to the invoicing of samples sent to manufacturers  particularly in the make-up market;brand  with the remainder primarily corresponding to the invoicing of samples sent to manufacturers  particularly in the make-up market; €894 000 in subsidies under various European programmes aimed at broadening the range of feedstocks that can be used in the process.The greatest changes in operating expenses can be found in the “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” line  details of which are provided below:€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of operating expenses Personnel costs 2 309 2 079 2 223 Industrialisation/Commercialisation 2 597 4 886 2 418 Change in inventory* -584 -520 - Laboratory 185 322 587 Rent and maintenance 423 413 511 Intellectual Property 137 326 270 Depreciation/Amortisation 559 1 038 1 576 Other 1 006 911 1 018 Total 6 632 9 455 8 603* a negative sign “–” here indicates a rise in inventory value€ thousands - Group H1 2022H1 2021H1 2020Detail of “Industrialisation/Commercialisation” item INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION Industrial scaling up 1 301 332 695 Fermentation runs 753 3 203 3 258 Historical 1-step process - 2 062 1 607 New 2-step process 753 410 - Conversion of isobutene into Isonaturane® 12 64 747 - Product Development 243 - - LAST ® BRAND ACTIVITY Testing and production - 345 116 Brand development 235 990 - Total 2 597 4 886 2 418The Leuna demo plant was dismantled when the operating agreement ended in July 2021 after4 years in service. The main units were relocated to the Pomacle site in France for the second step of the new production process  while the first step  which consists of producing DMA - the precursor of isobutene - was carried out by tollers  leading to an increase in inventories of more than half a million euros.A smaller quantity of isobutene was converted into Isonaturane® 12 compared to the first half of 2021  the period during which the conversion process was developed.Work also focused on the development of products for marketing  including regulatory aspects.

Inventories increased mainly as a result of DMA production operations.Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €9.3 million during the period. Cash flow from operations changed by €7.3 million  including an increase of just under €2 million in working capital (increase in inventories  flat receivables  reduction in payables). The additional outflows of€2 million correspond to works at the Pomacle site and debt repayment.Liabilities: all liability items decreased. The Group no longer has any deferred income from publicly funded projects.Highlights of the first half of 2022  recent events and outlookThe very first orders for Isonaturane® 12 placed in June by several major cosmetics companies  including L’Oréal  were undoubtedly the most significant development of the first half of the year.A commercially focused process was implemented for the first time since the creation of the Company: this is a major step forward for Global Bioenergies  reflecting the desire of industry players to find ever more environmentally friendly solutions. These orders follow a customer referencing process carried out over several months  which included sending out samples for testing. Delivery of these initial orders is scheduled for early next year.Global Bioenergies’ Isonaturane® 12 stands out in the world of cosmetic ingredients for its particularly high selling price. The fact that it is the first cosmetic grade isododecane of natural origin gives it a very high added value. This molecule  traditionally derived from oil  is essential for longwear  water-resistant and low transfer make-up. When incorporated to achieve these characteristics  it is the main ingredient  representing between 25% and 50% of the formulation.Isonaturane® 12 thus opens the way to naturalness in the so-called “longwear” make-up segment  which represents a quarter of the global make-up market. The selling price of Isonaturane® 12 benefits from the specific characteristics of the make-up sector:Limited volumes compared to other cosmetic applications - a make-up product represents only a few grams of formulated ingredients. A single tonne of Isonaturane ® 12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to naturalness. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations.12 can switch the equivalent of 500 000 units of lipstick or mascara to naturalness. This limits the Company’s exposure to feedstock and energy price fluctuations. Very small proportion (less than 1%) of the cost of ingredients in the selling price of a finished make-up product.The business model for the upcoming periods will therefore be based on an operating chain capable of producing several dozen tonnes of Isonaturane® 12 per year from plant-derived and renewable resources  corresponding to annual revenue of several million euros.Horizon 1: Organisation of the LAST ® businessThe development and launch in June 2021 of the LAST® brand - the first make-up brand in the world to incorporate Isonaturane® 12 and thereby enable the combination of naturalness and longwear performance - required the enlisting of external expertise.After witnessing a successful launch  the choice was made to bring the functions required for the deployment of the brand in-house: sales  communication  digital marketing  and so on. A director was hired to lead this team of five people  increase awareness of the LAST® brand  boost sales and balance the ratio of expenses to revenue. This organisation resulted in a significant reduction in costs compared to 2021.In February  the team was awarded the prestigious Prix d’Excellence France award in the “Research and Innovation” category by Marie-Claire magazine  whose jury chose to recognise LAST® for its make-up combining performance and naturalness.Horizon 2: Construction of the new isobutene production unit in PomacleIn 2021  Global Bioenergies switched to using generic fermenters for the majority of its process that were much larger than the two fermenters it had previously used. Only the final step  the conversion of the isobutene precursor - DMA - into isobutene  still requires a specific fermenter.The decision was therefore taken to develop a commercial production chain at the Pomacle site using this so-called “two-step” process. The engineering studies and preparatory work carried out at the end of 2021 gave way to the actual construction and integration work  which took place in the first half of 2022. The very first batches of “two-step” isobutene were produced in March using the 0.5 m3 fermenter installed on site since 2015  prior to the connection of the 5 m3 fermenter from Leuna  which will soon increase the unit’s production capacity tenfold.A portion of the isobutene derived from this new process will then be converted into Isonaturane® 12 by a chain of tollers  with the remainder being used to explore other applications  including road and aviation fuels.Horizon 3 : Engineering work for the 2 000-tonne plant projectEngineering studies were carried out simultaneously during the first half of 2022 in order to define the industrial process for the 2 000-tonne plant and ensure its robustness. Experimental validation work was carried out for the key steps. A model was developed to ensure that they could be extrapolated to a larger scale.The mass and energy balances of the process were developed  challenged and optimised. This entailed a sequence of unit operations  selected on the basis of technical and environmental performance criteria. The Company has hired an engineering firm to carry out the preliminary design of the plant.Horizon 4: Breaking into the fuel marketsThe commercial opportunities for isobutene and its derivatives are not limited to Isonaturane® 12. Of course  this route offers the greatest potential in terms of pricing. However  isobutene was identified at the time of the Company’s creation because of the many markets in which it could be used: cosmetics  fuels  plastics  rubbers  fine chemicals  etc. The economic equation only functions today in the cosmetics market  we can nonetheless see a growing interest among all industry sectors in accessing raw materials with a better environmental profile.The huge fuel market - characterised by both high volumes and low prices - also has a need to limit its carbon footprint  particularly in the aviation sector. The Company expects to have its aviation process certified within the next six months. There are very few solutions in this field: only seven technologies worldwide have been certified to date. Several oil companies have approached Global Bioenergies in recent months  including giants Shell and Repsol  reflecting a growing interest in the Company’s solutions and potential. Efforts to improve the process will still be necessary in order to bring it to the level of cost required in the fuels sector.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

Part of the company's global inspace project  the new Warehouse is designed to reshape employees' work environment to stimulate innovation  reimagine collaboration  and create and deliver value for patients living with severe diseases.“Leaders from the International WELL Building Institute and U.S. Green Building Council joined UCB executives to present the plaques certifying the Atlanta Warehouse on UCB’s campus as LEED Gold and WELL Platinum. Pictured L to R: Jean-Christophe Tellier  CEO  UCB; Dustin Mason  Associate Director  U.S. Market Transformation & Development  U.S. Green Building Council; Judith Webb  Executive Vice President  International WELL Building Institute; Patty Fritz  Vice President  Corporate Affairs  UCB; Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President and Head of Immunology and U.S. Solutions  UCB.First launched and implemented in UCB's Brussels  Belgium  headquarters in 2018  the inspace model offers employees four main work environments with unique design elements and functions. From quiet workspaces that promote individual tasks and confidential discussions  to open workspaces that foster connectivity  the four distinctly designed areas within inspace allow employees to tailor their environment to best suit their work activities and goals.""Everything we do at UCB is to keep people living with severe and rare diseases in mind – ensuring they can live their best lives  whatever that means for them – and the inspace reimagined work environment invests in our employees and facilitates collaboration as they pursue this mission "" said Patty Fritz  UCB's Vice President of U.S. Corporate Affairs. ""We are already seeing the positive impact the Atlanta Warehouse is delivering for our patients  employees  the environment  and the greater Atlanta community as it is the first building in UCB's network of almost 40 countries to receive this level of distinction.""The Atlanta Warehouse inspace project achieved LEED Gold certification for implementing practical and measurable strategies and solutions in areas including sustainable site development  water savings  energy efficiency  materials selection  and indoor environmental quality. In the U.S. alone  buildings account for almost 40 percent of national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; LEED-certified buildings create 34 percent lower CO2 emissions  consume 25 percent less energy and 11 percent less water  and divert more than 80 million tons of waste from landfills. UCB's Atlanta Warehouse is one of only 50 buildings in the pharmaceutical industry globally to achieve LEED Gold certification.In addition to LEED Gold  the Atlanta Warehouse project also achieved WELL certification at the Platinum level by the IWBI and is one of only two WELL Platinum certified pharmaceutical projects in the world. The Warehouse is also the first project to be awarded WELL Platinum certification in the state of Georgia.The UCB Warehouse inspace project is developed and designed to reflect UCB's sustainable business approach  creating healthy work environments  and minimizing the company's environmental impact on the greater Atlanta area. Key features achieved by the inspace project include:Diverting more than 85 percent of Warehouse waste generated during construction – equating to more than 1 500 tons of waste and saving 60 loaded standard garbage trucks from the landfill.Reducing the Warehouse's total energy consumption by 30 percent against the American Society of Heating  Refrigerating and Air-Condition Engineers (ASHRAE) 90.1-2010 baseline and without using any fossil fuel energy sources  in support of UCB's commitment to reduce its overall Green House Gas (GHG) CO2 emissions by 35 percent by 2030.Offsetting approximately 20 percent of the buildings' anticipated total annual energy use by installing a 223-kWh photovoltaic array (solar panels) for supplemental power generation located on the roof.Installing two 8 000-gallon cisterns to capture rainwater for landscape irrigation serving both the Warehouse project site and elsewhere on campus which is sufficient to serve 100 percent of the annual irrigation needs for the landscape served by this system.""Sustainability is an integral part of our business approach. UCB is dedicated to improving technology and energy efficiency in its facilities. Implementing the inspace model is one step of many as we work toward a more sustainable model for our Atlanta campus and beyond "" Fritz stated.The Atlanta Warehouse project was initiated in 2018 and Phase II of the project  which involved finalization of the building  and was completed in the second half of 2021. Phase III of the project is expected to begin in early 2023 with a planned redesign and renovation for an additional building on the campus.To learn more about the UCB Atlanta Warehouse inspace project  please visit https://ucbusa.news/3StKeMj.About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including but not limited to  the ability of UCB to successfully integrate the operations of Zogenix as planned or at all  estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  t…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  today announces its first half 2022 financial and operating results.The Company’s financial and operating highlights include the following:Clinical Development:In September 2022  ONWARD reported positive top-line results from its pivotal study evaluating the ability of ARC-EX to improve arm and hand function in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).In June 2022  enrollment completed in the LIFT Home study  evaluating ARC-EX in the home setting  with 17 participants at 5 leading research centers across the United States.In May 2022  the first patient was enrolled in the HemON feasibility study  a precursor to the upcoming planned pivotal trial with ARC-IM for blood pressure and trunk control. This was the first time that the Company’s ARC-IM implantable pulse generator (IPG) was used in a human.Financial:ONWARD reported an operating loss of EUR 15 1 million for the first six months of 2022 compared to EUR 9 3 million in the same period of 2021.The Company ended the six-month period with a positive cash balance of EUR 76 8 million (31 December 2021: EUR 89 4 million). The decrease in cash of EUR 12 6 million compared to 31 December 2021 is due to cash outflows mainly for operating activities.Management reiterated its guidance of a cash runway through the end of 2024.Corporate:In March 2022  the Company was added to Euronext Brussels’ BEL Small Index.In April  Bryan  Garnier & Co  a leading investment bank focused on growth companies  initiated research coverage on the Company with a buy rating and target price of EUR 17 00 per share.The Company hired Zouhir Mechta as Vice President Operations in May 2022 and Lara Smith Weber as Chief Financial Officer in June 2022.In June 2022  former Alcon and Medtronic executive  Kristina Dziekan  was appointed to the Board of Directors  bringing extensive experience in market access and reimbursement across global markets and specific industry experience in neuromodulation.Science & Intellectual Property:From January to June 2022  the Company added 24 patents to its IP portfolio  now totaling over 330 issued and pending patents covering a broad range of technologies and activities.In February 2022  results of the STIMO study  which highlighted the use of ARC-IM Therapy to enable people with even the most severe forms of spinal cord injury to stand and walk again  were published in the journal Nature Medicine and highlighted in major media outlets around the globe.In March 2022  the Company reported that it had obtained rights to breakthrough innovations in brain-spine interface and Parkinson’s disease from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV).In April 2022  the New England Journal of Medicine highlighted the use of ONWARD’s innovative approach to treating orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure) in a patient with MSA-P  a form of Parkinson’s disease that affects the sympathetic nervous system.In June 2022  research published in Nature Neuroscience showed the potential for ONWARD’s ARC-IM Therapy to restore movement and function in hands and arms after spinal cord injury.“In the first half of 2022  we continued to execute against our strategy – advancing development of our technology  enlarging our IP portfolio  validating our therapies through clinical milestones  and strengthening our organizational capabilities ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We are very pleased with the excellent results from the Up-LIFT study that we announced earlier this month and are now focusing on preparing regulatory submissions for ARC-EX. We are hopeful we can begin to positively impact the lives of people with spinal cord injury sometime during the second half of 2023.”“We expect our current cash to propel operations through the end of 2024 and support our planned investments in product development  clinical trials  operational capabilities  and commercial launch in 2023 ” commented Lara Smith Weber  CFO of ONWARD. “ONWARD is well prepared for its next chapter as a commercial organization  and we are ready to grow the Company in the years ahead for the benefit of our stakeholders.”First Half 2022 Financial Summary:In EUR millions For the six-month period ended June 30  2022 2021 Total Revenues & Other Income 1 0 0 6 Total Operating Expenses (16 1) (9 8) Operating Loss for the Period (15 1) (9 3) Net Finance Expenses (0 9) (2 9) Income Tax Expenses (0 0) (0 0) Net Loss for the Period (16 0) (12 2) Basic (and diluted) Earnings per Share (in EUR) (0 53) (3 14) At 30 June 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Cash position at the end of the period 76 8 89 4 Interest Bearing Loans (12 0) (11 5) Equity 68 9 82 7Total Revenues & Other IncomeOther Income during the first six months of 2022 increased to EUR 1 0 million (H1 2021: EUR 0 6 million)  following a new grant from the European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA) focusing on brain-spine interfaces to reverse upper- and lower-limb paralysis.Total Operating ExpensesTotal Operating Expenses increased during H1 2022 by EUR 6 3 million to EUR 16 1 million. The increase in operating expenses included EUR 2 9 million of additional Research & Development Expenses  driven by increased staff and outsourced development expenses associated with the Company’s ARC Therapies. It also included clinical expenses of EUR 3 0 million  an increase of EUR 1 1 million compared to the same period in the prior year  as a result of the Up-LIFT and LIFT Home studies. Lastly  General & Administrative Expenses showed an increase of EUR 1 6 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to the costs associated with being a public company following the Euronext listing in October 2021.Net Finance ExpenseNet Finance Expense decreased during the first six months of 2022 by EUR 2 million compared to H1 2021. The costs in H1 2021 included interest on the Company’s innovation loan from RVO NL (Dutch government)  the convertible loan (CLA)  and the accrued dividend for the preference A shares. Both the CLA and preference A shares converted in October 2021. The expense for H1 2022 relates to the innovation loan from RVO NL and bank interest paid on the positive cash balance.Cash PositionThe Company ended the six-month period with a positive cash balance of EUR 76 8 million on 30 June 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 89 4 million). The decrease in cash of EUR 12 6 million compared to 31 December 2021 is due to cash outflows mainly for operating activities.Interest-bearing LoansInterest-bearing Loans increased from 31 December 2021 by EUR 0 5 million to EUR 12 million  due to the interest that accumulated on the innovation loan from RVO NL (Dutch government).EquityThe Company’s positive Equity position of EUR 82 7 million at year-end 2021 decreased to EUR 68 9 million on 30 June 2022. The decrease related to the operating loss for the period of EUR 16 million  mitigated by positive reserve items related to the share-based payment expense of EUR 0 8 million  the revaluation of defined benefit obligation through comprehensive income of EUR 0 7 million  and the foreign currency translation impact of U.S. operations of EUR 0 6 million.OutlookONWARD’s management expects to continue the steady and consistent execution of its strategy in the second half of 2022 and beyond.Following positive top-line data from its first pivotal study  Up-LIFT  ONWARD announced plans to submit for regulatory approval in the US and EU late this year or in early 2023 to allow the Company to commercialize ARC-EX for the improvement of upper extremity strength and function in patients with SCI. These authorizations are expected in the second half of 2023.In the second half of 2022  top-line data from the LIFT Home study are expected. The Company plans to discuss findings from LIFT Home with regulatory authorities to determine the requirements to gain clearance to market ARC-EX for home use  including the design and scope of a potential pivotal study for the home setting  should this be necessary.Also in the second half of 2022  the Company expects to release combined top-line data from the STIMO-HEMO and HemON studies. Both studies are exploring the use of ARC-IM Therapy to normalize low blood pressure and provide enhanced trunk control in people with SCI  which is the first planned indication for ARC-IM. By year-end  ONWARD therefore expects to have released top-line data from its pivotal study for ARC-EX and top-line data from current clinical feasibility studies for ARC-IM  providing important clinical validation of both of its major technology platforms.The Company expects to continue building its team and capabilities in preparation for launch of its ARC-EX Therapy in the second half of 2023  both operationally and commercially. In late 2022 or early 2023  ONWARD plans to place even greater focus on recruiting for sales  marketing  and field service roles to cover the US and select European markets.Organizational enhancements extend to the Company’s Board of Directors  which this September added Vivian Riefberg  a highly accomplished expert in healthcare  government  and strategy. In 2020  Ms. Riefberg retired as a senior partner with McKinsey & Company  where she held a variety of senior positions  including leader of the Public Sector Practice for the Americas and co-leader of the U.S. Healthcare practice. She served on McKinsey & Company’s global board of directors and on the committee evaluating and developing global partners. Ms. Riefberg is currently Professor of Practice at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business where she holds the David C. Walentas Jefferson Scholars Chair.With a strong balance sheet  the current cash position is expected to be sufficient to finance operations through the end of 2024 and support investments in product development  clinical trials  operational capabilities  and commercial launch. ONWARD continues to consider opportunities to further strengthen its cash position as equity capital markets improve in the U.S. and around the globe.Conference Call & WebcastONWARD will host a conference call with live webcast today at 4 pm CET / 10 am EDT. The webcast may be accessed on the News and Events page of the Company’s website or by clicking here.

Our differentiated approach through the Benevolent Platform™ empowers creativity and innovation in drug discovery and development. This approach has generated a growing in-house pipeline of 13 named drug programmes and over 10 exploratory programmes while supporting successful commercial collaborations with AstraZeneca and leading global research and charitable institutions.The Benevolent Platform™ is a validated AI-enabled hypothesis-driven platform that powers high-confidence drug discovery. It is disease and modality-agnostic and capable of rapidly generating novel targets at scale. Our corporate strategy to date has been to leverage the Benevolent Platform™ to identify novel drug targets across a range of different therapeutic areas with the aim to reduce time and cost and improve the probability of clinical success compared to industry standards.Following a strategic review completed during the period by the Board  the Company will now look to focus its in-house pipeline on three specific therapy areas: immunology  oncology and neurology. This focused approach to our strategy will allow us to take forward assets where we have the right capabilities to successfully develop and  in the future  potentially commercialise with or without a partner. Subsequently  at an appropriate time  we will look to out-licence assets in therapeutic areas requiring larger and more complex clinical trials or in areas where we do not have the optimal internal capabilities to develop further.Over the period  we have invested in expanding our expertise by increasing headcount to over 350. Anticipated hiring will be weighted towards drug discovery and development  with a particular focus on enhanced clinical capability.The following highlights the progress across our lead in-house clinical and preclinical pipeline assets and the continuous enhancement of the Benevolent Platform™.BEN-2293 - topical best-in-class PanTrk inhibitor in development to relieve inflammation and rapidly resolve itch in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD): Phase IIa data expected in 2023BEN-2293 is a drug candidate being explored as a treatment for mild and moderate atopic dermatitis  with the potential to be explored within severe atopic dermatitis. The molecule is an inhibitor of three tropomyosin receptor kinases (“Trk”)  TrkA  TrkB and TrkC.The Company is currently progressing a Phase Ib/IIa double-blind  placebo-controlled  first-in-human  two-part clinical study to investigate the safety  tolerability  PK and efficacy of repeat topical dosing of BEN2293 in 90 patients with mild to moderate AD. The Phase Ib portion of the study in 32 patients was successfully completed in December 2021. The Phase IIa portion in 90 patients is set to complete by end-2022 with data expected in Q1 2023. Efficacy measures incorporated in the study included changes to the eczema area severity index (EASI)  affected body surface area (BSA)  a validated investigator global assessment (vIGA-AD)  a NRS itch scale  time to itch reduction and quality of life questionnaires.The Benevolent Platform™ identified the role of the Trk receptors as mediators of both itch and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. Applying expertise in molecular design  we were able to design potent and selective inhibitors specifically of the three Trk receptors with high selectivity. We believe that BEN-2293 has the potential to demonstrate efficacy against both itch and inflammation with fewer side effects than steroid creams and various inhibitor treatments that are currently the dominant forms of treatment for this chronic condition.If BEN-2293 successfully completes this clinical trial  our intention is to partner this asset with a pharmaceutical company that has a focus in dermatology for continued clinical development and  if approved  commercialisation. The addressable market for atopic dermatitis is forecast to exceed $14bn1 in the seven major markets by 2028.BenevolentAI has filed for formulation and composition of matter patents covering BEN-2293.BEN-8744 is an orally administered  peripherally-restricted  PDE10 inhibitor under development as a first-in-class treatment for refractory ulcerative colitis (UC)IND-enabling studies are ongoing  and a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) is scheduled to be filed by late 2022  with the Phase I trial anticipated to start in early 2023.The Benevolent Platform™ identified PDE10 as an entirely novel target for the treatment of UC – there was no previously known link between PDE10 and UC or other related inflammatory conditions. The target was experimentally validated in ex vivo UC colon samples from patients with active UC  allowing BenevolentAI to demonstrate efficacious target enzyme inhibition. Accordingly  we will look to demonstrate that BEN-8744 is effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe cases of UC and with fewer side effects than the anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors that are currently the dominant form of treatment for this disease.Our aim is to progress BEN-8744 through clinical trials and retain commercial rights to this asset in-house. The combination of high and growing disease prevalence  improved diagnosis  high treatments rates and the existence of numerous drugs in the development pipeline  together with the need for better treatments  is driving a market that is forecast to exceed US$7.8 billion by 20262.BenevolentAI has filed for second medical use and composition of matters patents in respect of BEN-8744.BEN-9160 is an orally administered  brain-penetrant asset we are developing as a best-in-class treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosisBEN-9160 is a c-Abl inhibitor. Preclinical safety  drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (“DMPK”) studies were completed in 2022. IND-enabling studies are expected to start Q1 2023  pending read out of an in-vivo efficacy model. Subject to positive data the asset will then be ready for Phase I studies in 2024.The Benevolent Platform™ identified the c-Abl enzyme as a target for the treatment of ALS. C-Abl inhibitors had previously been studied primarily in the context of cancer treatments  but in vitro ALS models indicate that BEN-9160 also has the potential to be significantly neuroprotective  and we hope to demonstrate the drug candidate’s efficacy in delaying the progression of ALS in our planned clinical development programme.BenevolentAI has filed for composition of matter patents covering BEN-9160.BEN-28010 is an orally administered asset we are developing as a best-in-class treatment for glioblastoma multiformeThis asset was declared a clinical candidate  post period  in July 2022 with preparation for IND-enabling studies ongoing. Subject to positive data the asset will then be ready for Phase I studies in 2024.BenevolentAI has filed a number of patents covering BEN-28010.Earlier stage pipeline assetsAcross the rest of the pipeline we continue to see good progress  with two assets progressing into lead optimisation in the period and a further two assets expected to enter lead optimisation in the second half of 2022. We have also started two new drug programs in the period  with a further two-to-four expected to enter our pipeline in the second half of 2022 and with all targets generated from the Benevolent Platform™.Continuous enhancement of the Benevolent Platform™The Benevolent Platform™ powers a growing pipeline of in-house assets and collaborations. The platform is an AI-enabled  hypothesis-driven drug discovery methodology that draws on a multi-modal biomedical knowledge base and enables scientists to explore underlying disease mechanisms and objectively identify potential novel drug targets.The platform improves predictions by running repeatable  reproducible processes at scale and continuously learns from insights generated from experimental data generated from the Company’s wet-laboratory facilities and AI models. The impact this continuous learning loop has on our platform increases over time  enabling the company to further enhance target identification and accelerate end-to-end drug discovery.The BenevolentAI Data Foundations sits at the core of our Platform and drug discovery programmes and is built on the foundations of all publicly relevant biomedical data mined from structured sources and language data  including scientific and patent literature  regulatory documents and primary human data  as well as third-party proprietary data and our in-house experimental data. The Knowledge Graph is constantly enriched to supply a comprehensive representation of biomedical data. Our exploratory tools and predictive models empower scientists to explore relationships in the graph between biological entities and disease networks.We continue to grow and enrich our Data Foundations with new and generated insights primarily due to an increase in patient-level data (‘omics) and enhanced natural language processing (NLP) recall. This led to an increase of over 250% in relationship volume in the Knowledge Graph from June 2021 to August 2022 (46% of which is proprietary to BenevolentAI) albeit we expect this growth rate to moderate in future years. The Knowledge Graph continues to evolve  and a new version was launched during the period to enhance the recall of facts from scientific literature  supporting more nuance and specificity in our biological relationships.Beyond our data representation  our AI tools for scientists and predictive algorithms have improved at pace. Extensions and enhancements to our existing suite of tools have been completed that allow for novel targets best prosecuted by alternative modalities for example  monoclonal antibodies. We have also introduced a large language model (LLM) approach for our tools for more sophisticated reasoning.Business modelThe Company’s flexible business model allows for different approaches to drug discovery and development  which can be tailored to suit each individual programme. It can out-license drug candidates at different stages of clinical development and  therefore  adjust the required level of funding over time. Furthermore  with a validated platform that is agnostic to therapeutic area and drug modality  we can select the opportunities with the most attractive value creation potential.The Company will now seek to develop further and then partner and/or commercialise pipeline assets in the following three disease areas: immunology  oncology and neurology. In all other disease areas assets would be out licensed prior to entering the clinic.In addition to our in-house pipeline  we will also target a small number of additional platform collaborations  similar to those with AstraZeneca. This would provide non-dilutive funding  further validate our platform and  importantly  allow us to leverage the data generated to enhance our Knowledge Graph to the benefit of our in-house pipeline.We expect to generate revenue broadly from three streams:Out-licence revenue: For some drug programmes  we will choose to out-licence to partners  who will then assume responsibility for some or all of the remaining clinical development and commercialisation. At the point of out-licensing each drug candidate  we expect to receive an up-front payment and then to receive milestone payments upon successfully completing various clinical  regulatory and/or sales milestones by the licensor. In addition  we would expect to receive royalty payments on the net sales of the out-licensed drugs.For some drug programmes  we will choose to out-licence to partners  who will then assume responsibility for some or all of the remaining clinical development and commercialisation.

In addition  we would expect to receive royalty payments on the net sales of the out-licensed drugs. Platform collaboration revenue: We may receive upfront payments  research funding  milestones and royalties from platform collaborations. Platform collaborations are where we work with a partner to identify new drug targets using the Benevolent Platform™. This includes the current collaboration with AstraZeneca  which began in 2019 and has recently been extended until 2025. The AstraZeneca collaboration has been a primary driver of revenue over the past three years.We may receive upfront payments  research funding  milestones and royalties from platform collaborations.

The AstraZeneca collaboration has been a primary driver of revenue over the past three years. Product sales from self-commercialised assets: We intend to commercialise certain drugs discovered using the Benevolent Platform™. Our first product launch is targeted for the second half of this decade or shortly thereafter  and we plan to build all the necessary infrastructure to successfully launch and commercialise our drugs globally.OutlookOur listing in April 2022 has strengthened our financial position and will enable us to enhance our leadership in the AI drug discovery sector. We believe that our scalable Benevolent Platform™ will transform understanding of disease biology and help us uncover novel treatment approaches faster  and with a higher probability of clinical success.Due to the flexibility and disease agnostic capability of the Benevolent Platform™  we aim to monetise our technology in three ways  as outlined below  to increase shareholder returns over the coming periods.Our primary focus will be to independently pursue the clinical development of certain in-house pipeline assets in a number of selected core therapeutic areas  identified as immunology  oncology and neurology  before either commercialising these in-house or with partners. Our lead asset for this approach is BEN-8744 for ulcerative colitis  which will enter Phase 1 first in human trials in 2023. We will out-license pipeline assets that do not fit within these new target indications at selective times to maximise value. Our lead asset for this approach is BEN-2293  which we will aim to out-license in 2023 post Phase 2 data. Lastly  we will endeavour to enter additional strategic collaborations to leverage our disease agnostic capabilities into therapeutic indications outside our focus areas.By the end of 2022  excluding early discovery programmes  BenevolentAI expects to have initiated 17 named drug programmes and  in 2023  expects to add between four and six named drug programmes. In addition  BenevolentAI will aim to progress one to two CTA/IND-stage drug candidates every year  not including assets taken forward by collaboration partners. This target number could increase if funding allows due to the scalability of our platform.BenevolentAI is well-funded with several value inflection points both in the near and medium term  providing a solid platform to fulfil our mission of delivering life-changing medicines to patients.Joanna ShieldsChief Executive Officer27 September 2022FINANCIAL REVIEWBusiness combinationOn 22 April 2022  Odyssey SPAC and BenevolentAI Limited (the former parent company of the BAI Group before the Business Combination (“Transaction”))  entered into a business combination agreement by way of contribution of all shares in BenevolentAI Limited into Odyssey SPAC in exchange for the issuance of new ordinary shares. The Transaction was completed on 22 April 2022 and resulted in changing the name of the Group’s new holding company from Odyssey Acquisition S.A. to BenevolentAI (the “Group”).As part of the overall Transaction an equity fundraise via a private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) and backstop arrangement was concluded  where the Group received at closing a cash flow of £177.9 million  with transaction costs reflected in the P & L for the period of £79.3 million. As part of the Transaction related costs the Group incurred a non-cash  non-recurring listing service expense of £65.4 million  professional and bank fees of £11.3 million and share-based payment expenses of £2.6 million  which have been removed from the reported normalised operating loss to more accurately reflect the Group’s underlying performance for the six months ended 30 June 2022. Other costs related to the Transaction are reflected in the opening reserves of the merged Odyssey SPAC entity (brought into the Group as at 22 April 2022  retranslated from EUR to GBP using at a 0.8302 exchange rate)  or were expensed as incurred in the 2021 year end under each corresponding entity.Through the Transaction  warrant liabilities were also acquired by the Group. These had been previously issued by Odyssey SPAC  and recognised as liabilities  with that treatment continuing through the reported period due to precedent accounting requiring liability treatment where a warrant is denominated in a currency other than that of the functional currency. The warrants were revalued at closing of the transaction (£18.1 million) and are revalued at each reporting period end  with the fair value as at 30 June 2022 of £12.0 million  with £6.1 million recognised as finance income.RevenuesThe Groups’ revenues have increased by £3.1 million to £4.8 million (H1 2021: £1.7 million) with the majority reflecting a second AI-enabled drug discovery collaboration with AstraZeneca starting in January 2022  combined with revenue from a one-year extension on the initial AstraZeneca collaboration that began in late 2021 and in H1 a milestone related to the second novel target for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Research and development (R&D) expensesNormalised drug discovery spend  excluding share-based payments  for the first half of 2022 has increased to £19.3 million (H1 2021: £13.0 million)  driven by the BenevolentAI pipeline advancing into later stages of development  in particular BEN-2293 and its progression through an adaptive Phase I/II clinical study.Normalised product and technology spend for the first half of 2022 has increased to £10.7 million (H1 2021: £9.9 million)  due to an increase in staff related costs to support the continued expansion of the Benevolent Platform™.General and administrative costsNormalised business operations spend  excluding share-based payments  for the first half of 2022 has increased to £8.1 million (H1 2021: £7.0 million)  reflecting additional costs related to listing readiness. These costs are expected to stay at these levels given the enhanced level of compliance and reporting obligations.Operating lossNormalised operating loss for the first half of 2022 has increased to £55.3 million (H1 2021: £46.5 million).Finance incomeFinance income for the first half of 2022 has increased to £6.3 million (H1 2021: £10 000). This is predominantly driven by the fair value revaluation of the warrant liabilities acquired through the Transaction  reflecting a decrease in their value as at 30 June 2022 when compared to the Transaction date.TaxationTaxation income for the first half of 2022 has decreased to £3.9 million (H1 2021: £5.7 million). This is predominantly composed of tax credits arising from the UK’s small and medium-sized enterprises R&D tax relief regime  for which the increase on the claim between the two periods  driven by an increase in eligible R&D expenditure  is more than offset by the stamp duty tax payable of £3.7 million arising from the Transaction.Loss per shareNormalised basic loss per share has increased to 47.4p for the first half of 2022 (H1 2021: 45.8p)  with the weighted average number of shares in both periods adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of the share for share exchange completed during the Transaction  such as to reflect the capital structure of the legal parent. The increase reflects the increase in normalised total loss.Current assetsCurrent assets as at 30 June 2022 have increased to £191.8 million (31 December 2021: £56.6 million)  largely driven by a £124.8 million increase in cash.Cash and cash equivalentsThe cash position as at 30 June 2022 has materially strengthened with cash and cash equivalents of £165.3 million (31 December 2021: £40.6 million). This increase is driven by the PIPE  backstop proceeds  Odyssey Acquisition acquired cash  with gross proceeds of £177.9 million and AstraZeneca collaboration proceeds and off-set by the settlement of transaction expenses and ordinary course working capital expenditure.WarrantsWarrants as at 30 June 2022 have increased to £12.0 million (31 December 2021: £nil)  brought in from the Transaction and revalued at the reporting period end.Other current liabilitiesOther current liabilities as at 30 June 2022 have increased to £42.4 million (31 December 2021: £23.7 million)  reflecting an increase in trade payables for Transaction-related expenses that were paid shortly after the Period ended  and an increase in deferred income under the AstraZeneca agreements.Normalised Cash FlowCash expended from operating activities before taxation and Transaction-related items has increased to £45.8 million for the first half of 2022 (H1 2021: £24.8 million)  primarily driven by the increase in normalised operating loss  as well as changes to working capital from outstanding receivables due on the R&D tax credits and AstraZeneca collaboration income receivables.Nicholas KeherChief Financial Officer27 September 2022INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME for the six months ended 30 June Note 2022 2021 Normalised Transaction-related(1) Total Restated(2)Total £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 Revenue 5 4 843 - 4 843 1 664 Gross profit 4 843 - 4 843 1 664 Research and development expenses 6 (36 553) - (36 553) (25 980) Included within research and development expenses: Share-based payment (""SBP"") expenses 6  11 (6 577) - (6 577) (3 083) Administrative expenses 2.2 (23 642) (79 267) (102 909) (22 260) Included within administrative expenses: SBP expenses 2.2  11 (15 568) (2 611) (18 179) (15 260) Other income 72 - 72 74 Operating loss 2.2 (55 280) (79 267) (134 547) (46 502) Finance income 7 195 6 120 6 315 10 Finance expense 8 (257) - (257) (247) Loss before taxation (55 342) (73 147) (128 489) (46 739) Taxation 9 7 637 (3 739) 3 898 5 651 Loss for the period (47 705) (76 886) (124 591) (41 088) Total comprehensive loss for the period (47 705) (76 886) (124 591) (41 088) Basic and diluted loss per share  expressed in pence (123.9p) (45.8p) Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 100 545 304 89 754 538 No dividend has been declared or paid in either reporting period.

(“Odyssey SPAC”)  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company established for the purpose of acquiring a business with principal business operations in Europe or in another geographic area  that is based in the healthcare sector or the TMT (technology  media  telecom) sector or any other sectors. Odyssey SPAC was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on 6 July 2021.On 22 April 2022 (“Closing date”)  Odyssey SPAC and BenevolentAI Limited (the former parent company of the privately held UK group before the business combination (“Transaction”))  entered into a business combination agreement by way of contribution of all shares in BenevolentAI Limited into Odyssey SPAC in exchange for Odyssey SPAC issuing new ordinary shares. The Transaction was completed on 22 April 2022 and the name of the ultimate holding company was changed from Odyssey Acquisition S.A. to BenevolentAI  whose consolidated Group post-closing is referred to as BAI Group.BAI Group is managed by its ultimate parent company BenevolentAI  with the following 5 trading subsidiaries operated under one segment.Registered office address Status Class ofshares held Ownership BenevolentAI Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Bio Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Technology Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% Benevolent Technology Inc(1) Domiciled in USA Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Energy Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Dormant Ordinary shares 100% Stratified Medical Limited(1) 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Dormant Ordinary shares 100% (1) Held indirectly2 Accounting policies2.1 Basis of preparationThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. They have been prepared on a historical cost basis  except for financial instruments measured at fair value  and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest £ ‘000.At 30 June 2022  net assets totaled £166.4m  with a cash balance of £165.3 million following the completion of the business combination. Management have reviewed the Group’s cash flow forecasts and believes it has sufficient cash for at least the next twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. The financial statements  therefore  continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.The financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 for both Odyssey Acquisition S.A. and BenevolentAI Limited.The Business Combination between BenevolentAI Limited and Odyssey SPAC is accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2 as a capital reorganisation since Odyssey SPAC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Under this accounting method  Odyssey SPAC is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. The comparatives in the financial statements  therefore  represent the financial information of BenevolentAI Limited and its subsidiaries  both to 30 June 2021 and as at 31 December 2021. The activity and position of the acquired Odyssey SPAC is considered only from the Closing date onwards. That is  the statement of profit and loss contains only the post-acquisition performance of Odyssey SPAC  with the pre-acquisition losses being reflected through reserves. See note 4 for further details.A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and earlier application is permitted; however  the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated Interim financial statements.The consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2022 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Board resolution on 27 September 2022.2.2 Normalised operating lossNormalised operating loss is defined as operating loss excluding expenses related to the business combination for the six months ended 30 June 2022. This is to show an underlying representation of operating losses and cash flows for the respective periods.It is an alternative performance measure (‘APM’) that is not calculated in accordance with IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies’ APMs  including those in the Group’s industry. APMs should be considered in addition to  and are not intended to substitute or supersede  IFRS measures.This APM is in our view an important metric for a biotech company in the development stage. Removing the Transaction-related costs  given their isolated nature  enables users to better compare the Group’s normal operating performance between reporting periods.The following table presents a reconciliation of normalised group operating loss  to the closest IFRS measures  for each of the periods indicated:For the six months ended 30 June Note 2022 2021 £'000 £'000 Reported group operating loss (134 547) (46 502) Adjustments for: Transaction-related expenditure 11 255 - Transaction-related listing service expense 4 65 401 - Transaction-related SBP expenses 11 2 611 - Total Transaction-related items 79 267 - Normalised group operating loss (55 280) (46 502)2.3 Change in functional currency of BenevolentAIAs of 22 April 2022  management reviewed the functional currency of BenevolentAI and the presentation currency of the Group. The change in functional currency  for standalone BenevolentAI was made to reflect that GBP has become the predominant operating currency for the Company representing a significant part of its cash flows and its operating environment  while the Group presentation currency remains in GBP consistent with the prior year.The Group presents as comparative information the financial information of the former BenevolentAI Limited Group  which had GBP as its functional and presentation currency. Comparative information  therefore  has not been re-stated following this change to BenevolentAI’s functional currency.3 Critical accounting estimates and judgementsThe consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the application of the chosen accounting policies requires management to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The estimates and the underlying assumptions are subject to continuous review. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments  however  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.In preparing these condensed interim financial statements  the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimate uncertainty are:Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe amount of goodwill and intangible assets initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based  to a considerable extent  on management’s judgement and based on industry benchmarks and information relevant to the specific assets in focus.The carrying value of goodwill and intangibles requires the assessment of discounted future cashflows of the future economic value of the underlying assets. The assumptions and critical judgement required from management is inherently uncertain though based on recognised industry methods of evaluating drug programme assets and companies undertaking drug discovery activities.Management used industry practice in its method of evaluating the estimate of future revenue streams of drug programmes  associated costs together with market data for the therapeutic areas of interest  discount rates for cost of capital  risk factors including probabilities of progressing a candidate to commercialisation or earlier partnering of a programme and other relevant factors.Management have further considered the positive progress identified to date from the acquisition of BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited with value anticipated to arise from already identified specific programmes in addition to the ongoing value creation from the underlying assets.Share-based payments provisionThe Group operates an unapproved Share Option Plan. All employees are offered options upon joining the Group. The fair value of share options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model at each reporting date taking into account various assumptions detailed in note 12. The full charge of the vested options during the half year is recognised in the profit and loss.Classification of Class A Warrants and B WarrantsAs part of the Business Combination transaction  BAI Group took on warrants which had been initially issued by Odyssey SPAC prior to the Transaction  as part of financing Odyssey SPAC’s working capital and investment.A derivative  other than a derivative that meets the definition of an equity instrument  is initially recognised as a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into  and the related transaction costs are expensed. The fair values of the derivatives are remeasured at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair values recognised in net income or loss.A derivative that will be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash in terms of its functional currency or another financial asset is classified and presented as an equity instrument  rather than a financial liability. The exercise price of the Company's share purchase warrants that are exercisable into common shares is denominated in EUR  however  the Company will receive a variable amount of cash in terms of its GBP functional currency upon exercise of the warrants due to movements in foreign exchange.Accordingly  the Company's warrants are classified and presented as derivative financial liabilities and measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of each warrant class is determined at each reporting date and exercise date and is based on quoted market prices  where available  or independently valued using Binomial Tree method and the Monte Carlo method. This is consistent with how fair value revaluations were determined under Odyssey SPAC.4 Accounting impact of the Business CombinationFollowing the successful completion of the Business Combination with Odyssey SPAC on 22 April 2022  BenevolentAI became the new name of the holding company of the new BAI Group.This Business Combination was achieved through the contribution of ordinary and preferred shares in BenevolentAI Limited in exchange for new ordinary shares in BenevolentAI (previously Odyssey SPAC)  The result being that the new BAI Group became listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.As discussed in note 2.1  the Business Combination between BenevolentAI Limited and Odyssey SPAC was accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2 as a capital reorganisation  since Odyssey SPAC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Accordingly  the Transaction was treated as the equivalent of BenevolentAI Limited issuing shares at the closing of the Business Combination for the net assets of Odyssey Acquisition S.A. as at the Closing date  accompanied by a recapitalisation. The excess of the fair value of consideration for Odyssey Acquisition S.A. over the fair value of its identifiable net assets acquired represents a compensation for the service of a stock exchange listing for its shares and expenses as incurred. This leads to a non-cash listing service expense of £65.4m that has been recognised in administrative expenses.As at Closing date  the fair value of BenevolentAI Limited’s shares that were deemed to be issued to Odyssey SPAC amounted to £88.3m  based on the initial closing price of shares of Odyssey Acquisition S.A. according to the table below. In return  BenevolentAI received Odyssey SPAC’s listing service and its net liabilities  equal to £6.1m  which mainly consisted of remaining cash net of redemptions and liabilities related to the warrants  resulting in a total non-cash listing service expense of £65.4m to administrative expenses  excluding the £29.0m of Transaction-related expenses incurred by Odyssey SPAC.Fair value in £m Class A shares (4.9 million shares at £8.22 per share) 40.0 Class B shares 2/3 (5 million shares at £8.22 per share) 41.1 Class B shares 1/3 (2.5 million shares at £2.87 per share) 7.2 BenevolentAI Limited’s shares deemed issued 88.3 Plus Odyssey SPAC’s net liabilities 6.1 Less Transaction-related expenses incurred by Odyssey SPAC (29.0) IFRS 2 non-cash listing service expense 65.4Odyssey SPAC’s net liabilities at Closing (before the gross proceeds of €136.1m from PIPE Financing and€40m backstop):Fair value in £m at Closing Cash 32.0 Prepayments and other debtors 0.2 Accruals and trade creditors (20.2) Warrants at fair value (18.1) Net liabilities acquired (6.1)In conjunction with the Transaction  Odyssey SPAC entered into subscription agreements with investors (“PIPE Investors”) in a Private Investment in Public Equity transaction (the “PIPE Financing”) in the aggregate amount of €136.1m (£113.0m). In return for their investment  the PIPE Investors received a total of 13 613 394 additional Odyssey SPAC Class A shares. An equity back stop facility for €40m (£33.2m) resulted in a further issuance of 4 000 000 (per note 15) ordinary shares were also issued. This resulted in a total cash inflow of £145.9m (less £0.3m of professional fees) across the equity PIPE and Backstop.Prior to closing  as consistent with the original public share offering by Odyssey SPAC  a total of 25.1 million ordinary shares with an agreed redemption price of €9.96 per share were redeemed for cash by eligible ordinary shareholders  following the redemption process. These are currently held as treasury shares. The redemption payable of €250.3 million was paid prior to Transaction close.As part of the Capital Reorganisation  BenevolentAI Limited’s share capital was exchanged for shares in Odyssey Acquisition S.A. of £75k  being 90 million shares at a par value of €0.001. This capital reorganization reflects the transition of the share capital and share premium from BenevolentAI Ltd to BenevolentAI. This results in a decrease within share capital by £0.1m from the old share capital (par value of £0.10) with an increase of £584m reflecting a true-up to the premium on the shares issued to BenevolentAI shareholders in the share for share exchange. The corresponding adjustment to reflect the book value accounted  reflected through a corresponding charge to retained earnings of £43.2m and the merger difference of £535.9m  reflected in BenevolentAI.The following table provides an overview of the impact of the Business Combination on the Statement of Comprehensive loss for the six months to 30 June 2022:in £m BenevolentAI Limited(ex-Transaction) Impact from BusinessCombination (1) (2) (3) BenevolentAIconsolidated(with Transaction) Gross profit 4.8 - 4.8 Operating loss (55.3) (79.3) (134.6) Loss before tax (55.4) (73.1) (128.5) Taxation 7.6 (3.7) 3.9 Loss for the period (47.8) (76.8) (124.6)(1) Operating loss includes the listing service expense of £65.4m; Transaction-related SBP expenses of £2.6m; transaction costs of £11.3m; and costs incurred by the Company since Transaction close. (2) Loss before tax includes those adjustments noted above  in addition to the revaluation of warrants since Close of £6.1m credit. (3) Loss for the period includes those adjustments noted above  in addition to stamp duty tax payable of £3.7m.In addition  the following table provides an overview of the impacts of the Business Combination on the Statement of Financial Position at 30 June 2022:in £m BenevolentAI Limited(ex-Transaction) Impact from BusinessCombination (4) (5) BenevolentAIconsolidated(with Transaction) Assets Total non-current assets 35.6 - 35.6 Total current assets 38.5 153.3 191.8 Total assets 74.1 153.3 227.4 Liabilities Total current liabilities 42.3 12.0 54.3 Total non-current liabilities 6.7 - 6.7 Total liabilities 49.0 12.0 61.0 Net assets (shareholders’ equity) 25.1 141.3 166.4(4) Current assets include £32.0m proceeds from cash in Odyssey SPAC at Transaction close  in addition to £112.7m net proceeds from PIPE Financing and £33.2m proceeds from backstop facility. This is then net of outflows of £24.6m for payments of stamp duty; supplier invoices; and negative interest. Note  neither the PIPE Financing nor the backstop have been included as net assets when determining the listing service expense. (5) Current liabilities includes the £12.0m fair value of warrants as at 30 June 2022  having moved from the £18.1m valuation at the Transaction close.5 RevenueWe initially recognise income under the AstraZeneca Collaboration as deferred revenue  which we become entitled to recognise as revenue in line with the delivery efforts towards the completion of tasks and provision of the deliverables set out in the agreements governing the AstraZeneca Collaboration. For the six months to 30 June 2022  this is represented by a revenue of £4.8m (six months to 30 June 2021: £1.7m).AZ Collaboration dealBuilding on the success of the first collaboration  the relationship with AstraZeneca has been expanded into a new 3-year partnership  starting 1 January 2022 and focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and heart failure (HF).As the result of this collaboration BenevolentAI received an upfront fee of $15m (£11.8m) in January 2022. As the result of the upfront fee  a total of £7.0m deferred revenue is recognised as of 30 June 2022 (nil as at 31 Dec 2021).There is no related party revenue in the six months to 30 June 2022 (six months to 30 June 2021: £nil).

Receipts for 2021 remain outstanding due to a scheme wide backlog in processing  reviewing and settling submissions to claimants.10 Loss per shareLoss per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of BenevolentAI after taxation for each financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial period. The weighted average number of shares is calculated from the number of ordinary and preferred BenevolentAI shares in circulation at the beginning of the period adjusted by the number of ordinary shares issued during the period  alongside the impacts of the transaction and multiplied by a time-weighting factor. The time-weighting factor reflects the ratio of the number of days on which ordinary shares were issued and the total number of days of the period.The G2 Growth Shares have been excluded as they do not attract dividends and were subsequently cancelled prior to the Transaction.As the business combination is accounted for as if BenevolentAI Ltd has acquired Odyssey SPAC  the number of shares is adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of the share for share exchange completed during the Transaction  such as to reflect the capital structure of the legal parent. In accordance with IAS 33  the calculation of the basic and diluted loss per share for all periods presented has been adjusted retrospectively due to these changes.For the six months ended 30 June Note 2022 2021 £’000 £’000 Basic and diluted loss per share  expressed in pence (123.9p) (45.8p) Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 100 545 304 89 754 538 Reported total comprehensive loss (124 591) (41 088) Adjustments for: Transaction-related items 2.2 79 267 - Fair value revaluation gain on warrants within finance income 7 (6 120) - Stamp duty tax payable within taxation 9 3 739 - Normalised total comprehensive loss (47 705) (41 088) Normalised basic and diluted loss per ordinary share (47.4p) (45.8p)11 Share based payments (“SBP”)During the period to the 22 April 2022 (before the Transaction)  1 602 040 options and 75 793 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) were granted to employees and others under the unapproved Share Option Plan for BenevolentAI Limited. No awards were made between the Transaction and 30 June 2022. Benevolent options and RSUs have been adjusted based on the ratio of 1 BenevolentAI Limited ordinary and A preferred share into approximately 38.4930 BenevolentAI ordinary shares  as determined in the business combination agreement as part of the share for share exchange. Correspondingly  the exercise price has been divided by the same ratio  such that the fair value charge remains consistent  with no other impact arising from this scheme modification. During the six months to 30 June 2022 575 894 options and 66 824 RSUs were forfeited. The comparative information presented has been adjusted retrospectively for this conversion  where applicable.The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options under BenevolentAI are as follows:Options and RSUs held in BenevolentAI Weightedaverage exerciseprice (pounds) Number ofoptions / RSUs Weighted averageexercise price(pounds) Number ofoptions / RSUs For the six months ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 2021 Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the period 0.1 19 043 911 1.0 8 839 032 Forfeited during the period (0.0) (642 718) (11.7) (721 128) Exercised during the period - - - - Granted during the period 0.0 1 677 833 0.0 3 940 682 Outstanding at the end of the period 0.1 20 079 026 0.2 12 058 586 Exercisable at the end of the period - - - -For the six months ended 30 June 2022 Restated 2021 £’000 £’000 SBP expenses 21 913 18 343 Transaction-related SBP expenses 2 371 - 24 284 18 343 Social security provision in relation to SBP 232 - Transaction-related social security provision in relation to SBP 240 - 472 -The Group has re-assessed the fair value (“FV”) charging methodology for the unapproved share option plan  identified as a result of the Business Combination  reflecting the scheme ‘point of exit’. Historic FV allocation was to spread straight line over the service period  rather than via a tranching approach. The tranching approach would result in straight line FV allocation for the tranches vesting pre-trigger over the ‘time to exit’  with the regular tranching thereafter. Prior estimates around the ‘time to exit’  using the service period as an estimate  were in some instances too long  meaning that the FV allocation in respect of awards was spread over a longer period than actually transpired. Indicators during 2021 would suggest that the re-assessment of the FV allocation over the period to exit should have taken place in 2021 and that the respective charges have been pulled back into the restated period.The error and subsequent correction  presented through the restatement for the 2021 Interim Statement of Consolidated Income to 30 June and Full Year 2021 Statement of Financial Position is detailed below.Audited balances referred to are pre-restatement  where the restatement itself is yet to be audited reflective of the interim statement itself being unaudited.£’000 Six months to 30 June 2021 ReportedUnaudited Prior PeriodAdjustmentsUnaudited RestatedUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Research and development expenses SBP expenses (821) (2 262) (3 083) Administrative Expenses SBP expenses (7 295) (7 965) (15 260) (8 116) (10 227) (18 343) Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Year to 31 December 2021 Audited Prior PeriodAdjustmentsUnaudited RestatedUnaudited Current liabilities provisions 10 391 1 383 11 774 Share-based payment reserve 67 666 20 054 87 720 Retained earnings (271 001) (21 437) (292 438)12 Trade and other Payables30 June 31 December 2022 2021 £'000 £'000 Trade payables 13 677 1 747 Taxation and social security 944 663 Other payables and accruals 6 561 7 876 21 182 10 286Trade payables includes £11.3 million in relation to Transaction-related payables as at 30 June 2022.

Following the Transaction close and subsequent consolidation of the post-acquisition performance of BenevolentAI (formerly Odyssey SPAC)  between 22 April 22 and 30 June 22  the change in the fair value was then recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as expense.The expense for the warrants was determined on the basis of the fair value at the Closing date. The fair value was derived by applying the using Binomial Tree method and the Monte Carlo pricing method.Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Comprehensive income statement. The current warrants are EUR denominated liability and are retranslated as at 30 June 22. The Foreign exchange difference arising on the retranslation is posted as expense in the statement of comprehensive income.14 ShareholdingsThe table  including a comparative  reflects the shares in issue for BenevolentAI Limited as the accounting acquirer of Odyssey SPAC (now BenevolentAI) and the subsequent consolidated impact of the share for share exchanged  the impact of the redemption  equity Pipe Financing and equity Backstop facility for BenevolentAI  as the legal Parent and listed entity.

Technoprobe: A Clear Winner Part 2,Thanks to the just-released results  we follow up on our comps analysis on the half-year performance of FormFactor Vs. Technoprobe. Click here to read more.,"PhonlamaiPhotoSince our initial comps analysis between FormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) and Technoprobe  their stock price performances have been diametrically opposed. In our first analysis  FormFactor was rated as a neutral opportunity  whereas Technoprobe was a screaming buy. The former delivered a negative return of more than 40%  while the latter was listed at €5.7 per share  and today  despite the negative market return  after the just released results  it is trading at more than €7 per share (Fig 1)  signing a plus 23% YTD. As a recap of our FormFactor analysis  here at the Lab  we also commented on the company's Q4 and Q1 results.FormFactor Vs Technoprobe: A Clear Winner (Mare Evidence Lab's previous publication)Technoprobe S.p.A. Stock Price Evolution (Yahoo Finance (Fig 1))Q2 results compsIn the half-year results  FormFactor delivered a good set of numbers. On a quarterly basis  revenue increased by 8.4% compared to Q2 2021 account; however  Technoprobe achieved a plus 42.6% in the same period. Going down to the P&L  we note the same positive trends. At gross margin level  FormFactor's gross margin stood at 46.3% versus the 40.6% in the second quarter of 2021 (in line with the guidance previously forecasted). Looking at the Italian counterpart  gross margin was at almost 60%  in line with Q1 and up 36% year-on-year. Going back to FormFactor  this positive performance in Q2 result in an EPS at the high end of the management range. Here at the Lab  we positively favor the latest company acquisition of JanisULT that further strengthens FormFactor's ""capabilities as a key supplier to the emerging quantum computing market"". Despite that  Technoprobe just delivered a breathtaking half-year performance  and we are much more confident of the long-term prospects.Additional upside in Technoprobe to considerFX development. Indeed  Technoprobe might benefit from a weak € currency. Being a net exporter  this might result in taking a higher market share in the probe market in the US; Once again  FormFactor cost pressure wage might be higher versus Technoprobe. This is due to various reasons: the lower US unemployment rate compared to the Italian one and the salary cost-based (once again  it is much lower in Italy); Higher expenditure in R&D development that favors Technoprobe; As already anticipated in the Infineon follow-up note  being located in the EU  Technoprobe might prosper from the EU Chips Act: ""the European Commission plans to allocate €11 billion in public funds for the research  design and manufacturing of semiconductors  with the goal of mobilizing a total of €43 billion of public and private investment until 2030"". A plan to bolster Europe's ""competitiveness and resilience in semiconductor technologies and applications"". It is just a piece of recent news that Intel is planning to open a new chip lab facility in the Northern part of Italy; When the company will pass from Euronext Growth Milan to the Star segment  Technoprobe will certainly have better investor visibility (and more trading volumes liquidity)  so we are confident that stock price performance will follow.Conclusion and valuationWith the recent FormFactor stock price decline  we believe that it might offer a good entry point; however  we are still more confident in the Italian company that likely offers a better upside in terms of valuation and 5 additional short/medium quick takeaways. The Q3 outlook for FormFactor was also not very positive  so we reaffirm our neutral rating.FormFactor Q3 Guidance (FormFactor Q2 Results)If you are interested in our latest coverage on European semis  please have a look at our recently published articles:",neutral,0.1,0.82,0.08,mixed,0.52,0.1,0.39,True,English,"['Clear Winner Part', 'FormFactor Vs', 'Technoprobe', 'Technoprobe S.p.A.

The low ppq levels demand an unprecedented level of cleanliness and instrument sensitivity which ultimately necessitate newer  and more robust analytical techniques.The results achieved provide clear evidence that ultra-trace levels of PFOA and PFOS can be detected  but with significantly increased levels of effort  cost  and environmental impact that are not sustainable for routine analysis.With this demonstration of capabilities  Eurofins Sacramento is in the process of developing an ultra-trace method capable of supporting the analysis of PFAS in the sub-ppt range.Methodology to Achieve the 2022 interim Health Advisory LevelsCurrent commercial lab limits of quantitation for PFAS are at 2ppt  requiring a 500-fold decrease for PFOA and a 100-fold for PFOS to support the US EPA HALs. Several modifications of existing procedures were employed with varying levels of success  including analysis on a SCIEX 7500  new LCMS column and traps  pre-rinsing consumables  use of water filtered through an LCMS column  and extraction in a clean room. At the conclusion of these efforts  a series of sample analyses demonstrated achievability of the 2022 interim Health Advisory Levels.For technical specifications and data related to this development  visit the SCIEX USA technical note “ Achieving low parts-per-quadrillion detection limits for PFAS analysis in drinking water”.ENDSAbout Eurofins Environment Testing – USAThe Eurofins environmental laboratories network in the US performs analysis of drinking water  groundwater  seawater  soil  air  and tissue using state-of-the-art analytical methods to assess quality and impact on health and the environment.About Eurofins – the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

A major milestone of it was achieved with the completion of enrolment in the Phase I/II clinical trial of the drug candidate Batten-1 in juvenile Batten disease (or CLN3). »Financial results for the first half of 2022In K€ First half - 22 First half - 21 Net sales - - Operating income 462 12 Other purchases and external charges 1 950 2 944 Personnel expenses 1 509 1 388 Depreciation and amortization 166 195 Other operating expenses 24 34 Total operating expenses 3 649 4 562 Operating profit/ loss (3 187) (4 550) Financial result (121) (112) Income taxes 18 939 Net profit/loss (3 290) (3 723)The half-year results for 2022 were approved by the company's Board of Directors on 27 September 2022 and were the subject of a report by the company's Statutory Auditors.Other purchases and external charges decreased in the first half of 2022 to €1 950 K from €2 944 K in the first half of 2021. This decrease is mainly due to the significant regulatory preclinical expenses incurred in the first half of 2021 for the Company's drug candidate in Batten disease. In the first half of 2022  the most significant external expenses were related to the phase 1/2 study still on the Batten-1 drug candidate.Personnel charges are relatively stable at €1 509 K in H1 2022 compared to €1 388 K in 2021 for the same period. The company has recruited one member to the clinical team in the first half of 2022.Depreciation and amortization decreased (€166 K in the first half of 2022 compared to €195 K in 2021 for the same period)  impacted by the end of amortization on THN patents  a total provision for amortization has been made at the end of 2021 for these assets.The financial result did not change much (loss of €121 K in 2022 compared to a loss of €112 K in 2021). It mainly includes interest charges on the company's debt.Income taxes are lower in the first half of 2022 than in 2021. Indeed  the advances and subsidies received in the first half of 2022 (totaling €1.7 M) exceed the base of expenses eligible for the Research Tax Credit (RTC) over the period  which results in a zero RTC over the half-year (the tax income of €18 K corresponds to the family tax credit). Conversely  in 2021 the company did not receive any significant subsidies or reimbursable advances and had incurred significant expenses eligible for the RTC (including regulatory pre-clinical expenditure in the context of its development in Batten disease).On 30 June 2022  total available funds stood at f €11.6 M. The cash level has evolved in line with the company's expectations for the first six months of the 2022 financial year. This healthy financial situation validates the decision to definitively terminate in April 2022 the equity financing line that had been set up with Iris Capital in January of the same year.About TheranexusTheranexus is an innovative biopharmaceutical company that emerged from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). It specializes in the treatment of central nervous system disorders and is a pioneer in the development of drug candidates targeting both neurons and glial cells.The company has a unique platform for the identification and characterization of advanced therapy drug candidates targeting rare neurological disorders and an initial drug candidate in clinical development for Batten disease.Theranexus is listed on the Euronext Growth market in Paris (FR0013286259- ALTHX).Next financial publication:20 October 2022 : Cash position as of 30 September 2022More information at http://www.theranexus.comClick and follow us on Twitter and LinkedlnContactsTHERANEXUSThierry LambertChief Financial Officercontact@theranexus.comNEWCAPThéo Martin/Pierre LaurentInvestor Relations+33 (0)1 44 71 94 97theranexus@newcap.eu FP2COMFlorence PortejoieMedia Relations+ 33 (0)6 07 76 82 83fportejoie@fp2com.fr------------------------This publication embed ""Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key:nHCdZclvZ2fHl2ufaJ5pmWZqbJuSlmOYZWicmWdra8mUnW+TlJdom8eeZnBnmG1t- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com.------------------------© Copyright Actusnews WireReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com  it's freeFull and original release in PDF format:https://www.actusnews.com/documents_communiques/ACTUS-0-76387-theranexus_pr_resultats_semestriels_2022-ven-def.pdf",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.09,0.24,0.67,True,English,"['FINANCIAL RESULTS', 'FIRST HALF', 'THERANEXUS ANNOUNCES', '2022', 'central nervous system disorders', 'Florence Portejoie Media Relations', 'Phase I/II clinical trial', 'advanced therapy drug candidates', 'significant regulatory preclinical expenses', 'phase 1/2 study', 'regulatory pre-clinical expenditure', 'new strategic plan', 'French Alternative Energies', 'Atomic Energy Commission', 'rare neurological disorders', 'Euronext Growth market', 'Théo Martin', 'next press releases', 'Research Tax Credit', 'family tax credit', 'total available funds', 'drug candidate Batten-1', 'Batten-1 drug candidate', 'initial drug candidate', 'healthy financial situation', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'first six months', 'equity financing line', 'Copyright Actusnews Wire', 'Total operating expenses', '195 Other operating expenses', 'significant external expenses', 'juvenile Batten disease', 'Next financial publication', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'Operating profit/ loss', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'innovative biopharmaceutical company', 'K€ First half', 'significant expenses', 'Investor Relations', 'Operating income', 'clinical team', 'total provision', 'tax income', '2,944 Personnel expenses', 'neurological diseases', 'Financial result', '2022 financial year', 'Other purchases', 'external charges', 'significant subsidies', '22 First half', '6pm CEST', 'glial cells', 'Franck Mouthon', 'rigorous management', 'major milestone', '21 Net sales', 'Income taxes', 'Net profit', 'Statutory Auditors', 'Personnel charges', 'one member', 'THN patents', 'interest charges', 'cash level', 'Iris Capital', 'same year', 'unique platform', 'Cash position', 'More information', 'Thierry Lambert', 'Pierre Laurent', 'eu FP2COM', 'original release', 'PDF format', 'clinical development', 'same period', 'reimbursable advances', 'zero RTC', 'half-year results', '€121 K', '€112 K', 'Lyon', 'France', '27 September', 'Theranexus', 'treatment', 'interaction', 'neurons', 'Chairman', 'deployment', 'completion', 'enrolment', 'CLN', 'Depreciation', 'amortization', 'Board', 'Directors', 'subject', 'report', 'decrease', 'H1', 'assets', 'debt', 'base', 'context', '30 June', 'expectations', 'decision', 'April', 'January', 'CEA', 'pioneer', 'identification', 'characterization', 'Paris', 'ALTHX', '20 October', '30 September', 'Twitter', 'Linkedln', 'Contacts', 'NEWCAP', 'fportejoie', 'nHCdZclvZ2fHl2ufaJ5pmWZqbJuSlmOYZWicmWdra8mUnW', 'TlJdom8eeZnBnmG1t', 'email', 'Full', 'documents_communiques', 'semestriels', '2021']",2022-09-05,2022-09-27,finanznachrichten.de

At the same time  we have continued our commercial development  notably abroad where our revenue has recorded substantial growth  whilst improving our sales margin thanks to better implant procurement conditions. In the United States  our priority market  we have met key milestones with the first surgical procedures performed and the granting of two FDA 510(k) clearances for our surgery planning software and our patient-specific rods. Building on our strengthened financial situation and this positive momentum  in the coming months we will focus on organizing training programs in order to promote SMAIO’s technologies and services internationally  with a particular emphasis on the United States. Furthermore  in early 2023  our partnership agreement with NuVasive should allow us to obtain a first milestone payment of $3 million followed by recurrent revenue thanks to imaging analysis services undertaken by SMAIO’s operators for NuVasive’s clients"".Story continuesFirst-half 2022 resultsSimplified income statement (€ millions) H1 2022 H1 2021 Sales 1.32 1.03 Operating income 1.70 1.53 Operating expenses (3.45) (3.29) Operating profit/(loss) (1.75) (1.76) Exceptional income/(expenses) 7.40 (0.3) Net profit/(loss) 5.37 (1.60)Sales totaled €1.3 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of +28% compared with the first half of 2021 (€1.0 million). This improvement was the result of buoyant growth in international activity (+119%)  and notably of the ramping up of our historical distributors in Spain and Scandinavia  new distribution agreements signed in the Baltic states and Greece and the first surgical procedures performed in the United States.As in 2021  sales of implants and rods accounted for almost all of the Company’s sales (96%). The software segment  with the Keops platform  accounted for the balance (4%) and will see substantial growth over the coming semesters  notably following the granting of 510(k) clearance by the FDA and thanks to the partnership and licensing agreement signed with NuVasive  a global leader in spine technology innovation.SMAIO’s gross margin reached a new high of 60%  versus 52% at end-June 2021 and 55% at end-December 2021  thanks to an increased presence on international markets  historically more lucrative  and the more advantageous implant procurement conditions obtained in 2021. The margin on implant sales alone also saw a significant improvement  increasing from 50% in H1 2021 to 63% in the same period of 2022.Other operating expenses increased in the first half of 2022  primarily as a result of the amortization of the new sets of instruments loaned out or given to hospitals on consignment  the amortization of R&D costs reflecting the intensification of the Company’s innovation efforts  as well as inventory depreciations. Amortization  impairment and provision charges came to €0.6 million in the first half of 2022  vs. €0.5 million a year earlier The operating loss was €1.75 million in the first half of 2022  stable compared with the first half of 2021.Exceptional items totaled +€7.40 million and consisted entirely of the dropping of the current account held by Japanese group Otsuka – longstanding SMAIO shareholder – to the Company’s benefit.Once a tax expense of €0.27 million is taken into account  there was a net profit of €5.4 million in the first half of 2022 compared with a net loss of €1.6 million in the same period of 2021.Strengthened financial structureSMAIO had cash and cash equivalents of €7.33 million at June 30  2022  compared with €0.57 million at December 31  2021. This figure notably includes the €7.5 million net proceeds of the Company’s IPO on the Euronext Growth market in Paris in April 2022. This cash position will allow the Company to finance its development in accordance with the strategy presented to the financial community at that time.Shareholders’ equity stood at €12.32 million at end-June 2022  vs. -€0.62 million at end-December 2021.On February 1  2022  Otsuka announced that it was discontinuing its activities in orthopedics and took the decision to transfer its interests to SMAIO’s Vice-President of Operations  as well as its current account to SMAIO’s only other shareholder  Sylorus Scientific2. Furthermore  it also decided to entirely cancel SMAIO’s current account debt  thus making the Company debt-free.H1 2022 highlightsValue-creating partnership with NuVasive  a global leader in spine technology innovationSharing a similar vision of the importance of spinal realignment planning and implant placement to achieve favorable  repeatable and long-lasting results  in the first quarter of 2022 NuVasive and SMAIO signed a partnership and licensing agreement to further develop SMAIO’s surgical planning solutions and to support the innovation pipeline and commercialization efforts.As part of this collaboration  NuVasive has pledged to invest a total of $10 million (~€9 million3) in the Company  of which $5 million (~€4.5 million3) has already been invested within the framework of SMAIO’s IPO  the balance consisting of milestone payments that will be made when the Company receives FDA 510(k) clearance for two software solutions interfacing with the U.S. group’s technological platforms. NuVasive has exclusivity regarding the planning tool development partnerships implemented by SMAIO for a three-year period from the date on which the second software solution is approved.Moreover  within the framework of this partnership  SMAIO will put in place an image analysis and planning assistance service for NuVasive’s clients  which will be billed and will thus generate recurring payments proportional to the number of analyses performed. This partnership leaves SMAIO free to distribute its own customized bending solutions and the remainder of its KHEIRON implant range either directly or via its network of distributors.Two 510(k) clearances to accelerate development in the United StatesIn June  SMAIO announced that it had been granted two 510(k) clearances by the FDA for the key components of its i-Kontrol platform: the Balance Analyzer 3D surgery planning software and the K-rod patient-specific union rod. Thanks to these approvals  SMAIO can now offer its i-Kontrol solution to North American medical centers. These clearances represent a major step in the American market penetration strategy that will be based on the distribution of the comprehensive i-Kontrol solution to key centers invited to participate in training programs called the ""sagittal alignment academy""  as well as on imaging analysis services distributed via NuVasive’s network as soon as the first version of the SMAIO surgery planning software jointly developed with its California partner is approved.Strategy and outlookOver the coming months  and in accordance with the strategy announced at the time of its IPO  the Company will pursue three key objectives:1. The ramping up of the partnership with NuVasive  focusing on the development of a customized version of the i-plan platform for NuVasive and  at the same time  an image analysis service offer.2. The marketing of the i-Kontrol solution in Europe  the United States and Australia. To achieve this  the Company will build on its own sales force  its partner NuVasive in the United States and a network of distributors and agents.3. The development of innovative R&D projects aimed at improving the accuracy  speed and reliability of spine surgery  with morphologically adapted guides 3D-printed from scans of the vertebrae to be operated upon enabling implants to be accurately positioned in the pedicles  or morphologically adapted trackers allowing vertebrae to be detected in space in order to steer them or guide a robotic arm.About SMAIOA precursor in the use of clinical data and imaging of the spine  SMAIO designs global solutions for spine surgery specialists. The Company has recognized expertise thanks to KEOPS  its Big Data management software that has become a global reference with more than 100 000 patient cases documented.SMAIO offers spine surgeons a comprehensive platform  I-Kontrol  incorporating planning  implants and related services  enabling them to treat spinal pathologies in a safe  effective and lasting way.SMAIO is positioned at the forefront of innovation with the ambition of providing surgeons with the first active robotic solution enabling a high level of performance and repeatability to be achieved.Based in Lyon  France  SMAIO benefits from the skill and expertise of more than 30 highly specialized staff.For further information  please visit our website: www.smaio.comListing market: Euronext Growth ParisISIN: FR0014005I80Mnemonic: ALSMADisclaimerThis press release contains non-factual elements  including  but not limited to  certain statements regarding future results and other future events.

The firm will have nearly 12 000 employees  many of them artists based in places such as India.The company is based in Paris  and it has numerous studios around the globe that assist game  film  and advertising companies with art  testing  and other development services. They include award-winning global visual effects (VFX)  animation and gaming studios MPC  The Mill  Mikros Animation and Technicolor Games.“Spinning off is gonna make it a lot easier to move more quickly in this space and really be an advocate with clear a vision ” said Jeaneane Falkler  president of games at Technicolor Creative Studios  in an interview with GamesBeat. “When you have a clear vision for something  it’s easier for people to get behind that. That is to be the first choice production company for the creative space.”Event GamesBeat Summit Next 2022 Join gaming leaders live this October 25-26 in San Francisco to examine the next big opportunities within the gaming industry. Register HereUnder the deal  Technicolor Creative Studios will be publicly traded  and it is distributing 65% of its shares to Technicolor shareholders. The parent company  now called Vantiva  will own 35%.Starting today  Technicolor Creative Studios will trade publicly under the symbol TCHCS on Euronext Paris. Trading is set to start at €1.9539  or $1.88 a share.Going forward  the parent company  formerly Technicolor  comprised of the Connected Home and Vantiva Supply Chain Services divisions  will remain listed on Euronext Paris under its new name of Vantiva and the leadership of its new CEO  Luis Martinez-Amago.Founded in 1915  Technicolor led the film industry with the world’s first exploration of full color and sound motion pictures  developing a series of innovative color film processes in the early 20th century.It is interesting that the parent company is going to relinquish the Technicolor name  which is more than 100 years old  and rename itself Vantiva as it focuses on settop boxes and supply chain services. Technicolor Creative Studios will carry on with the core focus on services for entertainment and advertising.Technicolor GamesTechnicolor Creative Studios focuses on film  games  digital ads and more.Technicolor Games has been around for 15 years. For art  Technicolor Games focuses on services such as making art assets  animations  digital effects  lighting  and rigging. It also provides game testing services  and it has worked with companies such as Electronic Arts  Rockstar Games  and 2K. The game division has more than 670 people with more coming on board.“We’re coming back to the roots of our iconic brand ” Falkler said.Falkler said many people are still working  but as people go back to work Technology Creative Studios will create a new office in Culver City where its focus on Hollywood projects can be be more visible.“Technicolor Games is really much more of a startup and it is growing quickly ” Falkler said.Falkler said that the convergence of games  film  and advertising is continuing into a kind of transmedia (yes  it’s an old buzzword but it kind of fits). In the digital age  the same tools are being used to create these different kinds of content  and it’s only going to get more entangled with the metaverse.“Transmedia used to be an outdated term  but I guess it’s made its way back in ” Falkler said. “When you look at companies that can take an intellectual property across a game and film and episodic and digital advertising  there is really no other one company that can do that the way that Technicolor can. I think that is a key. For me running the game team  it’s a key differentiator.”The creative technology brand later acquired leading VFX studios MPC  The Mill and Mikros Animation in addition to establishing Technicolor Games. These four studios now operate under the new brand name  Technicolor Creative Studios  to focus on growth in the entertainment and advertising markets.“We’re actually seeing a lot of interest in the market as there are a couple of companies that we’re working with right now that are actually building a game while at the same time also focusing that same IP on film and episodic ” Falkler said.MPC has worked on films like Harry Potter  Cruella  Top Gun Maverick  and Sonic The Hedgehog. The game division has worked on a wide variety of games  while The Mill is focused on digital advertising.“There is potential to work together on things that nobody else can really do ” she said.Technicolor Games president Jeaneane Falkler.“My ambition is to build the world’s most successful visual arts company ” said Christian Roberton  CEO of Technicolor Creative Studios  in a statement. “We believe our legacy for innovation and creativity is our foundation for the future  and the success of our studios will rely on continued investment in cutting-edge technology  the world’s best talent and our ongoing relationships with major entertainment studios and brands. The next chapter as an independent company will be pivotal in our growth and evolution.”Technicolor Creative Studios has a rich legacy for innovation in the entertainment and advertising industries. Major projects include Academy Award Winning features  Gladiator  1917  The Jungle Book and Life of Pi  as well as recent blockbusters Ghostbusters: Afterlife  Nope and Disney’s new live-action iteration of Pinocchio.The company’s animation division is credited with the world’s most recognizable animation intellectual properties including SpongeBob SquarePants and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The advertising and brand experience studio The Mill  has earned over 500 awards and accolades across its 30-year history in brand marketing  consistently producing work for the world’s most notable brands from iconic Super Bowl commercials to globally renowned campaigns.Technicolor Creative Studios CEO Christian Roberton will be joined by an executive committee of seasoned industry professionals leading the business.The studio presidents include Tom Williams  Josh Mandel  Andrea Miloro and Jeaneane Falkler. Additional executive committee appointees include Laurent Carozzi as CFO  Niki Steel as chief people officer  Mark Hardy as CMO and Nathan Wappet as COO.Technicolor Creative Studios worked on The Lion King.One of the world’s largest visual arts providers  Technicolor Creative Studios’ ambition is to become the first-choice production partner for the world’s most successful entertainment companies and brands. Each studio in the network will be powered by shared technologies  creative talent  R&D  and investment in future platforms. The studios have the structural power to provide clients content solutions across their IP journey  from film development to in-game assets and marketing materials.The primary goal of the new Technicolor Creative Studios structure is to provide each of its subsidiary brands and their respective clients with the infrastructure needed to consistently deliver the best creative output.Technicolor creative studios is home to more than 11 700 employees across 11 countries  with plans to continue growing into 2023 to meet market demand across all its verticals.The new structure and collaborative vision will be cemented further with a Technicolor Creative Studios campus opening this year in Los Angeles Culver City  which will host all studio brands under one roof  with the addition of a bespoke Virtual Production stage and Creators Hub.Technicolor teams worked on Sonic the Hedgehog.By being fully independent  Technicolor Creative Studios is taking a strategic step to extend its leadership and expand into new and scalable markets  capitalizing on the burgeoning global demand for VFX and animated content.“There has never been a more exciting time for the games industry  and the Technicolor Creative Studios spin-off allows us to invest even more in growing the Technicolor Games footprint  talent roster and suite of service lines ” said Falkler. “There is a growing client demand for content that blurs the lines between gaming  entertainment and marketing that we are perfectly placed to deliver and collaborate on alongside The Mill  MPC and Mikros Animation. As part of this network of creative studios  we will provide a suite of in-house full-service production across games IP  from in-game assets to feature-length film. There is no other brand that can deliver content of the scale  breadth and artistry that the historic Technicolor brand name is synonymous with.”I asked if it was a tough time for gaming now that there is a general downturn in the world economy. Falkler said that when there is an economic downturn  a lot of companies  gaming included  will tend to outsource more of their operations.“When times are good  they typically pull it in because they can have more control or better quality ” she said. “But in a downturn  they tend to outsource.”Falkler said it may become easier to hire people in a recession  but she noted that for multiple years hiring great talent has always been a challenge and it may continue to be so. As for the trend toward acquisitions  Technicolor Creative Studios hasn’t really done much of that  as it focuses on organic growth. But it may identify targets as times change going forward.,negative,0.04,0.42,0.53,mixed,0.57,0.32,0.11,True,English,"['Technicolor Creative Studios', 'public company', 'heavy focus', '$1B value', 'games', 'Vantiva Supply Chain Services divisions', 'award-winning global visual effects', 'first choice production company', 'Paris Euronext Stock Exchange', 'innovative color film processes', 'successful visual a', 'next big opportunities', 'sound motion pictures', 'early 20th century', 'Top Gun Maverick', 'other development services', 'Technology Creative Studios', 'standalone public company', 'other one company', 'creative technology brand', 'Sonic The Hedgehog', 'multimedia services company', 'Technicolor Creative Studios', 'leading VFX studios', 'Event GamesBeat Summit', 'new brand name', 'game testing services', 'Technicolor Games president', 'global network', 'first exploration', 'full color', 'digital effects', 'Euronext Paris', 'numerous studios', 'four studios', 'iconic brand', 'Technicolor name', 'new name', 'gaming studios', 'parent company', 'creative space', 'Technicolor shareholders', 'The Mill', 'new CEO', 'new office', 'emerging parts', 'San Francisco', 'Connected Home', 'Luis Martinez-Amago', 'settop boxes', 'digital ads', 'Electronic Arts', 'Culver City', 'Hollywood projects', 'old buzzword', 'digital age', 'same tools', 'different kinds', 'outdated term', 'intellectual property', 'same time', 'same IP', 'Harry Potter', 'wide variety', 'gaming executives', 'gaming leaders', 'game division', 'game team', 'Rockstar Games', 'digital advertising', 'advertising markets', 'Mikros Animation', 'feature film', 'gaming industry', 'parent firm', 'clear vision', 'core focus', 'key differentiator', 'film industry', 'art assets', 'Jeaneane Falkler', 'many people', 'advertising content', 'advertising companies', '670 people', 'Register', 'valuation', 'creation', 'episodic', '12,000 employees', 'artists', 'places', 'India', 'globe', 'MPC', 'advocate', 'interview', 'something', 'deal', 'shares', 'symbol', 'TCHCS', 'Trading', 'leadership', 'world', 'series', 'entertainment', '15 years', 'animations', 'lighting', 'rigging', '2K.', 'board', 'roots', 'startup', 'convergence', 'transmedia', 'metaverse', 'addition', 'growth', 'lot', 'interest', 'couple', 'films', 'Cruella', 'things', 'ambition']",2022-09-27,2022-09-27,venturebeat.com
