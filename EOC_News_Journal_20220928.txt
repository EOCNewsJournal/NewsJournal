If resolved  an announcement on India's inclusion could come early next year  they said. The sources did not want to be named as they are not allowed to speak to the media.India's finance ministry and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.GLOBAL AMBITIONNews of the likely delay in the inclusion process saw the Indian rupee turn lower  while yields on the government's benchmark bonds - which move inversely to price - rose to 7.37% from the day's low of 7.27%.Even once New Delhi gets the green light it will still require time for the inclusion process to start due to the sheer scale of the Indian bond market and the preparation time investors will need.India has sought to be included in global bond indexes since 2013  but that ambition has been held up by a number of factors.JPMorgan  whose GBI-EM index is tracked by an estimated $240 billion of funds globally  only began considering India's inclusion in its global bond index in 2021  a year after it began including China yuan-denominated debt.If successful  India would be the last major emerging market to be added to the JPMorgan index. It could see investors pump $30 billion into India's bond market within 10 months and between $170 billion and $250 billion over the next decade  Morgan Stanley has estimated.While most of JPMorgan's investors are in favour of including India in the GBI-EM index  many think issues such as investor verification and settlement rules need to be ironed out first  three of the sources said.India is opposed to providing any capital gains tax waivers to overseas debt investors and wants global bond index operators to consider the local settlement of its government securities if they are included in their indexes  according to two separate Reuters reports.""It is not insurmountable  but right now there is no transparency on how a capital gains tax would be calculated or levied  so we wouldn't be surprised if there was a delay (in a decision) "" said Jennifer Taylor  head of emerging market debt at State Street.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Aftab Ahmed  Selena Li in Hong Kong  and Marc Jones in London; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Richard PullinOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.03,0.9,0.07,negative,0.01,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['key govt bond index', 'next year', 'India', 'inclusion', 'sources', 'Reuters', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'influential emerging market debt index', 'Ana Nicolaci da Costa', 'last major emerging market', 'two separate Reuters reports', 'capital gains tax waivers', 'global bond index operators', 'local bond settlement rules', 'Indian bond market', 'FREE unlimited access', 'Reuters.com Register', 'tax treatment criteria', 'onshore bond settlement', 'international settlement platforms', 'large global fund', 'China yuan-denominated debt', 'global bond indexes', 'overseas debt investors', 'NEW DELHI/HONG KONG', 'Indian government bonds', 'local settlement', 'tax complexities', ""Reuters' request"", 'index experts', 'GBI-EM index', 'Indian rupee', 'fund manager', 'GLOBAL AMBITION', 'Index investors', 'long wait', 'green light', 'domestic ownership', 'Belgium-based firm', 'finance ministry', 'benchmark bonds', 'sheer scale', 'next decade', 'Morgan Stanley', 'investor verification', 'Jennifer Taylor', 'State Street', 'Aftab Ahmed', 'Selena Li', 'Marc Jones', 'Richard Pullin', 'JPMorgan index', 'government securities', 'next year', 'money managers', 'foreign investors', 'Reserve Bank', 'likely delay', 'preparation time', 'growing number', 'inclusion process', 'operational issues', 'four sources', 'matter', 'views', 'August', 'consultation', 'ejection', 'Russia', 'purchases', 'caps', 'way', 'Euroclear', 'sights', 'approach', 'end', 'announcement', 'media', 'comment', 'News', 'yields', 'price', 'day', 'factors', 'funds', '10 months', 'favour', 'transparency', 'decision', 'head', 'Reporting', 'London', 'Editing', 'Standards']",2022-09-27,2022-09-28,reuters.com

Index investors tend to favour international settlement platforms such as Euroclear but India has said it wants to settle bonds onshore  like China.""India is working to get its bonds included but operationally it is not ready "" one of the sources said.The government and the Reserve Bank of India are expected to sort out some of these issues by the end of 2022  said two of the sources. If resolved  an announcement on India's inclusion could come early next year  they said. The sources did not want to be named as they are not allowed to speak to the media.India's finance ministry and did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.GLOBAL AMBITIONIndia has sought to be included in global bond indexes since 2013  but that ambition has been held up by a number of factors over the years  and JP Morgan only began considering India's inclusion in its global bond index in 2021.If successful  India would be the last major emerging market to be added to the JP Morgan index.Its inclusion could result in additional flows of as much as $30 billion within 10 months into the bond market  Morgan Stanley estimated earlier this month.Last year  Morgan Stanley predicted that it could generate $170 billion to $250 billion of inflows over the next decade.Most of JPMorgan's index investors are in favour of including India in the index  but think issues such as investor verification and settlement rules need to be ironed out first  three of the sources said.India is opposed to providing any capital gains tax waivers to overseas debt investors and wants global bond index operators to consider the local settlement of its government securities if they are included in their indexes  according to two separate Reuters reports.""It is not insurmountable  but right now there is no transparency on how a capital gains tax would be calculated or levied  so we wouldn't be surprised if there was a delay "" said Jennifer Taylor  head of emerging market at State Street.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",neutral,0.06,0.86,0.09,negative,0.01,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['key govt bond index', 'next year', 'India', 'inclusion', 'Report', 'two separate Reuters reports', 'last major emerging market', 'capital gains tax waivers', 'emerging market global index', 'Local bond settlement rules', 'global bond index operators', 'Business Standard staff', 'international settlement platforms', 'large global fund', 'global bond indexes', 'overseas debt investors', 'various operational issues', 'JP Morgan index', 'bond market', 'local settlement', 'tax complexities', ""Reuters' request"", 'GLOBAL AMBITION', 'fund manager', 'Index investors', 'Morgan Stanley', 'New Delhi', 'investment cap', 'Reserve Bank', 'finance ministry', 'additional flows', 'next decade', 'investor verification', 'Jennifer Taylor', 'State Street', 'syndicated feed', 'foreign investors', 'government securities', 'four sources', 'Indian', 'matter', 'decision', 'month', 'composition', 'Russia', 'purchases', 'way', 'dollars', 'Euroclear', 'bonds', 'China', 'end', 'announcement', 'inclusion', 'media', 'comment', 'number', 'factors', 'years', 'inflows', 'JPMorgan', 'favour', 'transparency', 'delay', 'head', 'picture', 'rest', 'content']",2022-09-27,2022-09-28,business-standard.com

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  t…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  today announces its first half 2022 financial and operating results.The Company’s financial and operating highlights include the following:Clinical Development:In September 2022  ONWARD reported positive top-line results from its pivotal study evaluating the ability of ARC-EX to improve arm and hand function in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).In June 2022  enrollment completed in the LIFT Home study  evaluating ARC-EX in the home setting  with 17 participants at 5 leading research centers across the United States.In May 2022  the first patient was enrolled in the HemON feasibility study  a precursor to the upcoming planned pivotal trial with ARC-IM for blood pressure and trunk control. This was the first time that the Company’s ARC-IM implantable pulse generator (IPG) was used in a human.Financial:ONWARD reported an operating loss of EUR 15 1 million for the first six months of 2022 compared to EUR 9 3 million in the same period of 2021.The Company ended the six-month period with a positive cash balance of EUR 76 8 million (31 December 2021: EUR 89 4 million). The decrease in cash of EUR 12 6 million compared to 31 December 2021 is due to cash outflows mainly for operating activities.Management reiterated its guidance of a cash runway through the end of 2024.Corporate:In March 2022  the Company was added to Euronext Brussels’ BEL Small Index.In April  Bryan  Garnier & Co  a leading investment bank focused on growth companies  initiated research coverage on the Company with a buy rating and target price of EUR 17 00 per share.The Company hired Zouhir Mechta as Vice President Operations in May 2022 and Lara Smith Weber as Chief Financial Officer in June 2022.In June 2022  former Alcon and Medtronic executive  Kristina Dziekan  was appointed to the Board of Directors  bringing extensive experience in market access and reimbursement across global markets and specific industry experience in neuromodulation.Science & Intellectual Property:From January to June 2022  the Company added 24 patents to its IP portfolio  now totaling over 330 issued and pending patents covering a broad range of technologies and activities.In February 2022  results of the STIMO study  which highlighted the use of ARC-IM Therapy to enable people with even the most severe forms of spinal cord injury to stand and walk again  were published in the journal Nature Medicine and highlighted in major media outlets around the globe.In March 2022  the Company reported that it had obtained rights to breakthrough innovations in brain-spine interface and Parkinson’s disease from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV).In April 2022  the New England Journal of Medicine highlighted the use of ONWARD’s innovative approach to treating orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure) in a patient with MSA-P  a form of Parkinson’s disease that affects the sympathetic nervous system.In June 2022  research published in Nature Neuroscience showed the potential for ONWARD’s ARC-IM Therapy to restore movement and function in hands and arms after spinal cord injury.“In the first half of 2022  we continued to execute against our strategy – advancing development of our technology  enlarging our IP portfolio  validating our therapies through clinical milestones  and strengthening our organizational capabilities ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We are very pleased with the excellent results from the Up-LIFT study that we announced earlier this month and are now focusing on preparing regulatory submissions for ARC-EX. We are hopeful we can begin to positively impact the lives of people with spinal cord injury sometime during the second half of 2023.”“We expect our current cash to propel operations through the end of 2024 and support our planned investments in product development  clinical trials  operational capabilities  and commercial launch in 2023 ” commented Lara Smith Weber  CFO of ONWARD. “ONWARD is well prepared for its next chapter as a commercial organization  and we are ready to grow the Company in the years ahead for the benefit of our stakeholders.”First Half 2022 Financial Summary:In EUR millions For the six-month period ended June 30  2022 2021 Total Revenues & Other Income 1 0 0 6 Total Operating Expenses (16 1) (9 8) Operating Loss for the Period (15 1) (9 3) Net Finance Expenses (0 9) (2 9) Income Tax Expenses (0 0) (0 0) Net Loss for the Period (16 0) (12 2) Basic (and diluted) Earnings per Share (in EUR) (0 53) (3 14) At 30 June 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Cash position at the end of the period 76 8 89 4 Interest Bearing Loans (12 0) (11 5) Equity 68 9 82 7Total Revenues & Other IncomeOther Income during the first six months of 2022 increased to EUR 1 0 million (H1 2021: EUR 0 6 million)  following a new grant from the European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA) focusing on brain-spine interfaces to reverse upper- and lower-limb paralysis.Total Operating ExpensesTotal Operating Expenses increased during H1 2022 by EUR 6 3 million to EUR 16 1 million. The increase in operating expenses included EUR 2 9 million of additional Research & Development Expenses  driven by increased staff and outsourced development expenses associated with the Company’s ARC Therapies. It also included clinical expenses of EUR 3 0 million  an increase of EUR 1 1 million compared to the same period in the prior year  as a result of the Up-LIFT and LIFT Home studies. Lastly  General & Administrative Expenses showed an increase of EUR 1 6 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to the costs associated with being a public company following the Euronext listing in October 2021.Net Finance ExpenseNet Finance Expense decreased during the first six months of 2022 by EUR 2 million compared to H1 2021. The costs in H1 2021 included interest on the Company’s innovation loan from RVO NL (Dutch government)  the convertible loan (CLA)  and the accrued dividend for the preference A shares. Both the CLA and preference A shares converted in October 2021. The expense for H1 2022 relates to the innovation loan from RVO NL and bank interest paid on the positive cash balance.Cash PositionThe Company ended the six-month period with a positive cash balance of EUR 76 8 million on 30 June 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 89 4 million). The decrease in cash of EUR 12 6 million compared to 31 December 2021 is due to cash outflows mainly for operating activities.Interest-bearing LoansInterest-bearing Loans increased from 31 December 2021 by EUR 0 5 million to EUR 12 million  due to the interest that accumulated on the innovation loan from RVO NL (Dutch government).EquityThe Company’s positive Equity position of EUR 82 7 million at year-end 2021 decreased to EUR 68 9 million on 30 June 2022. The decrease related to the operating loss for the period of EUR 16 million  mitigated by positive reserve items related to the share-based payment expense of EUR 0 8 million  the revaluation of defined benefit obligation through comprehensive income of EUR 0 7 million  and the foreign currency translation impact of U.S. operations of EUR 0 6 million.OutlookONWARD’s management expects to continue the steady and consistent execution of its strategy in the second half of 2022 and beyond.Following positive top-line data from its first pivotal study  Up-LIFT  ONWARD announced plans to submit for regulatory approval in the US and EU late this year or in early 2023 to allow the Company to commercialize ARC-EX for the improvement of upper extremity strength and function in patients with SCI. These authorizations are expected in the second half of 2023.In the second half of 2022  top-line data from the LIFT Home study are expected. The Company plans to discuss findings from LIFT Home with regulatory authorities to determine the requirements to gain clearance to market ARC-EX for home use  including the design and scope of a potential pivotal study for the home setting  should this be necessary.Also in the second half of 2022  the Company expects to release combined top-line data from the STIMO-HEMO and HemON studies. Both studies are exploring the use of ARC-IM Therapy to normalize low blood pressure and provide enhanced trunk control in people with SCI  which is the first planned indication for ARC-IM. By year-end  ONWARD therefore expects to have released top-line data from its pivotal study for ARC-EX and top-line data from current clinical feasibility studies for ARC-IM  providing important clinical validation of both of its major technology platforms.The Company expects to continue building its team and capabilities in preparation for launch of its ARC-EX Therapy in the second half of 2023  both operationally and commercially. In late 2022 or early 2023  ONWARD plans to place even greater focus on recruiting for sales  marketing  and field service roles to cover the US and select European markets.Organizational enhancements extend to the Company’s Board of Directors  which this September added Vivian Riefberg  a highly accomplished expert in healthcare  government  and strategy. In 2020  Ms. Riefberg retired as a senior partner with McKinsey & Company  where she held a variety of senior positions  including leader of the Public Sector Practice for the Americas and co-leader of the U.S. Healthcare practice. She served on McKinsey & Company’s global board of directors and on the committee evaluating and developing global partners. Ms. Riefberg is currently Professor of Practice at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business where she holds the David C. Walentas Jefferson Scholars Chair.With a strong balance sheet  the current cash position is expected to be sufficient to finance operations through the end of 2024 and support investments in product development  clinical trials  operational capabilities  and commercial launch. ONWARD continues to consider opportunities to further strengthen its cash position as equity capital markets improve in the U.S. and around the globe.Conference Call & WebcastONWARD will host a conference call with live webcast today at 4 pm CET / 10 am EDT. The webcast may be accessed on the News and Events page of the Company’s website or by clicking here.

Our differentiated approach through the Benevolent Platform™ empowers creativity and innovation in drug discovery and development. This approach has generated a growing in-house pipeline of 13 named drug programmes and over 10 exploratory programmes while supporting successful commercial collaborations with AstraZeneca and leading global research and charitable institutions.The Benevolent Platform™ is a validated AI-enabled hypothesis-driven platform that powers high-confidence drug discovery. It is disease and modality-agnostic and capable of rapidly generating novel targets at scale. Our corporate strategy to date has been to leverage the Benevolent Platform™ to identify novel drug targets across a range of different therapeutic areas with the aim to reduce time and cost and improve the probability of clinical success compared to industry standards.Following a strategic review completed during the period by the Board  the Company will now look to focus its in-house pipeline on three specific therapy areas: immunology  oncology and neurology. This focused approach to our strategy will allow us to take forward assets where we have the right capabilities to successfully develop and  in the future  potentially commercialise with or without a partner. Subsequently  at an appropriate time  we will look to out-licence assets in therapeutic areas requiring larger and more complex clinical trials or in areas where we do not have the optimal internal capabilities to develop further.Over the period  we have invested in expanding our expertise by increasing headcount to over 350. Anticipated hiring will be weighted towards drug discovery and development  with a particular focus on enhanced clinical capability.The following highlights the progress across our lead in-house clinical and preclinical pipeline assets and the continuous enhancement of the Benevolent Platform™.BEN-2293 - topical best-in-class PanTrk inhibitor in development to relieve inflammation and rapidly resolve itch in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD): Phase IIa data expected in 2023BEN-2293 is a drug candidate being explored as a treatment for mild and moderate atopic dermatitis  with the potential to be explored within severe atopic dermatitis. The molecule is an inhibitor of three tropomyosin receptor kinases (“Trk”)  TrkA  TrkB and TrkC.The Company is currently progressing a Phase Ib/IIa double-blind  placebo-controlled  first-in-human  two-part clinical study to investigate the safety  tolerability  PK and efficacy of repeat topical dosing of BEN2293 in 90 patients with mild to moderate AD. The Phase Ib portion of the study in 32 patients was successfully completed in December 2021. The Phase IIa portion in 90 patients is set to complete by end-2022 with data expected in Q1 2023. Efficacy measures incorporated in the study included changes to the eczema area severity index (EASI)  affected body surface area (BSA)  a validated investigator global assessment (vIGA-AD)  a NRS itch scale  time to itch reduction and quality of life questionnaires.The Benevolent Platform™ identified the role of the Trk receptors as mediators of both itch and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. Applying expertise in molecular design  we were able to design potent and selective inhibitors specifically of the three Trk receptors with high selectivity. We believe that BEN-2293 has the potential to demonstrate efficacy against both itch and inflammation with fewer side effects than steroid creams and various inhibitor treatments that are currently the dominant forms of treatment for this chronic condition.If BEN-2293 successfully completes this clinical trial  our intention is to partner this asset with a pharmaceutical company that has a focus in dermatology for continued clinical development and  if approved  commercialisation. The addressable market for atopic dermatitis is forecast to exceed $14bn1 in the seven major markets by 2028.BenevolentAI has filed for formulation and composition of matter patents covering BEN-2293.BEN-8744 is an orally administered  peripherally-restricted  PDE10 inhibitor under development as a first-in-class treatment for refractory ulcerative colitis (UC)IND-enabling studies are ongoing  and a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) is scheduled to be filed by late 2022  with the Phase I trial anticipated to start in early 2023.The Benevolent Platform™ identified PDE10 as an entirely novel target for the treatment of UC – there was no previously known link between PDE10 and UC or other related inflammatory conditions. The target was experimentally validated in ex vivo UC colon samples from patients with active UC  allowing BenevolentAI to demonstrate efficacious target enzyme inhibition. Accordingly  we will look to demonstrate that BEN-8744 is effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe cases of UC and with fewer side effects than the anti-TNF and JAK inhibitors that are currently the dominant form of treatment for this disease.Our aim is to progress BEN-8744 through clinical trials and retain commercial rights to this asset in-house. The combination of high and growing disease prevalence  improved diagnosis  high treatments rates and the existence of numerous drugs in the development pipeline  together with the need for better treatments  is driving a market that is forecast to exceed US$7.8 billion by 20262.BenevolentAI has filed for second medical use and composition of matters patents in respect of BEN-8744.BEN-9160 is an orally administered  brain-penetrant asset we are developing as a best-in-class treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosisBEN-9160 is a c-Abl inhibitor. Preclinical safety  drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (“DMPK”) studies were completed in 2022. IND-enabling studies are expected to start Q1 2023  pending read out of an in-vivo efficacy model. Subject to positive data the asset will then be ready for Phase I studies in 2024.The Benevolent Platform™ identified the c-Abl enzyme as a target for the treatment of ALS. C-Abl inhibitors had previously been studied primarily in the context of cancer treatments  but in vitro ALS models indicate that BEN-9160 also has the potential to be significantly neuroprotective  and we hope to demonstrate the drug candidate’s efficacy in delaying the progression of ALS in our planned clinical development programme.BenevolentAI has filed for composition of matter patents covering BEN-9160.BEN-28010 is an orally administered asset we are developing as a best-in-class treatment for glioblastoma multiformeThis asset was declared a clinical candidate  post period  in July 2022 with preparation for IND-enabling studies ongoing. Subject to positive data the asset will then be ready for Phase I studies in 2024.BenevolentAI has filed a number of patents covering BEN-28010.Earlier stage pipeline assetsAcross the rest of the pipeline we continue to see good progress  with two assets progressing into lead optimisation in the period and a further two assets expected to enter lead optimisation in the second half of 2022. We have also started two new drug programs in the period  with a further two-to-four expected to enter our pipeline in the second half of 2022 and with all targets generated from the Benevolent Platform™.Continuous enhancement of the Benevolent Platform™The Benevolent Platform™ powers a growing pipeline of in-house assets and collaborations. The platform is an AI-enabled  hypothesis-driven drug discovery methodology that draws on a multi-modal biomedical knowledge base and enables scientists to explore underlying disease mechanisms and objectively identify potential novel drug targets.The platform improves predictions by running repeatable  reproducible processes at scale and continuously learns from insights generated from experimental data generated from the Company’s wet-laboratory facilities and AI models. The impact this continuous learning loop has on our platform increases over time  enabling the company to further enhance target identification and accelerate end-to-end drug discovery.The BenevolentAI Data Foundations sits at the core of our Platform and drug discovery programmes and is built on the foundations of all publicly relevant biomedical data mined from structured sources and language data  including scientific and patent literature  regulatory documents and primary human data  as well as third-party proprietary data and our in-house experimental data. The Knowledge Graph is constantly enriched to supply a comprehensive representation of biomedical data. Our exploratory tools and predictive models empower scientists to explore relationships in the graph between biological entities and disease networks.We continue to grow and enrich our Data Foundations with new and generated insights primarily due to an increase in patient-level data (‘omics) and enhanced natural language processing (NLP) recall. This led to an increase of over 250% in relationship volume in the Knowledge Graph from June 2021 to August 2022 (46% of which is proprietary to BenevolentAI) albeit we expect this growth rate to moderate in future years. The Knowledge Graph continues to evolve  and a new version was launched during the period to enhance the recall of facts from scientific literature  supporting more nuance and specificity in our biological relationships.Beyond our data representation  our AI tools for scientists and predictive algorithms have improved at pace. Extensions and enhancements to our existing suite of tools have been completed that allow for novel targets best prosecuted by alternative modalities for example  monoclonal antibodies. We have also introduced a large language model (LLM) approach for our tools for more sophisticated reasoning.Business modelThe Company’s flexible business model allows for different approaches to drug discovery and development  which can be tailored to suit each individual programme. It can out-license drug candidates at different stages of clinical development and  therefore  adjust the required level of funding over time. Furthermore  with a validated platform that is agnostic to therapeutic area and drug modality  we can select the opportunities with the most attractive value creation potential.The Company will now seek to develop further and then partner and/or commercialise pipeline assets in the following three disease areas: immunology  oncology and neurology. In all other disease areas assets would be out licensed prior to entering the clinic.In addition to our in-house pipeline  we will also target a small number of additional platform collaborations  similar to those with AstraZeneca. This would provide non-dilutive funding  further validate our platform and  importantly  allow us to leverage the data generated to enhance our Knowledge Graph to the benefit of our in-house pipeline.We expect to generate revenue broadly from three streams:Out-licence revenue: For some drug programmes  we will choose to out-licence to partners  who will then assume responsibility for some or all of the remaining clinical development and commercialisation. At the point of out-licensing each drug candidate  we expect to receive an up-front payment and then to receive milestone payments upon successfully completing various clinical  regulatory and/or sales milestones by the licensor. In addition  we would expect to receive royalty payments on the net sales of the out-licensed drugs.For some drug programmes  we will choose to out-licence to partners  who will then assume responsibility for some or all of the remaining clinical development and commercialisation.

In addition  we would expect to receive royalty payments on the net sales of the out-licensed drugs. Platform collaboration revenue: We may receive upfront payments  research funding  milestones and royalties from platform collaborations. Platform collaborations are where we work with a partner to identify new drug targets using the Benevolent Platform™. This includes the current collaboration with AstraZeneca  which began in 2019 and has recently been extended until 2025. The AstraZeneca collaboration has been a primary driver of revenue over the past three years.We may receive upfront payments  research funding  milestones and royalties from platform collaborations.

The AstraZeneca collaboration has been a primary driver of revenue over the past three years. Product sales from self-commercialised assets: We intend to commercialise certain drugs discovered using the Benevolent Platform™. Our first product launch is targeted for the second half of this decade or shortly thereafter  and we plan to build all the necessary infrastructure to successfully launch and commercialise our drugs globally.OutlookOur listing in April 2022 has strengthened our financial position and will enable us to enhance our leadership in the AI drug discovery sector. We believe that our scalable Benevolent Platform™ will transform understanding of disease biology and help us uncover novel treatment approaches faster  and with a higher probability of clinical success.Due to the flexibility and disease agnostic capability of the Benevolent Platform™  we aim to monetise our technology in three ways  as outlined below  to increase shareholder returns over the coming periods.Our primary focus will be to independently pursue the clinical development of certain in-house pipeline assets in a number of selected core therapeutic areas  identified as immunology  oncology and neurology  before either commercialising these in-house or with partners. Our lead asset for this approach is BEN-8744 for ulcerative colitis  which will enter Phase 1 first in human trials in 2023. We will out-license pipeline assets that do not fit within these new target indications at selective times to maximise value. Our lead asset for this approach is BEN-2293  which we will aim to out-license in 2023 post Phase 2 data. Lastly  we will endeavour to enter additional strategic collaborations to leverage our disease agnostic capabilities into therapeutic indications outside our focus areas.By the end of 2022  excluding early discovery programmes  BenevolentAI expects to have initiated 17 named drug programmes and  in 2023  expects to add between four and six named drug programmes. In addition  BenevolentAI will aim to progress one to two CTA/IND-stage drug candidates every year  not including assets taken forward by collaboration partners. This target number could increase if funding allows due to the scalability of our platform.BenevolentAI is well-funded with several value inflection points both in the near and medium term  providing a solid platform to fulfil our mission of delivering life-changing medicines to patients.Joanna ShieldsChief Executive Officer27 September 2022FINANCIAL REVIEWBusiness combinationOn 22 April 2022  Odyssey SPAC and BenevolentAI Limited (the former parent company of the BAI Group before the Business Combination (“Transaction”))  entered into a business combination agreement by way of contribution of all shares in BenevolentAI Limited into Odyssey SPAC in exchange for the issuance of new ordinary shares. The Transaction was completed on 22 April 2022 and resulted in changing the name of the Group’s new holding company from Odyssey Acquisition S.A. to BenevolentAI (the “Group”).As part of the overall Transaction an equity fundraise via a private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) and backstop arrangement was concluded  where the Group received at closing a cash flow of £177.9 million  with transaction costs reflected in the P & L for the period of £79.3 million. As part of the Transaction related costs the Group incurred a non-cash  non-recurring listing service expense of £65.4 million  professional and bank fees of £11.3 million and share-based payment expenses of £2.6 million  which have been removed from the reported normalised operating loss to more accurately reflect the Group’s underlying performance for the six months ended 30 June 2022. Other costs related to the Transaction are reflected in the opening reserves of the merged Odyssey SPAC entity (brought into the Group as at 22 April 2022  retranslated from EUR to GBP using at a 0.8302 exchange rate)  or were expensed as incurred in the 2021 year end under each corresponding entity.Through the Transaction  warrant liabilities were also acquired by the Group. These had been previously issued by Odyssey SPAC  and recognised as liabilities  with that treatment continuing through the reported period due to precedent accounting requiring liability treatment where a warrant is denominated in a currency other than that of the functional currency. The warrants were revalued at closing of the transaction (£18.1 million) and are revalued at each reporting period end  with the fair value as at 30 June 2022 of £12.0 million  with £6.1 million recognised as finance income.RevenuesThe Groups’ revenues have increased by £3.1 million to £4.8 million (H1 2021: £1.7 million) with the majority reflecting a second AI-enabled drug discovery collaboration with AstraZeneca starting in January 2022  combined with revenue from a one-year extension on the initial AstraZeneca collaboration that began in late 2021 and in H1 a milestone related to the second novel target for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Research and development (R&D) expensesNormalised drug discovery spend  excluding share-based payments  for the first half of 2022 has increased to £19.3 million (H1 2021: £13.0 million)  driven by the BenevolentAI pipeline advancing into later stages of development  in particular BEN-2293 and its progression through an adaptive Phase I/II clinical study.Normalised product and technology spend for the first half of 2022 has increased to £10.7 million (H1 2021: £9.9 million)  due to an increase in staff related costs to support the continued expansion of the Benevolent Platform™.General and administrative costsNormalised business operations spend  excluding share-based payments  for the first half of 2022 has increased to £8.1 million (H1 2021: £7.0 million)  reflecting additional costs related to listing readiness. These costs are expected to stay at these levels given the enhanced level of compliance and reporting obligations.Operating lossNormalised operating loss for the first half of 2022 has increased to £55.3 million (H1 2021: £46.5 million).Finance incomeFinance income for the first half of 2022 has increased to £6.3 million (H1 2021: £10 000). This is predominantly driven by the fair value revaluation of the warrant liabilities acquired through the Transaction  reflecting a decrease in their value as at 30 June 2022 when compared to the Transaction date.TaxationTaxation income for the first half of 2022 has decreased to £3.9 million (H1 2021: £5.7 million). This is predominantly composed of tax credits arising from the UK’s small and medium-sized enterprises R&D tax relief regime  for which the increase on the claim between the two periods  driven by an increase in eligible R&D expenditure  is more than offset by the stamp duty tax payable of £3.7 million arising from the Transaction.Loss per shareNormalised basic loss per share has increased to 47.4p for the first half of 2022 (H1 2021: 45.8p)  with the weighted average number of shares in both periods adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of the share for share exchange completed during the Transaction  such as to reflect the capital structure of the legal parent. The increase reflects the increase in normalised total loss.Current assetsCurrent assets as at 30 June 2022 have increased to £191.8 million (31 December 2021: £56.6 million)  largely driven by a £124.8 million increase in cash.Cash and cash equivalentsThe cash position as at 30 June 2022 has materially strengthened with cash and cash equivalents of £165.3 million (31 December 2021: £40.6 million). This increase is driven by the PIPE  backstop proceeds  Odyssey Acquisition acquired cash  with gross proceeds of £177.9 million and AstraZeneca collaboration proceeds and off-set by the settlement of transaction expenses and ordinary course working capital expenditure.WarrantsWarrants as at 30 June 2022 have increased to £12.0 million (31 December 2021: £nil)  brought in from the Transaction and revalued at the reporting period end.Other current liabilitiesOther current liabilities as at 30 June 2022 have increased to £42.4 million (31 December 2021: £23.7 million)  reflecting an increase in trade payables for Transaction-related expenses that were paid shortly after the Period ended  and an increase in deferred income under the AstraZeneca agreements.Normalised Cash FlowCash expended from operating activities before taxation and Transaction-related items has increased to £45.8 million for the first half of 2022 (H1 2021: £24.8 million)  primarily driven by the increase in normalised operating loss  as well as changes to working capital from outstanding receivables due on the R&D tax credits and AstraZeneca collaboration income receivables.Nicholas KeherChief Financial Officer27 September 2022INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME for the six months ended 30 June Note 2022 2021 Normalised Transaction-related(1) Total Restated(2)Total £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 Revenue 5 4 843 - 4 843 1 664 Gross profit 4 843 - 4 843 1 664 Research and development expenses 6 (36 553) - (36 553) (25 980) Included within research and development expenses: Share-based payment (""SBP"") expenses 6  11 (6 577) - (6 577) (3 083) Administrative expenses 2.2 (23 642) (79 267) (102 909) (22 260) Included within administrative expenses: SBP expenses 2.2  11 (15 568) (2 611) (18 179) (15 260) Other income 72 - 72 74 Operating loss 2.2 (55 280) (79 267) (134 547) (46 502) Finance income 7 195 6 120 6 315 10 Finance expense 8 (257) - (257) (247) Loss before taxation (55 342) (73 147) (128 489) (46 739) Taxation 9 7 637 (3 739) 3 898 5 651 Loss for the period (47 705) (76 886) (124 591) (41 088) Total comprehensive loss for the period (47 705) (76 886) (124 591) (41 088) Basic and diluted loss per share  expressed in pence (123.9p) (45.8p) Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 100 545 304 89 754 538 No dividend has been declared or paid in either reporting period.

(“Odyssey SPAC”)  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company established for the purpose of acquiring a business with principal business operations in Europe or in another geographic area  that is based in the healthcare sector or the TMT (technology  media  telecom) sector or any other sectors. Odyssey SPAC was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on 6 July 2021.On 22 April 2022 (“Closing date”)  Odyssey SPAC and BenevolentAI Limited (the former parent company of the privately held UK group before the business combination (“Transaction”))  entered into a business combination agreement by way of contribution of all shares in BenevolentAI Limited into Odyssey SPAC in exchange for Odyssey SPAC issuing new ordinary shares. The Transaction was completed on 22 April 2022 and the name of the ultimate holding company was changed from Odyssey Acquisition S.A. to BenevolentAI  whose consolidated Group post-closing is referred to as BAI Group.BAI Group is managed by its ultimate parent company BenevolentAI  with the following 5 trading subsidiaries operated under one segment.Registered office address Status Class ofshares held Ownership BenevolentAI Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Bio Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Technology Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Trading Ordinary shares 100% Benevolent Technology Inc(1) Domiciled in USA Trading Ordinary shares 100% BenevolentAI Energy Limited 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Dormant Ordinary shares 100% Stratified Medical Limited(1) 4-8 Maple Street  London W1T 5HD Dormant Ordinary shares 100% (1) Held indirectly2 Accounting policies2.1 Basis of preparationThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. They have been prepared on a historical cost basis  except for financial instruments measured at fair value  and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest £ ‘000.At 30 June 2022  net assets totaled £166.4m  with a cash balance of £165.3 million following the completion of the business combination. Management have reviewed the Group’s cash flow forecasts and believes it has sufficient cash for at least the next twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. The financial statements  therefore  continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.The financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 for both Odyssey Acquisition S.A. and BenevolentAI Limited.The Business Combination between BenevolentAI Limited and Odyssey SPAC is accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2 as a capital reorganisation since Odyssey SPAC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Under this accounting method  Odyssey SPAC is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. The comparatives in the financial statements  therefore  represent the financial information of BenevolentAI Limited and its subsidiaries  both to 30 June 2021 and as at 31 December 2021. The activity and position of the acquired Odyssey SPAC is considered only from the Closing date onwards. That is  the statement of profit and loss contains only the post-acquisition performance of Odyssey SPAC  with the pre-acquisition losses being reflected through reserves. See note 4 for further details.A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and earlier application is permitted; however  the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated Interim financial statements.The consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2022 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Board resolution on 27 September 2022.2.2 Normalised operating lossNormalised operating loss is defined as operating loss excluding expenses related to the business combination for the six months ended 30 June 2022. This is to show an underlying representation of operating losses and cash flows for the respective periods.It is an alternative performance measure (‘APM’) that is not calculated in accordance with IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies’ APMs  including those in the Group’s industry. APMs should be considered in addition to  and are not intended to substitute or supersede  IFRS measures.This APM is in our view an important metric for a biotech company in the development stage. Removing the Transaction-related costs  given their isolated nature  enables users to better compare the Group’s normal operating performance between reporting periods.The following table presents a reconciliation of normalised group operating loss  to the closest IFRS measures  for each of the periods indicated:For the six months ended 30 June Note 2022 2021 £'000 £'000 Reported group operating loss (134 547) (46 502) Adjustments for: Transaction-related expenditure 11 255 - Transaction-related listing service expense 4 65 401 - Transaction-related SBP expenses 11 2 611 - Total Transaction-related items 79 267 - Normalised group operating loss (55 280) (46 502)2.3 Change in functional currency of BenevolentAIAs of 22 April 2022  management reviewed the functional currency of BenevolentAI and the presentation currency of the Group. The change in functional currency  for standalone BenevolentAI was made to reflect that GBP has become the predominant operating currency for the Company representing a significant part of its cash flows and its operating environment  while the Group presentation currency remains in GBP consistent with the prior year.The Group presents as comparative information the financial information of the former BenevolentAI Limited Group  which had GBP as its functional and presentation currency. Comparative information  therefore  has not been re-stated following this change to BenevolentAI’s functional currency.3 Critical accounting estimates and judgementsThe consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the application of the chosen accounting policies requires management to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The estimates and the underlying assumptions are subject to continuous review. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments  however  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.In preparing these condensed interim financial statements  the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimate uncertainty are:Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe amount of goodwill and intangible assets initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based  to a considerable extent  on management’s judgement and based on industry benchmarks and information relevant to the specific assets in focus.The carrying value of goodwill and intangibles requires the assessment of discounted future cashflows of the future economic value of the underlying assets. The assumptions and critical judgement required from management is inherently uncertain though based on recognised industry methods of evaluating drug programme assets and companies undertaking drug discovery activities.Management used industry practice in its method of evaluating the estimate of future revenue streams of drug programmes  associated costs together with market data for the therapeutic areas of interest  discount rates for cost of capital  risk factors including probabilities of progressing a candidate to commercialisation or earlier partnering of a programme and other relevant factors.Management have further considered the positive progress identified to date from the acquisition of BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited with value anticipated to arise from already identified specific programmes in addition to the ongoing value creation from the underlying assets.Share-based payments provisionThe Group operates an unapproved Share Option Plan. All employees are offered options upon joining the Group. The fair value of share options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model at each reporting date taking into account various assumptions detailed in note 12. The full charge of the vested options during the half year is recognised in the profit and loss.Classification of Class A Warrants and B WarrantsAs part of the Business Combination transaction  BAI Group took on warrants which had been initially issued by Odyssey SPAC prior to the Transaction  as part of financing Odyssey SPAC’s working capital and investment.A derivative  other than a derivative that meets the definition of an equity instrument  is initially recognised as a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into  and the related transaction costs are expensed. The fair values of the derivatives are remeasured at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair values recognised in net income or loss.A derivative that will be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash in terms of its functional currency or another financial asset is classified and presented as an equity instrument  rather than a financial liability. The exercise price of the Company's share purchase warrants that are exercisable into common shares is denominated in EUR  however  the Company will receive a variable amount of cash in terms of its GBP functional currency upon exercise of the warrants due to movements in foreign exchange.Accordingly  the Company's warrants are classified and presented as derivative financial liabilities and measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of each warrant class is determined at each reporting date and exercise date and is based on quoted market prices  where available  or independently valued using Binomial Tree method and the Monte Carlo method. This is consistent with how fair value revaluations were determined under Odyssey SPAC.4 Accounting impact of the Business CombinationFollowing the successful completion of the Business Combination with Odyssey SPAC on 22 April 2022  BenevolentAI became the new name of the holding company of the new BAI Group.This Business Combination was achieved through the contribution of ordinary and preferred shares in BenevolentAI Limited in exchange for new ordinary shares in BenevolentAI (previously Odyssey SPAC)  The result being that the new BAI Group became listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.As discussed in note 2.1  the Business Combination between BenevolentAI Limited and Odyssey SPAC was accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2 as a capital reorganisation  since Odyssey SPAC did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Accordingly  the Transaction was treated as the equivalent of BenevolentAI Limited issuing shares at the closing of the Business Combination for the net assets of Odyssey Acquisition S.A. as at the Closing date  accompanied by a recapitalisation. The excess of the fair value of consideration for Odyssey Acquisition S.A. over the fair value of its identifiable net assets acquired represents a compensation for the service of a stock exchange listing for its shares and expenses as incurred. This leads to a non-cash listing service expense of £65.4m that has been recognised in administrative expenses.As at Closing date  the fair value of BenevolentAI Limited’s shares that were deemed to be issued to Odyssey SPAC amounted to £88.3m  based on the initial closing price of shares of Odyssey Acquisition S.A. according to the table below. In return  BenevolentAI received Odyssey SPAC’s listing service and its net liabilities  equal to £6.1m  which mainly consisted of remaining cash net of redemptions and liabilities related to the warrants  resulting in a total non-cash listing service expense of £65.4m to administrative expenses  excluding the £29.0m of Transaction-related expenses incurred by Odyssey SPAC.Fair value in £m Class A shares (4.9 million shares at £8.22 per share) 40.0 Class B shares 2/3 (5 million shares at £8.22 per share) 41.1 Class B shares 1/3 (2.5 million shares at £2.87 per share) 7.2 BenevolentAI Limited’s shares deemed issued 88.3 Plus Odyssey SPAC’s net liabilities 6.1 Less Transaction-related expenses incurred by Odyssey SPAC (29.0) IFRS 2 non-cash listing service expense 65.4Odyssey SPAC’s net liabilities at Closing (before the gross proceeds of €136.1m from PIPE Financing and€40m backstop):Fair value in £m at Closing Cash 32.0 Prepayments and other debtors 0.2 Accruals and trade creditors (20.2) Warrants at fair value (18.1) Net liabilities acquired (6.1)In conjunction with the Transaction  Odyssey SPAC entered into subscription agreements with investors (“PIPE Investors”) in a Private Investment in Public Equity transaction (the “PIPE Financing”) in the aggregate amount of €136.1m (£113.0m). In return for their investment  the PIPE Investors received a total of 13 613 394 additional Odyssey SPAC Class A shares. An equity back stop facility for €40m (£33.2m) resulted in a further issuance of 4 000 000 (per note 15) ordinary shares were also issued. This resulted in a total cash inflow of £145.9m (less £0.3m of professional fees) across the equity PIPE and Backstop.Prior to closing  as consistent with the original public share offering by Odyssey SPAC  a total of 25.1 million ordinary shares with an agreed redemption price of €9.96 per share were redeemed for cash by eligible ordinary shareholders  following the redemption process. These are currently held as treasury shares. The redemption payable of €250.3 million was paid prior to Transaction close.As part of the Capital Reorganisation  BenevolentAI Limited’s share capital was exchanged for shares in Odyssey Acquisition S.A. of £75k  being 90 million shares at a par value of €0.001. This capital reorganization reflects the transition of the share capital and share premium from BenevolentAI Ltd to BenevolentAI. This results in a decrease within share capital by £0.1m from the old share capital (par value of £0.10) with an increase of £584m reflecting a true-up to the premium on the shares issued to BenevolentAI shareholders in the share for share exchange. The corresponding adjustment to reflect the book value accounted  reflected through a corresponding charge to retained earnings of £43.2m and the merger difference of £535.9m  reflected in BenevolentAI.The following table provides an overview of the impact of the Business Combination on the Statement of Comprehensive loss for the six months to 30 June 2022:in £m BenevolentAI Limited(ex-Transaction) Impact from BusinessCombination (1) (2) (3) BenevolentAIconsolidated(with Transaction) Gross profit 4.8 - 4.8 Operating loss (55.3) (79.3) (134.6) Loss before tax (55.4) (73.1) (128.5) Taxation 7.6 (3.7) 3.9 Loss for the period (47.8) (76.8) (124.6)(1) Operating loss includes the listing service expense of £65.4m; Transaction-related SBP expenses of £2.6m; transaction costs of £11.3m; and costs incurred by the Company since Transaction close. (2) Loss before tax includes those adjustments noted above  in addition to the revaluation of warrants since Close of £6.1m credit. (3) Loss for the period includes those adjustments noted above  in addition to stamp duty tax payable of £3.7m.In addition  the following table provides an overview of the impacts of the Business Combination on the Statement of Financial Position at 30 June 2022:in £m BenevolentAI Limited(ex-Transaction) Impact from BusinessCombination (4) (5) BenevolentAIconsolidated(with Transaction) Assets Total non-current assets 35.6 - 35.6 Total current assets 38.5 153.3 191.8 Total assets 74.1 153.3 227.4 Liabilities Total current liabilities 42.3 12.0 54.3 Total non-current liabilities 6.7 - 6.7 Total liabilities 49.0 12.0 61.0 Net assets (shareholders’ equity) 25.1 141.3 166.4(4) Current assets include £32.0m proceeds from cash in Odyssey SPAC at Transaction close  in addition to £112.7m net proceeds from PIPE Financing and £33.2m proceeds from backstop facility. This is then net of outflows of £24.6m for payments of stamp duty; supplier invoices; and negative interest. Note  neither the PIPE Financing nor the backstop have been included as net assets when determining the listing service expense. (5) Current liabilities includes the £12.0m fair value of warrants as at 30 June 2022  having moved from the £18.1m valuation at the Transaction close.5 RevenueWe initially recognise income under the AstraZeneca Collaboration as deferred revenue  which we become entitled to recognise as revenue in line with the delivery efforts towards the completion of tasks and provision of the deliverables set out in the agreements governing the AstraZeneca Collaboration. For the six months to 30 June 2022  this is represented by a revenue of £4.8m (six months to 30 June 2021: £1.7m).AZ Collaboration dealBuilding on the success of the first collaboration  the relationship with AstraZeneca has been expanded into a new 3-year partnership  starting 1 January 2022 and focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and heart failure (HF).As the result of this collaboration BenevolentAI received an upfront fee of $15m (£11.8m) in January 2022. As the result of the upfront fee  a total of £7.0m deferred revenue is recognised as of 30 June 2022 (nil as at 31 Dec 2021).There is no related party revenue in the six months to 30 June 2022 (six months to 30 June 2021: £nil).

Receipts for 2021 remain outstanding due to a scheme wide backlog in processing  reviewing and settling submissions to claimants.10 Loss per shareLoss per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of BenevolentAI after taxation for each financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial period. The weighted average number of shares is calculated from the number of ordinary and preferred BenevolentAI shares in circulation at the beginning of the period adjusted by the number of ordinary shares issued during the period  alongside the impacts of the transaction and multiplied by a time-weighting factor. The time-weighting factor reflects the ratio of the number of days on which ordinary shares were issued and the total number of days of the period.The G2 Growth Shares have been excluded as they do not attract dividends and were subsequently cancelled prior to the Transaction.As the business combination is accounted for as if BenevolentAI Ltd has acquired Odyssey SPAC  the number of shares is adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of the share for share exchange completed during the Transaction  such as to reflect the capital structure of the legal parent. In accordance with IAS 33  the calculation of the basic and diluted loss per share for all periods presented has been adjusted retrospectively due to these changes.For the six months ended 30 June Note 2022 2021 £’000 £’000 Basic and diluted loss per share  expressed in pence (123.9p) (45.8p) Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 100 545 304 89 754 538 Reported total comprehensive loss (124 591) (41 088) Adjustments for: Transaction-related items 2.2 79 267 - Fair value revaluation gain on warrants within finance income 7 (6 120) - Stamp duty tax payable within taxation 9 3 739 - Normalised total comprehensive loss (47 705) (41 088) Normalised basic and diluted loss per ordinary share (47.4p) (45.8p)11 Share based payments (“SBP”)During the period to the 22 April 2022 (before the Transaction)  1 602 040 options and 75 793 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) were granted to employees and others under the unapproved Share Option Plan for BenevolentAI Limited. No awards were made between the Transaction and 30 June 2022. Benevolent options and RSUs have been adjusted based on the ratio of 1 BenevolentAI Limited ordinary and A preferred share into approximately 38.4930 BenevolentAI ordinary shares  as determined in the business combination agreement as part of the share for share exchange. Correspondingly  the exercise price has been divided by the same ratio  such that the fair value charge remains consistent  with no other impact arising from this scheme modification. During the six months to 30 June 2022 575 894 options and 66 824 RSUs were forfeited. The comparative information presented has been adjusted retrospectively for this conversion  where applicable.The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options under BenevolentAI are as follows:Options and RSUs held in BenevolentAI Weightedaverage exerciseprice (pounds) Number ofoptions / RSUs Weighted averageexercise price(pounds) Number ofoptions / RSUs For the six months ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 2021 Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the period 0.1 19 043 911 1.0 8 839 032 Forfeited during the period (0.0) (642 718) (11.7) (721 128) Exercised during the period - - - - Granted during the period 0.0 1 677 833 0.0 3 940 682 Outstanding at the end of the period 0.1 20 079 026 0.2 12 058 586 Exercisable at the end of the period - - - -For the six months ended 30 June 2022 Restated 2021 £’000 £’000 SBP expenses 21 913 18 343 Transaction-related SBP expenses 2 371 - 24 284 18 343 Social security provision in relation to SBP 232 - Transaction-related social security provision in relation to SBP 240 - 472 -The Group has re-assessed the fair value (“FV”) charging methodology for the unapproved share option plan  identified as a result of the Business Combination  reflecting the scheme ‘point of exit’. Historic FV allocation was to spread straight line over the service period  rather than via a tranching approach. The tranching approach would result in straight line FV allocation for the tranches vesting pre-trigger over the ‘time to exit’  with the regular tranching thereafter. Prior estimates around the ‘time to exit’  using the service period as an estimate  were in some instances too long  meaning that the FV allocation in respect of awards was spread over a longer period than actually transpired. Indicators during 2021 would suggest that the re-assessment of the FV allocation over the period to exit should have taken place in 2021 and that the respective charges have been pulled back into the restated period.The error and subsequent correction  presented through the restatement for the 2021 Interim Statement of Consolidated Income to 30 June and Full Year 2021 Statement of Financial Position is detailed below.Audited balances referred to are pre-restatement  where the restatement itself is yet to be audited reflective of the interim statement itself being unaudited.£’000 Six months to 30 June 2021 ReportedUnaudited Prior PeriodAdjustmentsUnaudited RestatedUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Research and development expenses SBP expenses (821) (2 262) (3 083) Administrative Expenses SBP expenses (7 295) (7 965) (15 260) (8 116) (10 227) (18 343) Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Year to 31 December 2021 Audited Prior PeriodAdjustmentsUnaudited RestatedUnaudited Current liabilities provisions 10 391 1 383 11 774 Share-based payment reserve 67 666 20 054 87 720 Retained earnings (271 001) (21 437) (292 438)12 Trade and other Payables30 June 31 December 2022 2021 £'000 £'000 Trade payables 13 677 1 747 Taxation and social security 944 663 Other payables and accruals 6 561 7 876 21 182 10 286Trade payables includes £11.3 million in relation to Transaction-related payables as at 30 June 2022.

Following the Transaction close and subsequent consolidation of the post-acquisition performance of BenevolentAI (formerly Odyssey SPAC)  between 22 April 22 and 30 June 22  the change in the fair value was then recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as expense.The expense for the warrants was determined on the basis of the fair value at the Closing date. The fair value was derived by applying the using Binomial Tree method and the Monte Carlo pricing method.Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Comprehensive income statement. The current warrants are EUR denominated liability and are retranslated as at 30 June 22. The Foreign exchange difference arising on the retranslation is posted as expense in the statement of comprehensive income.14 ShareholdingsThe table  including a comparative  reflects the shares in issue for BenevolentAI Limited as the accounting acquirer of Odyssey SPAC (now BenevolentAI) and the subsequent consolidated impact of the share for share exchanged  the impact of the redemption  equity Pipe Financing and equity Backstop facility for BenevolentAI  as the legal Parent and listed entity.

Technoprobe: A Clear Winner Part 2,Thanks to the just-released results  we follow up on our comps analysis on the half-year performance of FormFactor Vs. Technoprobe. Click here to read more.,"PhonlamaiPhotoSince our initial comps analysis between FormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) and Technoprobe  their stock price performances have been diametrically opposed. In our first analysis  FormFactor was rated as a neutral opportunity  whereas Technoprobe was a screaming buy. The former delivered a negative return of more than 40%  while the latter was listed at €5.7 per share  and today  despite the negative market return  after the just released results  it is trading at more than €7 per share (Fig 1)  signing a plus 23% YTD. As a recap of our FormFactor analysis  here at the Lab  we also commented on the company's Q4 and Q1 results.FormFactor Vs Technoprobe: A Clear Winner (Mare Evidence Lab's previous publication)Technoprobe S.p.A. Stock Price Evolution (Yahoo Finance (Fig 1))Q2 results compsIn the half-year results  FormFactor delivered a good set of numbers. On a quarterly basis  revenue increased by 8.4% compared to Q2 2021 account; however  Technoprobe achieved a plus 42.6% in the same period. Going down to the P&L  we note the same positive trends. At gross margin level  FormFactor's gross margin stood at 46.3% versus the 40.6% in the second quarter of 2021 (in line with the guidance previously forecasted). Looking at the Italian counterpart  gross margin was at almost 60%  in line with Q1 and up 36% year-on-year. Going back to FormFactor  this positive performance in Q2 result in an EPS at the high end of the management range. Here at the Lab  we positively favor the latest company acquisition of JanisULT that further strengthens FormFactor's ""capabilities as a key supplier to the emerging quantum computing market"". Despite that  Technoprobe just delivered a breathtaking half-year performance  and we are much more confident of the long-term prospects.Additional upside in Technoprobe to considerFX development. Indeed  Technoprobe might benefit from a weak € currency. Being a net exporter  this might result in taking a higher market share in the probe market in the US; Once again  FormFactor cost pressure wage might be higher versus Technoprobe. This is due to various reasons: the lower US unemployment rate compared to the Italian one and the salary cost-based (once again  it is much lower in Italy); Higher expenditure in R&D development that favors Technoprobe; As already anticipated in the Infineon follow-up note  being located in the EU  Technoprobe might prosper from the EU Chips Act: ""the European Commission plans to allocate €11 billion in public funds for the research  design and manufacturing of semiconductors  with the goal of mobilizing a total of €43 billion of public and private investment until 2030"". A plan to bolster Europe's ""competitiveness and resilience in semiconductor technologies and applications"". It is just a piece of recent news that Intel is planning to open a new chip lab facility in the Northern part of Italy; When the company will pass from Euronext Growth Milan to the Star segment  Technoprobe will certainly have better investor visibility (and more trading volumes liquidity)  so we are confident that stock price performance will follow.Conclusion and valuationWith the recent FormFactor stock price decline  we believe that it might offer a good entry point; however  we are still more confident in the Italian company that likely offers a better upside in terms of valuation and 5 additional short/medium quick takeaways. The Q3 outlook for FormFactor was also not very positive  so we reaffirm our neutral rating.FormFactor Q3 Guidance (FormFactor Q2 Results)If you are interested in our latest coverage on European semis  please have a look at our recently published articles:",neutral,0.1,0.82,0.08,mixed,0.52,0.1,0.39,True,English,"['Clear Winner Part', 'FormFactor Vs', 'Technoprobe', 'Technoprobe S.p.A.

The low ppq levels demand an unprecedented level of cleanliness and instrument sensitivity which ultimately necessitate newer  and more robust analytical techniques.The results achieved provide clear evidence that ultra-trace levels of PFOA and PFOS can be detected  but with significantly increased levels of effort  cost  and environmental impact that are not sustainable for routine analysis.With this demonstration of capabilities  Eurofins Sacramento is in the process of developing an ultra-trace method capable of supporting the analysis of PFAS in the sub-ppt range.Methodology to Achieve the 2022 interim Health Advisory LevelsCurrent commercial lab limits of quantitation for PFAS are at 2ppt  requiring a 500-fold decrease for PFOA and a 100-fold for PFOS to support the US EPA HALs. Several modifications of existing procedures were employed with varying levels of success  including analysis on a SCIEX 7500  new LCMS column and traps  pre-rinsing consumables  use of water filtered through an LCMS column  and extraction in a clean room. At the conclusion of these efforts  a series of sample analyses demonstrated achievability of the 2022 interim Health Advisory Levels.For technical specifications and data related to this development  visit the SCIEX USA technical note “ Achieving low parts-per-quadrillion detection limits for PFAS analysis in drinking water”.ENDSAbout Eurofins Environment Testing – USAThe Eurofins environmental laboratories network in the US performs analysis of drinking water  groundwater  seawater  soil  air  and tissue using state-of-the-art analytical methods to assess quality and impact on health and the environment.About Eurofins – the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

10635,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/india-unwilling-relent-tax-stance-091534995.html,India Unwilling to Bend for Index Inclusion to Bring in Billions,(Bloomberg) -- India has ruled out any changes to tax policies that will make it easier for the nation’s bonds to be included in global indexes  according to...,(Bloomberg) -- India has ruled out any changes to tax policies that will make it easier for the nation’s bonds to be included in global indexes  according to people familiar with the matter.Most Read from BloombergThe government doesn’t plan to waive capital gains taxes  and it’s concerned that foreign inflows will increase the volatility of local markets  said the people  who didn’t want to be identified discussing policy matters. Those taxes have been a stumbling block in previous negotiations.FTSE Russell and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are due to unveil the results of their index reviews in coming weeks  with investors piling into Indian bonds on bets the country will replace Russian debt. While the index compilers could proceed to include the securities without changes  discussions earlier fell apart over the government’s demand to retain the right to tax capital gains  dashing analysts’ predictions of $30 billion of foreign inflows.“Unlike equities  Indian bonds have failed to attract any sizable pool of foreign capital ” said Pankaj Pathak  a fixed-income fund manager at Quantum Asset Management Co. “India’s inclusion would add diversification to the index  enhance the yield and expand the market opportunities for global debt investors. So  the benefits might outweigh the concerns.”India’s bond market is the largest in the emerging world that’s not already included in global indexes. The nation’s benchmark 10-year bond yield has dropped around 30 basis points since the middle of June as local banks and foreign investors boosted their holdings. The yield fell seven basis points on Tuesday to 7.29%.Money managers frequently track global bond indexes when making allocation decisions  and inclusion often lead to billions of dollars of inflows.Story continuesThe government wants to be self-reliant in its funding  and is prepared to handle any selloff in its debt market should inclusion fail to happen  the people said. The nation is borrowing a record 14.3 trillion rupee ($176 billion) this fiscal year.JPMorgan SurveyA JPMorgan investor survey found that funds want India to replace Russia  which was excluded after the invasion of Ukraine  said a money manager with access to the results. Still  the survey also showed investors wanted the government to ease some rules  the person said  asking not to be identified as the discussions are private.The ability to access India’s debt market through an international central security depository  such as Euroclear  better transaction efficiency and clarity on taxes were cited as some of the key remaining hurdles to index inclusion  the fund manager said.The people didn’t say if JPMorgan had made any specific requests for its review. A finance ministry spokesperson didn’t respond to calls seeking comments  while JPMorgan declined to comment.“For passive foreign investors  it will be very important to get a solution to trade on standard platforms ” said Rajeev De Mello  a global macro portfolio manager at GAMA Asset Management in Geneva. Still  “not all investors are operationally ready but the largest active investment firms have already set up their infrastructure to support their emerging market teams who have been investing in India for many years.”Unrelenting StanceIndia’s bonds will likely only be included in JPMorgan’s index early next year as the government still needs to address operational issues  Reuters reported  citing people with knowledge of the matter.“The market was expecting inclusion of Indian bonds into key global bond indexes ” said Arnob Biswas  a strategist at SMC Global Securities. A delay “brings more downside risk to the rupee and we are possibly heading below 82.30-82.50 to a dollar in coming weeks.”The rupee has declined almost 9% this year  and closed at 81.5762 to the dollar on Tuesday.India’s introduction of the so-called Fully Accessible Route in 2020  which removed limits on foreign ownership on some bonds  and other changes had bolstered investor optimism over index inclusion. The unrelenting stance on a tax waiver  that would facilitate settlement on a platform such as Euroclear  may undermine the attractiveness of Indian bonds even if they’re included.FTSE Russell will unveil the results of its review on Thursday  a spokesperson said. JPMorgan hasn’t revealed a date as yet for its announcement.Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd  which administers indexes that compete with those from other service providers.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,mixed,0.11,0.15,0.74,True,English,"['Index Inclusion', 'India', 'Billions', 'international central security depository', 'largest active investment firms', 'global macro portfolio manager', 'Quantum Asset Management Co', 'benchmark 10-year bond yield', 'Bloomberg Index Services Ltd', 'key global bond indexes', 'A JPMorgan investor survey', 'GAMA Asset Management', 'key remaining hurdles', 'Rajeev De Mello', 'Fully Accessible Route', 'other service providers', 'fixed-income fund manager', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'finance ministry spokesperson', 'SMC Global Securities', 'record 14.3 trillion rupee', 'emerging market teams', 'global debt investors', 'passive foreign investors', 'capital gains taxes', 'global indexes', 'bond market', 'investor optimism', 'money manager', 'foreign capital', 'emerging world', 'Russian debt', 'debt market', 'foreign ownership', 'Bloomberg LP', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'JPMorgan Survey', 'local markets', 'policy matters', 'stumbling block', 'previous negotiations', 'FTSE Russell', 'index reviews', 'coming weeks', 'index compilers', 'analysts’ predictions', 'sizable pool', 'Pankaj Pathak', 'market opportunities', 'local banks', 'allocation decisions', 'transaction efficiency', 'specific requests', 'standard platforms', 'many years', 'Unrelenting Stance', 'operational issues', 'Arnob Biswas', 'downside risk', 'parent company', 'foreign inflows', 'other changes', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'tax policies', 'tax waiver', 'Indian bonds', 'index inclusion', 'Co.', 'people', 'government', 'volatility', 'results', 'bets', 'country', 'discussions', 'demand', 'right', 'equities', 'diversification', 'benefits', 'concerns', '30 basis', 'middle', 'June', 'holdings', 'Tuesday', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Story', 'funding', 'selloff', 'funds', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'rules', 'ability', 'Euroclear', 'clarity', 'calls', 'comments', 'solution', 'Geneva', 'infrastructure', 'Reuters', 'knowledge', 'strategist', 'delay', 'introduction', 'limits', 'settlement', 'attractiveness', 'Thursday', 'date', 'announcement']",2022-09-27,2022-09-28,finance.yahoo.com

The new service  which will be available for broad adoption in 2023  addresses one of the biggest challenges in the securities industry.The lack of visibility after a securities transaction takes place means that there is no way of tracking all the steps in its lifecycle across multiple intermediaries  increasing the risk that a security may not be in the right place at the time of completion. This leads to settlement fails that add operational costs of some USD 3 billion a year for the industry as well as regulatory penalties such as those introduced by Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) in Europe earlier this year.SWIFT Securities View gives market participants a clear view of all the steps in the settlement journey and enables them to identify trades at risk of failing  including early detection of any discrepancies between buy-sell instructions  so they can take pre-emptive action. It does so by leveraging an ISO-standard Unique Transaction Identifier that links messages related to the same securities flow  enabling automated tracking of both sides of the transaction by all market participants involved  similar to the tracking of a package via a postal delivery service.As part of its strategy to enable instant  frictionless and interoperable transactions globally  SWIFT is encouraging universal adoption of the transaction identifier to achieve standardised data use across the post trade lifecycle. This will bring increased transparency to securities transactions  help reduce risk  and support innovative new services. The pilot included the following market participants amongst others: ABN Amro Clearing Bank; BlackRock; BNP Paribas; BNY Mellon; Citi (Securities Services and Global Markets); Credit Suisse; Euroclear; Euronext; HSBC; J.P.Morgan; Northern Trust; Optiver; Pershing; and SEB.Vikesh Patel  Head of Securities Strategy  SWIFT said: “ SWIFT Securities View does more than just empower our customers to identify and rectify discrepancies in settlement transactions; it sets the blueprint and foundation for a new industry standard to radically transform the industry  just as SWIFT gpi continues to do for cross-border payments. Our early pilot results show this potential and further strengthen our mission of making transactions instant and frictionless  across all industries.”Steve Wager  Executive Manager  Head of Direct Markets Management  BNY Mellon  said: “ The UTI adoption by the industry could facilitate earlier matching which is key to timely settlement especially with trade settlement cycles shortening across the Globe.”Jeff King  Head of Core Custody Product  Citi Securities Services  said: “ With the rollout of CSDR in Europe and the planned move to T+1 in Asia and the US  it is becoming increasingly important to ensure settlement efficiency and having transactions match and settle on time. The inclusion of the Unique Transaction Identifier within the settlement lifecycle data communication and the adoption of SWIFT’s Securities View Service within the industry facilitates heightened transparency earlier in the settlement lifecycle allowing matching issues to be discovered higher up the settlement chain rather than waiting on matching updates to come back from CSDs and market infrastructures.”Olivier Grimonpont  Managing Director  Product Management - Market Liquidity  Euroclear  said: “ Euroclear consistently focuses on improving operational efficiency in the post trade space and helping our clients reduce settlement fails. We were pleased to participate in the pilot  which enabled the market to test the potential of adopting a UTI to improve transaction lifecycle visibility.”Pierre Davoust  Head of CSDs  Global Primary Markets and Corporate Services and Post Trade  Euronext  said: "" At Euronext Securities we are continuously looking into ways that enable our clients to improve their daily business. We are pleased to support this important initiative that helps the industry to strengthen the settlement processes and reduce fails.Paul Baybutt  Global Head of Middle Office for Securities Services  HSBC  said: “ We’re pleased to participate in this SWIFT pilot. Wider adoption of the Unique Transaction Identifier should improve visibility for market participants to identify transactions that might be at risk of failing and address potential settlement issues quicker and even before they occur. Expanding the use of UTIs should therefore make it more efficient for service providers  such as ourselves  to respond to client queries about the status of their transactions – which is ever more important with the implementation this year of the Settlement Discipline Regime.”Russ Stamey  Senior Vice President  Asset Servicing  Northern Trust  said: “ We applaud SWIFT Securities View as another step toward full transaction transparency  enabling more efficient securities settlement and more control in the post-trade space.”Edward Monrad  Head of Market Structure  Optiver said: “ Critical to the health of financial markets is a well-functioning and reliable post-trade process. By seeking to increase transparency and efficiency around settlement  SWIFT's Securities Tracking Pilot is making an important contribution toward this very goal. The UTI has the potential to substantially improve the OTC settlement process and reduce costs by allowing parties to a trade to easily find out where and how other parties are instructing in case of mismatches. Optiver is pleased to be participating in this pilot and looks forward to widespread adoption of the UTI.”About SWIFTSWIFT is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:“Total Net Revenue” is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.“Adjusted EBITDA” as Net profit plus/(less): (1) depreciation and amortization  (2) other expenses/(income)  (3) foreign exchange loss/(gain)  (4) share of loss/(gain) of associates and joint ventures  (5) interest expenses/ (income)  (6) income tax expenses  (7) share-based payment expenses  (8) impairment of non-current assets.“Adjusted Net profit” as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.“Adjusted Net profit Margin” as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue.Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  income tax  and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company’s operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume. Payment Services segment net revenue yield provides a measure of our ability to generate net revenue per unit of volume we process.We define these measures as follows:PS Payment Net Revenue is the Net Revenue consisting of the merchant and consumer fees collected for the payment transactions.PS Other Net Revenue primarily consists of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments  interest revenue  cash and settlement services and related conversion income  fees for intercompany and third-party funding  and advertising fees.QIWI plc.Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results(in millions  except per share data)Three months ended (unaudited) June 30  2021 June 30  2022 June 30  2022 RUB RUB USD Revenue 10 813 14 015 274.0 Minus: Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 4 764 3 807 74.4 Total Net Revenue 6 049 10 208 199.5 Segment Net Revenue Payment Services Segment Revenue 10 145 12 854 251.3 PS Payment Revenue(1) 9 162 10 839 211.9 Minus: Cost of PS Payment Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(2) 4 229 3 260 63.7 PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue 4 933 7 579 148.1 PS Other Revenue(3) 983 2 015 39.4 Minus: Cost of PS Other Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(4) 238 276 5.4 PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue 745 1 739 34.0 Payment Services Segment Net Revenue 5 678 9 318 182.1 Corporate and Other Category Revenue 668 1 161 22.7 Minus: Cost of CO revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 297 271 5.3 Corporate and Other Category Net Revenue 371 890 17.4 Total Segment Net Revenue 6 049 10 208 199.5 Profit for the period 2 633 2 810 54.9 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 285 287 5.6 Other income and expenses  net 65 (18 ) (0.4 ) Foreign exchange (gain)/loss  net 50 2 369 46.3 Share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (141 ) -

You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:“Total Net Revenue” is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.“Adjusted EBITDA” as Net profit plus/(less): (1) depreciation and amortization  (2) other expenses/(income)  (3) foreign exchange loss/(gain)  (4) share of loss/(gain) of associates and joint ventures  (5) interest expenses/ (income)  (6) income tax expenses  (7) share-based payment expenses  (8) impairment of non-current assets.“Adjusted Net profit” as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.“Adjusted Net profit Margin” as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue.Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  income tax  and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company’s operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume.

The new service ,"Cooperative piloted first phase of new capability  called SWIFT Securities View  with leading financial institutions as part of push towards ‘zero-touch’ processingLeverages the power of a Unique Transaction Identifier to make the complex flow of a securities trade as simple as tracking a packageBRUSSELS  September 28  2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SWIFT today announces the successful pilot of SWIFT Securities View  a new capability that significantly increases transparency in post-trade processing and helps prevent costly settlement fails. The new service  which will be available for broad adoption in 2023  addresses one of the biggest challenges in the securities industry.The lack of visibility after a securities transaction takes place means that there is no way of tracking all the steps in its lifecycle across multiple intermediaries  increasing the risk that a security may not be in the right place at the time of completion. This leads to settlement fails that add operational costs of some USD 3 billion a year for the industry as well as regulatory penalties such as those introduced by Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) in Europe earlier this year.SWIFT Securities View gives market participants a clear view of all the steps in the settlement journey and enables them to identify trades at risk of failing  including early detection of any discrepancies between buy-sell instructions  so they can take pre-emptive action. It does so by leveraging an ISO-standard Unique Transaction Identifier that links messages related to the same securities flow  enabling automated tracking of both sides of the transaction by all market participants involved  similar to the tracking of a package via a postal delivery service.As part of its strategy to enable instant  frictionless and interoperable transactions globally  SWIFT is encouraging universal adoption of the transaction identifier to achieve standardised data use across the post trade lifecycle. This will bring increased transparency to securities transactions  help reduce risk  and support innovative new services. The pilot included the following market participants amongst others: ABN Amro Clearing Bank; BlackRock; BNP Paribas; BNY Mellon; Citi (Securities Services and Global Markets); Credit Suisse; Euroclear; Euronext; HSBC; J.P.Morgan; Northern Trust; Optiver; Pershing; and SEB.Story continuesVikesh Patel  Head of Securities Strategy  SWIFT said: ""SWIFT Securities View does more than just empower our customers to identify and rectify discrepancies in settlement transactions; it sets the blueprint and foundation for a new industry standard to radically transform the industry  just as SWIFT gpi continues to do for cross-border payments. Our early pilot results show this potential and further strengthen our mission of making transactions instant and frictionless  across all industries.""Steve Wager  Executive Manager  Head of Direct Markets Management  BNY Mellon  said: ""The UTI adoption by the industry could facilitate earlier matching which is key to timely settlement especially with trade settlement cycles shortening across the Globe.""Jeff King  Head of Core Custody Product  Citi Securities Services  said: ""With the rollout of CSDR in Europe and the planned move to T+1 in Asia and the US  it is becoming increasingly important to ensure settlement efficiency and having transactions match and settle on time. The inclusion of the Unique Transaction Identifier within the settlement lifecycle data communication and the adoption of SWIFT’s Securities View Service within the industry facilitates heightened transparency earlier in the settlement lifecycle allowing matching issues to be discovered higher up the settlement chain rather than waiting on matching updates to come back from CSDs and market infrastructures.""Olivier Grimonpont  Managing Director  Product Management - Market Liquidity  Euroclear  said: ""Euroclear consistently focuses on improving operational efficiency in the post trade space and helping our clients reduce settlement fails. We were pleased to participate in the pilot  which enabled the market to test the potential of adopting a UTI to improve transaction lifecycle visibility.""Pierre Davoust  Head of CSDs  Global Primary Markets and Corporate Services and Post Trade  Euronext  said: ""At Euronext Securities we are continuously looking into ways that enable our clients to improve their daily business. We are pleased to support this important initiative that helps the industry to strengthen the settlement processes and reduce fails.Paul Baybutt  Global Head of Middle Office for Securities Services  HSBC  said: ""We’re pleased to participate in this SWIFT pilot. Wider adoption of the Unique Transaction Identifier should improve visibility for market participants to identify transactions that might be at risk of failing and address potential settlement issues quicker and even before they occur. Expanding the use of UTIs should therefore make it more efficient for service providers  such as ourselves  to respond to client queries about the status of their transactions – which is ever more important with the implementation this year of the Settlement Discipline Regime.""Russ Stamey  Senior Vice President  Asset Servicing  Northern Trust  said: ""We applaud SWIFT Securities View as another step toward full transaction transparency  enabling more efficient securities settlement and more control in the post-trade space.""Edward Monrad  Head of Market Structure  Optiver said: ""Critical to the health of financial markets is a well-functioning and reliable post-trade process. By seeking to increase transparency and efficiency around settlement  SWIFT's Securities Tracking Pilot is making an important contribution toward this very goal. The UTI has the potential to substantially improve the OTC settlement process and reduce costs by allowing parties to a trade to easily find out where and how other parties are instructing in case of mismatches. Optiver is pleased to be participating in this pilot and looks forward to widespread adoption of the UTI.""About SWIFTSWIFT is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

Those taxes have been a stumbling block in previous negotiations.FTSE Russell and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are due to unveil the results of their index reviews in coming weeks. Investors have piled into Indian bonds ahead of those announcements on bets the country will replace Russian debt. While the index compilers could proceed to include the securities without changes  discussions earlier this year fell apart over the government’s demand to retain the right to tax capital gains on transactions  dashing analyst predictions of $30 billion of foreign inflows.India’s bond market is the largest in the emerging world that’s not already included in global indexes. The nation’s benchmark 10-year bond yield has dropped almost 30 basis points since the middle of June as local banks and foreign investors boosted their holdings.Money managers frequently track global bond indexes when making allocation decisions  and inclusion often lead to billions of dollars of inflows.A JPMorgan investor survey found that funds want India to replace Russia  which was excluded after the invasion of Ukraine  said a money manager with access to the results. Still  the survey also showed investors wanted the Asian nation’s government to ease some rules  the money manager said  asking not to be identified as the discussions are private.Tax ClarityThe ability to access India’s debt market through an international central security depository  such as Euroclear  better transaction efficiency and clarity on taxes were cited as some of the key remaining hurdles to index inclusion  the money manager said.The people didn’t say if JPMorgan had made any specific requests for its review. A finance ministry spokesperson didn’t respond to calls seeking comments  while JPMorgan declined to comment.India’s bonds will likely only be included in JPMorgan’s index early next year as the government still needs to address operational issues  Reuters reported  citing people with knowledge of the matter.India’s introduction of the so-called Fully Accessible Route in 2020  which removed limits on foreign ownership on some bonds  and other changes had bolstered investor optimism over index inclusion. The unrelenting stance on a tax waiver  that would facilitate settlement on a platform such as Euroclear  may undermine the attractiveness of Indian bonds even if they’re included.The government wants to be self-reliant in its funding  and is prepared to handle any selloff in its debt market should inclusion fail to happen  the people said.

Join gaming executives to discuss emerging parts of the industry this October at GamesBeat Summit Next. Register today.Technicolor Creative Studios is spinning out of its parent firm as a standalone public company on the Paris Euronext Stock Exchange at a valuation above $1 billion.The multimedia services company has a global network of creative studios and it will focus on the creation of feature film  episodic  gaming and advertising content. The firm will have nearly 12 000 employees  many of them artists based in places such as India.The company is based in Paris  and it has numerous studios around the globe that assist game  film  and advertising companies with art  testing  and other development services. They include award-winning global visual effects (VFX)  animation and gaming studios MPC  The Mill  Mikros Animation and Technicolor Games.“Spinning off is gonna make it a lot easier to move more quickly in this space and really be an advocate with clear a vision ” said Jeaneane Falkler  president of games at Technicolor Creative Studios  in an interview with GamesBeat. “When you have a clear vision for something  it’s easier for people to get behind that. That is to be the first choice production company for the creative space.”Event GamesBeat Summit Next 2022 Join gaming leaders live this October 25-26 in San Francisco to examine the next big opportunities within the gaming industry. Register HereUnder the deal  Technicolor Creative Studios will be publicly traded  and it is distributing 65% of its shares to Technicolor shareholders. The parent company  now called Vantiva  will own 35%.Starting today  Technicolor Creative Studios will trade publicly under the symbol TCHCS on Euronext Paris. Trading is set to start at €1.9539  or $1.88 a share.Going forward  the parent company  formerly Technicolor  comprised of the Connected Home and Vantiva Supply Chain Services divisions  will remain listed on Euronext Paris under its new name of Vantiva and the leadership of its new CEO  Luis Martinez-Amago.Founded in 1915  Technicolor led the film industry with the world’s first exploration of full color and sound motion pictures  developing a series of innovative color film processes in the early 20th century.It is interesting that the parent company is going to relinquish the Technicolor name  which is more than 100 years old  and rename itself Vantiva as it focuses on settop boxes and supply chain services. Technicolor Creative Studios will carry on with the core focus on services for entertainment and advertising.Technicolor GamesTechnicolor Creative Studios focuses on film  games  digital ads and more.Technicolor Games has been around for 15 years. For art  Technicolor Games focuses on services such as making art assets  animations  digital effects  lighting  and rigging. It also provides game testing services  and it has worked with companies such as Electronic Arts  Rockstar Games  and 2K. The game division has more than 670 people with more coming on board.“We’re coming back to the roots of our iconic brand ” Falkler said.Falkler said many people are still working  but as people go back to work Technology Creative Studios will create a new office in Culver City where its focus on Hollywood projects can be be more visible.“Technicolor Games is really much more of a startup and it is growing quickly ” Falkler said.Falkler said that the convergence of games  film  and advertising is continuing into a kind of transmedia (yes  it’s an old buzzword but it kind of fits). In the digital age  the same tools are being used to create these different kinds of content  and it’s only going to get more entangled with the metaverse.“Transmedia used to be an outdated term  but I guess it’s made its way back in ” Falkler said. “When you look at companies that can take an intellectual property across a game and film and episodic and digital advertising  there is really no other one company that can do that the way that Technicolor can. I think that is a key. For me running the game team  it’s a key differentiator.”The creative technology brand later acquired leading VFX studios MPC  The Mill and Mikros Animation in addition to establishing Technicolor Games. These four studios now operate under the new brand name  Technicolor Creative Studios  to focus on growth in the entertainment and advertising markets.“We’re actually seeing a lot of interest in the market as there are a couple of companies that we’re working with right now that are actually building a game while at the same time also focusing that same IP on film and episodic ” Falkler said.MPC has worked on films like Harry Potter  Cruella  Top Gun Maverick  and Sonic The Hedgehog. The game division has worked on a wide variety of games  while The Mill is focused on digital advertising.“There is potential to work together on things that nobody else can really do ” she said.Technicolor Games president Jeaneane Falkler.“My ambition is to build the world’s most successful visual arts company ” said Christian Roberton  CEO of Technicolor Creative Studios  in a statement. “We believe our legacy for innovation and creativity is our foundation for the future  and the success of our studios will rely on continued investment in cutting-edge technology  the world’s best talent and our ongoing relationships with major entertainment studios and brands. The next chapter as an independent company will be pivotal in our growth and evolution.”Technicolor Creative Studios has a rich legacy for innovation in the entertainment and advertising industries. Major projects include Academy Award Winning features  Gladiator  1917  The Jungle Book and Life of Pi  as well as recent blockbusters Ghostbusters: Afterlife  Nope and Disney’s new live-action iteration of Pinocchio.The company’s animation division is credited with the world’s most recognizable animation intellectual properties including SpongeBob SquarePants and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The advertising and brand experience studio The Mill  has earned over 500 awards and accolades across its 30-year history in brand marketing  consistently producing work for the world’s most notable brands from iconic Super Bowl commercials to globally renowned campaigns.Technicolor Creative Studios CEO Christian Roberton will be joined by an executive committee of seasoned industry professionals leading the business.The studio presidents include Tom Williams  Josh Mandel  Andrea Miloro and Jeaneane Falkler. Additional executive committee appointees include Laurent Carozzi as CFO  Niki Steel as chief people officer  Mark Hardy as CMO and Nathan Wappet as COO.Technicolor Creative Studios worked on The Lion King.One of the world’s largest visual arts providers  Technicolor Creative Studios’ ambition is to become the first-choice production partner for the world’s most successful entertainment companies and brands. Each studio in the network will be powered by shared technologies  creative talent  R&D  and investment in future platforms. The studios have the structural power to provide clients content solutions across their IP journey  from film development to in-game assets and marketing materials.The primary goal of the new Technicolor Creative Studios structure is to provide each of its subsidiary brands and their respective clients with the infrastructure needed to consistently deliver the best creative output.Technicolor creative studios is home to more than 11 700 employees across 11 countries  with plans to continue growing into 2023 to meet market demand across all its verticals.The new structure and collaborative vision will be cemented further with a Technicolor Creative Studios campus opening this year in Los Angeles Culver City  which will host all studio brands under one roof  with the addition of a bespoke Virtual Production stage and Creators Hub.Technicolor teams worked on Sonic the Hedgehog.By being fully independent  Technicolor Creative Studios is taking a strategic step to extend its leadership and expand into new and scalable markets  capitalizing on the burgeoning global demand for VFX and animated content.“There has never been a more exciting time for the games industry  and the Technicolor Creative Studios spin-off allows us to invest even more in growing the Technicolor Games footprint  talent roster and suite of service lines ” said Falkler. “There is a growing client demand for content that blurs the lines between gaming  entertainment and marketing that we are perfectly placed to deliver and collaborate on alongside The Mill  MPC and Mikros Animation. As part of this network of creative studios  we will provide a suite of in-house full-service production across games IP  from in-game assets to feature-length film. There is no other brand that can deliver content of the scale  breadth and artistry that the historic Technicolor brand name is synonymous with.”I asked if it was a tough time for gaming now that there is a general downturn in the world economy. Falkler said that when there is an economic downturn  a lot of companies  gaming included  will tend to outsource more of their operations.“When times are good  they typically pull it in because they can have more control or better quality ” she said. “But in a downturn  they tend to outsource.”Falkler said it may become easier to hire people in a recession  but she noted that for multiple years hiring great talent has always been a challenge and it may continue to be so.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has...","The FDA has assigned a PDUFA goal date of March 29  2023 for the NDA submission based on randomized-controlled and long-term extension data for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiencyLEIDEN  The Netherlands  Sept. 28  2022 /CNW/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  to treat the rare primary immunodeficiency activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023  aligned with a Priority Review classification.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)Submitted by Pharming on July 29  2022  the NDA was supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in index lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Those results demonstrated the efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from the baseline size of participants' index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.006) and normalization of their immune function  as evidenced by an increased proportion of naïve B cells from the baseline (p=0.002). Those findings indicate a reduction in disease markers associated with APDS  whose clinical hallmarks include significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as increased risk of lymphoma. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial including 38 patients with APDS who were treated with leniolisib for a median of 102 weeks.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The FDA's acceptance for priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib is a milestone that demonstrates our commitment to addressing unmet needs for patients with rare diseases. With FDA's review  leniolisib moves further along the regulatory pathway as a potential disease-modifying targeted treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA  as well as with regulatory authorities across the globe  to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their APDS patients.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:...,Trust StampAwarded Trademark by the US Patent and Trademark OfficeAtlanta  GA  Sept. 28  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T Stamp Inc. (“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDAI  Euronext Growth: AIID ID)  a global provider of AI-powered trust and identity services used globally across multiple sectors  today unveiled its new government-focused  privacy-first identity technology  Privtech™  and reports it has received registered trademark status for the Privtech solution by the US Patent and Trademark Office.The technology provides four customizable levels of privacy protection using the Company’s existing Privtech Certified® structure and offers government agencies the ability to verify identity and protect against fraud  while minimizing the data collected and providing transparency as to its use.Gareth Genner  Chief Executive Officer of Trust Stamp  explained  “Privtech technology utilizes our patented irreversibly transformed identity token (IT2™)  which allows users to be identified on a probabilistic basis without disclosing underlying biometric or other identity data. Within the Privtech Certified® structure there are four levels of privacy protection  of which Privtech Level Four is the most stringent with the entire enrollment and authentication processes taking place on the user’s own device  and only a randomized and encrypted one-time identifier ever leaving the device.”Dr. Norman Poh  Chief Science Officer of Trust Stamp  stated  “An IT2 can be created from virtually any modality of biometric together with most other types of identity data. In addition to the obvious benefit of privacy protection  the IT2 has numerous advantages when compared to legacy biometric templates  including computational efficiency  interoperability and cancelability.”Gareth Genner further noted  “Government agencies need to balance safe and efficient interaction with digital users against minimizing intrusion into the user’s privacy. Unlike the typical biometric systems in use today  Privtech Level Four does not require data intermediation by a private sector vendor and does not require the user to provide the agency with their biometric data. We have designed these solutions to meet the specific demands of government customers  which represent a very substantial and growing market opportunity. Ultimately  we believe that Privtech Certified products will define a new privacy-first approach to interacting with government agencies.”Story continuesThe Company’s announcement is in the wake of substantial increases in technology-focused investments by government agencies including $80 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service with a stated emphasis on improving taxpayer services and modernizing the agency’s technology and other infrastructure.About Trust StampTrust Stamp  is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.

The new service  which will be avail…,"BRUSSELS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SWIFT today announces the successful pilot of SWIFT Securities View  a new capability that significantly increases transparency in post-trade processing and helps prevent costly settlement fails. The new service  which will be available for broad adoption in 2023  addresses one of the biggest challenges in the securities industry.The lack of visibility after a securities transaction takes place means that there is no way of tracking all the steps in its lifecycle across multiple intermediaries  increasing the risk that a security may not be in the right place at the time of completion. This leads to settlement fails that add operational costs of some USD 3 billion a year for the industry as well as regulatory penalties such as those introduced by Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) in Europe earlier this year.SWIFT Securities View gives market participants a clear view of all the steps in the settlement journey and enables them to identify trades at risk of failing  including early detection of any discrepancies between buy-sell instructions  so they can take pre-emptive action. It does so by leveraging an ISO-standard Unique Transaction Identifier that links messages related to the same securities flow  enabling automated tracking of both sides of the transaction by all market participants involved  similar to the tracking of a package via a postal delivery service.As part of its strategy to enable instant  frictionless and interoperable transactions globally  SWIFT is encouraging universal adoption of the transaction identifier to achieve standardised data use across the post trade lifecycle. This will bring increased transparency to securities transactions  help reduce risk  and support innovative new services. The pilot included the following market participants amongst others: ABN Amro Clearing Bank; BlackRock; BNP Paribas; BNY Mellon; Citi (Securities Services and Global Markets); Credit Suisse; Euroclear; Euronext; HSBC; J.P.Morgan; Northern Trust; Optiver; Pershing; and SEB.Vikesh Patel  Head of Securities Strategy  SWIFT said: “ SWIFT Securities View does more than just empower our customers to identify and rectify discrepancies in settlement transactions; it sets the blueprint and foundation for a new industry standard to radically transform the industry  just as SWIFT gpi continues to do for cross-border payments. Our early pilot results show this potential and further strengthen our mission of making transactions instant and frictionless  across all industries.”Steve Wager  Executive Manager  Head of Direct Markets Management  BNY Mellon  said: “ The UTI adoption by the industry could facilitate earlier matching which is key to timely settlement especially with trade settlement cycles shortening across the Globe.”Jeff King  Head of Core Custody Product  Citi Securities Services  said: “ With the rollout of CSDR in Europe and the planned move to T+1 in Asia and the US  it is becoming increasingly important to ensure settlement efficiency and having transactions match and settle on time. The inclusion of the Unique Transaction Identifier within the settlement lifecycle data communication and the adoption of SWIFT’s Securities View Service within the industry facilitates heightened transparency earlier in the settlement lifecycle allowing matching issues to be discovered higher up the settlement chain rather than waiting on matching updates to come back from CSDs and market infrastructures.”Olivier Grimonpont  Managing Director  Product Management - Market Liquidity  Euroclear  said: “ Euroclear consistently focuses on improving operational efficiency in the post trade space and helping our clients reduce settlement fails. We were pleased to participate in the pilot  which enabled the market to test the potential of adopting a UTI to improve transaction lifecycle visibility.”Pierre Davoust  Head of CSDs  Global Primary Markets and Corporate Services and Post Trade  Euronext  said: "" At Euronext Securities we are continuously looking into ways that enable our clients to improve their daily business. We are pleased to support this important initiative that helps the industry to strengthen the settlement processes and reduce fails.Paul Baybutt  Global Head of Middle Office for Securities Services  HSBC  said: “ We’re pleased to participate in this SWIFT pilot. Wider adoption of the Unique Transaction Identifier should improve visibility for market participants to identify transactions that might be at risk of failing and address potential settlement issues quicker and even before they occur. Expanding the use of UTIs should therefore make it more efficient for service providers  such as ourselves  to respond to client queries about the status of their transactions – which is ever more important with the implementation this year of the Settlement Discipline Regime.”Russ Stamey  Senior Vice President  Asset Servicing  Northern Trust  said: “ We applaud SWIFT Securities View as another step toward full transaction transparency  enabling more efficient securities settlement and more control in the post-trade space.”Edward Monrad  Head of Market Structure  Optiver said: “ Critical to the health of financial markets is a well-functioning and reliable post-trade process. By seeking to increase transparency and efficiency around settlement  SWIFT's Securities Tracking Pilot is making an important contribution toward this very goal. The UTI has the potential to substantially improve the OTC settlement process and reduce costs by allowing parties to a trade to easily find out where and how other parties are instructing in case of mismatches. Optiver is pleased to be participating in this pilot and looks forward to widespread adoption of the UTI.”About SWIFTSWIFT is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

(“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDAI  Euronext Growth: AIID ID)  a...,Awarded Trademark by the US Patent and Trademark OfficeT Stamp Inc. (“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDAI  Euronext Growth: AIID ID)  a global provider of AI-powered trust and identity services used globally across multiple sectors  today unveiled its new government-focused  privacy-first identity technology  Privtech™  and reports it has received registered trademark status for the Privtech solution by the US Patent and Trademark Office.The technology provides four customizable levels of privacy protection using the Company’s existing Privtech Certified® structure and offers government agencies the ability to verify identity and protect against fraud  while minimizing the data collected and providing transparency as to its use.Gareth Genner  Chief Executive Officer of Trust Stamp  explained  “Privtech technology utilizes our patented irreversibly transformed identity token (IT2™)  which allows users to be identified on a probabilistic basis without disclosing underlying biometric or other identity data. Within the Privtech Certified® structure there are four levels of privacy protection  of which Privtech Level Four is the most stringent with the entire enrollment and authentication processes taking place on the user’s own device  and only a randomized and encrypted one-time identifier ever leaving the device.”Dr. Norman Poh  Chief Science Officer of Trust Stamp  stated  “An IT2 can be created from virtually any modality of biometric together with most other types of identity data. In addition to the obvious benefit of privacy protection  the IT2 has numerous advantages when compared to legacy biometric templates  including computational efficiency  interoperability and cancelability.”Gareth Genner further noted  “Government agencies need to balance safe and efficient interaction with digital users against minimizing intrusion into the user’s privacy. Unlike the typical biometric systems in use today  Privtech Level Four does not require data intermediation by a private sector vendor and does not require the user to provide the agency with their biometric data. We have designed these solutions to meet the specific demands of government customers  which represent a very substantial and growing market opportunity. Ultimately  we believe that Privtech Certified products will define a new privacy-first approach to interacting with government agencies.”The Company’s announcement is in the wake of substantial increases in technology-focused investments by government agencies including $80 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service with a stated emphasis on improving taxpayer services and modernizing the agency’s technology and other infrastructure.About Trust StampTrust Stamp  is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.

In December 2021  Ipsen Pharma SAS acquired 8% of the Company's share capital and 7.64% of the voting rights.

Key aspects of the first half 2022 financial resultsCash and cash equivalentsAs of June 30  2022  GENFIT had €209 million in cash and cash equivalents (€259 million as of December 31  2021).In the first half of 2022  these cash flows include the disbursement of €24 million corresponding to the VAT on the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021  as well as the disbursement of the employee participation to the profits of GENFIT SA for a total of €628 thousand.Operating incomeOperating income amounted to €12 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €3 million in the first half 2021).The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the partial recognition of deferred income in accordance with IFRS 15 of €40.0 million following the conclusion of the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with Ipsen in December 2021. Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half 2022.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €27 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €33 million in the first half 2021).The decrease in operating expenses is due to:The decrease in contracting costs which amounted to €9 million in the first half 2022 compared with €15 million in the first half 2021  reflecting the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022Research and development expenses amounted to €18 million in the six months to June 30  2022 compared with €23 million in the six months to June 30  2021The decrease in reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to a total cost of €2 million in the first half 2021 (including expenses relating to the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds representing €1.9 million in the first half 2021). This had a positive impact of €0.2 million in the first-half 2022 due to the residual provision reversalSuch decreases were partially offset by the increase in the general and administrative expenses (€8.2 million in the first half 2022  compared to €7.6 million euros in the first half 2021) mainly attributable to the increase in insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors.Financial resultsFinancial income in the first half 2022 was a gain of €4 million  compared to a gain of €36 million in the first half 2021.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35.6 million).The change in financial results notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions (€2 million in the first half 2022 compared with €3 million in the first half 2021) as a result of the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half 2021.Net lossThe first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 million  compared with a net profit of €9 million in the first half of 2021.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under IFRS for the first half 2022  with comparative figures for the first half 2021.Half-year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Revenues and other income Revenue 11 8 790 Other income 3 417 3 398 Revenues and other income 3 428 12 188 Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses) Research and development expenses (23 079) (17 599) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (8 229) Marketing and market access expenses (783) (460) Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) 179 Other operating income (expenses) 301 (423) Operating income (loss) (29 551) (14 344) Financial income (1) 40 822 6 182 Financial expenses (5 107) (2 197) Financial profit (loss) 35 714 3 985 Net profit (loss) before tax 6 163 (10 359) Income tax benefit (expense) 2 895 (40) Net profit (loss) 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to owners of the Company 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to non-controlling interests 0 0 Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.21 (0.21) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.19 (0.21) (1): Of which Financial income incurred by renegotiating the convertible bond debt OCEANE 35 578 0Further information is provided in the above “Key aspects of business activity” section of this press release and in the condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022 under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the management discussion of the results are provided in the appendix at the end of this press release.

Deferred income is recognized in revenue in proportion to progress on the double-blind ELATIVE study  in accordance with IFRS 15.Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half of 2022  as initially provided for in the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement signed in December 2021.The estimated amount of the research tax credit for the first half of 2022 is stable compared with the first half of 2021  reflecting the stability of eligible research expenditure.(2) Operating expenses by destinationThe tables below break operating expenses down by destination  mainly into research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  marketing and market access expenses  and restructuring and reorganization expenses  for the six months to June 30  2022 and June 30  2021.Half-year ended Of which : 2021/06/30 Raw Contracted Employee Other Depreciation  Gain / materials research and expenses expenses amortization (loss) on and development (maintenance  and disposal of consumables activities fees  travel  impairment property  used conducted by taxes…) charges plant and (in € thousands) third parties equipment Research and development expenses (23 079) (642) (15 029) (4 842) (2 334) (225) (6) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (73) (48) (3 336) (4 123) (51) 0 Marketing and market access expenses (783) (2) (1) (465) (316) 0 0 Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) (3) 0 0 (1 942) 158 0 Other operating income (expenses) 301 0 0 0 637 0 (336) TOTAL (32 979) (721) (15 078) (8 643) (8 078) (117) (343) (*) : including reversalsHalf-year ended Of which : 2022/06/30 Raw Contracted Employee Other Depreciation  Gain / materials research and expenses expenses amortization (loss) on and development (maintenance  and disposal of consumables activities fees  travel  impairment property  used conducted by taxes…) charges plant and (in € thousands) third parties equipment Research and development expenses (17 599) (1 052) (8 538) (4 889) (2 408) (712) 0 General and administrative expenses (8 229) (133) (38) (3 230) (4 580) (248) 0 Marketing and market access expenses (460) (2) 0 (272) (182) (3) 0 Reorganization and restructuring expenses 179 0 0 0 (1) 180 0 Other operating income (expenses) (423) 0 0 0 (422) 0 (1) TOTAL (26 532) (1 187) (8 576) (8 391) (7 594) (783) (1) (*) : including reversalsOperating expenses amounted to €26 532 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €32 979 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Research and development expenses  which amounted to €17 599 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €23 079 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  including contracted research and development costs  particularly clinical and pharmaceutical subcontracting (€8 538 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €15 029 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel assigned to research and development (€4 889 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 842 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  external expenses excluding contracted research and development  notably related to intellectual property (€2 408 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €2 334 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  purchases consumed for research and development activities (€1 052 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €642 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€712 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €225 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021);The decrease in research and development expenses is mainly attributable to the decrease in contracting costs. It reflects the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half of 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022.See Note 20 ""Operating Expense"" of the notes to the 2022 half year condensed consolidated financial statements on the determination of research and development expenses.General and administrative expenses  which amounted to €8 229 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €7 632 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including external expenses other than contracted research and development (€4 580 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 123 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel not assigned to research and development or marketing (€3 230 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €3 336 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€248 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €51 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021).The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to the increase in other external expenses excluding subcontracting  notably including insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors  and to the increase in net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense.Marketing and market access expenses   which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021).  which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021). Reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to €179 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €1 786 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.For comparison  the reorganization and restructuring expenses recorded in the first half of 2021 mainly included the expenses for the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds (representing an expense of €1 939 thousand in the first half of 2021) and readjustments of provisions relating to personnel expenses in connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l’Emploi – PSE) initiated in 2020 and the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study (representing a provision reversal of €158 thousand in the first half of 2021). None of any such non-recurring items linked to the Company’s reorganization initiated in mid-2020 were recorded in the first half of 2022  other than a residual provision reversal.(3) Operating expenses by typeBroken down by type rather than by destination  operating expenses mainly included:Contracted research and development activitiesContracted research and development expenses amounted to €8 576 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €15 078 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of approximately 43% attributable mainly to the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study.Employee expensesHalf-year ended (in € thousands) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Wages and salaries (5 734) (5 842) Social security costs (2 729) (2 317) Changes in pension provision 37 (84) Share-based compensation (217) (148) TOTAL (8 643) (8 391)Employee expenses excluding share-based payments amounted to €8 243 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 426 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of 2%. This change includes a small increase in headcount (from 124 at June 30  2021 to 127 at June 30  2022)  balanced with a change in employee profiles.See Note 20 ""Operating Expenses"" regarding the change in headcount by activity.As a reminder  as the Company had recognized a positive net result in 2021  a plan for the participation of employees in the benefits of the Company was put in place  for a total amount of €628 thousand  which was paid out during the first half of 2022 (without effect on the comparison between employee expenses for the first half of 2022 and those of the first half of 2021).The amount recognised in respect of non-cash share-based payments (warrants  redeemable warrants  stock options and free shares) was €148 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €217 thousand in the first half of 2021.See Note 21 ""Share-based Compensation"" .Other operating expensesOther operating expenses amounted to €7 594 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 078 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Fees  including legal  audit and accounting fees  fees for various advisors (banking  press relations  investor relations  communication  IT  market access)  as well as fees for some of the Company’s scientific advisors. This amount also includes intellectual property expenditure such as fees incurred by the Company for the filing and maintenance of its patents;Insurance-related expenses  including those incurred as a result of the Company’s listing on Nasdaq since 2019;Expenses related to the leasing  use and upkeep of the Group’s premises;Expenses related to external personnel made available to the Company (building management  security  reception  clinical and IT services);Business travel and conference expenses  which mainly relate to staff travel costs as well as the cost of attending scientific  medical  financial and business development conferences.The decline in other operating expenses compared with the first half of 2021 is mainly attributable to the absence of reorganization and restructuring expenses in the first half of 2022  partially offset by the increase in insurance expenses and fees.(4) Financial income (expense)Financial income for the six months to June 30  2022 was a gain of €3 985 thousand  compared with a gain of €35 714 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.This change notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions from €2 758 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €2 160 thousand in the first half of 2022  as well as the reduction in unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses on financial transactions from €2 291 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €0 in the first half of 2022  and the increase in unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains on financial transactions from €5 019 thousand in first half of 2021 to €6 032 thousand in the first half of 2022.Interest expense on financing transactions mainly reflects  in the first half of 2022 as in the first half of 2021  interest expense on the bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) issued in October 2017  bearing a coupon of 3.5% and discounting the bond debt at a rate of 8.8%. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half of 2021.Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial transactions relate mainly to exchange rate differences on cash investments in US dollars  the Company having chosen to keep part of its cash in US dollars  and therefore reflects change in the US dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2022.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half of 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35 578 thousand).(5) Net income (loss)The first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 399 thousand compared with a net profit of €9 058 thousand in the first half of 2021.

The first Delhaize wine bottling plant opened in 1880.Capacity of bottling 18.000 bottles per hour.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportation.Zaandam  the Netherlands  28 September  2022. Yesterday  in the presence of Belgian Prime Minister  Alexander De Croo  Delhaize opened its new wine bottling plant in Brussels. Standing at 9 500 square metres  it is the largest in the Benelux  representing an investment of €30 million. The plant will not only bottle wine for Delhaize customers  but also for other Ahold Delhaize brands in Europe and the U.S. and brands outside Ahold Delhaize. With this new plant  Ahold Delhaize strengthens its wine expertise in a sustainable and efficient way.In the bottling plant  wines from different vineyards from around the world arrive in bulk  in tankers or via containers. They are stored in large barrels in the wine cellar until they are ready to be bottled. Before the wine is bottled or boxed and goes to the store  the wine goes through a number of processes such as filtering. The filtration and storage processes are still carried out in the traditional way.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportationIt is the ambition to bottle a natural product such as wine in a sustainable way. That is why Delhaize has invested in sustainable systems such as water and heating for cleaning and maintaining the temperature in the building. Besides that  the wine is stored underground as there is an almost constant temperature in winter and summer without the need for cooling or heating. Importing wine from all over the world in bulk  instead of bottled wines not only halves transportation costs  it also reduces the wine's carbon emissions.Story continuesSharing expertiseDelhaize wants to continue to offer affordable high-quality wine to customers. The wine that is bottled in the new plant will not only be available in Delhaize stores  but also at other brands within Ahold Delhaize. By doing so  the brands are sharing expertise with a focus on innovation  sustainability and affordable prices for customers.Wouter Kolk  CEO Ahold Delhaize Europe & Indonesia: ""The great local brands of Ahold Delhaize all have their own special or local expertise. I am always proud when we can share knowledge in a way that benefits our other brands  and their customers.Today it becomes clear that Delhaize’s 140+ years of experience in bottling wines is taken to an even more ambitious level. My congratulations to the Delhaize team for this strong and sustainable achievement!""Art of the heritageWine has always been an important product for Delhaize. Shortly after Delhaize was founded in 1867  it opened its own wine bottling plant in 1880 in Brussels. This tradition continues with the opening of the new  high-tech wine bottling plant which can bottle the equivalent of 14 Olympic swimming pools per year and has a storage capacity of three million liters of wine.New wine bottling plant in numbers:Investment of €30 million9 500 m² surface areaServes multiple Ahold Delhaize brands: Delhaize  Albert Heijn  Gall & Gall  AB Vassilopoulos  Mega Image  Albert  Hannaford and Food Lion.Storage capacity of three million liters of wine18 000 bottles bottled per hourFour bottle lines8 km of pipes in which wine is transported150 different wines73 employees and wine expertsHalf of the bottles sold at Delhaize come from this bottling plant-ENDS-Cautionary noticeThis communication includes forward-looking statements.

This is attributable to the increase in ancillary services (+€2.5 million) linked to a rise in the chartering of barges in the Rhine basin.The Containers division saw consolidation of the results of the proprietary trading and investment policy  posting an increase in its revenue from activities of €25.2 million to €41.3 million. Sales of owned equipment related to the trading business rose by a sharp €18.8 million. Invoicing of ancillary services (pick-up charges) rose by €2.1 million. This increase reflects exceptional demand for containers among shipping companies amid the ongoing shortage. This trend was underpinned by leasing revenue  which was up by a sharp 45% over the period to €7.3 million.The management activity increased by €2.0 million to €4.8 million. Syndication fees were up and commissions on the sale of investor equipment also increased by €0.7 million. Management fees rose by €0.2 million.The Modular Building activity in Africa presented in the “Miscellaneous” line item failed to replicate its H1 2021 performance  posting a decrease of €4.7 million.SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PROFITABILITYGroup EBITDA stood at €29.5 million at 30 June 2022  up sharply (by €8.2 million) on H1 2021.This performance was mainly due to strong growth in leasing activity in the Freight Railcars and Containers divisions  which was underpinned by a decrease in operating expenses on Freight Railcars and the return of purchases and sales in the container trading activity.Syndication fees were also up in both divisions  with a significant increase in overall sales volumes in the Containers division.The Group share of net profit came to €7.6 million in H1 2022 (vs. €2.0 million a year earlier).FINANCIAL STRUCTUREOn 28 June 2022  Touax SCA issued a sustainability-linked bond of €33.3 million over 5 years  in order to:- repay part of its existing debt in the amount of €10 million and extend its maturity by 2 years to 2027;- reduce the cost of its financial resources by €0.9 million per year by buying back the full €26.6 million in undated deeply subordinated bonds.At 30 June 2022  the Group’s loan-to-value ratio was 56% compared with 52% at end-December 2021. This increase can be explained in part by the increase in investments in new equipment during the first six months of the year (in the Containers division in particular)  the financing ratio of which is higher  and by a portion of the buyback of the undated deeply subordinated bonds as of 30 June 2022 (€8.5 million repaid at that date  while the balance of €18.1 million was repaid on 1 August 2022).The Group’s net debt stood at €242 million  up €11 million year-to-date.Total shareholders’ equity at 30 June 2022 amounted to €170.2 million compared with €165.0 million at 31 December 2021. This figure includes €8.5 million in repayment on the hybrid capital.OUTLOOKTouax is not directly exposed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict  as it has no subsidiaries  customers or leased transport assets (with the possible exception of a few non-significant containers in transit) in Ukraine or Russia.In the current context of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates  Touax continues to roll out its activities with confidence  backed by a resilient business model and recurring revenues based on long-term contracts. The Group plans to continue to seize new asset acquisition opportunities over the coming months  while also adopting a prudent investment policy. The current inflationary environment has a positive effect on the valuation of the portfolio of assets.From a structural and medium- to long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from developments in relation to infrastructures  e-commerce  and intermodal logistics as they keep pace with the expectations of consumers  industrial groups  public authorities  lenders and investors around green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS29 September 2022: Video conference call to present the H1 results in French30 September 2022: Video conference call to present the H1 results in English14 November 2022: Q3 revenue from activitiesTOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

This decrease is mainly due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants in Brazil (which had started producing in the first half of 2021) and to a lower average level of resources (wind  sunshine and hydraulic flow) in the first half of 2022  whereas the resource in the first half of 2021 was at its long-term average.These factors of decrease in volume are partially offset by factors of increase:production benefits from the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3 in Brazil and Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao in France) and the first effects of the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 (mainly SSM1-2 in Brazil  Stavria in Greece and Carrière des Plaines in France); andproduction has benefited from the very strong momentum of Helexia.The increase in revenues (+7%) in a context of lower production (-19%) reflects a strong increase in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors:the contractual indexation of sales prices on indices equal or close to the consumer price index (inflation) at 83% of the revenues contractually indexed on inflation in 2021;the replacement of projects with low prices per MWh (VSM2 and VSM4  which benefit from some of the best wind levels in the world) with more tariffed projects  e.g. Helexia's solar roofs;the strengthening of the Brazilian real: with an average EUR/BRL rate of 5.55 in the first half of 2022  compared to 6.49 in the first half of 2021  which contributes to almost a third of the increase in the average selling price per megawatt hour.EBITDAEnergy Sales generate EBITDA of €53.6 million in the first half of 2022  up +8% (stable at constant exchange rates)  representing an EBITDA margin of 56.0%  i.e. +1 point compared to the first half of 2021.Detail by country:in Brazil  51% of Energy Sales  EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower production due to the divestment in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in H1 2021) and wind conditions that were less favourable than a year earlier and well below the long-term resource average. This loss of volume was almost entirely offset by a favourable exchange rate effect (strengthening of the Brazilian currency) and by contractual clauses indexing sales prices to inflation;in France  26% of Energy Sales  EBITDA benefits from the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon  Cacao and Helexia portfolio) despite a slight decrease in production due to lower wind;in the other countries (UK  Belgium  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Greece  Egypt and Jordan)  23% of Energy Sales  EBITDA is significantly higher  benefiting from the commissioning of the new Stavria solar plant in Greece in March  and the strong production of Helexia in Spain  Belgium and Portugal.Services: strong revenue and EBITDA growthFinancial key figuresIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2022 H1 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Revenues 166.9 95.9 +74% +71% Of which internal revenues 48.6 36.9 +32% +28% Of which external revenues 118.3 59.0 x2.0 x2.0 EBITDA 7.2 -5.1 N/A N/AIn the first-half of 2022 revenues from Services (internal and external) amount to €166.9 million  up +74% (+71% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting in particular from the strong growth in revenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments. EBITDA moves into positive territory despite the weight of development costs linked to the prospecting of new projects  which remains significant in order to contribute to the Group's future growth: the pipeline thus increased from 10.7 GW at the end of June 2021 to 13.6 GW at the end of June 2022  an increase of +27%.Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementRevenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments amount to €152.0 million in the first half of 2022  up +90% (+88% at constant exchange rates) compared to the first half of 2021. EBITDA from this segment increases by €12.0 million in first half of 2022 to €6.8 million. Over the period  Development benefits from the sale of projects to third party customers  including disposals that were shifted from 2021 to 2022 representing an EBITDA of approximately €10 million. In addition  Construction and Equipment Procurement benefit from the strong commercial momentum with third party customers. Voltalia has managed to control its costs  in a general context of inflation in material costs  thanks to the strength of its integrated model  which enables it to pool its equipment purchases and to finely control its expenses.Operations & MaintenanceRevenues of the Operations & Maintenance segment reach €15 million  up +17% (+12% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from contracts in Europe and Latin America.

Consolidated EBITDA amount to €47.4 million  up +39% compared to 2021.Depreciation  amortisation and provisions amount to €31.8 million  down -7%. Depreciation is up  due to the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 and the full-year effect of the plants commissioned in 2021  while provisions are down after significant allocations in the first half of 2021.At €13.9 million  net financial expenses are down -23%. Interest earned on deposits in Brazil (notably the reserve accounts required for project financing)  which rose sharply with the increase in short-term rates  more than offset the financial charges related to long-term project financing  the outstanding amounts of which are rising in line with investments on Voltalia's three continents.After taking into account minority interests and taxes  the seasonal net loss (Group share) is divided by almost 5.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at 30 June 2022 is €2.6 billion  up 23% at current exchange rates and 19% at constant exchange rates  with the difference coming from the appreciation of the Brazilian real with a EUR/BRL rate of 6.32 at the end of December 2021 compared to 5.44 at the end of June 2022.In € million 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Goodwill 80 78 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 1 846 1 510 Cash and cash equivalents 331 291 Other assets 334 234 Total assets 2 591 2 113 Equity  Group share 757 672 Minorities 108 62 Financial debt 1 398 1 050 Provisions 12 14 Other current and non-current liabilities 316 315 Total liabilities 2 591 2 113The increase in the Group's assets is mainly due to the increase in the portfolio of power plants in operation and under construction  with fixed assets up by +22% to €1 846 million.The Group's cash position at the end of June 2022 is €331 million  up +14%.This level should be compared to total financial debt of €1 398 million at the end of June 2022  up +33%  reflecting a gearing6 that remains low  at 55%.Over the period  operational activity (excluding investments) generated cash flow of €19 million.PROJECT PORTFOLIO UNDER DEVELOPMENTThe portfolio of projects under development  to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  is growing strongly to 13.6 GW at 30 June 2022  i.e. +27% compared to 30 June 2021.With the strategy of geographical diversification promoted by the Group  this portfolio is currently distributed as follows: 42% in Latin America  39% in Europe and 19% in Africa. In terms of technology  solar energy is in the majority  at 66%  followed by wind energy at 30% and other technologies at 4%.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JULY 1st 2022Construction of a 140 MW solar project in Albania7Voltalia is launching the construction of the Karavasta solar power plant  which was awarded a 30-year concession in 2020. Under the terms of the tender  Karavasta will sell 50% of the electricity through a 15-year sales contract to the Albanian public operator  while the remainder of the production will be sold through long-term contracts to private operators. The plant is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023.Construction of two UK solar projects of 90 MW in total8After winning the recent CfD AR4 auction in the UK for two solar projects  Clifton Solar and Higher Stockbridge Solar  of 45 MW each  Voltalia has launched their construction  with respective commissioning scheduled for the last quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.Construction of 50.6 MW solar projects in Portugal9Voltalia has launched the construction of five projects for a total of 50.6 MW  launching Garrido  its new Portuguese complex of small solar power plants. The electricity will be sold through very long-term sales contracts signed with companies that will consume the electricity (corporate PPA).Construction of a 23.6 MW wind farm in France10The Sud Vannier wind farm is located in the Haute-Marne region  approximately 25 kilometres south-east of the town of Langres and 65 kilometres north-east of the town of Dijon. It has a 20-year sales contract with a guaranteed tariff. Commissioning is planned for the first half of 2023.Signature of a CPPA with Leroy Merlin for the construction of a 30 MW plant11Leroy Merlin and Voltalia have signed a CPPA for the production of an additional solar power plant specifically built for Leroy Merlin. This agreement will enable Leroy Merlin to supply approximately 15% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy.

Thanks to the acquisition of Versantis which will be completed shortly  we will soon be able to have six ongoing programs at all stages of development - preclinical  Phase 1  Phase 2 and Phase 3 - in five different indications. This should provide us with a steady stream of news over the next few months and years  with important clinical data in a relatively short term.

Key aspects of the first half 2022 financial resultsCash and cash equivalentsAs of June 30  2022  GENFIT had €209 million in cash and cash equivalents (€259 million as of December 31  2021).In the first half of 2022  these cash flows include the disbursement of €24 million corresponding to the VAT on the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021  as well as the disbursement of the employee participation to the profits of GENFIT SA for a total of €628 thousand.Operating incomeOperating income amounted to €12 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €3 million in the first half 2021).The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the partial recognition of deferred income in accordance with IFRS 15 of €40.0 million following the conclusion of the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with Ipsen in December 2021. Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half 2022.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €27 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €33 million in the first half 2021).The decrease in operating expenses is due to:The decrease in contracting costs which amounted to €9 million in the first half 2022 compared with €15 million in the first half 2021  reflecting the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022Research and development expenses amounted to €18 million in the six months to June 30  2022 compared with €23 million in the six months to June 30  2021The decrease in reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to a total cost of €2 million in the first half 2021 (including expenses relating to the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds representing €1.9 million in the first half 2021). This had a positive impact of €0.2 million in the first-half 2022 due to the residual provision reversalSuch decreases were partially offset by the increase in the general and administrative expenses (€8.2 million in the first half 2022  compared to €7.6 million euros in the first half 2021) mainly attributable to the increase in insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors.Financial resultsFinancial income in the first half 2022 was a gain of €4 million  compared to a gain of €36 million in the first half 2021.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35.6 million).The change in financial results notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions (€2 million in the first half 2022 compared with €3 million in the first half 2021) as a result of the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half 2021.Net lossThe first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 million  compared with a net profit of €9 million in the first half of 2021.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under IFRS for the first half 2022  with comparative figures for the first half 2021.Half-year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Revenues and other income Revenue 11 8 790 Other income 3 417 3 398 Revenues and other income 3 428 12 188 Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses) Research and development expenses (23 079) (17 599) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (8 229) Marketing and market access expenses (783) (460) Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) 179 Other operating income (expenses) 301 (423) Operating income (loss) (29 551) (14 344) Financial income (1) 40 822 6 182 Financial expenses (5 107) (2 197) Financial profit (loss) 35 714 3 985 Net profit (loss) before tax 6 163 (10 359) Income tax benefit (expense) 2 895 (40) Net profit (loss) 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to owners of the Company 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to non-controlling interests 0 0 Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.21 (0.21) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.19 (0.21) (1): Of which Financial income incurred by renegotiating the convertible bond debt OCEANE 35 578 0Further information is provided in the above “Key aspects of business activity” section of this press release and in the condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022 under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the management discussion of the results are provided in the appendix at the end of this press release.

Deferred income is recognized in revenue in proportion to progress on the double-blind ELATIVE study  in accordance with IFRS 15.Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half of 2022  as initially provided for in the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement signed in December 2021.The estimated amount of the research tax credit for the first half of 2022 is stable compared with the first half of 2021  reflecting the stability of eligible research expenditure.(2) Operating expenses by destinationThe tables below break operating expenses down by destination  mainly into research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  marketing and market access expenses  and restructuring and reorganization expenses  for the six months to June 30  2022 and June 30  2021.Half-year ended Of which : 2021/06/30 Raw Contracted Employee Other Depreciation  Gain / materials research and expenses expenses amortization (loss) on and development (maintenance  and disposal of consumables activities fees  travel  impairment property  used conducted by taxes…) charges plant and (in € thousands) third parties equipment Research and development expenses (23 079) (642) (15 029) (4 842) (2 334) (225) (6) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (73) (48) (3 336) (4 123) (51) 0 Marketing and market access expenses (783) (2) (1) (465) (316) 0 0 Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) (3) 0 0 (1 942) 158 0 Other operating income (expenses) 301 0 0 0 637 0 (336) TOTAL (32 979) (721) (15 078) (8 643) (8 078) (117) (343) (*) : including reversalsHalf-year ended Of which : 2022/06/30 Raw Contracted Employee Other Depreciation  Gain / materials research and expenses expenses amortization (loss) on and development (maintenance  and disposal of consumables activities fees  travel  impairment property  used conducted by taxes…) charges plant and (in € thousands) third parties equipment Research and development expenses (17 599) (1 052) (8 538) (4 889) (2 408) (712) 0 General and administrative expenses (8 229) (133) (38) (3 230) (4 580) (248) 0 Marketing and market access expenses (460) (2) 0 (272) (182) (3) 0 Reorganization and restructuring expenses 179 0 0 0 (1) 180 0 Other operating income (expenses) (423) 0 0 0 (422) 0 (1) TOTAL (26 532) (1 187) (8 576) (8 391) (7 594) (783) (1) (*) : including reversalsOperating expenses amounted to €26 532 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €32 979 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Research and development expenses  which amounted to €17 599 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €23 079 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  including contracted research and development costs  particularly clinical and pharmaceutical subcontracting (€8 538 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €15 029 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel assigned to research and development (€4 889 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 842 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  external expenses excluding contracted research and development  notably related to intellectual property (€2 408 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €2 334 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  purchases consumed for research and development activities (€1 052 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €642 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€712 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €225 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021);The decrease in research and development expenses is mainly attributable to the decrease in contracting costs. It reflects the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half of 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022.See Note 20 ""Operating Expense"" of the notes to the 2022 half year condensed consolidated financial statements on the determination of research and development expenses.General and administrative expenses  which amounted to €8 229 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €7 632 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including external expenses other than contracted research and development (€4 580 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 123 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel not assigned to research and development or marketing (€3 230 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €3 336 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€248 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €51 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021).The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to the increase in other external expenses excluding subcontracting  notably including insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors  and to the increase in net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense.Marketing and market access expenses   which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021).Reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to €179 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €1 786 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.For comparison  the reorganization and restructuring expenses recorded in the first half of 2021 mainly included the expenses for the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds (representing an expense of €1 939 thousand in the first half of 2021) and readjustments of provisions relating to personnel expenses in connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l’Emploi – PSE) initiated in 2020 and the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study (representing a provision reversal of €158 thousand in the first half of 2021). None of any such non-recurring items linked to the Company’s reorganization initiated in mid-2020 were recorded in the first half of 2022  other than a residual provision reversal.(3) Operating expenses by typeBroken down by type rather than by destination  operating expenses mainly included:Contracted research and development activitiesContracted research and development expenses amounted to €8 576 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €15 078 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of approximately 43% attributable mainly to the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study.Employee expensesHalf-year ended (in € thousands) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Wages and salaries (5 734) (5 842) Social security costs (2 729) (2 317) Changes in pension provision 37 (84) Share-based compensation (217) (148) TOTAL (8 643) (8 391)Employee expenses excluding share-based payments amounted to €8 243 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 426 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of 2%. This change includes a small increase in headcount (from 124 at June 30  2021 to 127 at June 30  2022)  balanced with a change in employee profiles.See Note 20 ""Operating Expenses"" regarding the change in headcount by activity.As a reminder  as the Company had recognized a positive net result in 2021  a plan for the participation of employees in the benefits of the Company was put in place  for a total amount of €628 thousand  which was paid out during the first half of 2022 (without effect on the comparison between employee expenses for the first half of 2022 and those of the first half of 2021).The amount recognised in respect of non-cash share-based payments (warrants  redeemable warrants  stock options and free shares) was €148 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €217 thousand in the first half of 2021.See Note 21 ""Share-based Compensation"" .Other operating expensesOther operating expenses amounted to €7 594 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 078 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Fees  including legal  audit and accounting fees  fees for various advisors (banking  press relations  investor relations  communication  IT  market access)  as well as fees for some of the Company’s scientific advisors. This amount also includes intellectual property expenditure such as fees incurred by the Company for the filing and maintenance of its patents;Insurance-related expenses  including those incurred as a result of the Company’s listing on Nasdaq since 2019;Expenses related to the leasing  use and upkeep of the Group’s premises;Expenses related to external personnel made available to the Company (building management  security  reception  clinical and IT services);Business travel and conference expenses  which mainly relate to staff travel costs as well as the cost of attending scientific  medical  financial and business development conferences.The decline in other operating expenses compared with the first half of 2021 is mainly attributable to the absence of reorganization and restructuring expenses in the first half of 2022  partially offset by the increase in insurance expenses and fees.(4) Financial income (expense)Financial income for the six months to June 30  2022 was a gain of €3 985 thousand  compared with a gain of €35 714 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.This change notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions from €2 758 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €2 160 thousand in the first half of 2022  as well as the reduction in unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses on financial transactions from €2 291 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €0 in the first half of 2022  and the increase in unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains on financial transactions from €5 019 thousand in first half of 2021 to €6 032 thousand in the first half of 2022.Interest expense on financing transactions mainly reflects  in the first half of 2022 as in the first half of 2021  interest expense on the bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) issued in October 2017  bearing a coupon of 3.5% and discounting the bond debt at a rate of 8.8%. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half of 2021.Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial transactions relate mainly to exchange rate differences on cash investments in US dollars  the Company having chosen to keep part of its cash in US dollars  and therefore reflects change in the US dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2022.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half of 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35 578 thousand).(5) Net income (loss)The first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 399 thousand compared with a net profit of €9 058 thousand in the first half of 2021. As a reminder  the net profit for 2021 amounted to €67 259 thousand.Comments on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position at June 30  2022As of June 30  2022  the total of the Group’s statement of financial position was €237 049thousand compared with €281 720 thousand as of December 31  2021.As of June 30  2022  the Group’s cash  cash equivalents and other financial assets amounted to €213 932 thousand  compared with €263 187 thousand as of 31 December 31  2021Cash management: with €209 115 thousand in cash and cash equivalents at June 30  2021  and based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis’ programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate – based on current assumptions and without taking exceptional events into account – that funding of the Group’s corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.(1) Non current assetsNon-current assets  which include intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and other financial assets  were stable at €13 519 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €13 623 thousand as of December 31  2021(2) Current assetsCurrent assets amounted to €223 530 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €268 097 thousand as of December 31  2021.Cash and cash equivalents decreased from €258 756 thousand as of December 31  2021 to €209 115 thousand as of June 30  2022  a decline of 19%.

The limited review of the half-yearly financial information by the auditor of the Company has been completed and his report has been published on the web site.The consolidated financial statements (condensed interim financial statements and notes)  reviewed by the auditor  as well as the presentation of the 2022 half-year results are available on the Solutions 30 website www.solutions30.com  under Investor Relations.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chairman of the Management Board of Solutions 30  states:“Business in the first half of the year was characterized by the continued transition in the French market and dynamic growth of activities outside France.Performance in France has been penalized by our historical markets reaching maturity and by the delay in our growth drivers—especially for the energy transition—due to supply chain disruptions. We now find ourselves in the midst of an operational transition. This is particularly true in the telecom market  which has undergone abrupt changes after peaking in the last two years. Our organization has had to adapt to this new situation and to the new demands of our customers  which is impacting all our processes and eroding our margins this year.Story continuesIn the Benelux and other countries  business is growing dynamically  by around 30%. This underlying trend is supported by the deployment of fiber networks in almost all the countries we operate in and by new subscriber connections. In the Benelux  where we have reached critical size  our model has become virtuous  combining business growth with increasing margins. In other areas  where we have not yet reached critical size  we are financing rapid ramp-ups  which requires recruiting and training technicians. This has an automatic impact on short-term profitability  but puts us into a position to reach critical mass and maximize value creation for our shareholders.In a volatile and rising interest rate environment  our focus is on organic growth and managing our cash flow. We have reached a low point and we anticipate a recovery in the final quarter that will continue throughout 2023. In the longer term  and despite an uncertain macroeconomic context  the group’s outlook remains favorable given Solutions 30’s positioning at the crossroads of promising structural trends—the digital transformation and the transition to more efficient and independent sources of energy.”Key figures – Consolidated dataIn millions of euros 06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change Revenue 444.3 441.3 0.7% Operating margin (Adjusted EBITDA) 29.6 49.5 -40.2% As a % of revenue 6.7% 11.2% Adjusted EBIT(1) 6.7 29.6 -77.5% As a % of revenue 1.5% 6.7% Operating income (EBIT) -8.9 17.5 - As a % of revenue -2.0% 4.0% Consolidated net income -11.3 14.6 - As a % of revenue -2.5% 3.3% Net income  group share -12.3 14.1 - As a % of revenue -2.8% 3.2% Free cash flow(1) -15.8 0.9 -16.7 Financial structure figures 06/30/2022 12/31/2021 Change Equity 183.2 191.6 -8.4 Net debt 76.6 33 1 43.5 Net bank debt(1) -20.4 -52.3 31.9(1) See glossary at the end of this documentActivityConsolidated revenueSolutions 30’s consolidated half-year revenue for 2022 amounted to €444.3 million  up +0.7% (-1.5% on an organic basis). After a limited decline in the first quarter  the group returned to modest growth in the second quarter. Solutions 30 posted the highest second quarter in its history despite an unfavorable base effect linked to record activity in the first half of 2021 caused by the boom in ultra-fast internet roll-outs in France during the COVID crisis.In France  performance continues to be penalized by a maturing fiber-optic market and the scheduled halt to smart meter roll-outs  while new activities are starting up more slowly than expected. Although sales activity is encouraging  revenue generation has slowed due to the supply disruptions affecting the photovoltaic and electric vehicle charging station markets  with historically long delivery times for vehicles.Elsewhere in Europe  business is buoyant with growth rates of around 30%. Solutions 30 has succeeded in capturing significant market share where fiber-optic deployments are booming.A virtuous business model based on 3 pillarsSolutions 30’s business model is based on 3 fundamental pillars:Scalability . Solutions 30 prefers markets where its call-outs and operating methods can be standardized to maximize economies of scale. Density . With its dense territorial coverage  Solutions 30 can reduce its response times and optimize the travel time of its technicians. Automation. The group’s IT platform automates repetitive and time-consuming tasks and optimizes technicians’ schedules and routes in real time.These three pillars underpin the group’s profitability and explain its historically profitable growth trajectory  which has enabled it to finance all its organic growth from equity since its creation in 2003.Transition of the business model in France:In the telecoms segment  which accounts for 72% of Solutions 30’s revenue in France  the group is pursuing its operational transition in a now mature market after five years of exponential growth. As explained at the end of July  the geographical redeployment of one of the group’s major contracts—following a call for tender that redistributed activities among the service provider’s partners—is weighing on the operational efficiency of the French subsidiaries  especially in the southern half of France. To meet the new parameters of this contract  Solutions 30  like its competitors  has to review all its processes and methods  recruit and train staff to obtain new authorizations  and readjust its structures locally to prepare for the future. This has a significant impact on the group’s operating profitability  as it has to bear the costs of personnel who are not yet productive  while the processes  which are still being adjusted  are not yet standardized. In addition  and pending the definitive stabilization of the geographic distribution of the contract  Solutions 30 has chosen to keep in place structures that are not operating at full capacity.In the energy segment  Solutions 30 is positioned—thanks to its historical know-how—in the markets for installing and maintaining electric charging stations  photovoltaic panels  and intelligent sensors aimed at optimizing energy consumption. These new businesses are currently experiencing supply chain disruptions and are ramping up more slowly than anticipated  preventing them from compensating for the end of smart electricity meter roll-outs. During this phase  Solutions 30 is adjusting its processes and adapting its operational organization.Overall  in France  the group has implemented an action plan aimed at returning to growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan is based on 3 pillars:Gain market share in the mature telecoms sector  where a second wave of consolidation is expected to take place as the market remains relatively fragmented. The development of new  fast-growing activities  particularly in the buoyant energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles. The strengthening of synergies between various activities  accompanied by a reassignment of technicians to activities with greater potential.In the Benelux  the group is rolling out its business model and  thanks to the critical size achieved in this region  Solutions 30 is slightly improving margins despite the fact that major fiber contracts are just getting underway.In the other countries  the group needs to reach critical size  i.e. about €100 million in revenue per country  to start optimizing its profitability. The growth of fiber throughout Europe and the group’s proven ability to capture market share should enable it to achieve this objective in 2 to 5 years depending on the country. In these countries  the focus is on revenue growth and the signing of major contracts  as is the case in Italy and the United Kingdom  where the start-up and ramp-up phases  which are currently weighing on profitability  are underway. These start-up phases require the creation of new organizational structures and more robust processes  the adoption of new IT tools  and new trainings for on-site teams.ProfitabilityFigures by geographical area are detailed below:06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change France Revenue 221.9 270.3 -17.9% EBITDA 18.8 41.9 -55.1% EBITDA margin (%) 8.5% 15.5% Benelux Revenue 98.4 74.9 31.3% EBITDA 13.7 10.4 31.7% EBITDA margin (%) 13.9% 13.8% Other countries Revenue 124.0 96.1 29.0% EBITDA 2.4 1.7 41.2% EBITDA margin (%) 2.0% 1.8%For the group as a whole  adjusted EBITDA is down 40% to €29.6 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €49.5 million a year earlier  attributable exclusively to the activity in France as explained above.Operating costs have increased by +5.9% compared to the first half of 2021 and represent 84.1% of revenue  compared to 79.9% a year earlier  while structural costs increased by 4.9% to €40.9 million  compared to €39.0 million a year earlier.After accounting for €9.1 million in impairments and operational provisions  and after amortizing the usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  worth €13.8 million  adjusted EBIT stood at €6.7 million at June 30  2022  compared to €29.6 million a year earlier.There were €10.3 million in non-current operating expenses during the first half of 2022  mainly related to restructuring costs and exceptional transition costs incurred in connection with new contracts won in France following the above-mentioned tender (€6.7 million)  to exceptional costs incurred by the group to respond to an aggressive defamation campaign (€1.9 million)  and to expenses related to share-based payments pursuant to IFRS 2 (€1.2 million).Customer relationship amortization amounted to €7.1 million at June 30  2022  compared to €7.3 million a year earlier.Financial income represents an expense of €5.3 million from the adjustment of contingent consideration (earnout) values for €3.8 million. In the first half of 2021  financial income amounted to +€0.7 million.After including tax income of €3.0 million due to loss carryforwards  compared to an expense of €3.6 million a year earlier  the group share of net income amounted to -€12.3 million  compared to €14.1 million for the same period in 2021.Financial structureAt June 30  2022  the group had €183.2 million in equity  compared to €191.6 million at December 31  2021. The group had €85.0 million in gross cash  compared to €129.8 million at the end of December 2021. Gross bank debt stood at €64.6 million  compared to €77.5 million six months earlier  due to scheduled debt repayments. The group had €20.4 million in cash net of debt at the end of June 2022  compared to €52.3 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2021.Including €75.3 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €21.7 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the total net debt amounts to €76.6 million.The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.3 and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 41.8%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €62.0 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €92.3 million at December 31  2021. The decrease in the amount of receivables assigned is explained by the time required to ramp up new contracts. Despite the rising interest rate environment  factoring remains the most competitive short-term financing tool. Its cost remains largely under control thanks to the quality of the credit ratings of Solutions 30’s customers.Operating cash flow amounted to €15.7 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €37.9 million in the first half of 2021. The ramp-up of contracts and the reduced use of factoring generated an increase of €22.2 million in working capital requirements  which amounted to -€2.8 million. Adjusted for the change related to factoring  working capital decreased by €8.1 million.Cash flow from business activities during the first half of 2022 stood at -€6.5 million  compared to €7.2 million a year earlier  and net investments reached €9.4 million.This results in an overall free cash flow of -€15.8 million  compared to breakeven free cash flow in the first half of 2021.OutlookIn the second half of 2022  growth should accelerate and continue to be driven by activities outside France. Full-year revenue is expected to be about €900 million  compared with €874 million in 2021. In terms of profitability  the group should return to a more normal  double-digit EBITDA at the end of the year  but this will remain below 10% over the entire year. This objective is based on the rate renegotiations undertaken with the group’s customers  which began to take effect during the second quarter  as well as on the acceleration of the deployment and start-up of new contracts in Belgium  the Netherlands  Poland and the United Kingdom.From the end of this year and into 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.In each of these business segments  Solutions 30 has excellent references and a solid order book. With €770 million in orders taken since the beginning of the year  Solutions 30 is gaining market share in Europe  particularly in the deployment of fiber and the connection of homes to the ultra-fast network. In this segment alone  the group has won deals worth a total of €2.6 billion  to be delivered over the next 3 to 5 years. This figure includes new contracts and optical fiber renewals (deployment and connections). In the energy sector  Solutions 30 is pursuing it efforts  despite the shortages that are impacting supply chains. With 48 active customers for charging stations (charging service providers  energy companies  car manufacturers  and even manufacturers of charging stations)  more than 20 000 charging points installed by 2022  nearly 1 000 solar panel installations already completed  and prestigious customer references  Solutions 30 is ideally positioned to become a major player in the European energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q3 Revenue Report October 27  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

The first Delhaize wine bottling plant opened in 1880.Capacity of bottling 18.000 bottles per hour.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportation.Zaandam  the Netherlands  28 September  2022. Yesterday  in the presence of Belgian Prime Minister  Alexander De Croo  Delhaize opened its new wine bottling plant in Brussels. Standing at 9 500 square metres  it is the largest in the Benelux  representing an investment of €30 million. The plant will not only bottle wine for Delhaize customers  but also for other Ahold Delhaize brands in Europe and the U.S. and brands outside Ahold Delhaize. With this new plant  Ahold Delhaize strengthens its wine expertise in a sustainable and efficient way.In the bottling plant  wines from different vineyards from around the world arrive in bulk  in tankers or via containers. They are stored in large barrels in the wine cellar until they are ready to be bottled. Before the wine is bottled or boxed and goes to the store  the wine goes through a number of processes such as filtering. The filtration and storage processes are still carried out in the traditional way.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportationIt is the ambition to bottle a natural product such as wine in a sustainable way. That is why Delhaize has invested in sustainable systems such as water and heating for cleaning and maintaining the temperature in the building. Besides that  the wine is stored underground as there is an almost constant temperature in winter and summer without the need for cooling or heating. Importing wine from all over the world in bulk  instead of bottled wines not only halves transportation costs  it also reduces the wine's carbon emissions.Sharing expertiseDelhaize wants to continue to offer affordable high-quality wine to customers. The wine that is bottled in the new plant will not only be available in Delhaize stores  but also at other brands within Ahold Delhaize. By doing so  the brands are sharing expertise with a focus on innovation  sustainability and affordable prices for customers.Wouter Kolk  CEO Ahold Delhaize Europe & Indonesia: ""The great local brands of Ahold Delhaize all have their own special or local expertise. I am always proud when we can share knowledge in a way that benefits our other brands  and their customers.Today it becomes clear that Delhaize’s 140+ years of experience in bottling wines is taken to an even more ambitious level. My congratulations to the Delhaize team for this strong and sustainable achievement!""Art of the heritageWine has always been an important product for Delhaize. Shortly after Delhaize was founded in 1867  it opened its own wine bottling plant in 1880 in Brussels. This tradition continues with the opening of the new  high-tech wine bottling plant which can bottle the equivalent of 14 Olympic swimming pools per year and has a storage capacity of three million liters of wine.New wine bottling plant in numbers:Investment of €30 million9 500 m² surface areaServes multiple Ahold Delhaize brands: Delhaize  Albert Heijn  Gall & Gall  AB Vassilopoulos  Mega Image  Albert  Hannaford and Food Lion.Storage capacity of three million liters of wine18 000 bottles bottled per hourFour bottle lines8 km of pipes in which wine is transported150 different wines73 employees and wine expertsHalf of the bottles sold at Delhaize come from this bottling plant-ENDS-Cautionary noticeThis communication includes forward-looking statements.

With the 2022-2023 term beginning next month  senior health law legal analyst Sheila Lynch-Afryl revisited the top cases from the previous term  outlining the major takeaways and how Court watchers can prepare for what's next.In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization   the Court overturned the abortion protections afforded by Roe v. Wade  and ruled that individual states have the power to set limits on abortion. In the wake of this ruling  state laws curtailing abortions have taken effect  while the Biden Administration and Congress attempt to protect abortion rights despite the decision. District courts have already come to conflicting decisions about whether EMTALA preempts state laws prohibiting abortion. Could this important issue also come before the Supreme Court during its 2022-23 term?  the Court overturned the abortion protections afforded by and ruled that individual states have the power to set limits on abortion. In the wake of this ruling  state laws curtailing abortions have taken effect  while the Biden Administration and Congress attempt to protect abortion rights despite the decision. District courts have already come to conflicting decisions about whether EMTALA preempts state laws prohibiting abortion. Could this important issue also come before the Supreme Court during its 2022-23 term? In Biden v. Louisiana   the Court stayed the injunctions that barred enforcement of the CMS COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 24 states  finding that HHS had the statutory authority to require providers to protect their Medicare and Medicaid patients' health and safety. According to the majority  ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a ""dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first  do no harm."" With HHS' declared COVID public health emergency probably ending early next year  the industry will have to stay vigilant about CMS' unwinding of Medicare and Medicaid flexibilities.  the Court stayed the injunctions that barred enforcement of the CMS COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 24 states  finding that HHS had the statutory authority to require providers to protect their Medicare and Medicaid patients' health and safety.

With HHS' declared COVID public health emergency probably ending early next year  the industry will have to stay vigilant about CMS' unwinding of Medicare and Medicaid flexibilities. In American Hospital Association v. Becerra  the Court unanimously invalidated a final rule that reduced drug reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals. The Court concluded that HHS didn't conduct a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs  as required by the Medicare statute. Although the Court has yet to grant cert for a Medicare case for its next term  a False Claims Act case that involved Medicare billing is currently on its docket.Who: Sheila Lynch-Afryl  J.D.

This decrease is mainly due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants in Brazil (which had started producing in the first half of 2021) and to a lower average level of resources (wind  sunshine and hydraulic flow) in the first half of 2022  whereas the resource in the first half of 2021 was at its long-term average.These factors of decrease in volume are partially offset by factors of increase:production benefits from the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3 in Brazil and Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao in France) and the first effects of the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 (mainly SSM1-2 in Brazil  Stavria in Greece and Carrière des Plaines in France); andproduction has benefited from the very strong momentum of Helexia.The increase in revenues (+7%) in a context of lower production (-19%) reflects a strong increase in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors:the contractual indexation of sales prices on indices equal or close to the consumer price index (inflation) at 83% of the revenues contractually indexed on inflation in 2021;the replacement of projects with low prices per MWh (VSM2 and VSM4  which benefit from some of the best wind levels in the world) with more tariffed projects  e.g. Helexia's solar roofs;the strengthening of the Brazilian real: with an average EUR/BRL rate of 5.55 in the first half of 2022  compared to 6.49 in the first half of 2021  which contributes to almost a third of the increase in the average selling price per megawatt hour.EBITDAEnergy Sales generate EBITDA of €53.6 million in the first half of 2022  up +8% (stable at constant exchange rates)  representing an EBITDA margin of 56.0%  i.e. +1 point compared to the first half of 2021.Detail by country:in Brazil  51% of Energy Sales  EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower production due to the divestment in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in H1 2021) and wind conditions that were less favourable than a year earlier and well below the long-term resource average. This loss of volume was almost entirely offset by a favourable exchange rate effect (strengthening of the Brazilian currency) and by contractual clauses indexing sales prices to inflation;in France  26% of Energy Sales  EBITDA benefits from the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon  Cacao and Helexia portfolio) despite a slight decrease in production due to lower wind;in the other countries (UK  Belgium  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Greece  Egypt and Jordan)  23% of Energy Sales  EBITDA is significantly higher  benefiting from the commissioning of the new Stavria solar plant in Greece in March  and the strong production of Helexia in Spain  Belgium and Portugal.Services: strong revenue and EBITDA growthFinancial key figuresIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2022 H1 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Revenues 166.9 95.9 +74% +71% Of which internal revenues 48.6 36.9 +32% +28% Of which external revenues 118.3 59.0 x2.0 x2.0 EBITDA 7.2 -5.1 N/A N/AIn the first-half of 2022 revenues from Services (internal and external) amount to €166.9 million  up +74% (+71% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting in particular from the strong growth in revenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments. EBITDA moves into positive territory despite the weight of development costs linked to the prospecting of new projects  which remains significant in order to contribute to the Group's future growth: the pipeline thus increased from 10.7 GW at the end of June 2021 to 13.6 GW at the end of June 2022  an increase of +27%.Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementRevenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments amount to €152.0 million in the first half of 2022  up +90% (+88% at constant exchange rates) compared to the first half of 2021. EBITDA from this segment increases by €12.0 million in first half of 2022 to €6.8 million. Over the period  Development benefits from the sale of projects to third party customers  including disposals that were shifted from 2021 to 2022 representing an EBITDA of approximately €10 million. In addition  Construction and Equipment Procurement benefit from the strong commercial momentum with third party customers. Voltalia has managed to control its costs  in a general context of inflation in material costs  thanks to the strength of its integrated model  which enables it to pool its equipment purchases and to finely control its expenses.Operations & MaintenanceRevenues of the Operations & Maintenance segment reach €15 million  up +17% (+12% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from contracts in Europe and Latin America. The segment posts an EBITDA of €0.4 million (x4)  confirming the positive profitability achieved in 2021.OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 60.7 44.3 +37% +27% Eliminations and corporate -13.3 -10.1 +31% +27% EBITDA 47.4 34.1 +39% +27% Depreciation  amortisation  and provisions -31.8 -34.3 -7% -13% Operating revenue (EBIT) 15.6 -0.2 N/A N/A Financial result -13.9 -18.1 -23% -34% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -8.4 -4.1 x2.1 x1.9 Minority interests 2.1 0.9 x2.4 x2.1 Net result (Group share) -4.6 -21.4 ÷4.6 ÷4.5EBITDA before eliminations and corporate items increases by +37% to €60.7 million. Eliminations are up  reflecting the growth in internal activity. Corporate items are also up  but at a much lower rate than overall activity. Consolidated EBITDA is €47.4 million  up +39% compared to 2021. Consolidated EBITDA amount to €47.4 million  up +39% compared to 2021.Depreciation  amortisation and provisions amount to €31.8 million  down -7%. Depreciation is up  due to the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 and the full-year effect of the plants commissioned in 2021  while provisions are down after significant allocations in the first half of 2021.At €13.9 million  net financial expenses are down -23%. Interest earned on deposits in Brazil (notably the reserve accounts required for project financing)  which rose sharply with the increase in short-term rates  more than offset the financial charges related to long-term project financing  the outstanding amounts of which are rising in line with investments on Voltalia's three continents.After taking into account minority interests and taxes  the seasonal net loss (Group share) is divided by almost 5.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at 30 June 2022 is €2.6 billion  up 23% at current exchange rates and 19% at constant exchange rates  with the difference coming from the appreciation of the Brazilian real with a EUR/BRL rate of 6.32 at the end of December 2021 compared to 5.44 at the end of June 2022.In € million 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Goodwill 80 78 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 1 846 1 510 Cash and cash equivalents 331 291 Other assets 334 234 Total assets 2 591 2 113 Equity  Group share 757 672 Minorities 108 62 Financial debt 1 398 1 050 Provisions 12 14 Other current and non-current liabilities 316 315 Total liabilities 2 591 2 113The increase in the Group's assets is mainly due to the increase in the portfolio of power plants in operation and under construction  with fixed assets up by +22% to €1 846 million.The Group's cash position at the end of June 2022 is €331 million  up +14%.This level should be compared to total financial debt of €1 398 million at the end of June 2022  up +33%  reflecting a gearing6 that remains low  at 55%.Over the period  operational activity (excluding investments) generated cash flow of €19 million.PROJECT PORTFOLIO UNDER DEVELOPMENTThe portfolio of projects under development  to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  is growing strongly to 13.6 GW at 30 June 2022  i.e. +27% compared to 30 June 2021.With the strategy of geographical diversification promoted by the Group  this portfolio is currently distributed as follows: 42% in Latin America  39% in Europe and 19% in Africa. In terms of technology  solar energy is in the majority  at 66%  followed by wind energy at 30% and other technologies at 4%.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JULY 1st 2022Construction of a 140 MW solar project in Albania7Voltalia is launching the construction of the Karavasta solar power plant  which was awarded a 30-year concession in 2020.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  to treat the rare primary immunodeficiency activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023  aligned with a Priority Review classification.Submitted by Pharming on July 29  2022  the NDA was supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in index lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Those results demonstrated the efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from the baseline size of participants' index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.006) and normalization of their immune function  as evidenced by an increased proportion of naïve B cells from the baseline (p=0.002). Those findings indicate a reduction in disease markers associated with APDS  whose clinical hallmarks include significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as increased risk of lymphoma. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial including 38 patients with APDS who were treated with leniolisib for a median of 102 weeks.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The FDA's acceptance for priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib is a milestone that demonstrates our commitment to addressing unmet needs for patients with rare diseases. With FDA's review  leniolisib moves further along the regulatory pathway as a potential disease-modifying targeted treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA  as well as with regulatory authorities across the globe  to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their APDS patients.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The limited review of the half-yearly financial information by the auditor of the Company has been completed and his report has been published on the web site.The consolidated financial statements (condensed interim financial statements and notes)  reviewed by the auditor  as well as the presentation of the 2022 half-year results are available on the Solutions 30 website www.solutions30.com  under Investor Relations.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chairman of the Management Board of Solutions 30  states:“Business in the first half of the year was characterized by the continued transition in the French market and dynamic growth of activities outside France.Performance in France has been penalized by our historical markets reaching maturity and by the delay in our growth drivers—especially for the energy transition—due to supply chain disruptions. We now find ourselves in the midst of an operational transition. This is particularly true in the telecom market  which has undergone abrupt changes after peaking in the last two years. Our organization has had to adapt to this new situation and to the new demands of our customers  which is impacting all our processes and eroding our margins this year.In the Benelux and other countries  business is growing dynamically  by around 30%. This underlying trend is supported by the deployment of fiber networks in almost all the countries we operate in and by new subscriber connections. In the Benelux  where we have reached critical size  our model has become virtuous  combining business growth with increasing margins. In other areas  where we have not yet reached critical size  we are financing rapid ramp-ups  which requires recruiting and training technicians. This has an automatic impact on short-term profitability  but puts us into a position to reach critical mass and maximize value creation for our shareholders.In a volatile and rising interest rate environment  our focus is on organic growth and managing our cash flow. We have reached a low point and we anticipate a recovery in the final quarter that will continue throughout 2023. In the longer term  and despite an uncertain macroeconomic context  the group’s outlook remains favorable given Solutions 30’s positioning at the crossroads of promising structural trends—the digital transformation and the transition to more efficient and independent sources of energy.”Key figures – Consolidated dataIn millions of euros 06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change Revenue 444.3 441.3 0.7% Operating margin (Adjusted EBITDA) 29.6 49.5 -40.2% As a % of revenue 6.7% 11.2% Adjusted EBIT(1) 6.7 29.6 -77.5% As a % of revenue 1.5% 6.7% Operating income (EBIT) -8.9 17.5 - As a % of revenue -2.0% 4.0% Consolidated net income -11.3 14.6 - As a % of revenue -2.5% 3.3% Net income  group share -12.3 14.1 - As a % of revenue -2.8% 3.2% Free cash flow(1) -15.8 0.9 -16.7 Financial structure figures 06/30/2022 12/31/2021 Change Equity 183.2 191.6 -8.4 Net debt 76.6 33 1 43.5 Net bank debt(1) -20.4 -52.3 31.9(1) See glossary at the end of this documentActivityConsolidated revenueSolutions 30’s consolidated half-year revenue for 2022 amounted to €444.3 million  up +0.7% (-1.5% on an organic basis).

Solutions 30 posted the highest second quarter in its history despite an unfavorable base effect linked to record activity in the first half of 2021 caused by the boom in ultra-fast internet roll-outs in France during the COVID crisis.In France  performance continues to be penalized by a maturing fiber-optic market and the scheduled halt to smart meter roll-outs  while new activities are starting up more slowly than expected. Although sales activity is encouraging  revenue generation has slowed due to the supply disruptions affecting the photovoltaic and electric vehicle charging station markets  with historically long delivery times for vehicles.Elsewhere in Europe  business is buoyant with growth rates of around 30%. Solutions 30 has succeeded in capturing significant market share where fiber-optic deployments are booming.A virtuous business model based on 3 pillarsSolutions 30’s business model is based on 3 fundamental pillars:Scalability . Solutions 30 prefers markets where its call-outs and operating methods can be standardized to maximize economies of scale. Density . With its dense territorial coverage  Solutions 30 can reduce its response times and optimize the travel time of its technicians. Automation. The group’s IT platform automates repetitive and time-consuming tasks and optimizes technicians’ schedules and routes in real time.These three pillars underpin the group’s profitability and explain its historically profitable growth trajectory  which has enabled it to finance all its organic growth from equity since its creation in 2003.Transition of the business model in France:In the telecoms segment  which accounts for 72% of Solutions 30’s revenue in France  the group is pursuing its operational transition in a now mature market after five years of exponential growth. As explained at the end of July  the geographical redeployment of one of the group’s major contracts—following a call for tender that redistributed activities among the service provider’s partners—is weighing on the operational efficiency of the French subsidiaries  especially in the southern half of France. To meet the new parameters of this contract  Solutions 30  like its competitors  has to review all its processes and methods  recruit and train staff to obtain new authorizations  and readjust its structures locally to prepare for the future. This has a significant impact on the group’s operating profitability  as it has to bear the costs of personnel who are not yet productive  while the processes  which are still being adjusted  are not yet standardized. In addition  and pending the definitive stabilization of the geographic distribution of the contract  Solutions 30 has chosen to keep in place structures that are not operating at full capacity.In the energy segment  Solutions 30 is positioned—thanks to its historical know-how—in the markets for installing and maintaining electric charging stations  photovoltaic panels  and intelligent sensors aimed at optimizing energy consumption. These new businesses are currently experiencing supply chain disruptions and are ramping up more slowly than anticipated  preventing them from compensating for the end of smart electricity meter roll-outs. During this phase  Solutions 30 is adjusting its processes and adapting its operational organization.Overall  in France  the group has implemented an action plan aimed at returning to growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan is based on 3 pillars:Gain market share in the mature telecoms sector  where a second wave of consolidation is expected to take place as the market remains relatively fragmented. The development of new  fast-growing activities  particularly in the buoyant energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles. The strengthening of synergies between various activities  accompanied by a reassignment of technicians to activities with greater potential.In the Benelux  the group is rolling out its business model and  thanks to the critical size achieved in this region  Solutions 30 is slightly improving margins despite the fact that major fiber contracts are just getting underway.In the other countries  the group needs to reach critical size  i.e. about €100 million in revenue per country  to start optimizing its profitability. The growth of fiber throughout Europe and the group’s proven ability to capture market share should enable it to achieve this objective in 2 to 5 years depending on the country. In these countries  the focus is on revenue growth and the signing of major contracts  as is the case in Italy and the United Kingdom  where the start-up and ramp-up phases  which are currently weighing on profitability  are underway. These start-up phases require the creation of new organizational structures and more robust processes  the adoption of new IT tools  and new trainings for on-site teams.ProfitabilityFigures by geographical area are detailed below:06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change France Revenue 221.9 270.3 -17.9% EBITDA 18.8 41.9 -55.1% EBITDA margin (%) 8.5% 15.5% Benelux Revenue 98.4 74.9 31.3% EBITDA 13.7 10.4 31.7% EBITDA margin (%) 13.9% 13.8% Other countries Revenue 124.0 96.1 29.0% EBITDA 2.4 1.7 41.2% EBITDA margin (%) 2.0% 1.8%For the group as a whole  adjusted EBITDA is down 40% to €29.6 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €49.5 million a year earlier  attributable exclusively to the activity in France as explained above.Operating costs have increased by +5.9% compared to the first half of 2021 and represent 84.1% of revenue  compared to 79.9% a year earlier  while structural costs increased by 4.9% to €40.9 million  compared to €39.0 million a year earlier.After accounting for €9.1 million in impairments and operational provisions  and after amortizing the usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  worth €13.8 million  adjusted EBIT stood at €6.7 million at June 30  2022  compared to €29.6 million a year earlier.There were €10.3 million in non-current operating expenses during the first half of 2022  mainly related to restructuring costs and exceptional transition costs incurred in connection with new contracts won in France following the above-mentioned tender (€6.7 million)  to exceptional costs incurred by the group to respond to an aggressive defamation campaign (€1.9 million)  and to expenses related to share-based payments pursuant to IFRS 2 (€1.2 million).Customer relationship amortization amounted to €7.1 million at June 30  2022  compared to €7.3 million a year earlier.Financial income represents an expense of €5.3 million from the adjustment of contingent consideration (earnout) values for €3.8 million. In the first half of 2021  financial income amounted to +€0.7 million.After including tax income of €3.0 million due to loss carryforwards  compared to an expense of €3.6 million a year earlier  the group share of net income amounted to -€12.3 million  compared to €14.1 million for the same period in 2021.Financial structureAt June 30  2022  the group had €183.2 million in equity  compared to €191.6 million at December 31  2021. The group had €85.0 million in gross cash  compared to €129.8 million at the end of December 2021. Gross bank debt stood at €64.6 million  compared to €77.5 million six months earlier  due to scheduled debt repayments. The group had €20.4 million in cash net of debt at the end of June 2022  compared to €52.3 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2021.Including €75.3 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €21.7 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the total net debt amounts to €76.6 million.The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.3 and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 41.8%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €62.0 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €92.3 million at December 31  2021. The decrease in the amount of receivables assigned is explained by the time required to ramp up new contracts. Despite the rising interest rate environment  factoring remains the most competitive short-term financing tool. Its cost remains largely under control thanks to the quality of the credit ratings of Solutions 30’s customers.Operating cash flow amounted to €15.7 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €37.9 million in the first half of 2021. The ramp-up of contracts and the reduced use of factoring generated an increase of €22.2 million in working capital requirements  which amounted to -€2.8 million. Adjusted for the change related to factoring  working capital decreased by €8.1 million.Cash flow from business activities during the first half of 2022 stood at -€6.5 million  compared to €7.2 million a year earlier  and net investments reached €9.4 million.This results in an overall free cash flow of -€15.8 million  compared to breakeven free cash flow in the first half of 2021.OutlookIn the second half of 2022  growth should accelerate and continue to be driven by activities outside France. Full-year revenue is expected to be about €900 million  compared with €874 million in 2021. In terms of profitability  the group should return to a more normal  double-digit EBITDA at the end of the year  but this will remain below 10% over the entire year. This objective is based on the rate renegotiations undertaken with the group’s customers  which began to take effect during the second quarter  as well as on the acceleration of the deployment and start-up of new contracts in Belgium  the Netherlands  Poland and the United Kingdom.From the end of this year and into 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.In each of these business segments  Solutions 30 has excellent references and a solid order book. With €770 million in orders taken since the beginning of the year  Solutions 30 is gaining market share in Europe  particularly in the deployment of fiber and the connection of homes to the ultra-fast network. In this segment alone  the group has won deals worth a total of €2.6 billion  to be delivered over the next 3 to 5 years. This figure includes new contracts and optical fiber renewals (deployment and connections). In the energy sector  Solutions 30 is pursuing it efforts  despite the shortages that are impacting supply chains. With 48 active customers for charging stations (charging service providers  energy companies  car manufacturers  and even manufacturers of charging stations)  more than 20 000 charging points installed by 2022  nearly 1 000 solar panel installations already completed  and prestigious customer references  Solutions 30 is ideally positioned to become a major player in the European energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q3 Revenue Report October 27  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Today we have a broad and diversified pipeline of promising programs in rare and severe liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs. Thanks to the acquisition of Versantis which will be completed shortly  we will soon be able to have six ongoing programs at all stages of development - preclinical  Phase 1  Phase 2 and Phase 3 - in five different indications. This should provide us with a steady stream of news over the next few months and years  with important clinical data in a relatively short term. The expertise of our team in Zurich will allow us to accelerate our research and development  and strengthen our leadership in markets with significant potential such as ACLF. We are also looking forward to the Phase 3 PBC clinical data read out expected in the second quarter 2023. »I. Key aspects of business activityElafibranor development program in PBCDespite disruptions in our clinical operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2021 (in particular as a result of the highly-contagious Omicron variant)  the situation improved in the first quarter of 2022 and enrollment rates rebounded significantly in our ELATIVETM clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC. As a result  patient enrollment was completed in the first half of the year  allowing us to confirm our goal to announce topline data in the second quarter of 2023  as per previous estimates.GNS561 development program in CCAIn September 2022  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to GNS561 for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.A Phase 1b/2a trial is expected to start in the fourth quarter 2022  with a first patient visit expected in the first quarter 2023.NTZ development program in ACLFGENFIT continues the development of its other program evaluating NTZ in ACLF  with a pre-IND meeting scheduled with the FDA in the coming weeks  following encouraging Phase 1 data.Acquisition of the Clinical-stage Biopharmaceutical Company VersantisOn September 19  2022  the Company announced it had signed an exclusive agreement with Versantis AG to acquire all the shares and voting rights of Versantis AG  a private Swiss-based clinical stage biotechnology company focused on addressing the growing unmet medical needs in liver diseases. This acquisition  which should be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022  aims at:consolidating GENFIT's position as a leader in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF)significantly expanding GENFIT's pipeline with VS-01-ACLF  a Phase 2 ready program based on first-in-class scavenging liposome technology  VS-01-UCD  a pediatric program focused on urea cycle disorder (UCD)  and VS-02-HE  an early-stage program focused on hepatic encephalopathy (HE)combining Versantis' expertise with GENFIT's know-how in conducting complex development programs in liver diseases  to strengthen and accelerate research and developmentThe deal includes an initial consideration of CHF40 million due at closing  with contingent consideration of up to CHF65 million upon positive Phase 2 results for VS-01 and VS-02 and regulatory approval of VS-01. In addition  Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01's pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party  or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs.Main events related to Corporate GovernanceAt the Company's Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on May 25  2022  all of the resolutions endorsed by the Board of Directors were adopted by a significant majority of the votes cast; this includes financial authorizations that would allow the Company to have diverse means adaptable to market conditions to implement them and seize new opportunities.The shareholders have renewed the appointments of Biotech Avenir  represented by Ms. Florence Séjourné  Mr. Jean-François Mouney  Mr. Jean-François Tiné  Mr. Xavier Guille  Ms. Anne-Hélène Monsellato and Ms. Catherine Larue as Directors for a term of five years.Mr. Frédéric Desdouits resigned from his Board appointment due to his new functions and therefore the Board of Directors did not propose to renew his appointment at the Shareholders' Meeting.The shareholders also appointed Ipsen Pharma SAS as Director  with Dr. Steven Hildemann as its permanent representative. In December 2021  Ipsen Pharma SAS acquired 8% of the Company's share capital and 7.64% of the voting rights. Pursuant to the investment agreement between the Company and Ipsen Pharma SAS signed in December 2021  the Board of Directors committed to propose the appointment of Ipsen Pharma SAS as Director at the General Meeting.II. Key aspects of the first half 2022 financial resultsCash and cash equivalentsAs of June 30  2022  GENFIT had €209 million in cash and cash equivalents (€259 million as of December 31  2021).In the first half of 2022  these cash flows include the disbursement of €24 million corresponding to the VAT on the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021  as well as the disbursement of the employee participation to the profits of GENFIT SA for a total of €628 thousand.Operating incomeOperating income amounted to €12 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €3 million in the first half 2021).The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the partial recognition of deferred income in accordance with IFRS 15 of €40.0 million following the conclusion of the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with Ipsen in December 2021. Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half 2022.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €27 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €33 million in the first half 2021).The decrease in operating expenses is due to:The decrease in contracting costs which amounted to €9 million in the first half 2022 compared with €15 million in the first half 2021  reflecting the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022Research and development expenses amounted to €18 million in the six months to June 30  2022 compared with €23 million in the six months to June 30  2021The decrease in reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to a total cost of €2 million in the first half 2021 (including expenses relating to the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds representing €1.9 million in the first half 2021). This had a positive impact of €0.2 million in the first-half 2022 due to the residual provision reversalSuch decreases were partially offset by the increase in the general and administrative expenses (€8.2 million in the first half 2022  compared to €7.6 million euros in the first half 2021) mainly attributable to the increase in insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company's shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company's financial advisors and auditors.Financial resultsFinancial income in the first half 2022 was a gain of €4 million  compared to a gain of €36 million in the first half 2021.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company's convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35.6 million).The change in financial results notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions (€2 million in the first half 2022 compared with €3 million in the first half 2021) as a result of the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half 2021.Net lossThe first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 million  compared with a net profit of €9 million in the first half of 2021.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under IFRS for the first half 2022  with comparative figures for the first half 2021.Half-year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Revenues and other income Revenue 11 8 790 Other income 3 417 3 398 Revenues and other income 3 428 12 188 Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses) Research and development expenses (23 079) (17 599) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (8 229) Marketing and market access expenses (783) (460) Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) 179 Other operating income (expenses) 301 (423) Operating income (loss) (29 551) (14 344) Financial income (1) 40 822 6 182 Financial expenses (5 107) (2 197) Financial profit (loss) 35 714 3 985 Net profit (loss) before tax 6 163 (10 359) Income tax benefit (expense) 2 895 (40) Net profit (loss) 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to owners of the Company 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to non-controlling interests 0 0 Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.21 (0.21) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.19 (0.21) (1): Of which Financial income incurred by renegotiating the convertible bond debt OCEANE 35 578 0Further information is provided in the above ""Key aspects of business activity"" section of this press release and in the condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022 under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the management discussion of the results are provided in the appendix at the end of this press release.

It reflects the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half of 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022.See Note 20 ""Operating Expense"" of the notes to the 2022 half year condensed consolidated financial statements on the determination of research and development expenses.General and administrative expenses  which amounted to €8 229 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €7 632 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including external expenses other than contracted research and development (€4 580 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 123 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel not assigned to research and development or marketing (€3 230 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €3 336 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€248 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €51 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021).The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to the increase in other external expenses excluding subcontracting  notably including insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company's shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company's financial advisors and auditors  and to the increase in net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense.Marketing and market access expenses   which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021).  which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021). Reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to €179 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €1 786 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.For comparison  the reorganization and restructuring expenses recorded in the first half of 2021 mainly included the expenses for the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds (representing an expense of €1 939 thousand in the first half of 2021) and readjustments of provisions relating to personnel expenses in connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l'Emploi – PSE) initiated in 2020 and the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study (representing a provision reversal of €158 thousand in the first half of 2021). None of any such non-recurring items linked to the Company's reorganization initiated in mid-2020 were recorded in the first half of 2022  other than a residual provision reversal.(3) Operating expenses by typeBroken down by type rather than by destination  operating expenses mainly included:Contracted research and development activitiesContracted research and development expenses amounted to €8 576 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €15 078 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of approximately 43% attributable mainly to the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study.Employee expensesHalf-year ended (in € thousands) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Wages and salaries (5 734) (5 842) Social security costs (2 729) (2 317) Changes in pension provision 37 (84) Share-based compensation (217) (148) TOTAL (8 643) (8 391)Employee expenses excluding share-based payments amounted to €8 243 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 426 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of 2%. This change includes a small increase in headcount (from 124 at June 30  2021 to 127 at June 30  2022)  balanced with a change in employee profiles.See Note 20 ""Operating Expenses"" regarding the change in headcount by activity.As a reminder  as the Company had recognized a positive net result in 2021  a plan for the participation of employees in the benefits of the Company was put in place  for a total amount of €628 thousand  which was paid out during the first half of 2022 (without effect on the comparison between employee expenses for the first half of 2022 and those of the first half of 2021).The amount recognised in respect of non-cash share-based payments (warrants  redeemable warrants  stock options and free shares) was €148 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €217 thousand in the first half of 2021.See Note 21 ""Share-based Compensation"" .Other operating expensesOther operating expenses amounted to €7 594 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 078 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Fees  including legal  audit and accounting fees  fees for various advisors (banking  press relations  investor relations  communication  IT  market access)  as well as fees for some of the Company's scientific advisors. This amount also includes intellectual property expenditure such as fees incurred by the Company for the filing and maintenance of its patents;Insurance-related expenses  including those incurred as a result of the Company's listing on Nasdaq since 2019;Expenses related to the leasing  use and upkeep of the Group's premises;Expenses related to external personnel made available to the Company (building management  security  reception  clinical and IT services);Business travel and conference expenses  which mainly relate to staff travel costs as well as the cost of attending scientific  medical  financial and business development conferences.The decline in other operating expenses compared with the first half of 2021 is mainly attributable to the absence of reorganization and restructuring expenses in the first half of 2022  partially offset by the increase in insurance expenses and fees.(4) Financial income (expense)Financial income for the six months to June 30  2022 was a gain of €3 985 thousand  compared with a gain of €35 714 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.This change notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions from €2 758 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €2 160 thousand in the first half of 2022  as well as the reduction in unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses on financial transactions from €2 291 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €0 in the first half of 2022  and the increase in unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains on financial transactions from €5 019 thousand in first half of 2021 to €6 032 thousand in the first half of 2022.Interest expense on financing transactions mainly reflects  in the first half of 2022 as in the first half of 2021  interest expense on the bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) issued in October 2017  bearing a coupon of 3.5% and discounting the bond debt at a rate of 8.8%. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half of 2021.Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial transactions relate mainly to exchange rate differences on cash investments in US dollars  the Company having chosen to keep part of its cash in US dollars  and therefore reflects change in the US dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2022.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half of 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company's convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35 578 thousand).(5) Net income (loss)The first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 399 thousand compared with a net profit of €9 058 thousand in the first half of 2021. As a reminder  the net profit for 2021 amounted to €67 259 thousand.Comments on the Group's Statement of Financial Position at June 30  2022As of June 30  2022  the total of the Group's statement of financial position was €237 049thousand compared with €281 720 thousand as of December 31  2021.As of June 30  2022  the Group's cash  cash equivalents and other financial assets amounted to €213 932 thousand  compared with €263 187 thousand as of 31 December 31  2021Cash management: with €209 115 thousand in cash and cash equivalents at June 30  2021  and based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis' programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate – based on current assumptions and without taking exceptional events into account – that funding of the Group's corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.(1) Non current assetsNon-current assets  which include intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and other financial assets  were stable at €13 519 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €13 623 thousand as of December 31  2021(2) Current assetsCurrent assets amounted to €223 530 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €268 097 thousand as of December 31  2021.Cash and cash equivalents decreased from €258 756 thousand as of December 31  2021 to €209 115 thousand as of June 30  2022  a decline of 19%.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K?) inhibitor  to treat the rare primary immunodeficiency activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023  aligned with a Priority Review classification.Submitted by Pharming on July 29  2022  the NDA was supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in index lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Those results demonstrated the efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from the baseline size of participants' index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.006) and normalization of their immune function  as evidenced by an increased proportion of naïve B cells from the baseline (p=0.002). Those findings indicate a reduction in disease markers associated with APDS  whose clinical hallmarks include significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as increased risk of lymphoma. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial including 38 patients with APDS who were treated with leniolisib for a median of 102 weeks.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The FDA's acceptance for priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib is a milestone that demonstrates our commitment to addressing unmet needs for patients with rare diseases. With FDA's review  leniolisib moves further along the regulatory pathway as a potential disease-modifying targeted treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA  as well as with regulatory authorities across the globe  to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their APDS patients.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase ? Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3K? (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3K? pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3K? and PI3K?  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K? and PI3K? are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K? in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K? is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.
