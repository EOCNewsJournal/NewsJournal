The new service  which will be avail…,"BRUSSELS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SWIFT today announces the successful pilot of SWIFT Securities View  a new capability that significantly increases transparency in post-trade processing and helps prevent costly settlement fails. The new service  which will be available for broad adoption in 2023  addresses one of the biggest challenges in the securities industry.The lack of visibility after a securities transaction takes place means that there is no way of tracking all the steps in its lifecycle across multiple intermediaries  increasing the risk that a security may not be in the right place at the time of completion. This leads to settlement fails that add operational costs of some USD 3 billion a year for the industry as well as regulatory penalties such as those introduced by Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) in Europe earlier this year.SWIFT Securities View gives market participants a clear view of all the steps in the settlement journey and enables them to identify trades at risk of failing  including early detection of any discrepancies between buy-sell instructions  so they can take pre-emptive action. It does so by leveraging an ISO-standard Unique Transaction Identifier that links messages related to the same securities flow  enabling automated tracking of both sides of the transaction by all market participants involved  similar to the tracking of a package via a postal delivery service.As part of its strategy to enable instant  frictionless and interoperable transactions globally  SWIFT is encouraging universal adoption of the transaction identifier to achieve standardised data use across the post trade lifecycle. This will bring increased transparency to securities transactions  help reduce risk  and support innovative new services. The pilot included the following market participants amongst others: ABN Amro Clearing Bank; BlackRock; BNP Paribas; BNY Mellon; Citi (Securities Services and Global Markets); Credit Suisse; Euroclear; Euronext; HSBC; J.P.Morgan; Northern Trust; Optiver; Pershing; and SEB.Vikesh Patel  Head of Securities Strategy  SWIFT said: “ SWIFT Securities View does more than just empower our customers to identify and rectify discrepancies in settlement transactions; it sets the blueprint and foundation for a new industry standard to radically transform the industry  just as SWIFT gpi continues to do for cross-border payments. Our early pilot results show this potential and further strengthen our mission of making transactions instant and frictionless  across all industries.”Steve Wager  Executive Manager  Head of Direct Markets Management  BNY Mellon  said: “ The UTI adoption by the industry could facilitate earlier matching which is key to timely settlement especially with trade settlement cycles shortening across the Globe.”Jeff King  Head of Core Custody Product  Citi Securities Services  said: “ With the rollout of CSDR in Europe and the planned move to T+1 in Asia and the US  it is becoming increasingly important to ensure settlement efficiency and having transactions match and settle on time. The inclusion of the Unique Transaction Identifier within the settlement lifecycle data communication and the adoption of SWIFT’s Securities View Service within the industry facilitates heightened transparency earlier in the settlement lifecycle allowing matching issues to be discovered higher up the settlement chain rather than waiting on matching updates to come back from CSDs and market infrastructures.”Olivier Grimonpont  Managing Director  Product Management - Market Liquidity  Euroclear  said: “ Euroclear consistently focuses on improving operational efficiency in the post trade space and helping our clients reduce settlement fails. We were pleased to participate in the pilot  which enabled the market to test the potential of adopting a UTI to improve transaction lifecycle visibility.”Pierre Davoust  Head of CSDs  Global Primary Markets and Corporate Services and Post Trade  Euronext  said: "" At Euronext Securities we are continuously looking into ways that enable our clients to improve their daily business. We are pleased to support this important initiative that helps the industry to strengthen the settlement processes and reduce fails.Paul Baybutt  Global Head of Middle Office for Securities Services  HSBC  said: “ We’re pleased to participate in this SWIFT pilot. Wider adoption of the Unique Transaction Identifier should improve visibility for market participants to identify transactions that might be at risk of failing and address potential settlement issues quicker and even before they occur. Expanding the use of UTIs should therefore make it more efficient for service providers  such as ourselves  to respond to client queries about the status of their transactions – which is ever more important with the implementation this year of the Settlement Discipline Regime.”Russ Stamey  Senior Vice President  Asset Servicing  Northern Trust  said: “ We applaud SWIFT Securities View as another step toward full transaction transparency  enabling more efficient securities settlement and more control in the post-trade space.”Edward Monrad  Head of Market Structure  Optiver said: “ Critical to the health of financial markets is a well-functioning and reliable post-trade process. By seeking to increase transparency and efficiency around settlement  SWIFT's Securities Tracking Pilot is making an important contribution toward this very goal. The UTI has the potential to substantially improve the OTC settlement process and reduce costs by allowing parties to a trade to easily find out where and how other parties are instructing in case of mismatches. Optiver is pleased to be participating in this pilot and looks forward to widespread adoption of the UTI.”About SWIFTSWIFT is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:“Total Net Revenue” is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.“Adjusted EBITDA” as Net profit plus/(less): (1) depreciation and amortization  (2) other expenses/(income)  (3) foreign exchange loss/(gain)  (4) share of loss/(gain) of associates and joint ventures  (5) interest expenses/ (income)  (6) income tax expenses  (7) share-based payment expenses  (8) impairment of non-current assets.“Adjusted Net profit” as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.“Adjusted Net profit Margin” as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue.Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  income tax  and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company’s operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume. Payment Services segment net revenue yield provides a measure of our ability to generate net revenue per unit of volume we process.We define these measures as follows:PS Payment Net Revenue is the Net Revenue consisting of the merchant and consumer fees collected for the payment transactions.PS Other Net Revenue primarily consists of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments  interest revenue  cash and settlement services and related conversion income  fees for intercompany and third-party funding  and advertising fees.QIWI plc.Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results(in millions  except per share data)Three months ended (unaudited) June 30  2021 June 30  2022 June 30  2022 RUB RUB USD Revenue 10 813 14 015 274.0 Minus: Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 4 764 3 807 74.4 Total Net Revenue 6 049 10 208 199.5 Segment Net Revenue Payment Services Segment Revenue 10 145 12 854 251.3 PS Payment Revenue(1) 9 162 10 839 211.9 Minus: Cost of PS Payment Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(2) 4 229 3 260 63.7 PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue 4 933 7 579 148.1 PS Other Revenue(3) 983 2 015 39.4 Minus: Cost of PS Other Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(4) 238 276 5.4 PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue 745 1 739 34.0 Payment Services Segment Net Revenue 5 678 9 318 182.1 Corporate and Other Category Revenue 668 1 161 22.7 Minus: Cost of CO revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 297 271 5.3 Corporate and Other Category Net Revenue 371 890 17.4 Total Segment Net Revenue 6 049 10 208 199.5 Profit for the period 2 633 2 810 54.9 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 285 287 5.6 Other income and expenses  net 65 (18 ) (0.4 ) Foreign exchange (gain)/loss  net 50 2 369 46.3 Share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (141 ) -

You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:“Total Net Revenue” is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.“Adjusted EBITDA” as Net profit plus/(less): (1) depreciation and amortization  (2) other expenses/(income)  (3) foreign exchange loss/(gain)  (4) share of loss/(gain) of associates and joint ventures  (5) interest expenses/ (income)  (6) income tax expenses  (7) share-based payment expenses  (8) impairment of non-current assets.“Adjusted Net profit” as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.“Adjusted Net profit Margin” as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue.Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  income tax  and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company’s operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume. Payment Services segment net revenue yield provides a measure of our ability to generate net revenue per unit of volume we process.We define these measures as follows:PS Payment Net Revenue is the Net Revenue consisting of the merchant and consumer fees collected for the payment transactions.PS Other Net Revenue primarily consists of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments  interest revenue  cash and settlement services and related conversion income  fees for intercompany and third-party funding  and advertising fees.QIWI plc.Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results(in millions  except per share data)Three months ended (unaudited) June 30  2021 June 30  2022 June 30  2022 RUB RUB USD Revenue 10 813 14 015 274.0 Minus: Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 4 764 3 807 74.4 Total Net Revenue 6 049 10 208 199.5 Segment Net Revenue Payment Services Segment Revenue 10 145 12 854 251.3 PS Payment Revenue(1) 9 162 10 839 211.9 Minus: Cost of PS Payment Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(2) 4 229 3 260 63.7 PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue 4 933 7 579 148.1 PS Other Revenue(3) 983 2 015 39.4 Minus: Cost of PS Other Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(4) 238 276 5.4 PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue 745 1 739 34.0 Payment Services Segment Net Revenue 5 678 9 318 182.1 Corporate and Other Category Revenue 668 1 161 22.7 Minus: Cost of CO revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 297 271 5.3 Corporate and Other Category Net Revenue 371 890 17.4 Total Segment Net Revenue 6 049 10 208 199.5 Profit for the period 2 633 2 810 54.9 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 285 287 5.6 Other income and expenses  net 65 (18 ) (0.4 ) Foreign exchange (gain)/loss  net 50 2 369 46.3 Share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (141 ) -

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has...","The FDA has assigned a PDUFA goal date of March 29  2023 for the NDA submission based on randomized-controlled and long-term extension data for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiencyLEIDEN  The Netherlands  Sept. 28  2022 /CNW/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  to treat the rare primary immunodeficiency activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023  aligned with a Priority Review classification.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)Submitted by Pharming on July 29  2022  the NDA was supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in index lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Those results demonstrated the efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from the baseline size of participants' index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.006) and normalization of their immune function  as evidenced by an increased proportion of naïve B cells from the baseline (p=0.002). Those findings indicate a reduction in disease markers associated with APDS  whose clinical hallmarks include significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as increased risk of lymphoma. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial including 38 patients with APDS who were treated with leniolisib for a median of 102 weeks.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The FDA's acceptance for priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib is a milestone that demonstrates our commitment to addressing unmet needs for patients with rare diseases. With FDA's review  leniolisib moves further along the regulatory pathway as a potential disease-modifying targeted treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA  as well as with regulatory authorities across the globe  to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their APDS patients.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:...,Trust StampAwarded Trademark by the US Patent and Trademark OfficeAtlanta  GA  Sept. 28  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T Stamp Inc. (“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDAI  Euronext Growth: AIID ID)  a global provider of AI-powered trust and identity services used globally across multiple sectors  today unveiled its new government-focused  privacy-first identity technology  Privtech™  and reports it has received registered trademark status for the Privtech solution by the US Patent and Trademark Office.The technology provides four customizable levels of privacy protection using the Company’s existing Privtech Certified® structure and offers government agencies the ability to verify identity and protect against fraud  while minimizing the data collected and providing transparency as to its use.Gareth Genner  Chief Executive Officer of Trust Stamp  explained  “Privtech technology utilizes our patented irreversibly transformed identity token (IT2™)  which allows users to be identified on a probabilistic basis without disclosing underlying biometric or other identity data. Within the Privtech Certified® structure there are four levels of privacy protection  of which Privtech Level Four is the most stringent with the entire enrollment and authentication processes taking place on the user’s own device  and only a randomized and encrypted one-time identifier ever leaving the device.”Dr. Norman Poh  Chief Science Officer of Trust Stamp  stated  “An IT2 can be created from virtually any modality of biometric together with most other types of identity data. In addition to the obvious benefit of privacy protection  the IT2 has numerous advantages when compared to legacy biometric templates  including computational efficiency  interoperability and cancelability.”Gareth Genner further noted  “Government agencies need to balance safe and efficient interaction with digital users against minimizing intrusion into the user’s privacy. Unlike the typical biometric systems in use today  Privtech Level Four does not require data intermediation by a private sector vendor and does not require the user to provide the agency with their biometric data. We have designed these solutions to meet the specific demands of government customers  which represent a very substantial and growing market opportunity. Ultimately  we believe that Privtech Certified products will define a new privacy-first approach to interacting with government agencies.”Story continuesThe Company’s announcement is in the wake of substantial increases in technology-focused investments by government agencies including $80 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service with a stated emphasis on improving taxpayer services and modernizing the agency’s technology and other infrastructure.About Trust StampTrust Stamp  is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.

The new service  which will be avail…,"BRUSSELS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SWIFT today announces the successful pilot of SWIFT Securities View  a new capability that significantly increases transparency in post-trade processing and helps prevent costly settlement fails. The new service  which will be available for broad adoption in 2023  addresses one of the biggest challenges in the securities industry.The lack of visibility after a securities transaction takes place means that there is no way of tracking all the steps in its lifecycle across multiple intermediaries  increasing the risk that a security may not be in the right place at the time of completion. This leads to settlement fails that add operational costs of some USD 3 billion a year for the industry as well as regulatory penalties such as those introduced by Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) in Europe earlier this year.SWIFT Securities View gives market participants a clear view of all the steps in the settlement journey and enables them to identify trades at risk of failing  including early detection of any discrepancies between buy-sell instructions  so they can take pre-emptive action. It does so by leveraging an ISO-standard Unique Transaction Identifier that links messages related to the same securities flow  enabling automated tracking of both sides of the transaction by all market participants involved  similar to the tracking of a package via a postal delivery service.As part of its strategy to enable instant  frictionless and interoperable transactions globally  SWIFT is encouraging universal adoption of the transaction identifier to achieve standardised data use across the post trade lifecycle. This will bring increased transparency to securities transactions  help reduce risk  and support innovative new services. The pilot included the following market participants amongst others: ABN Amro Clearing Bank; BlackRock; BNP Paribas; BNY Mellon; Citi (Securities Services and Global Markets); Credit Suisse; Euroclear; Euronext; HSBC; J.P.Morgan; Northern Trust; Optiver; Pershing; and SEB.Vikesh Patel  Head of Securities Strategy  SWIFT said: “ SWIFT Securities View does more than just empower our customers to identify and rectify discrepancies in settlement transactions; it sets the blueprint and foundation for a new industry standard to radically transform the industry  just as SWIFT gpi continues to do for cross-border payments. Our early pilot results show this potential and further strengthen our mission of making transactions instant and frictionless  across all industries.”Steve Wager  Executive Manager  Head of Direct Markets Management  BNY Mellon  said: “ The UTI adoption by the industry could facilitate earlier matching which is key to timely settlement especially with trade settlement cycles shortening across the Globe.”Jeff King  Head of Core Custody Product  Citi Securities Services  said: “ With the rollout of CSDR in Europe and the planned move to T+1 in Asia and the US  it is becoming increasingly important to ensure settlement efficiency and having transactions match and settle on time. The inclusion of the Unique Transaction Identifier within the settlement lifecycle data communication and the adoption of SWIFT’s Securities View Service within the industry facilitates heightened transparency earlier in the settlement lifecycle allowing matching issues to be discovered higher up the settlement chain rather than waiting on matching updates to come back from CSDs and market infrastructures.”Olivier Grimonpont  Managing Director  Product Management - Market Liquidity  Euroclear  said: “ Euroclear consistently focuses on improving operational efficiency in the post trade space and helping our clients reduce settlement fails. We were pleased to participate in the pilot  which enabled the market to test the potential of adopting a UTI to improve transaction lifecycle visibility.”Pierre Davoust  Head of CSDs  Global Primary Markets and Corporate Services and Post Trade  Euronext  said: "" At Euronext Securities we are continuously looking into ways that enable our clients to improve their daily business. We are pleased to support this important initiative that helps the industry to strengthen the settlement processes and reduce fails.Paul Baybutt  Global Head of Middle Office for Securities Services  HSBC  said: “ We’re pleased to participate in this SWIFT pilot. Wider adoption of the Unique Transaction Identifier should improve visibility for market participants to identify transactions that might be at risk of failing and address potential settlement issues quicker and even before they occur. Expanding the use of UTIs should therefore make it more efficient for service providers  such as ourselves  to respond to client queries about the status of their transactions – which is ever more important with the implementation this year of the Settlement Discipline Regime.”Russ Stamey  Senior Vice President  Asset Servicing  Northern Trust  said: “ We applaud SWIFT Securities View as another step toward full transaction transparency  enabling more efficient securities settlement and more control in the post-trade space.”Edward Monrad  Head of Market Structure  Optiver said: “ Critical to the health of financial markets is a well-functioning and reliable post-trade process. By seeking to increase transparency and efficiency around settlement  SWIFT's Securities Tracking Pilot is making an important contribution toward this very goal. The UTI has the potential to substantially improve the OTC settlement process and reduce costs by allowing parties to a trade to easily find out where and how other parties are instructing in case of mismatches. Optiver is pleased to be participating in this pilot and looks forward to widespread adoption of the UTI.”About SWIFTSWIFT is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

(“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDAI  Euronext Growth: AIID ID)  a...,Awarded Trademark by the US Patent and Trademark OfficeT Stamp Inc. (“Trust Stamp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: IDAI  Euronext Growth: AIID ID)  a global provider of AI-powered trust and identity services used globally across multiple sectors  today unveiled its new government-focused  privacy-first identity technology  Privtech™  and reports it has received registered trademark status for the Privtech solution by the US Patent and Trademark Office.The technology provides four customizable levels of privacy protection using the Company’s existing Privtech Certified® structure and offers government agencies the ability to verify identity and protect against fraud  while minimizing the data collected and providing transparency as to its use.Gareth Genner  Chief Executive Officer of Trust Stamp  explained  “Privtech technology utilizes our patented irreversibly transformed identity token (IT2™)  which allows users to be identified on a probabilistic basis without disclosing underlying biometric or other identity data. Within the Privtech Certified® structure there are four levels of privacy protection  of which Privtech Level Four is the most stringent with the entire enrollment and authentication processes taking place on the user’s own device  and only a randomized and encrypted one-time identifier ever leaving the device.”Dr. Norman Poh  Chief Science Officer of Trust Stamp  stated  “An IT2 can be created from virtually any modality of biometric together with most other types of identity data. In addition to the obvious benefit of privacy protection  the IT2 has numerous advantages when compared to legacy biometric templates  including computational efficiency  interoperability and cancelability.”Gareth Genner further noted  “Government agencies need to balance safe and efficient interaction with digital users against minimizing intrusion into the user’s privacy. Unlike the typical biometric systems in use today  Privtech Level Four does not require data intermediation by a private sector vendor and does not require the user to provide the agency with their biometric data. We have designed these solutions to meet the specific demands of government customers  which represent a very substantial and growing market opportunity. Ultimately  we believe that Privtech Certified products will define a new privacy-first approach to interacting with government agencies.”The Company’s announcement is in the wake of substantial increases in technology-focused investments by government agencies including $80 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service with a stated emphasis on improving taxpayer services and modernizing the agency’s technology and other infrastructure.About Trust StampTrust Stamp  is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.

Today we have a broad and diversified pipeline of promising programs in rare and severe liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs. Thanks to the acquisition of Versantis which will be completed shortly  we will soon be able to have six ongoing programs at all stages of development - preclinical  Phase 1  Phase 2 and Phase 3 - in five different indications. This should provide us with a steady stream of news over the next few months and years  with important clinical data in a relatively short term. The expertise of our team in Zurich will allow us to accelerate our research and development  and strengthen our leadership in markets with significant potential such as ACLF. We are also looking forward to the Phase 3 PBC clinical data read out expected in the second quarter 2023. »I. Key aspects of business activityElafibranor development program in PBCDespite disruptions in our clinical operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2021 (in particular as a result of the highly-contagious Omicron variant)  the situation improved in the first quarter of 2022 and enrollment rates rebounded significantly in our ELATIVETM clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC. As a result  patient enrollment was completed in the first half of the year  allowing us to confirm our goal to announce topline data in the second quarter of 2023  as per previous estimates.GNS561 development program in CCAIn September 2022  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to GNS561 for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.A Phase 1b/2a trial is expected to start in the fourth quarter 2022  with a first patient visit expected in the first quarter 2023.NTZ development program in ACLFGENFIT continues the development of its other program evaluating NTZ in ACLF  with a pre-IND meeting scheduled with the FDA in the coming weeks  following encouraging Phase 1 data.Acquisition of the Clinical-stage Biopharmaceutical Company VersantisOn September 19  2022  the Company announced it had signed an exclusive agreement with Versantis AG to acquire all the shares and voting rights of Versantis AG  a private Swiss-based clinical stage biotechnology company focused on addressing the growing unmet medical needs in liver diseases.

In addition  Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01’s pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party  or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs.Main events related to Corporate GovernanceAt the Company’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 25  2022  all of the resolutions endorsed by the Board of Directors were adopted by a significant majority of the votes cast; this includes financial authorizations that would allow the Company to have diverse means adaptable to market conditions to implement them and seize new opportunities.The shareholders have renewed the appointments of Biotech Avenir  represented by Ms. Florence Séjourné  Mr. Jean-François Mouney  Mr. Jean-François Tiné  Mr. Xavier Guille  Ms. Anne-Hélène Monsellato and Ms. Catherine Larue as Directors for a term of five years.Mr. Frédéric Desdouits resigned from his Board appointment due to his new functions and therefore the Board of Directors did not propose to renew his appointment at the Shareholders' Meeting.The shareholders also appointed Ipsen Pharma SAS as Director  with Dr. Steven Hildemann as its permanent representative. In December 2021  Ipsen Pharma SAS acquired 8% of the Company's share capital and 7.64% of the voting rights. Pursuant to the investment agreement between the Company and Ipsen Pharma SAS signed in December 2021  the Board of Directors committed to propose the appointment of Ipsen Pharma SAS as Director at the General Meeting.II. Key aspects of the first half 2022 financial resultsCash and cash equivalentsAs of June 30  2022  GENFIT had €209 million in cash and cash equivalents (€259 million as of December 31  2021).In the first half of 2022  these cash flows include the disbursement of €24 million corresponding to the VAT on the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021  as well as the disbursement of the employee participation to the profits of GENFIT SA for a total of €628 thousand.Operating incomeOperating income amounted to €12 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €3 million in the first half 2021).The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the partial recognition of deferred income in accordance with IFRS 15 of €40.0 million following the conclusion of the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with Ipsen in December 2021. Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half 2022.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €27 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €33 million in the first half 2021).The decrease in operating expenses is due to:The decrease in contracting costs which amounted to €9 million in the first half 2022 compared with €15 million in the first half 2021  reflecting the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022Research and development expenses amounted to €18 million in the six months to June 30  2022 compared with €23 million in the six months to June 30  2021The decrease in reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to a total cost of €2 million in the first half 2021 (including expenses relating to the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds representing €1.9 million in the first half 2021). This had a positive impact of €0.2 million in the first-half 2022 due to the residual provision reversalSuch decreases were partially offset by the increase in the general and administrative expenses (€8.2 million in the first half 2022  compared to €7.6 million euros in the first half 2021) mainly attributable to the increase in insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors.Financial resultsFinancial income in the first half 2022 was a gain of €4 million  compared to a gain of €36 million in the first half 2021.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35.6 million).The change in financial results notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions (€2 million in the first half 2022 compared with €3 million in the first half 2021) as a result of the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half 2021.Net lossThe first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 million  compared with a net profit of €9 million in the first half of 2021.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under IFRS for the first half 2022  with comparative figures for the first half 2021.Half-year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Revenues and other income Revenue 11 8 790 Other income 3 417 3 398 Revenues and other income 3 428 12 188 Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses) Research and development expenses (23 079) (17 599) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (8 229) Marketing and market access expenses (783) (460) Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) 179 Other operating income (expenses) 301 (423) Operating income (loss) (29 551) (14 344) Financial income (1) 40 822 6 182 Financial expenses (5 107) (2 197) Financial profit (loss) 35 714 3 985 Net profit (loss) before tax 6 163 (10 359) Income tax benefit (expense) 2 895 (40) Net profit (loss) 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to owners of the Company 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to non-controlling interests 0 0 Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.21 (0.21) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.19 (0.21) (1): Of which Financial income incurred by renegotiating the convertible bond debt OCEANE 35 578 0Further information is provided in the above “Key aspects of business activity” section of this press release and in the condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022 under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the management discussion of the results are provided in the appendix at the end of this press release.

It reflects the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half of 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022.See Note 20 ""Operating Expense"" of the notes to the 2022 half year condensed consolidated financial statements on the determination of research and development expenses.General and administrative expenses  which amounted to €8 229 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €7 632 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including external expenses other than contracted research and development (€4 580 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 123 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel not assigned to research and development or marketing (€3 230 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €3 336 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€248 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €51 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021).The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to the increase in other external expenses excluding subcontracting  notably including insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors  and to the increase in net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense.Marketing and market access expenses   which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021).  which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021). Reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to €179 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €1 786 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.For comparison  the reorganization and restructuring expenses recorded in the first half of 2021 mainly included the expenses for the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds (representing an expense of €1 939 thousand in the first half of 2021) and readjustments of provisions relating to personnel expenses in connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l’Emploi – PSE) initiated in 2020 and the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study (representing a provision reversal of €158 thousand in the first half of 2021). None of any such non-recurring items linked to the Company’s reorganization initiated in mid-2020 were recorded in the first half of 2022  other than a residual provision reversal.(3) Operating expenses by typeBroken down by type rather than by destination  operating expenses mainly included:Contracted research and development activitiesContracted research and development expenses amounted to €8 576 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €15 078 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of approximately 43% attributable mainly to the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study.Employee expensesHalf-year ended (in € thousands) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Wages and salaries (5 734) (5 842) Social security costs (2 729) (2 317) Changes in pension provision 37 (84) Share-based compensation (217) (148) TOTAL (8 643) (8 391)Employee expenses excluding share-based payments amounted to €8 243 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 426 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of 2%. This change includes a small increase in headcount (from 124 at June 30  2021 to 127 at June 30  2022)  balanced with a change in employee profiles.See Note 20 ""Operating Expenses"" regarding the change in headcount by activity.As a reminder  as the Company had recognized a positive net result in 2021  a plan for the participation of employees in the benefits of the Company was put in place  for a total amount of €628 thousand  which was paid out during the first half of 2022 (without effect on the comparison between employee expenses for the first half of 2022 and those of the first half of 2021).The amount recognised in respect of non-cash share-based payments (warrants  redeemable warrants  stock options and free shares) was €148 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €217 thousand in the first half of 2021.See Note 21 ""Share-based Compensation"" .Other operating expensesOther operating expenses amounted to €7 594 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 078 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Fees  including legal  audit and accounting fees  fees for various advisors (banking  press relations  investor relations  communication  IT  market access)  as well as fees for some of the Company’s scientific advisors. This amount also includes intellectual property expenditure such as fees incurred by the Company for the filing and maintenance of its patents;Insurance-related expenses  including those incurred as a result of the Company’s listing on Nasdaq since 2019;Expenses related to the leasing  use and upkeep of the Group’s premises;Expenses related to external personnel made available to the Company (building management  security  reception  clinical and IT services);Business travel and conference expenses  which mainly relate to staff travel costs as well as the cost of attending scientific  medical  financial and business development conferences.The decline in other operating expenses compared with the first half of 2021 is mainly attributable to the absence of reorganization and restructuring expenses in the first half of 2022  partially offset by the increase in insurance expenses and fees.(4) Financial income (expense)Financial income for the six months to June 30  2022 was a gain of €3 985 thousand  compared with a gain of €35 714 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.This change notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions from €2 758 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €2 160 thousand in the first half of 2022  as well as the reduction in unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses on financial transactions from €2 291 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €0 in the first half of 2022  and the increase in unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains on financial transactions from €5 019 thousand in first half of 2021 to €6 032 thousand in the first half of 2022.Interest expense on financing transactions mainly reflects  in the first half of 2022 as in the first half of 2021  interest expense on the bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) issued in October 2017  bearing a coupon of 3.5% and discounting the bond debt at a rate of 8.8%. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half of 2021.Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial transactions relate mainly to exchange rate differences on cash investments in US dollars  the Company having chosen to keep part of its cash in US dollars  and therefore reflects change in the US dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2022.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half of 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35 578 thousand).(5) Net income (loss)The first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 399 thousand compared with a net profit of €9 058 thousand in the first half of 2021. As a reminder  the net profit for 2021 amounted to €67 259 thousand.Comments on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position at June 30  2022As of June 30  2022  the total of the Group’s statement of financial position was €237 049thousand compared with €281 720 thousand as of December 31  2021.As of June 30  2022  the Group’s cash  cash equivalents and other financial assets amounted to €213 932 thousand  compared with €263 187 thousand as of 31 December 31  2021Cash management: with €209 115 thousand in cash and cash equivalents at June 30  2021  and based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis’ programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate – based on current assumptions and without taking exceptional events into account – that funding of the Group’s corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.(1) Non current assetsNon-current assets  which include intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and other financial assets  were stable at €13 519 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €13 623 thousand as of December 31  2021(2) Current assetsCurrent assets amounted to €223 530 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €268 097 thousand as of December 31  2021.Cash and cash equivalents decreased from €258 756 thousand as of December 31  2021 to €209 115 thousand as of June 30  2022  a decline of 19%. Cash is mainly invested in low risk  highly liquid short-term investments.The change in current trade and other receivables from €7 236 thousand as of December 31  2021 to €11 428 thousand as of June 30  2022 is mainly attributable to the inclusion of the receivable related to the estimated amount of the Research Tax Credit in the first half of 2022 and the receivable for the 2021 Research Tax Credit  for which the request for reimbursement made in the first half of 2022 is currently being processed.The change in other current assets corresponds to the increase in accrued expenses related to current operating expenses and in particular to the Directors & Officers civil liability insurance.(3) Shareholders’ equityAs of June 30  2022  the Group’s shareholders’ equity totalled €109 166  thousand compared with €119 097 thousand as of December 31  2021.The change is mainly attributable to the recognition of a net loss of €10 399 thousand in the first half of 2022.No conversion of OCEANE bonds was recorded in the first half of 2022.The notes to the consolidated financial statements and the table of changes in shareholders’ equity prepared in accordance with IFRS and appearing in section 3 “Half-year condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022” provide details of changes in the Company’s share capital and the Group’s shareholders’ equity respectively.(4) Non-current liabilityNon-current liabilities amounted to €92 595 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €99 786 thousand as of December 31  2021.This is the portion due in more than one year of the:Bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) issued in October 2017 and redeemable in October 2025 (maturity following the renegotiation of the terms of the OCEANE bonds concluded in January 2021)  in the amount of €48 760 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €47 682 thousand as of December 31  2021 Other financial liabilities in the amount of €23 739 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €24 365 thousand as of December 31  2021  including bank loans (including the government-guaranteed loans taken out in June and July 2021 and the subsidized loan concluded in November 2021)  the conditional advance granted by Bpifrance  and lease liabilities pursuant to IFRS 16 (see Note 12 “Loans and Borrowings” ) )  Deferred revenues and income  in the amount of €18 284 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €25 821 thousand as of December 31  2021  corresponding to the current portion of the deferred income resulting from the recognition of the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021 Employee benefits (€714 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €864 thousand in the six months to December 31  2021)  deferred tax liabilities (€647 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €602 thousand as of December 31  2021) and trade and other payables (€450 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €450 thousand as of December 31  2021).(5) Current liabilitiesAs of (in € thousands) 2021/12/31 2022/06/30 Current convertible loans 415 415 Current other loans and borrowings 1 773 1 830 Current trade and other payables 40 988 14 273 Current deferred income and revenue 14 298 13 670 Current provisions 313 193 Current tax liabilities 5 051 4 906 TOTAL 62 837 35 288This balance sheet item includes accrued interest related to the bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) redeemable in October 2025  bank loans  trade payables  social security payables and lease liabilities.

The first Delhaize wine bottling plant opened in 1880.Capacity of bottling 18.000 bottles per hour.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportation.Zaandam  the Netherlands  28 September  2022. Yesterday  in the presence of Belgian Prime Minister  Alexander De Croo  Delhaize opened its new wine bottling plant in Brussels. Standing at 9 500 square metres  it is the largest in the Benelux  representing an investment of €30 million. The plant will not only bottle wine for Delhaize customers  but also for other Ahold Delhaize brands in Europe and the U.S. and brands outside Ahold Delhaize. With this new plant  Ahold Delhaize strengthens its wine expertise in a sustainable and efficient way.In the bottling plant  wines from different vineyards from around the world arrive in bulk  in tankers or via containers. They are stored in large barrels in the wine cellar until they are ready to be bottled. Before the wine is bottled or boxed and goes to the store  the wine goes through a number of processes such as filtering. The filtration and storage processes are still carried out in the traditional way.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportationIt is the ambition to bottle a natural product such as wine in a sustainable way. That is why Delhaize has invested in sustainable systems such as water and heating for cleaning and maintaining the temperature in the building. Besides that  the wine is stored underground as there is an almost constant temperature in winter and summer without the need for cooling or heating. Importing wine from all over the world in bulk  instead of bottled wines not only halves transportation costs  it also reduces the wine's carbon emissions.Story continuesSharing expertiseDelhaize wants to continue to offer affordable high-quality wine to customers. The wine that is bottled in the new plant will not only be available in Delhaize stores  but also at other brands within Ahold Delhaize. By doing so  the brands are sharing expertise with a focus on innovation  sustainability and affordable prices for customers.Wouter Kolk  CEO Ahold Delhaize Europe & Indonesia: ""The great local brands of Ahold Delhaize all have their own special or local expertise. I am always proud when we can share knowledge in a way that benefits our other brands  and their customers.Today it becomes clear that Delhaize’s 140+ years of experience in bottling wines is taken to an even more ambitious level. My congratulations to the Delhaize team for this strong and sustainable achievement!""Art of the heritageWine has always been an important product for Delhaize. Shortly after Delhaize was founded in 1867  it opened its own wine bottling plant in 1880 in Brussels. This tradition continues with the opening of the new  high-tech wine bottling plant which can bottle the equivalent of 14 Olympic swimming pools per year and has a storage capacity of three million liters of wine.New wine bottling plant in numbers:Investment of €30 million9 500 m² surface areaServes multiple Ahold Delhaize brands: Delhaize  Albert Heijn  Gall & Gall  AB Vassilopoulos  Mega Image  Albert  Hannaford and Food Lion.Storage capacity of three million liters of wine18 000 bottles bottled per hourFour bottle lines8 km of pipes in which wine is transported150 different wines73 employees and wine expertsHalf of the bottles sold at Delhaize come from this bottling plant-ENDS-Cautionary noticeThis communication includes forward-looking statements.

This is attributable to the increase in ancillary services (+€2.5 million) linked to a rise in the chartering of barges in the Rhine basin.The Containers division saw consolidation of the results of the proprietary trading and investment policy  posting an increase in its revenue from activities of €25.2 million to €41.3 million. Sales of owned equipment related to the trading business rose by a sharp €18.8 million. Invoicing of ancillary services (pick-up charges) rose by €2.1 million. This increase reflects exceptional demand for containers among shipping companies amid the ongoing shortage. This trend was underpinned by leasing revenue  which was up by a sharp 45% over the period to €7.3 million.The management activity increased by €2.0 million to €4.8 million. Syndication fees were up and commissions on the sale of investor equipment also increased by €0.7 million. Management fees rose by €0.2 million.The Modular Building activity in Africa presented in the “Miscellaneous” line item failed to replicate its H1 2021 performance  posting a decrease of €4.7 million.SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PROFITABILITYGroup EBITDA stood at €29.5 million at 30 June 2022  up sharply (by €8.2 million) on H1 2021.This performance was mainly due to strong growth in leasing activity in the Freight Railcars and Containers divisions  which was underpinned by a decrease in operating expenses on Freight Railcars and the return of purchases and sales in the container trading activity.Syndication fees were also up in both divisions  with a significant increase in overall sales volumes in the Containers division.The Group share of net profit came to €7.6 million in H1 2022 (vs. €2.0 million a year earlier).FINANCIAL STRUCTUREOn 28 June 2022  Touax SCA issued a sustainability-linked bond of €33.3 million over 5 years  in order to:- repay part of its existing debt in the amount of €10 million and extend its maturity by 2 years to 2027;- reduce the cost of its financial resources by €0.9 million per year by buying back the full €26.6 million in undated deeply subordinated bonds.At 30 June 2022  the Group’s loan-to-value ratio was 56% compared with 52% at end-December 2021. This increase can be explained in part by the increase in investments in new equipment during the first six months of the year (in the Containers division in particular)  the financing ratio of which is higher  and by a portion of the buyback of the undated deeply subordinated bonds as of 30 June 2022 (€8.5 million repaid at that date  while the balance of €18.1 million was repaid on 1 August 2022).The Group’s net debt stood at €242 million  up €11 million year-to-date.Total shareholders’ equity at 30 June 2022 amounted to €170.2 million compared with €165.0 million at 31 December 2021. This figure includes €8.5 million in repayment on the hybrid capital.OUTLOOKTouax is not directly exposed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict  as it has no subsidiaries  customers or leased transport assets (with the possible exception of a few non-significant containers in transit) in Ukraine or Russia.In the current context of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates  Touax continues to roll out its activities with confidence  backed by a resilient business model and recurring revenues based on long-term contracts. The Group plans to continue to seize new asset acquisition opportunities over the coming months  while also adopting a prudent investment policy. The current inflationary environment has a positive effect on the valuation of the portfolio of assets.From a structural and medium- to long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from developments in relation to infrastructures  e-commerce  and intermodal logistics as they keep pace with the expectations of consumers  industrial groups  public authorities  lenders and investors around green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS29 September 2022: Video conference call to present the H1 results in French30 September 2022: Video conference call to present the H1 results in English14 November 2022: Q3 revenue from activitiesTOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

This decrease is mainly due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants in Brazil (which had started producing in the first half of 2021) and to a lower average level of resources (wind  sunshine and hydraulic flow) in the first half of 2022  whereas the resource in the first half of 2021 was at its long-term average.These factors of decrease in volume are partially offset by factors of increase:production benefits from the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3 in Brazil and Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao in France) and the first effects of the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 (mainly SSM1-2 in Brazil  Stavria in Greece and Carrière des Plaines in France); andproduction has benefited from the very strong momentum of Helexia.The increase in revenues (+7%) in a context of lower production (-19%) reflects a strong increase in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors:the contractual indexation of sales prices on indices equal or close to the consumer price index (inflation) at 83% of the revenues contractually indexed on inflation in 2021;the replacement of projects with low prices per MWh (VSM2 and VSM4  which benefit from some of the best wind levels in the world) with more tariffed projects  e.g. Helexia's solar roofs;the strengthening of the Brazilian real: with an average EUR/BRL rate of 5.55 in the first half of 2022  compared to 6.49 in the first half of 2021  which contributes to almost a third of the increase in the average selling price per megawatt hour.EBITDAEnergy Sales generate EBITDA of €53.6 million in the first half of 2022  up +8% (stable at constant exchange rates)  representing an EBITDA margin of 56.0%  i.e. +1 point compared to the first half of 2021.Detail by country:in Brazil  51% of Energy Sales  EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower production due to the divestment in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in H1 2021) and wind conditions that were less favourable than a year earlier and well below the long-term resource average. This loss of volume was almost entirely offset by a favourable exchange rate effect (strengthening of the Brazilian currency) and by contractual clauses indexing sales prices to inflation;in France  26% of Energy Sales  EBITDA benefits from the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon  Cacao and Helexia portfolio) despite a slight decrease in production due to lower wind;in the other countries (UK  Belgium  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Greece  Egypt and Jordan)  23% of Energy Sales  EBITDA is significantly higher  benefiting from the commissioning of the new Stavria solar plant in Greece in March  and the strong production of Helexia in Spain  Belgium and Portugal.Services: strong revenue and EBITDA growthFinancial key figuresIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2022 H1 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Revenues 166.9 95.9 +74% +71% Of which internal revenues 48.6 36.9 +32% +28% Of which external revenues 118.3 59.0 x2.0 x2.0 EBITDA 7.2 -5.1 N/A N/AIn the first-half of 2022 revenues from Services (internal and external) amount to €166.9 million  up +74% (+71% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting in particular from the strong growth in revenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments. EBITDA moves into positive territory despite the weight of development costs linked to the prospecting of new projects  which remains significant in order to contribute to the Group's future growth: the pipeline thus increased from 10.7 GW at the end of June 2021 to 13.6 GW at the end of June 2022  an increase of +27%.Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementRevenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments amount to €152.0 million in the first half of 2022  up +90% (+88% at constant exchange rates) compared to the first half of 2021. EBITDA from this segment increases by €12.0 million in first half of 2022 to €6.8 million. Over the period  Development benefits from the sale of projects to third party customers  including disposals that were shifted from 2021 to 2022 representing an EBITDA of approximately €10 million. In addition  Construction and Equipment Procurement benefit from the strong commercial momentum with third party customers. Voltalia has managed to control its costs  in a general context of inflation in material costs  thanks to the strength of its integrated model  which enables it to pool its equipment purchases and to finely control its expenses.Operations & MaintenanceRevenues of the Operations & Maintenance segment reach €15 million  up +17% (+12% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from contracts in Europe and Latin America. The segment posts an EBITDA of €0.4 million (x4)  confirming the positive profitability achieved in 2021.OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 60.7 44.3 +37% +27% Eliminations and corporate -13.3 -10.1 +31% +27% EBITDA 47.4 34.1 +39% +27% Depreciation  amortisation  and provisions -31.8 -34.3 -7% -13% Operating revenue (EBIT) 15.6 -0.2 N/A N/A Financial result -13.9 -18.1 -23% -34% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -8.4 -4.1 x2.1 x1.9 Minority interests 2.1 0.9 x2.4 x2.1 Net result (Group share) -4.6 -21.4 ÷4.6 ÷4.5EBITDA before eliminations and corporate items increases by +37% to €60.7 million.

Consolidated EBITDA is €47.4 million  up +39% compared to 2021. Consolidated EBITDA amount to €47.4 million  up +39% compared to 2021.Depreciation  amortisation and provisions amount to €31.8 million  down -7%. Depreciation is up  due to the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 and the full-year effect of the plants commissioned in 2021  while provisions are down after significant allocations in the first half of 2021.At €13.9 million  net financial expenses are down -23%. Interest earned on deposits in Brazil (notably the reserve accounts required for project financing)  which rose sharply with the increase in short-term rates  more than offset the financial charges related to long-term project financing  the outstanding amounts of which are rising in line with investments on Voltalia's three continents.After taking into account minority interests and taxes  the seasonal net loss (Group share) is divided by almost 5.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at 30 June 2022 is €2.6 billion  up 23% at current exchange rates and 19% at constant exchange rates  with the difference coming from the appreciation of the Brazilian real with a EUR/BRL rate of 6.32 at the end of December 2021 compared to 5.44 at the end of June 2022.In € million 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Goodwill 80 78 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 1 846 1 510 Cash and cash equivalents 331 291 Other assets 334 234 Total assets 2 591 2 113 Equity  Group share 757 672 Minorities 108 62 Financial debt 1 398 1 050 Provisions 12 14 Other current and non-current liabilities 316 315 Total liabilities 2 591 2 113The increase in the Group's assets is mainly due to the increase in the portfolio of power plants in operation and under construction  with fixed assets up by +22% to €1 846 million.The Group's cash position at the end of June 2022 is €331 million  up +14%.This level should be compared to total financial debt of €1 398 million at the end of June 2022  up +33%  reflecting a gearing6 that remains low  at 55%.Over the period  operational activity (excluding investments) generated cash flow of €19 million.PROJECT PORTFOLIO UNDER DEVELOPMENTThe portfolio of projects under development  to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  is growing strongly to 13.6 GW at 30 June 2022  i.e. +27% compared to 30 June 2021.With the strategy of geographical diversification promoted by the Group  this portfolio is currently distributed as follows: 42% in Latin America  39% in Europe and 19% in Africa. In terms of technology  solar energy is in the majority  at 66%  followed by wind energy at 30% and other technologies at 4%.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JULY 1st 2022Construction of a 140 MW solar project in Albania7Voltalia is launching the construction of the Karavasta solar power plant  which was awarded a 30-year concession in 2020.

The condensed consolidated financial statements are included in this press release and the complete financial statements are available on the “Investors” page of the GENFIT website.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented :«I am very pleased with the way GENFIT has pursued the implementation of its strategy in 2022  in line with the plan announced in the fall of 2020 and our ambitions. Today we have a broad and diversified pipeline of promising programs in rare and severe liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs. Thanks to the acquisition of Versantis which will be completed shortly  we will soon be able to have six ongoing programs at all stages of development - preclinical  Phase 1  Phase 2 and Phase 3 - in five different indications. This should provide us with a steady stream of news over the next few months and years  with important clinical data in a relatively short term. The expertise of our team in Zurich will allow us to accelerate our research and development  and strengthen our leadership in markets with significant potential such as ACLF. We are also looking forward to the Phase 3 PBC clinical data read out expected in the second quarter 2023. »Story continuesI. Key aspects of business activityElafibranor development program in PBCDespite disruptions in our clinical operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2021 (in particular as a result of the highly-contagious Omicron variant)  the situation improved in the first quarter of 2022 and enrollment rates rebounded significantly in our ELATIVETM clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC. As a result  patient enrollment was completed in the first half of the year  allowing us to confirm our goal to announce topline data in the second quarter of 2023  as per previous estimates.GNS561 development program in CCAIn September 2022  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to GNS561 for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.A Phase 1b/2a trial is expected to start in the fourth quarter 2022  with a first patient visit expected in the first quarter 2023.NTZ development program in ACLFGENFIT continues the development of its other program evaluating NTZ in ACLF  with a pre-IND meeting scheduled with the FDA in the coming weeks  following encouraging Phase 1 data.Acquisition of the Clinical-stage Biopharmaceutical Company VersantisOn September 19  2022  the Company announced it had signed an exclusive agreement with Versantis AG to acquire all the shares and voting rights of Versantis AG  a private Swiss-based clinical stage biotechnology company focused on addressing the growing unmet medical needs in liver diseases. This acquisition  which should be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022  aims at:consolidating GENFIT’s position as a leader in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF)significantly expanding GENFIT’s pipeline with VS-01-ACLF  a Phase 2 ready program based on first-in-class scavenging liposome technology  VS-01-UCD  a pediatric program focused on urea cycle disorder (UCD)  and VS-02-HE  an early-stage program focused on hepatic encephalopathy (HE)combining Versantis’ expertise with GENFIT’s know-how in conducting complex development programs in liver diseases  to strengthen and accelerate research and developmentThe deal includes an initial consideration of CHF40 million due at closing  with contingent consideration of up to CHF65 million upon positive Phase 2 results for VS-01 and VS-02 and regulatory approval of VS-01. In addition  Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01’s pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party  or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs.Main events related to Corporate GovernanceAt the Company’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 25  2022  all of the resolutions endorsed by the Board of Directors were adopted by a significant majority of the votes cast; this includes financial authorizations that would allow the Company to have diverse means adaptable to market conditions to implement them and seize new opportunities.The shareholders have renewed the appointments of Biotech Avenir  represented by Ms. Florence Séjourné  Mr. Jean-François Mouney  Mr. Jean-François Tiné  Mr. Xavier Guille  Ms. Anne-Hélène Monsellato and Ms. Catherine Larue as Directors for a term of five years.Mr. Frédéric Desdouits resigned from his Board appointment due to his new functions and therefore the Board of Directors did not propose to renew his appointment at the Shareholders' Meeting.The shareholders also appointed Ipsen Pharma SAS as Director  with Dr. Steven Hildemann as its permanent representative. In December 2021  Ipsen Pharma SAS acquired 8% of the Company's share capital and 7.64% of the voting rights. Pursuant to the investment agreement between the Company and Ipsen Pharma SAS signed in December 2021  the Board of Directors committed to propose the appointment of Ipsen Pharma SAS as Director at the General Meeting.II. Key aspects of the first half 2022 financial resultsCash and cash equivalentsAs of June 30  2022  GENFIT had €209 million in cash and cash equivalents (€259 million as of December 31  2021).In the first half of 2022  these cash flows include the disbursement of €24 million corresponding to the VAT on the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021  as well as the disbursement of the employee participation to the profits of GENFIT SA for a total of €628 thousand.Operating incomeOperating income amounted to €12 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €3 million in the first half 2021).The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the partial recognition of deferred income in accordance with IFRS 15 of €40.0 million following the conclusion of the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with Ipsen in December 2021. Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half 2022.Operating expensesOperating expenses amounted to €27 million in the first half 2022 (compared with €33 million in the first half 2021).The decrease in operating expenses is due to:The decrease in contracting costs which amounted to €9 million in the first half 2022 compared with €15 million in the first half 2021  reflecting the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022Research and development expenses amounted to €18 million in the six months to June 30  2022 compared with €23 million in the six months to June 30  2021The decrease in reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to a total cost of €2 million in the first half 2021 (including expenses relating to the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds representing €1.9 million in the first half 2021). This had a positive impact of €0.2 million in the first-half 2022 due to the residual provision reversalSuch decreases were partially offset by the increase in the general and administrative expenses (€8.2 million in the first half 2022  compared to €7.6 million euros in the first half 2021) mainly attributable to the increase in insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors.Financial resultsFinancial income in the first half 2022 was a gain of €4 million  compared to a gain of €36 million in the first half 2021.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35.6 million).The change in financial results notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions (€2 million in the first half 2022 compared with €3 million in the first half 2021) as a result of the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half 2021.Net lossThe first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 million  compared with a net profit of €9 million in the first half of 2021.The table below presents the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations under IFRS for the first half 2022  with comparative figures for the first half 2021.Half-year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Revenues and other income Revenue 11 8 790 Other income 3 417 3 398 Revenues and other income 3 428 12 188 Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses) Research and development expenses (23 079) (17 599) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (8 229) Marketing and market access expenses (783) (460) Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) 179 Other operating income (expenses) 301 (423) Operating income (loss) (29 551) (14 344) Financial income (1) 40 822 6 182 Financial expenses (5 107) (2 197) Financial profit (loss) 35 714 3 985 Net profit (loss) before tax 6 163 (10 359) Income tax benefit (expense) 2 895 (40) Net profit (loss) 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to owners of the Company 9 058 (10 399) Attributable to non-controlling interests 0 0 Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.21 (0.21) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) 0.19 (0.21) (1): Of which Financial income incurred by renegotiating the convertible bond debt OCEANE 35 578 0Further information is provided in the above “Key aspects of business activity” section of this press release and in the condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022 under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the management discussion of the results are provided in the appendix at the end of this press release.

Deferred income is recognized in revenue in proportion to progress on the double-blind ELATIVE study  in accordance with IFRS 15.Revenue growth also reflects certain services billed to Ipsen under the transition agreement  entered into between Genfit and Ipsen in the first half of 2022  as initially provided for in the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement signed in December 2021.The estimated amount of the research tax credit for the first half of 2022 is stable compared with the first half of 2021  reflecting the stability of eligible research expenditure.(2) Operating expenses by destinationThe tables below break operating expenses down by destination  mainly into research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  marketing and market access expenses  and restructuring and reorganization expenses  for the six months to June 30  2022 and June 30  2021.Half-year ended Of which : 2021/06/30 Raw Contracted Employee Other Depreciation  Gain / materials research and expenses expenses amortization (loss) on and development (maintenance  and disposal of consumables activities fees  travel  impairment property  used conducted by taxes…) charges plant and (in € thousands) third parties equipment Research and development expenses (23 079) (642) (15 029) (4 842) (2 334) (225) (6) General and administrative expenses (7 632) (73) (48) (3 336) (4 123) (51) 0 Marketing and market access expenses (783) (2) (1) (465) (316) 0 0 Reorganization and restructuring expenses (1 786) (3) 0 0 (1 942) 158 0 Other operating income (expenses) 301 0 0 0 637 0 (336) TOTAL (32 979) (721) (15 078) (8 643) (8 078) (117) (343) (*) : including reversalsHalf-year ended Of which : 2022/06/30 Raw Contracted Employee Other Depreciation  Gain / materials research and expenses expenses amortization (loss) on and development (maintenance  and disposal of consumables activities fees  travel  impairment property  used conducted by taxes…) charges plant and (in € thousands) third parties equipment Research and development expenses (17 599) (1 052) (8 538) (4 889) (2 408) (712) 0 General and administrative expenses (8 229) (133) (38) (3 230) (4 580) (248) 0 Marketing and market access expenses (460) (2) 0 (272) (182) (3) 0 Reorganization and restructuring expenses 179 0 0 0 (1) 180 0 Other operating income (expenses) (423) 0 0 0 (422) 0 (1) TOTAL (26 532) (1 187) (8 576) (8 391) (7 594) (783) (1) (*) : including reversalsOperating expenses amounted to €26 532 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €32 979 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Research and development expenses  which amounted to €17 599 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €23 079 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  including contracted research and development costs  particularly clinical and pharmaceutical subcontracting (€8 538 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €15 029 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel assigned to research and development (€4 889 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 842 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  external expenses excluding contracted research and development  notably related to intellectual property (€2 408 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €2 334 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  purchases consumed for research and development activities (€1 052 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €642 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€712 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €225 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021);The decrease in research and development expenses is mainly attributable to the decrease in contracting costs. It reflects the difference between the remaining expenses of the RESOLVE-IT study (terminated in July 2020) recognized in the first half of 2021 and the remainder recorded in the first half of 2022.See Note 20 ""Operating Expense"" of the notes to the 2022 half year condensed consolidated financial statements on the determination of research and development expenses.General and administrative expenses  which amounted to €8 229 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €7 632 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including external expenses other than contracted research and development (€4 580 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €4 123 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  expenses relating to personnel not assigned to research and development or marketing (€3 230 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €3 336 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense (€248 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €51 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021).The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to the increase in other external expenses excluding subcontracting  notably including insurance premiums related to the listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq and fees for the Company’s financial advisors and auditors  and to the increase in net depreciation  amortization and impairment expense.Marketing and market access expenses   which amounted to €460 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €783 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021  mainly including expenses relating to personnel assigned to marketing and business development (€272 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €465 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021)  and other external expenses excluding contracted research and development (market research  marketing strategy  medical communication  market access  etc.) (€182 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €316 thousand at June 30  2021).Reorganization and restructuring expenses  which amounted to €179 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €1 786 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.For comparison  the reorganization and restructuring expenses recorded in the first half of 2021 mainly included the expenses for the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds (representing an expense of €1 939 thousand in the first half of 2021) and readjustments of provisions relating to personnel expenses in connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l’Emploi – PSE) initiated in 2020 and the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study (representing a provision reversal of €158 thousand in the first half of 2021). None of any such non-recurring items linked to the Company’s reorganization initiated in mid-2020 were recorded in the first half of 2022  other than a residual provision reversal.(3) Operating expenses by typeBroken down by type rather than by destination  operating expenses mainly included:Contracted research and development activitiesContracted research and development expenses amounted to €8 576 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €15 078 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of approximately 43% attributable mainly to the termination of the RESOLVE-IT study.Employee expensesHalf-year ended (in € thousands) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Wages and salaries (5 734) (5 842) Social security costs (2 729) (2 317) Changes in pension provision 37 (84) Share-based compensation (217) (148) TOTAL (8 643) (8 391)Employee expenses excluding share-based payments amounted to €8 243 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 426 thousand in the first half of 2021  a decline of 2%. This change includes a small increase in headcount (from 124 at June 30  2021 to 127 at June 30  2022)  balanced with a change in employee profiles.See Note 20 ""Operating Expenses"" regarding the change in headcount by activity.As a reminder  as the Company had recognized a positive net result in 2021  a plan for the participation of employees in the benefits of the Company was put in place  for a total amount of €628 thousand  which was paid out during the first half of 2022 (without effect on the comparison between employee expenses for the first half of 2022 and those of the first half of 2021).The amount recognised in respect of non-cash share-based payments (warrants  redeemable warrants  stock options and free shares) was €148 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €217 thousand in the first half of 2021.See Note 21 ""Share-based Compensation"" .Other operating expensesOther operating expenses amounted to €7 594 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €8 078 thousand in the first half of 2021. They include the following:Fees  including legal  audit and accounting fees  fees for various advisors (banking  press relations  investor relations  communication  IT  market access)  as well as fees for some of the Company’s scientific advisors. This amount also includes intellectual property expenditure such as fees incurred by the Company for the filing and maintenance of its patents;Insurance-related expenses  including those incurred as a result of the Company’s listing on Nasdaq since 2019;Expenses related to the leasing  use and upkeep of the Group’s premises;Expenses related to external personnel made available to the Company (building management  security  reception  clinical and IT services);Business travel and conference expenses  which mainly relate to staff travel costs as well as the cost of attending scientific  medical  financial and business development conferences.The decline in other operating expenses compared with the first half of 2021 is mainly attributable to the absence of reorganization and restructuring expenses in the first half of 2022  partially offset by the increase in insurance expenses and fees.(4) Financial income (expense)Financial income for the six months to June 30  2022 was a gain of €3 985 thousand  compared with a gain of €35 714 thousand in the six months to June 30  2021.This change notably reflects the reduction in interest expense on financing transactions from €2 758 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €2 160 thousand in the first half of 2022  as well as the reduction in unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses on financial transactions from €2 291 thousand in the first half of 2021 to €0 in the first half of 2022  and the increase in unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains on financial transactions from €5 019 thousand in first half of 2021 to €6 032 thousand in the first half of 2022.Interest expense on financing transactions mainly reflects  in the first half of 2022 as in the first half of 2021  interest expense on the bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) issued in October 2017  bearing a coupon of 3.5% and discounting the bond debt at a rate of 8.8%. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to the partial redemption and subsequent conversion of OCEANE bonds during the first half of 2021.Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial transactions relate mainly to exchange rate differences on cash investments in US dollars  the Company having chosen to keep part of its cash in US dollars  and therefore reflects change in the US dollar exchange rate in the first half of 2022.For comparison  note that net financial income (expense) in the first half of 2021 included the gain generated by the partial redemption of the Company’s convertible bonds as part of the renegotiation of the OCEANE bonds in the first half of 2021 (€35 578 thousand).(5) Net income (loss)The first half of 2022 resulted in net loss of €10 399 thousand compared with a net profit of €9 058 thousand in the first half of 2021. As a reminder  the net profit for 2021 amounted to €67 259 thousand.Comments on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position at June 30  2022As of June 30  2022  the total of the Group’s statement of financial position was €237 049thousand compared with €281 720 thousand as of December 31  2021.As of June 30  2022  the Group’s cash  cash equivalents and other financial assets amounted to €213 932 thousand  compared with €263 187 thousand as of 31 December 31  2021Cash management: with €209 115 thousand in cash and cash equivalents at June 30  2021  and based on our development plan for our current programs and for Versantis’ programs  the revenue expected from our partnership agreements  and accounting for transaction costs  we anticipate – based on current assumptions and without taking exceptional events into account – that funding of the Group’s corporate development is secured for approximately 2 years.(1) Non current assetsNon-current assets  which include intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and other financial assets  were stable at €13 519 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €13 623 thousand as of December 31  2021(2) Current assetsCurrent assets amounted to €223 530 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €268 097 thousand as of December 31  2021.Cash and cash equivalents decreased from €258 756 thousand as of December 31  2021 to €209 115 thousand as of June 30  2022  a decline of 19%. Cash is mainly invested in low risk  highly liquid short-term investments.The change in current trade and other receivables from €7 236 thousand as of December 31  2021 to €11 428 thousand as of June 30  2022 is mainly attributable to the inclusion of the receivable related to the estimated amount of the Research Tax Credit in the first half of 2022 and the receivable for the 2021 Research Tax Credit  for which the request for reimbursement made in the first half of 2022 is currently being processed.The change in other current assets corresponds to the increase in accrued expenses related to current operating expenses and in particular to the Directors & Officers civil liability insurance.(3) Shareholders’ equityAs of June 30  2022  the Group’s shareholders’ equity totalled €109 166  thousand compared with €119 097 thousand as of December 31  2021.The change is mainly attributable to the recognition of a net loss of €10 399 thousand in the first half of 2022.No conversion of OCEANE bonds was recorded in the first half of 2022.The notes to the consolidated financial statements and the table of changes in shareholders’ equity prepared in accordance with IFRS and appearing in section 3 “Half-year condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30  2022” provide details of changes in the Company’s share capital and the Group’s shareholders’ equity respectively.(4) Non-current liabilityNon-current liabilities amounted to €92 595 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €99 786 thousand as of December 31  2021.This is the portion due in more than one year of the:Bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) issued in October 2017 and redeemable in October 2025 (maturity following the renegotiation of the terms of the OCEANE bonds concluded in January 2021)  in the amount of €48 760 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €47 682 thousand as of December 31  2021 Other financial liabilities in the amount of €23 739 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €24 365 thousand as of December 31  2021  including bank loans (including the government-guaranteed loans taken out in June and July 2021 and the subsidized loan concluded in November 2021)  the conditional advance granted by Bpifrance  and lease liabilities pursuant to IFRS 16 (see Note 12 “Loans and Borrowings” ) Deferred revenues and income  in the amount of €18 284 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €25 821 thousand as of December 31  2021  corresponding to the current portion of the deferred income resulting from the recognition of the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021 Employee benefits (€714 thousand in the six months to June 30  2022  compared with €864 thousand in the six months to December 31  2021)  deferred tax liabilities (€647 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €602 thousand as of December 31  2021) and trade and other payables (€450 thousand as of June 30  2022  compared with €450 thousand as of December 31  2021).(5) Current liabilitiesAs of (in € thousands) 2021/12/31 2022/06/30 Current convertible loans 415 415 Current other loans and borrowings 1 773 1 830 Current trade and other payables 40 988 14 273 Current deferred income and revenue 14 298 13 670 Current provisions 313 193 Current tax liabilities 5 051 4 906 TOTAL 62 837 35 288This balance sheet item includes accrued interest related to the bonds convertible into or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) redeemable in October 2025  bank loans  trade payables  social security payables and lease liabilities. The change in current liabilities is mainly attributable to the change in contracted research and development expenses  and the change in deferred income resulting from the recognition of the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021 (see Notes 12 ""Loans and Borrowings"" and 13 ""Fair value of financial instruments"" ).Comments on the Group’s Cash Flows for the periods ended June 30  2021 and June 30  2022As of June 30  2022  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €209 115 thousand a decline of €49 641 thousand compared with December 31  2021.Over the period  change in cash flow by type of flow was as follows:Half-year ended Half-year ended (in € thousands) 2021/06/30 2022/06/30 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities (27 810) (47 499) Cash flows provided by (used in) investment activities 215 (199) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (38 966) (1 943) (66 561) (49 641)(1) Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activitiesCash flow used in operating activities amounted to €-47 499 thousand for the half-year ended June 30  2022 compared with €-27 810  thousand for the half-year ended June 30  2021.In the first half of 2022  these cash flows include the disbursement of €24 000 thousand corresponding to the VAT on the upfront payment received from Ipsen under the licensing agreement entered into in December 2021  as well as the disbursement of the employee participation to the profits of GENFIT SA for a total of €628 thousand.These cash flows reflect GENFIT’s business  which requires significant research and development efforts  and generates expenses that change in line with progress on the Company’s research programs  net of its operating revenues.(2) Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activitiesCash flow used in investing activities amounted to €-199 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €215 thousand in cash flow provided in the first half of 2021.These cash flows include acquisitions  disposals and repayments of fixed assets and financial assets.(3) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activitiesCash flow used in financing activities amounted to €-1 943 thousand in the first half of 2022  compared with €-38 966 thousand in the first half of 2021.In the first half of 2022  these cash flows mainly reflect financial interest received and paid  the amount of which is stable compared with first half of 2021.For comparison  note that in the first half of 2021  these cash flows included the disbursement of €47 482 thousand corresponding to the settlement of the partial redemption of the OCEANE bonds as part of the renegotiation of this bond debt  and the payment of €11 000 thousand of the government-guaranteed loan (Prêt Garanti par l’Etat – PGE) granted by a syndicate of French banks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with severe chronic liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

The limited review of the half-yearly financial information by the auditor of the Company has been completed and his report has been published on the web site.The consolidated financial statements (condensed interim financial statements and notes)  reviewed by the auditor  as well as the presentation of the 2022 half-year results are available on the Solutions 30 website www.solutions30.com  under Investor Relations.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chairman of the Management Board of Solutions 30  states:“Business in the first half of the year was characterized by the continued transition in the French market and dynamic growth of activities outside France.Performance in France has been penalized by our historical markets reaching maturity and by the delay in our growth drivers—especially for the energy transition—due to supply chain disruptions. We now find ourselves in the midst of an operational transition. This is particularly true in the telecom market  which has undergone abrupt changes after peaking in the last two years. Our organization has had to adapt to this new situation and to the new demands of our customers  which is impacting all our processes and eroding our margins this year.Story continuesIn the Benelux and other countries  business is growing dynamically  by around 30%. This underlying trend is supported by the deployment of fiber networks in almost all the countries we operate in and by new subscriber connections. In the Benelux  where we have reached critical size  our model has become virtuous  combining business growth with increasing margins. In other areas  where we have not yet reached critical size  we are financing rapid ramp-ups  which requires recruiting and training technicians. This has an automatic impact on short-term profitability  but puts us into a position to reach critical mass and maximize value creation for our shareholders.In a volatile and rising interest rate environment  our focus is on organic growth and managing our cash flow. We have reached a low point and we anticipate a recovery in the final quarter that will continue throughout 2023. In the longer term  and despite an uncertain macroeconomic context  the group’s outlook remains favorable given Solutions 30’s positioning at the crossroads of promising structural trends—the digital transformation and the transition to more efficient and independent sources of energy.”Key figures – Consolidated dataIn millions of euros 06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change Revenue 444.3 441.3 0.7% Operating margin (Adjusted EBITDA) 29.6 49.5 -40.2% As a % of revenue 6.7% 11.2% Adjusted EBIT(1) 6.7 29.6 -77.5% As a % of revenue 1.5% 6.7% Operating income (EBIT) -8.9 17.5 - As a % of revenue -2.0% 4.0% Consolidated net income -11.3 14.6 - As a % of revenue -2.5% 3.3% Net income  group share -12.3 14.1 - As a % of revenue -2.8% 3.2% Free cash flow(1) -15.8 0.9 -16.7 Financial structure figures 06/30/2022 12/31/2021 Change Equity 183.2 191.6 -8.4 Net debt 76.6 33 1 43.5 Net bank debt(1) -20.4 -52.3 31.9(1) See glossary at the end of this documentActivityConsolidated revenueSolutions 30’s consolidated half-year revenue for 2022 amounted to €444.3 million  up +0.7% (-1.5% on an organic basis). After a limited decline in the first quarter  the group returned to modest growth in the second quarter. Solutions 30 posted the highest second quarter in its history despite an unfavorable base effect linked to record activity in the first half of 2021 caused by the boom in ultra-fast internet roll-outs in France during the COVID crisis.In France  performance continues to be penalized by a maturing fiber-optic market and the scheduled halt to smart meter roll-outs  while new activities are starting up more slowly than expected. Although sales activity is encouraging  revenue generation has slowed due to the supply disruptions affecting the photovoltaic and electric vehicle charging station markets  with historically long delivery times for vehicles.Elsewhere in Europe  business is buoyant with growth rates of around 30%. Solutions 30 has succeeded in capturing significant market share where fiber-optic deployments are booming.A virtuous business model based on 3 pillarsSolutions 30’s business model is based on 3 fundamental pillars:Scalability . Solutions 30 prefers markets where its call-outs and operating methods can be standardized to maximize economies of scale. Density . With its dense territorial coverage  Solutions 30 can reduce its response times and optimize the travel time of its technicians. Automation. The group’s IT platform automates repetitive and time-consuming tasks and optimizes technicians’ schedules and routes in real time.These three pillars underpin the group’s profitability and explain its historically profitable growth trajectory  which has enabled it to finance all its organic growth from equity since its creation in 2003.Transition of the business model in France:In the telecoms segment  which accounts for 72% of Solutions 30’s revenue in France  the group is pursuing its operational transition in a now mature market after five years of exponential growth. As explained at the end of July  the geographical redeployment of one of the group’s major contracts—following a call for tender that redistributed activities among the service provider’s partners—is weighing on the operational efficiency of the French subsidiaries  especially in the southern half of France. To meet the new parameters of this contract  Solutions 30  like its competitors  has to review all its processes and methods  recruit and train staff to obtain new authorizations  and readjust its structures locally to prepare for the future. This has a significant impact on the group’s operating profitability  as it has to bear the costs of personnel who are not yet productive  while the processes  which are still being adjusted  are not yet standardized. In addition  and pending the definitive stabilization of the geographic distribution of the contract  Solutions 30 has chosen to keep in place structures that are not operating at full capacity.In the energy segment  Solutions 30 is positioned—thanks to its historical know-how—in the markets for installing and maintaining electric charging stations  photovoltaic panels  and intelligent sensors aimed at optimizing energy consumption. These new businesses are currently experiencing supply chain disruptions and are ramping up more slowly than anticipated  preventing them from compensating for the end of smart electricity meter roll-outs. During this phase  Solutions 30 is adjusting its processes and adapting its operational organization.Overall  in France  the group has implemented an action plan aimed at returning to growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan is based on 3 pillars:Gain market share in the mature telecoms sector  where a second wave of consolidation is expected to take place as the market remains relatively fragmented. The development of new  fast-growing activities  particularly in the buoyant energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles. The strengthening of synergies between various activities  accompanied by a reassignment of technicians to activities with greater potential.In the Benelux  the group is rolling out its business model and  thanks to the critical size achieved in this region  Solutions 30 is slightly improving margins despite the fact that major fiber contracts are just getting underway.In the other countries  the group needs to reach critical size  i.e. about €100 million in revenue per country  to start optimizing its profitability. The growth of fiber throughout Europe and the group’s proven ability to capture market share should enable it to achieve this objective in 2 to 5 years depending on the country. In these countries  the focus is on revenue growth and the signing of major contracts  as is the case in Italy and the United Kingdom  where the start-up and ramp-up phases  which are currently weighing on profitability  are underway. These start-up phases require the creation of new organizational structures and more robust processes  the adoption of new IT tools  and new trainings for on-site teams.ProfitabilityFigures by geographical area are detailed below:06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change France Revenue 221.9 270.3 -17.9% EBITDA 18.8 41.9 -55.1% EBITDA margin (%) 8.5% 15.5% Benelux Revenue 98.4 74.9 31.3% EBITDA 13.7 10.4 31.7% EBITDA margin (%) 13.9% 13.8% Other countries Revenue 124.0 96.1 29.0% EBITDA 2.4 1.7 41.2% EBITDA margin (%) 2.0% 1.8%For the group as a whole  adjusted EBITDA is down 40% to €29.6 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €49.5 million a year earlier  attributable exclusively to the activity in France as explained above.Operating costs have increased by +5.9% compared to the first half of 2021 and represent 84.1% of revenue  compared to 79.9% a year earlier  while structural costs increased by 4.9% to €40.9 million  compared to €39.0 million a year earlier.After accounting for €9.1 million in impairments and operational provisions  and after amortizing the usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  worth €13.8 million  adjusted EBIT stood at €6.7 million at June 30  2022  compared to €29.6 million a year earlier.There were €10.3 million in non-current operating expenses during the first half of 2022  mainly related to restructuring costs and exceptional transition costs incurred in connection with new contracts won in France following the above-mentioned tender (€6.7 million)  to exceptional costs incurred by the group to respond to an aggressive defamation campaign (€1.9 million)  and to expenses related to share-based payments pursuant to IFRS 2 (€1.2 million).Customer relationship amortization amounted to €7.1 million at June 30  2022  compared to €7.3 million a year earlier.Financial income represents an expense of €5.3 million from the adjustment of contingent consideration (earnout) values for €3.8 million. In the first half of 2021  financial income amounted to +€0.7 million.After including tax income of €3.0 million due to loss carryforwards  compared to an expense of €3.6 million a year earlier  the group share of net income amounted to -€12.3 million  compared to €14.1 million for the same period in 2021.Financial structureAt June 30  2022  the group had €183.2 million in equity  compared to €191.6 million at December 31  2021. The group had €85.0 million in gross cash  compared to €129.8 million at the end of December 2021. Gross bank debt stood at €64.6 million  compared to €77.5 million six months earlier  due to scheduled debt repayments. The group had €20.4 million in cash net of debt at the end of June 2022  compared to €52.3 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2021.Including €75.3 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €21.7 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the total net debt amounts to €76.6 million.The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.3 and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 41.8%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €62.0 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €92.3 million at December 31  2021. The decrease in the amount of receivables assigned is explained by the time required to ramp up new contracts. Despite the rising interest rate environment  factoring remains the most competitive short-term financing tool. Its cost remains largely under control thanks to the quality of the credit ratings of Solutions 30’s customers.Operating cash flow amounted to €15.7 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €37.9 million in the first half of 2021. The ramp-up of contracts and the reduced use of factoring generated an increase of €22.2 million in working capital requirements  which amounted to -€2.8 million. Adjusted for the change related to factoring  working capital decreased by €8.1 million.Cash flow from business activities during the first half of 2022 stood at -€6.5 million  compared to €7.2 million a year earlier  and net investments reached €9.4 million.This results in an overall free cash flow of -€15.8 million  compared to breakeven free cash flow in the first half of 2021.OutlookIn the second half of 2022  growth should accelerate and continue to be driven by activities outside France. Full-year revenue is expected to be about €900 million  compared with €874 million in 2021. In terms of profitability  the group should return to a more normal  double-digit EBITDA at the end of the year  but this will remain below 10% over the entire year. This objective is based on the rate renegotiations undertaken with the group’s customers  which began to take effect during the second quarter  as well as on the acceleration of the deployment and start-up of new contracts in Belgium  the Netherlands  Poland and the United Kingdom.From the end of this year and into 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.In each of these business segments  Solutions 30 has excellent references and a solid order book. With €770 million in orders taken since the beginning of the year  Solutions 30 is gaining market share in Europe  particularly in the deployment of fiber and the connection of homes to the ultra-fast network. In this segment alone  the group has won deals worth a total of €2.6 billion  to be delivered over the next 3 to 5 years. This figure includes new contracts and optical fiber renewals (deployment and connections). In the energy sector  Solutions 30 is pursuing it efforts  despite the shortages that are impacting supply chains. With 48 active customers for charging stations (charging service providers  energy companies  car manufacturers  and even manufacturers of charging stations)  more than 20 000 charging points installed by 2022  nearly 1 000 solar panel installations already completed  and prestigious customer references  Solutions 30 is ideally positioned to become a major player in the European energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q3 Revenue Report October 27  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

The first Delhaize wine bottling plant opened in 1880.Capacity of bottling 18.000 bottles per hour.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportation.Zaandam  the Netherlands  28 September  2022. Yesterday  in the presence of Belgian Prime Minister  Alexander De Croo  Delhaize opened its new wine bottling plant in Brussels. Standing at 9 500 square metres  it is the largest in the Benelux  representing an investment of €30 million. The plant will not only bottle wine for Delhaize customers  but also for other Ahold Delhaize brands in Europe and the U.S. and brands outside Ahold Delhaize. With this new plant  Ahold Delhaize strengthens its wine expertise in a sustainable and efficient way.In the bottling plant  wines from different vineyards from around the world arrive in bulk  in tankers or via containers. They are stored in large barrels in the wine cellar until they are ready to be bottled. Before the wine is bottled or boxed and goes to the store  the wine goes through a number of processes such as filtering. The filtration and storage processes are still carried out in the traditional way.Reducing carbon emissions through bulk transportationIt is the ambition to bottle a natural product such as wine in a sustainable way. That is why Delhaize has invested in sustainable systems such as water and heating for cleaning and maintaining the temperature in the building. Besides that  the wine is stored underground as there is an almost constant temperature in winter and summer without the need for cooling or heating. Importing wine from all over the world in bulk  instead of bottled wines not only halves transportation costs  it also reduces the wine's carbon emissions.Sharing expertiseDelhaize wants to continue to offer affordable high-quality wine to customers. The wine that is bottled in the new plant will not only be available in Delhaize stores  but also at other brands within Ahold Delhaize. By doing so  the brands are sharing expertise with a focus on innovation  sustainability and affordable prices for customers.Wouter Kolk  CEO Ahold Delhaize Europe & Indonesia: ""The great local brands of Ahold Delhaize all have their own special or local expertise. I am always proud when we can share knowledge in a way that benefits our other brands  and their customers.Today it becomes clear that Delhaize’s 140+ years of experience in bottling wines is taken to an even more ambitious level. My congratulations to the Delhaize team for this strong and sustainable achievement!""Art of the heritageWine has always been an important product for Delhaize. Shortly after Delhaize was founded in 1867  it opened its own wine bottling plant in 1880 in Brussels. This tradition continues with the opening of the new  high-tech wine bottling plant which can bottle the equivalent of 14 Olympic swimming pools per year and has a storage capacity of three million liters of wine.New wine bottling plant in numbers:Investment of €30 million9 500 m² surface areaServes multiple Ahold Delhaize brands: Delhaize  Albert Heijn  Gall & Gall  AB Vassilopoulos  Mega Image  Albert  Hannaford and Food Lion.Storage capacity of three million liters of wine18 000 bottles bottled per hourFour bottle lines8 km of pipes in which wine is transported150 different wines73 employees and wine expertsHalf of the bottles sold at Delhaize come from this bottling plant-ENDS-Cautionary noticeThis communication includes forward-looking statements.

With the 2022-2023 term beginning next month  senior health law legal analyst Sheila Lynch-Afryl revisited the top cases from the previous term  outlining the major takeaways and how Court watchers can prepare for what's next.In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization   the Court overturned the abortion protections afforded by Roe v. Wade  and ruled that individual states have the power to set limits on abortion. In the wake of this ruling  state laws curtailing abortions have taken effect  while the Biden Administration and Congress attempt to protect abortion rights despite the decision. District courts have already come to conflicting decisions about whether EMTALA preempts state laws prohibiting abortion. Could this important issue also come before the Supreme Court during its 2022-23 term?  the Court overturned the abortion protections afforded by and ruled that individual states have the power to set limits on abortion.

District courts have already come to conflicting decisions about whether EMTALA preempts state laws prohibiting abortion. Could this important issue also come before the Supreme Court during its 2022-23 term? In Biden v. Louisiana   the Court stayed the injunctions that barred enforcement of the CMS COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 24 states  finding that HHS had the statutory authority to require providers to protect their Medicare and Medicaid patients' health and safety. According to the majority  ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a ""dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first  do no harm."" With HHS' declared COVID public health emergency probably ending early next year  the industry will have to stay vigilant about CMS' unwinding of Medicare and Medicaid flexibilities.  the Court stayed the injunctions that barred enforcement of the CMS COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 24 states  finding that HHS had the statutory authority to require providers to protect their Medicare and Medicaid patients' health and safety.

With HHS' declared COVID public health emergency probably ending early next year  the industry will have to stay vigilant about CMS' unwinding of Medicare and Medicaid flexibilities. In American Hospital Association v. Becerra  the Court unanimously invalidated a final rule that reduced drug reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals. The Court concluded that HHS didn't conduct a survey of hospitals' acquisition costs  as required by the Medicare statute. Although the Court has yet to grant cert for a Medicare case for its next term  a False Claims Act case that involved Medicare billing is currently on its docket.Who: Sheila Lynch-Afryl  J.D.

This decrease is mainly due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants in Brazil (which had started producing in the first half of 2021) and to a lower average level of resources (wind  sunshine and hydraulic flow) in the first half of 2022  whereas the resource in the first half of 2021 was at its long-term average.These factors of decrease in volume are partially offset by factors of increase:production benefits from the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3 in Brazil and Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao in France) and the first effects of the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 (mainly SSM1-2 in Brazil  Stavria in Greece and Carrière des Plaines in France); andproduction has benefited from the very strong momentum of Helexia.The increase in revenues (+7%) in a context of lower production (-19%) reflects a strong increase in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors:the contractual indexation of sales prices on indices equal or close to the consumer price index (inflation) at 83% of the revenues contractually indexed on inflation in 2021;the replacement of projects with low prices per MWh (VSM2 and VSM4  which benefit from some of the best wind levels in the world) with more tariffed projects  e.g. Helexia's solar roofs;the strengthening of the Brazilian real: with an average EUR/BRL rate of 5.55 in the first half of 2022  compared to 6.49 in the first half of 2021  which contributes to almost a third of the increase in the average selling price per megawatt hour.EBITDAEnergy Sales generate EBITDA of €53.6 million in the first half of 2022  up +8% (stable at constant exchange rates)  representing an EBITDA margin of 56.0%  i.e. +1 point compared to the first half of 2021.Detail by country:in Brazil  51% of Energy Sales  EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower production due to the divestment in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in H1 2021) and wind conditions that were less favourable than a year earlier and well below the long-term resource average. This loss of volume was almost entirely offset by a favourable exchange rate effect (strengthening of the Brazilian currency) and by contractual clauses indexing sales prices to inflation;in France  26% of Energy Sales  EBITDA benefits from the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon  Cacao and Helexia portfolio) despite a slight decrease in production due to lower wind;in the other countries (UK  Belgium  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Greece  Egypt and Jordan)  23% of Energy Sales  EBITDA is significantly higher  benefiting from the commissioning of the new Stavria solar plant in Greece in March  and the strong production of Helexia in Spain  Belgium and Portugal.Services: strong revenue and EBITDA growthFinancial key figuresIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally H1 2022 H1 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Revenues 166.9 95.9 +74% +71% Of which internal revenues 48.6 36.9 +32% +28% Of which external revenues 118.3 59.0 x2.0 x2.0 EBITDA 7.2 -5.1 N/A N/AIn the first-half of 2022 revenues from Services (internal and external) amount to €166.9 million  up +74% (+71% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting in particular from the strong growth in revenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments. EBITDA moves into positive territory despite the weight of development costs linked to the prospecting of new projects  which remains significant in order to contribute to the Group's future growth: the pipeline thus increased from 10.7 GW at the end of June 2021 to 13.6 GW at the end of June 2022  an increase of +27%.Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementRevenues from the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segments amount to €152.0 million in the first half of 2022  up +90% (+88% at constant exchange rates) compared to the first half of 2021. EBITDA from this segment increases by €12.0 million in first half of 2022 to €6.8 million. Over the period  Development benefits from the sale of projects to third party customers  including disposals that were shifted from 2021 to 2022 representing an EBITDA of approximately €10 million. In addition  Construction and Equipment Procurement benefit from the strong commercial momentum with third party customers. Voltalia has managed to control its costs  in a general context of inflation in material costs  thanks to the strength of its integrated model  which enables it to pool its equipment purchases and to finely control its expenses.Operations & MaintenanceRevenues of the Operations & Maintenance segment reach €15 million  up +17% (+12% at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from contracts in Europe and Latin America. The segment posts an EBITDA of €0.4 million (x4)  confirming the positive profitability achieved in 2021.OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 60.7 44.3 +37% +27% Eliminations and corporate -13.3 -10.1 +31% +27% EBITDA 47.4 34.1 +39% +27% Depreciation  amortisation  and provisions -31.8 -34.3 -7% -13% Operating revenue (EBIT) 15.6 -0.2 N/A N/A Financial result -13.9 -18.1 -23% -34% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -8.4 -4.1 x2.1 x1.9 Minority interests 2.1 0.9 x2.4 x2.1 Net result (Group share) -4.6 -21.4 ÷4.6 ÷4.5EBITDA before eliminations and corporate items increases by +37% to €60.7 million.

Consolidated EBITDA amount to €47.4 million  up +39% compared to 2021.Depreciation  amortisation and provisions amount to €31.8 million  down -7%. Depreciation is up  due to the plants commissioned in the first half of 2022 and the full-year effect of the plants commissioned in 2021  while provisions are down after significant allocations in the first half of 2021.At €13.9 million  net financial expenses are down -23%. Interest earned on deposits in Brazil (notably the reserve accounts required for project financing)  which rose sharply with the increase in short-term rates  more than offset the financial charges related to long-term project financing  the outstanding amounts of which are rising in line with investments on Voltalia's three continents.After taking into account minority interests and taxes  the seasonal net loss (Group share) is divided by almost 5.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at 30 June 2022 is €2.6 billion  up 23% at current exchange rates and 19% at constant exchange rates  with the difference coming from the appreciation of the Brazilian real with a EUR/BRL rate of 6.32 at the end of December 2021 compared to 5.44 at the end of June 2022.In € million 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Goodwill 80 78 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 1 846 1 510 Cash and cash equivalents 331 291 Other assets 334 234 Total assets 2 591 2 113 Equity  Group share 757 672 Minorities 108 62 Financial debt 1 398 1 050 Provisions 12 14 Other current and non-current liabilities 316 315 Total liabilities 2 591 2 113The increase in the Group's assets is mainly due to the increase in the portfolio of power plants in operation and under construction  with fixed assets up by +22% to €1 846 million.The Group's cash position at the end of June 2022 is €331 million  up +14%.This level should be compared to total financial debt of €1 398 million at the end of June 2022  up +33%  reflecting a gearing6 that remains low  at 55%.Over the period  operational activity (excluding investments) generated cash flow of €19 million.PROJECT PORTFOLIO UNDER DEVELOPMENTThe portfolio of projects under development  to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  is growing strongly to 13.6 GW at 30 June 2022  i.e. +27% compared to 30 June 2021.With the strategy of geographical diversification promoted by the Group  this portfolio is currently distributed as follows: 42% in Latin America  39% in Europe and 19% in Africa. In terms of technology  solar energy is in the majority  at 66%  followed by wind energy at 30% and other technologies at 4%.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JULY 1st 2022Construction of a 140 MW solar project in Albania7Voltalia is launching the construction of the Karavasta solar power plant  which was awarded a 30-year concession in 2020.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  to treat the rare primary immunodeficiency activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023  aligned with a Priority Review classification.Submitted by Pharming on July 29  2022  the NDA was supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in index lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Those results demonstrated the efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from the baseline size of participants' index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.006) and normalization of their immune function  as evidenced by an increased proportion of naïve B cells from the baseline (p=0.002). Those findings indicate a reduction in disease markers associated with APDS  whose clinical hallmarks include significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as increased risk of lymphoma. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial including 38 patients with APDS who were treated with leniolisib for a median of 102 weeks.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The FDA's acceptance for priority review of Pharming's New Drug Application for leniolisib is a milestone that demonstrates our commitment to addressing unmet needs for patients with rare diseases. With FDA's review  leniolisib moves further along the regulatory pathway as a potential disease-modifying targeted treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older in the US  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the FDA  as well as with regulatory authorities across the globe  to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their APDS patients.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The limited review of the half-yearly financial information by the auditor of the Company has been completed and his report has been published on the web site.The consolidated financial statements (condensed interim financial statements and notes)  reviewed by the auditor  as well as the presentation of the 2022 half-year results are available on the Solutions 30 website www.solutions30.com  under Investor Relations.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chairman of the Management Board of Solutions 30  states:“Business in the first half of the year was characterized by the continued transition in the French market and dynamic growth of activities outside France.Performance in France has been penalized by our historical markets reaching maturity and by the delay in our growth drivers—especially for the energy transition—due to supply chain disruptions. We now find ourselves in the midst of an operational transition. This is particularly true in the telecom market  which has undergone abrupt changes after peaking in the last two years. Our organization has had to adapt to this new situation and to the new demands of our customers  which is impacting all our processes and eroding our margins this year.In the Benelux and other countries  business is growing dynamically  by around 30%. This underlying trend is supported by the deployment of fiber networks in almost all the countries we operate in and by new subscriber connections. In the Benelux  where we have reached critical size  our model has become virtuous  combining business growth with increasing margins. In other areas  where we have not yet reached critical size  we are financing rapid ramp-ups  which requires recruiting and training technicians. This has an automatic impact on short-term profitability  but puts us into a position to reach critical mass and maximize value creation for our shareholders.In a volatile and rising interest rate environment  our focus is on organic growth and managing our cash flow. We have reached a low point and we anticipate a recovery in the final quarter that will continue throughout 2023. In the longer term  and despite an uncertain macroeconomic context  the group’s outlook remains favorable given Solutions 30’s positioning at the crossroads of promising structural trends—the digital transformation and the transition to more efficient and independent sources of energy.”Key figures – Consolidated dataIn millions of euros 06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change Revenue 444.3 441.3 0.7% Operating margin (Adjusted EBITDA) 29.6 49.5 -40.2% As a % of revenue 6.7% 11.2% Adjusted EBIT(1) 6.7 29.6 -77.5% As a % of revenue 1.5% 6.7% Operating income (EBIT) -8.9 17.5 - As a % of revenue -2.0% 4.0% Consolidated net income -11.3 14.6 - As a % of revenue -2.5% 3.3% Net income  group share -12.3 14.1 - As a % of revenue -2.8% 3.2% Free cash flow(1) -15.8 0.9 -16.7 Financial structure figures 06/30/2022 12/31/2021 Change Equity 183.2 191.6 -8.4 Net debt 76.6 33 1 43.5 Net bank debt(1) -20.4 -52.3 31.9(1) See glossary at the end of this documentActivityConsolidated revenueSolutions 30’s consolidated half-year revenue for 2022 amounted to €444.3 million  up +0.7% (-1.5% on an organic basis). After a limited decline in the first quarter  the group returned to modest growth in the second quarter. Solutions 30 posted the highest second quarter in its history despite an unfavorable base effect linked to record activity in the first half of 2021 caused by the boom in ultra-fast internet roll-outs in France during the COVID crisis.In France  performance continues to be penalized by a maturing fiber-optic market and the scheduled halt to smart meter roll-outs  while new activities are starting up more slowly than expected. Although sales activity is encouraging  revenue generation has slowed due to the supply disruptions affecting the photovoltaic and electric vehicle charging station markets  with historically long delivery times for vehicles.Elsewhere in Europe  business is buoyant with growth rates of around 30%. Solutions 30 has succeeded in capturing significant market share where fiber-optic deployments are booming.A virtuous business model based on 3 pillarsSolutions 30’s business model is based on 3 fundamental pillars:Scalability . Solutions 30 prefers markets where its call-outs and operating methods can be standardized to maximize economies of scale. Density . With its dense territorial coverage  Solutions 30 can reduce its response times and optimize the travel time of its technicians. Automation. The group’s IT platform automates repetitive and time-consuming tasks and optimizes technicians’ schedules and routes in real time.These three pillars underpin the group’s profitability and explain its historically profitable growth trajectory  which has enabled it to finance all its organic growth from equity since its creation in 2003.Transition of the business model in France:In the telecoms segment  which accounts for 72% of Solutions 30’s revenue in France  the group is pursuing its operational transition in a now mature market after five years of exponential growth. As explained at the end of July  the geographical redeployment of one of the group’s major contracts—following a call for tender that redistributed activities among the service provider’s partners—is weighing on the operational efficiency of the French subsidiaries  especially in the southern half of France. To meet the new parameters of this contract  Solutions 30  like its competitors  has to review all its processes and methods  recruit and train staff to obtain new authorizations  and readjust its structures locally to prepare for the future. This has a significant impact on the group’s operating profitability  as it has to bear the costs of personnel who are not yet productive  while the processes  which are still being adjusted  are not yet standardized. In addition  and pending the definitive stabilization of the geographic distribution of the contract  Solutions 30 has chosen to keep in place structures that are not operating at full capacity.In the energy segment  Solutions 30 is positioned—thanks to its historical know-how—in the markets for installing and maintaining electric charging stations  photovoltaic panels  and intelligent sensors aimed at optimizing energy consumption. These new businesses are currently experiencing supply chain disruptions and are ramping up more slowly than anticipated  preventing them from compensating for the end of smart electricity meter roll-outs. During this phase  Solutions 30 is adjusting its processes and adapting its operational organization.Overall  in France  the group has implemented an action plan aimed at returning to growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan is based on 3 pillars:Gain market share in the mature telecoms sector  where a second wave of consolidation is expected to take place as the market remains relatively fragmented. The development of new  fast-growing activities  particularly in the buoyant energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles. The strengthening of synergies between various activities  accompanied by a reassignment of technicians to activities with greater potential.In the Benelux  the group is rolling out its business model and  thanks to the critical size achieved in this region  Solutions 30 is slightly improving margins despite the fact that major fiber contracts are just getting underway.In the other countries  the group needs to reach critical size  i.e. about €100 million in revenue per country  to start optimizing its profitability. The growth of fiber throughout Europe and the group’s proven ability to capture market share should enable it to achieve this objective in 2 to 5 years depending on the country. In these countries  the focus is on revenue growth and the signing of major contracts  as is the case in Italy and the United Kingdom  where the start-up and ramp-up phases  which are currently weighing on profitability  are underway. These start-up phases require the creation of new organizational structures and more robust processes  the adoption of new IT tools  and new trainings for on-site teams.ProfitabilityFigures by geographical area are detailed below:06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Change France Revenue 221.9 270.3 -17.9% EBITDA 18.8 41.9 -55.1% EBITDA margin (%) 8.5% 15.5% Benelux Revenue 98.4 74.9 31.3% EBITDA 13.7 10.4 31.7% EBITDA margin (%) 13.9% 13.8% Other countries Revenue 124.0 96.1 29.0% EBITDA 2.4 1.7 41.2% EBITDA margin (%) 2.0% 1.8%For the group as a whole  adjusted EBITDA is down 40% to €29.6 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €49.5 million a year earlier  attributable exclusively to the activity in France as explained above.Operating costs have increased by +5.9% compared to the first half of 2021 and represent 84.1% of revenue  compared to 79.9% a year earlier  while structural costs increased by 4.9% to €40.9 million  compared to €39.0 million a year earlier.After accounting for €9.1 million in impairments and operational provisions  and after amortizing the usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  worth €13.8 million  adjusted EBIT stood at €6.7 million at June 30  2022  compared to €29.6 million a year earlier.There were €10.3 million in non-current operating expenses during the first half of 2022  mainly related to restructuring costs and exceptional transition costs incurred in connection with new contracts won in France following the above-mentioned tender (€6.7 million)  to exceptional costs incurred by the group to respond to an aggressive defamation campaign (€1.9 million)  and to expenses related to share-based payments pursuant to IFRS 2 (€1.2 million).Customer relationship amortization amounted to €7.1 million at June 30  2022  compared to €7.3 million a year earlier.Financial income represents an expense of €5.3 million from the adjustment of contingent consideration (earnout) values for €3.8 million. In the first half of 2021  financial income amounted to +€0.7 million.After including tax income of €3.0 million due to loss carryforwards  compared to an expense of €3.6 million a year earlier  the group share of net income amounted to -€12.3 million  compared to €14.1 million for the same period in 2021.Financial structureAt June 30  2022  the group had €183.2 million in equity  compared to €191.6 million at December 31  2021. The group had €85.0 million in gross cash  compared to €129.8 million at the end of December 2021. Gross bank debt stood at €64.6 million  compared to €77.5 million six months earlier  due to scheduled debt repayments. The group had €20.4 million in cash net of debt at the end of June 2022  compared to €52.3 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2021.Including €75.3 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €21.7 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the total net debt amounts to €76.6 million.The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.3 and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 41.8%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €62.0 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €92.3 million at December 31  2021. The decrease in the amount of receivables assigned is explained by the time required to ramp up new contracts. Despite the rising interest rate environment  factoring remains the most competitive short-term financing tool. Its cost remains largely under control thanks to the quality of the credit ratings of Solutions 30’s customers.Operating cash flow amounted to €15.7 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €37.9 million in the first half of 2021. The ramp-up of contracts and the reduced use of factoring generated an increase of €22.2 million in working capital requirements  which amounted to -€2.8 million. Adjusted for the change related to factoring  working capital decreased by €8.1 million.Cash flow from business activities during the first half of 2022 stood at -€6.5 million  compared to €7.2 million a year earlier  and net investments reached €9.4 million.This results in an overall free cash flow of -€15.8 million  compared to breakeven free cash flow in the first half of 2021.OutlookIn the second half of 2022  growth should accelerate and continue to be driven by activities outside France. Full-year revenue is expected to be about €900 million  compared with €874 million in 2021. In terms of profitability  the group should return to a more normal  double-digit EBITDA at the end of the year  but this will remain below 10% over the entire year. This objective is based on the rate renegotiations undertaken with the group’s customers  which began to take effect during the second quarter  as well as on the acceleration of the deployment and start-up of new contracts in Belgium  the Netherlands  Poland and the United Kingdom.From the end of this year and into 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.In each of these business segments  Solutions 30 has excellent references and a solid order book. With €770 million in orders taken since the beginning of the year  Solutions 30 is gaining market share in Europe  particularly in the deployment of fiber and the connection of homes to the ultra-fast network. In this segment alone  the group has won deals worth a total of €2.6 billion  to be delivered over the next 3 to 5 years. This figure includes new contracts and optical fiber renewals (deployment and connections). In the energy sector  Solutions 30 is pursuing it efforts  despite the shortages that are impacting supply chains. With 48 active customers for charging stations (charging service providers  energy companies  car manufacturers  and even manufacturers of charging stations)  more than 20 000 charging points installed by 2022  nearly 1 000 solar panel installations already completed  and prestigious customer references  Solutions 30 is ideally positioned to become a major player in the European energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q3 Revenue Report October 27  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

The nation is borrowing a record 14.3 trillion rupee ($176 billion) this fiscal year.,BloombergIndia has ruled out any changes to tax policies that will make it easier for the nation’s bonds to be included in global indexes  according to people familiar with the matter.The government doesn’t plan to waive capital gains taxes  and it’s concerned that foreign inflows will increase the volatility of local markets  said the people  who didn’t want to be identified discussing policy matters. Those taxes have been a stumbling block in previous negotiations.FTSE Russell and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are due to unveil the results of their index reviews in coming weeks  with investors piling into Indian bonds on bets the country will replace Russian debt. While the index compilers could proceed to include the securities without changes  discussions earlier fell apart over the government’s demand to retain the right to tax capital gains  dashing analysts’ predictions of $30 billion of foreign inflows.“Unlike equities  Indian bonds have failed to attract any sizable pool of foreign capital ” said Pankaj Pathak  a fixed-income fund manager at Quantum Asset Management Co. “India’s inclusion would add diversification to the index  enhance the yield and expand the market opportunities for global debt investors. So  the benefits might outweigh the concerns.”India’s bond market is the largest in the emerging world that’s not already included in global indexes. The nation’s benchmark 10-year bond yield has dropped around 30 basis points since the middle of June as local banks and foreign investors boosted their holdings. The yield fell seven basis points on Tuesday to 7.29%.Money managers frequently track global bond indexes when making allocation decisions  and inclusion often lead to billions of dollars of inflows.The government wants to be self-reliant in its funding  and is prepared to handle any selloff in its debt market should inclusion fail to happen  the people said. The nation is borrowing a record 14.3 trillion rupee ($176 billion) this fiscal year.A JPMorgan investor survey found that funds want India to replace Russia  which was excluded after the invasion of Ukraine  said a money manager with access to the results. Still  the survey also showed investors wanted the government to ease some rules  the person said  asking not to be identified as the discussions are private.The ability to access India’s debt market through an international central security depository  such as Euroclear  better transaction efficiency and clarity on taxes were cited as some of the key remaining hurdles to index inclusion  the fund manager said.The people didn’t say if JPMorgan had made any specific requests for its review. A finance ministry spokesperson didn’t respond to calls seeking comments  while JPMorgan declined to comment.“For passive foreign investors  it will be very important to get a solution to trade on standard platforms ” said Rajeev De Mello  a global macro portfolio manager at GAMA Asset Management in Geneva. Still  “not all investors are operationally ready but the largest active investment firms have already set up their infrastructure to support their emerging market teams who have been investing in India for many years.”India’s bonds will likely only be included in JPMorgan’s index early next year as the government still needs to address operational issues  Reuters reported  citing people with knowledge of the matter.“The market was expecting inclusion of Indian bonds into key global bond indexes ” said Arnob Biswas  a strategist at SMC Global Securities. A delay “brings more downside risk to the rupee and we are possibly heading below 82.30-82.50 to a dollar in coming weeks.”The rupee has declined almost 9% this year  and closed at 81.5762 to the dollar on Tuesday.India’s introduction of the so-called Fully Accessible Route in 2020  which removed limits on foreign ownership on some bonds  and other changes had bolstered investor optimism over index inclusion. The unrelenting stance on a tax waiver  that would facilitate settlement on a platform such as Euroclear  may undermine the attractiveness of Indian bonds even if they’re included.FTSE Russell will unveil the results of its review on Thursday  a spokesperson said.

Notably  the first half of 2022 has been marked by an important milestone for MaaT Pharma as we started our pivotal single-arm  open-label Phase 3 trial. We are satisfied with the ongoing patient enrollment for this trial  despite the public health context in the first half of the year. We are looking forward to initiating a Phase 2b for our second drug candidate  MaaT033  by the end of this year. Additionally  the construction of our new cGMP manufacturing facility is taking shape  which will be key to prepare for the entry of the first of our MaaT03X candidates into clinical study by the end of 2023. MaaT03X  a new generation of co-cultured drug candidates  is a donor-independent  highly scalable  and indication-specific product design  which has the potential to be a game-changer in improving patient responses to immunotherapies. We have watched closely the positive vote from an Advisory Committee convened by the FDA1 for the first marketing authorization application for a microbiome drug product to treat infectious diseases  that uses technology similar to our native technology. In this context  we hope to soon see the first approval of such a candidate  which would represent a major regulatory milestone for the whole industry.”Key Financial ResultsThe key unaudited financial results for the first half of 2022 are as follows:Income StatementIn thousands of euros 06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Revenue 494 385 Cost of Goods Sold (72) (27) Gross Margin 422 357 Other Income 1 793 1 189 Sales and distribution costs (140) (87) General and administrative costs (2 115) (1 058) Research and development costs (7 328) (4 384) Operating income (expense) (7 368) (3 983) Financial Income 0 0 Financial Expense (50) (64) Net financial income (expense) (49) (64) Income (loss) before income tax (7 417) (4 047) Income tax expense - - Net Income (loss) for the period (7 417) (4 047) Prepared in accordance with international standards  IFRSRevenues totaled €0.5 million for the half year ended June 30  2022  which include compensation invoiced from the compassionate access program generating a gross margin of €0.4 million.Operating loss amounted to €7.4 million compared with €4.0 million in the first half of 2021  an increase of €3.4 million. This increase reflects the growth of research and development costs which have risen from €4.4 million in the first half of 2021 to €7.3 million in 2022  representing an overall increase of €2.9 million and fully consistent with the advancement of activities  offset in part the R&D tax credit of €1.8 million included in “Other Income”:MaaT013: Phase 3 clinical trial  ARES  was initiated with the first patient dosed in March 2022. Regulatory authorization was obtained by the Company  to date  in six European countries – France  Germany  Spain  Austria  Belgium  and Italy. MaaT Pharma continues to pursue the Early Access Program in France as in 2021  allowing patients to benefit from early access to the MaaT013 therapy  mainly for the treatment of acute Graft-vs-host-Disease. As of today  the Company has safely treated over 140 patients with MaaT013 in Europe. The proof-of-concept Phase 2a trial  PICASSO  was initiated in April 2022 to evaluate MaaT013’s impact on the efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma. The trial is sponsored by AP-HP with MaaT Pharma supplying drug candidates and performing the microbiome profiling of patients using its proprietary gutPrint® platform.MaaT033: Phase 1b clinical trial  CIMON  has been completed with confirmation of principal positive results in June 2022 enabling the Company to define the dosing regimen for the next development phase.Phase 1b clinical trial  CIMON  has been completed with confirmation of principal positive results in June 2022 enabling the Company to define the dosing regimen for the next development phase.

Enrichment of Worldline’s value proposalin the dynamic marketplaces and platforms vertical...,WORLDLINE SAWorldline to acquire a 40% stakein Online Payment Platform B.V.Enrichment of Worldline’s value proposalin the dynamic marketplaces and platforms verticalParis  La Défense  September 29  2022 – Worldline [Euronext: WLN]  a global leader in payment services  announces an agreement for the acquisition of a 40% stake in Online Payment Platform B.V.  an online Payment Service Provider with a dedicated payment solution for marketplaces and platforms.Marketplaces and platforms: a fast growing e-commerce marketTransactions through marketplaces and platforms make up approximately one third of the European e-commerce volumes and are expected to increase to more than half in 2025.Business and consumer habits across the globe have undoubtedly evolved during the Covid-19 pandemic. From accelerating e-commerce trends and the transition from cash to digital payments  to encouraging innovative companies and disruptive entrepreneurs to launch new platforms  whilst existing retailers were stimulated to create their own marketplaces.Traditionally  the majority of e-commerce transactions take place on B2C web shops where payments are supported by a few global PSPs. The dynamics of marketplace and platform payments however require expertise that differs from the traditional e-commerce market. Such skills involve dealing with large quantities of merchants with a relatively low volume of sales  and the handling of escrow payments with dispute and mediation management even between consumers for marketplaces that cover as well C2C (ie Consumer to Consumer) business.Online Payment Platform (OPP)  a Dutch online PSP focused on e-commerce marketplacesFounded in 2011  Online Payment Platform (OPP) is a Dutch online PSP co-led by its founder Richard Straver  and Maurice Jongmans  CEO. The company focuses on digital payments for marketplaces and platforms with a specific focus in the C2C segment. With a team of over 60 employees they offer their services in the entire European Union and the UK  passporting their Dutch PI licence which they obtained in 2014. OPP serves over a hundred marketplaces and platforms  such as e-Bay Kleinanzeigen  Marktplaats (both part of Adevinta)  Gumtree  Royal FloraHolland and PayPal. OPP has a strong expertise in customer support for marketplaces  including fast merchant onboarding and dispute management.Story continuesIn this rapidly changing industry  OPP is perfectly positioned to comprehensively target the C2C marketplaces’ need to outsource their payment requirements and to focus on significant growth opportunities in the B2B and B2C marketplaces segments.Richard Straver  founder of OPP  stated: “We are proud to join forces with the European leader in payments  Worldline. We can leverage each other’s strengths to improve the service offering to OPP’s client base  and roll it out to new geographies for new clients. Our team is delighted to join the Worldline family and embark on this incredibly exciting next growth chapter.”Strategic rationaleOPP was looking for a global strategic partner to accelerate its growth and to expand within Worldline core European markets to be able to quickly capture the fast growing market opportunity of marketplaces and platforms. Worldline  being a global payments leader  fits that profile perfectly.The transaction enriches the growth profile of Worldline  and enables synergy for both parties involved through Worldline’s sale infrastructure. This transaction is perfectly in line with Worldline’s strategic roadmap as it expands its exposure into e-commerce and brings a proven technological brick with a unique solution built from the ground up.Marc-Henri Desportes  Deputy CEO of Worldline  stated: “I am very happy to announce today that we’ve signed an agreement for this strategic investment in OPP. This enables Worldline to get access to the exciting growth market of digital marketplaces and platforms via OPP’s European footprint and market leading scalable technology  as we continue to establish Worldline as a truly global paytech leader.”Key items of the transactionWorldline to buy a 40% minority stake in OPP in 2022The remaining 60% owned by both the founder and the CEO of OPPExpected closing by the end of 2022Call option to buy the remaining 60% in 2026The completion of the transaction is subject to approval from the Dutch Central Bank.

Sports betting & online gaming business declined by -2.8% due to a high comparison basis in H1 2021 and discontinued operations in some jurisdictions at Bet-at-Home8 in the first half. Excluding the impact of discontinued operations  Sports betting & online gaming business recorded a solid +4% growth in H1 2022 (constant exchange rates).This is reflected as follows by business:€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change % constant currency Production 929.4 1168.3 25.7% Distribution 110.4 159.6 44.4% Other 66.1 76.3 15.3 Content production & distribution 1 106.0 1 404.2 27.0% 22.1% Sportsbook 333.8 322.3 -3.5% Casino 50.0 46.5 -7.0% Poker 21.6 23.2 7.1% Other 3.2 4.6 44.9% Sports betting & online gaming 408.7 396.6 -3.0% -2.8% TOTAL REVENUE 1 514.7 1 800.8 18.9% 15.6%Content production & distribution:The strong double-digit revenue growth was well spread across the two activities: Content production was driven by new show deliveries (such as “Pride and Prejudice” in the US  “Pekin Express” and “Laura Pausini” in Italy)  the return to seasonal pre-covid production pace in the US (such as “Big Brother Celebrity”  “Masterchef”)  repeat business with formats recommission (such as “Survivor” in Australia)  a favorable production phasing with early deliveries of programs and  to a lower extent  bolt-on acquisitions. Distribution also performed well both with linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted formats. This also includes a good trend in selling new formats in different territories.Overall  the number of hours of in the catalog at the end of June 2022 reached about 134 000 hours  up +9% versus December 2021.Sports betting & online gaming:Revenue decreased by -3.0% in absolute terms to €396.6m in H1 2022. The decline was largely attributable to a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (Euro 2020 football tournament in June / July 2021)  positive impact of lockdowns in 2021 and some activities at Bet-at-home which were discontinued in the course of 2021.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued operations in some jurisdictions of Bet-at-home  revenues of the business were up +4% during the first half with a solid performance of Betclic entity (+5% revenue growth)  while partly offset by Bet-at-home  down -16%.Overall  Unique Active Players increased by +7% in H1 2022 versus H1 2021  illustrating the attractiveness of the platform. This comes in particular from the permanent enrichment of product services with high added-value content and a cutting-edge digital platform  continuing to provide its players with a safe and responsible gaming environment thanks to the development of advanced AI tools and processes  putting the player at the core of business and bringing individual support to players in need.ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA amounted to €300.7m  up +16.0% in H1 2022  splitting into +31.1% to €198.3m for Content production & distribution and -4.6% for Sports betting & online gaming as a result of revenue trend.Adjusted EBITDA margin came at 16.7% versus 17.1% in H1 2021  demonstrating FL Entertainment sound business model. Increased profitability of Content production & distribution mostly derived from increased revenue. Profitability of Sports betting & online gaming reduced on the back of the lower performance of Bet-at-home.The increase in external and personnel expenses was mainly driven by Content production & distribution  which grew in lockstep with its revenue growth  illustrating the dynamism of the activity and variability of the costs.In € million H1 2021 H1 2022 % change Content production & distribution 151.2 198.3 31.1% Sports betting & online gaming 108.2 103.2 -4.6% Holding (0.1) (0.7) Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 16.0% Content production & distribution 13.7% 14.1% Sports betting & online gaming 26.5% 26.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin 17.1% 16.7%NORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMEH1 2022 Normalized P&L highlights the performance of the group without any impact of one-off items related to reorganization & business combination.Comments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 reported P&L.In € million H1 2021Reported H1 2022Reported H1 2022Adjusted from merger Transaction impact H1 2022Normalized P&L (1) (2) (1) – (2) Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 300.7 - 300.7 Restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (14.6) 5.4 (95.8) (107.8) 12.0 LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses (79.1) (76.6) (76.6) (33.0) (43.6) Depreciation and amortization (excl D&A fiction) (54.1) (59.0) (59.0) - (59.0) Operating profit/(loss) 111.5 170.4 69.2 (140.8) 210.0 Cost of net debt (66.0) (73.6) (73.6) 0.0 (73.6) Other finance income/(costs) (10.6) (85.6) (82.7) (93.5) 10.8 Net financial income/(expense) (76.6) (159.2) (156.3) (93.5) (62.8) Share of net income from associates & joint ventures (1.4) (1.5) (1.5) - (1.5) Earnings before provision for income taxes 33.6 9.7 (88.7) (234.3) 145.7 Income tax expenses (9.4) (27.8) (27.8) - (27.8) Profit/(loss) from continuing operations 24.2 (18.2) (116.5) (234.3) 117.8 Net income/(loss) for the period of withh: 24.2 (18.2) (116.5) (234.3) 117.8 Non-controlling interests 11.3 2.1 2.1 - 2.1 Shareholders 12.8 (20.2) (118.5) (234.3) 115.8 Restructuring costs & other non-recurring items 14.6 (5.4) 95.8 107.8 (12.0) LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses 79.1 76.6 76.6 33.0 43.6 Other financial income 10.6 85.6 82.7 93.5 (10.8) Adjusted Net income 128.5 138.7 138.7 0.0 138.7One-off items related to the transaction:FL Entertainment recorded one-off items from the Group re-organization and listing transaction that occurred in H1 2022 and until 5 July 2022. They split as follow:Restructuring and other non-recurring items : €108m related to listing fee and costs incurred to realize the transaction. Under IFRS  the merger with the SPAC is considered as an equity-settled share-based payment for a service rendered by the SPAC to list the Group. This service is valued at €89m and is recorded as a listing fee.LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses : €33m mainly driven by the change in fair value of financial instruments explained by the LTIP following the upward reassessment of the Banijay Group’s shares.Other finance income / loss: €94m attributable mainly to the change in fair value of financial instruments. This splits into puts re-evaluation and the change in fair value of Vivendi’s convertible bond derivatives following the upward assessment of the Banijay Group’s shares. This bond was paid back as part of the transaction.Exceptional income from the deconsolidation of Bet-at-home Entertainment LtdFL Entertainment recorded €12m income mainly coming from the deconsolidation of Bet-at-home Entertainment Ltd in H1 2022.Net financial resultNet financial result amounted to -€62.8m in H1 2022 compared to -€76.6m in H1 2021. Of this amount:Cost of net debt amounted to -€73.6m in H1 2022 vs -€66.0m in H1 2021  mostly attributable to a higher level of interest charges explained by a timing effect of interest charges related to Betclic loan issued on 13 December 2021.Other financial income and expenses as of June 2022 amounted to +€10.8m  compared to - €10.6m for the first half of 2021 mainly explained by gains on exchange rates and derivates during H1 2022.Income tax expensesThe tax charge in H1 2022 totaled -€28m compared to -€9m in H1 2021  representing an effective tax rate of 17.8% compared with 11.2% respectively.The change is mostly explained by a particularly low effective income tax interest rate in H1 2021 due to the use of significant loss carry-forward in 2021 for Sports betting & online gaming business.Adjusted net incomeAs a result of the above  adjusted net income rose by +7.9% to €138.7m in H1 2022 from €128.5m in H1 2021.FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBT IN H1 2022HIGH FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSION IN H1 2022The Group improved significantly its adjusted free cash flow in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 thanks to positive adjusted EBITDA and tight control of cash expenses: capex remained stable while change in working capital increased on the back of timing differences for betting taxes’ payment. The rise in income taxes paid was attributable to greater use of tax loss carry-forward in H1 2021.Adjusted free cash flow conversion after capex and leases payment amounted to 83%.€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 16.0% Capex (28.8) (28.6) Total cash outflows for leases that are not recognised as rental expenses (22.3) (22.8) Adjusted free cash flow 208.2 249.3 19.7% Changes in working capital* (62.1) (68.9) Income tax paid (17.4) (33.0) Adjusted operating free cash flow 128.7 147.4 14.5%*Excludes LTIP paid and exceptional items cash-outSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION AND DE-LEVERAGINGIncluding the full impact of the transaction as of 5 July 2022  net financial debt decreased to €2 155m as of 30 June 2022 compared to €2 269m as of 31 December 2021  primarily driven by the performance of adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in net debt came mainly from adjusted free cash flows of the period for -€147m and cash proceeds received following the transaction  partly offset by vendor loans for €525m  net acquisitions for €46m and €74m interests recognized during H1 2022.Based on net debt adjusted from the transaction  the Group’s leverage reduced to 3.3x as of 30 June 2022 versus 3.7x as at 31 December 2021.

The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “VALN ” and the Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“Euronext”) under the symbol “VLA.”The offering price per ADS in U.S. dollars and the corresponding offering price per ordinary share in euros  as well as the number of ADSs and ordinary shares sold in the Global Offering  will be determined following a book building process commencing immediately. The price per ordinary share (and corresponding offering price per ADS) will be at least equal to the weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares on Euronext over a period  chosen by the Company’s Management Board  of between three (3) and ninety (90) consecutive trading days preceding the determination of the offering price  reduced by a maximum discount of 15%  if applicable.The ADSs and/or ordinary shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights and for the benefit of a specified category of persons within the meaning of Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and pursuant to the 24th resolution of the Company’s annual combined general meeting held on June 23  2022. Under the authority granted by the shareholders in the 24th resolution  the ordinary shares and ADSs may only be purchased initially by (i) natural persons and legal entities  including companies  trusts or investment funds  organized under French or foreign law  that routinely invest in the pharmaceutical  biotechnological or medical technology sector; and/or (ii) companies  institutions or entities of any type  French or foreign  that do a significant part of their business in the pharmaceutical  cosmetic  chemical or medical devices and/or technologies or research in these sectors. In order to purchase ordinary shares and/or ADSs in the Global Offering  potential investors will be required to execute and provide to the Underwriters an investor letter representing that they satisfy the foregoing investor criteria.The European Private Placement will be open only to qualified investors as such term is defined in article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14  2017.The closing of the U.S. Offering and the European Private Placement will occur simultaneously  will be conditioned on each other and are expected to occur on the third trading day after the final pricing and allocation of the Global Offering.

However  because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase  the Underwriters may determine to sell fewer or no ordinary shares in the Global Offering to Bpifrance Participations S.A.  or Bpifrance Participations S.A. may determine to purchase fewer or no ordinary shares in the Global Offering. The representative of Bpifrance Participations S.A. to the Company’s Supervisory Board (Conseil de Surveillance) did not take part in the vote on the decisions (relating to the approval for the launch of the global offering and for the delegation of authority) at the meeting of the Supervisory Board of Directors (Conseil de Surveillance) held on September 24  2022.A shelf registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the ADSs and ordinary shares in the Global Offering was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 12  2022 and was declared effective on August 19  2022.

This awakening was the starting point of our actions."" - FRÉDÉRIC FERREIRA  Food & Beverage Director & Deputy Director  ibis Paris CDG Airport.Swinging into action in the kitchensSince March 2022  the hotel has been equipped with Orbisk  smart connected e-scales that use advanced image recognition. The monitor and dashboard allow teams to compare and track food waste based on KPIs  such as food waste volumes per week and avoided CO2 emissions. The teams have decided to take this further  for example  by adding a compost heap for peelings  gathering individual unused packaged products after breakfast and launching a no-waste campaign to raise customer awareness.Concrete results for the environment and businessThis no-waste approach is already repeating results. Everyone in the team is much more aware of just how important reducing  sorting and recycling waste are – and has concrete tools to make a difference.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEuronext delivered a €167 million pay-day to five Irish finance houses – Davy  Goodbody Stockbrokers  Cantor Fitzgerald  Investec and the now defunct Campbell O’Connor – when it acquired the Irish Stock Exchange from them in 2018.However  the pan-European bourse operator  also owner of the Amsterdam  Brussels  Paris  Lisbon  Oslo and Milan stock exchanges  is making headway in recouping its investment.The latest set of annual accounts of The Irish Stock Exchange plc  which now trades as Euronext Dublin  show that the business has paid and pledged over €43.4 million of dividends to its parent since 2019.

Even casual observes of the Irish market will know that company exits from the Irish stock market have also surpassed initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent years.An area where Euronext has been successful has been in shaving 30 per cent off the Irish unit’s bill for salaries and employees’ benefits since it took over the business.It’s come at a cost  however  of local jobs  as support functions were provided by other parts of the group.

It has its own 10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring throughout the state of Illinois built using the Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system  allowing it to reach any customer by extending its network from the nearest Point-of-Presence (PoP) to the customer facility.Stratus is now also using the Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device (EAD) to provide wholesale  MEF-compliant  EPL (E-Access Ethernet Private Line) services to a third-party wireless network operator for mobile backhaul connectivity. Stratus chose the 1651 EAD primarily because of its support for wire-speed service activation testing (SAT) at 10Gbps (gigabit per second). Using IETF RFC-2544 and ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards  the 1651 acts as both the SAT generator & reflector  saving the cost of a second testing device while also speeding the SAT process.With this capability  Stratus now has the tool it needs to not only validate its service level agreements with real-time data  but also to show by how much it exceeded its contracted performance.“We are extremely pleased by the operational efficiency that the 1651 remote SAT testing has provided. Instead of rolling a truck to each site and using dedicated test equipment  we can use the built-in generator/reflector validate SLA on demand. I anticipate future cost savings as we upgrade cellular backhaul to 10Gbps line-rate without deploying any additional equipment or field techs for manual SAT testing. ”said Ben Russell  Chief Technology Officer  Stratus networks. Another reason for selecting the 1651 was Ekinops’ ability to deliver within the required timeframe  the only vendor to make that commitment of those Stratus considered”“The 1651 is ideal for what Stratus is doing ” says Kevin Antill  Ekinops’ group vice president of sales for North America. “10G is the new currency for these types of backhaul applications  especially with the far greater bandwidth 5G demands. The ability to test quickly and provide SLA reporting ensures Stratus customers that they have chosen the best partner.”Stratus becomes one of the first service providers in North America to operate a combined Ekinops network of Layer 2 Ethernet and Layer 1 WDM platforms.Press Release,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.83,0.15,0.02,True,English,"['Mobile Backhaul Connectivity', 'Stratus Networks', 'Ekinops', 'Ekinops OneOS6-based 1651 10G Ethernet Access Device', 'Ekinops360 dynamic optical transport system', '10Gb/s Ethernet Access Device', '10G/100G/200G capable fiber ring', 'E-Access Ethernet Private Line', 'greater bandwidth 5G demands', 'ITU-T Y.1564 testing standards', 'Ekinops’ group vice president', 'wire-speed service activation testing', 'private fiber network solutions', 'third-party wireless network operator', 'optical transport systems', 'access network solutions', 'second testing device', 'service level agreements', 'first service providers', 'wireless backhaul connectivity', 'strong business model', 'Chief Technology Officer', 'combined Ekinops network', '1651 remote SAT testing', 'manual SAT testing', 'mobile backhaul connectivity', 'dedicated test equipment', 'Layer 1 WDM platforms', 'wholesale, MEF-compliant, EPL', 'future cost savings', 'Layer 2 Ethernet', 'cellular backhaul', 'additional equipment', 'backhaul applications', 'network services', 'SAT generator', 'SAT process', 'Press Release', 'Euronext Paris', 'leading supplier', 'leading provider', 'Peoria Heights', 'other carriers', 'small businesses', 'education customers', 'nearest Point', 'IETF RFC', 'real-time data', 'operational efficiency', 'field techs', 'Ben Russell', 'Kevin Antill', 'North America', 'new currency', 'best partner', 'customer facility', '10Gbps line-rate', 'SLA reporting', 'Stratus Networks', 'Stratus customers', 'Illinois', 'USA', 'entities', 'sizes', 'government', 'state', 'Presence', 'PoP', '1651 EAD', 'support', 'gigabit', 'reflector', 'capability', 'tool', 'contracted', 'performance', 'truck', 'site', 'reason', 'timeframe', 'vendor', 'commitment', 'sales', 'types']",2022-09-28,2022-09-29,telecompetitor.com

From accelerating e-commerce trends and the transition from cash to digital payments  to encouraging innovative companies and disruptive entrepreneurs to launch new platforms  whilst existing retailers were stimulated to create their own marketplaces.Traditionally  the majority of e-commerce transactions take place on B2C web shops where payments are supported by a few global PSPs. The dynamics of marketplace and platform payments however require expertise that differs from the traditional e-commerce market. Such skills involve dealing with large quantities of merchants with a relatively low volume of sales  and the handling of escrow payments with dispute and mediation management even between consumers for marketplaces that cover as well C2C (ie Consumer to Consumer) business.Online Payment Platform (OPP)  a Dutch online PSP focused on e-commerce marketplacesFounded in 2011  Online Payment Platform (OPP) is a Dutch online PSP co-led by its founder Richard Straver  and Maurice Jongmans  CEO. The company focuses on digital payments for marketplaces and platforms with a specific focus in the C2C segment. With a team of over 60 employees they offer their services in the entire European Union and the UK  passporting their Dutch PI licence which they obtained in 2014. OPP serves over a hundred marketplaces and platforms  such as e-Bay Kleinanzeigen  Marktplaats (both part of Adevinta)  Gumtree  Royal FloraHolland and PayPal. OPP has a strong expertise in customer support for marketplaces  including fast merchant onboarding and dispute management.In this rapidly changing industry  OPP is perfectly positioned to comprehensively target the C2C marketplaces’ need to outsource their payment requirements and to focus on significant growth opportunities in the B2B and B2C marketplaces segments.Richard Straver  founder of OPP  stated: “We are proud to join forces with the European leader in payments  Worldline. We can leverage each other’s strengths to improve the service offering to OPP’s client base  and roll it out to new geographies for new clients. Our team is delighted to join the Worldline family and embark on this incredibly exciting next growth chapter.”Strategic rationaleOPP was looking for a global strategic partner to accelerate its growth and to expand within Worldline core European markets to be able to quickly capture the fast growing market opportunity of marketplaces and platforms. Worldline  being a global payments leader  fits that profile perfectly.The transaction enriches the growth profile of Worldline  and enables synergy for both parties involved through Worldline’s sale infrastructure. This transaction is perfectly in line with Worldline’s strategic roadmap as it expands its exposure into e-commerce and brings a proven technological brick with a unique solution built from the ground up.Marc-Henri Desportes  Deputy CEO of Worldline  stated: “I am very happy to announce today that we’ve signed an agreement for this strategic investment in OPP. This enables Worldline to get access to the exciting growth market of digital marketplaces and platforms via OPP’s European footprint and market leading scalable technology  as we continue to establish Worldline as a truly global paytech leader.”Key items of the transactionWorldline to buy a 40% minority stake in OPP in 2022The remaining 60% owned by both the founder and the CEO of OPPExpected closing by the end of 2022Call option to buy the remaining 60% in 2026The completion of the transaction is subject to approval from the Dutch Central Bank.

September 28  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the U.S. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.Naimish Patel  M.DHead of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi“Until today  there were limited treatment options to manage the relentless itch and associated sensations of burning and stinging skin that can negatively impact the lives of patients struggling with prurigo nodularis. Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for prurigo nodularis patients by alleviating the key hallmarks of the disease  such as reducing itch and achieving clearer skin. With Dupixent now approved in two diseases in dermatology where type 2 inflammation is a central driver  we look forward to further evaluating the potential of inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 in other chronic skin diseases.”George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer  Regeneron“Patients living with prurigo nodularis must often contend with dozens  if not hundreds  of itchy and painful nodules covering their body and have not had an approved treatment option for their disease. Dupixent has already transformed the treatment landscape of several diseases driven by type 2 inflammation – including atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis – and been prescribed to more than half a million patients around the world for its approved indications. With this approval  those suffering with prurigo nodularis finally have a medicine to address the debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease.”Story continuesThe FDA approval is based on data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Efficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch  clearing of skin  or both:About three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 20% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME.44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 12 weeks  compared to 16% and 22% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME2.More than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 16% for placebo.More than three times as many Dupixent patients (39% and 32%) experienced both a clinically meaningful reduction in itch and clear or almost clear skin  compared to 9% and 9% of placebo patients at 24 weeks.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. The most common adverse events (≥2%) from pooled PRIME and PRIME2 data more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  2% placebo)  conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent  1% placebo)  herpes infection (3% Dupixent  0% placebo)  dizziness (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  muscle pain (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  and diarrhea (3% Dupixent  1% placebo).A regulatory filing for prurigo nodularis is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are also planned in 2022.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful  with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are about 75 000 adults in the U.S. living with prurigo nodularis and are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis.In PRIME and PRIME2  the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks  respectively. Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale)  and the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent 300 mg is administered with a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen every two weeks following an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as prurigo nodularis  atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP and EoE.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

10760,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dupixent-dupilumab-approved-fda-first-214400203.html,Dupixent® (dupilumab) Approved by FDA as the First and Only Treatment Indicated for Prurigo Nodularis,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab)...,"Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo in direct-to-Phase 3 program consisting of two pivotal trialsAbout 75 000 adults in the U.S. living with prurigo nodularis are most in need of new treatment optionsApproval represents the second dermatology indication for Dupixent and fifth disease indication overall in the U.S.TARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  Sept. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the U.S. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.""Patients living with prurigo nodularis must often contend with dozens  if not hundreds  of itchy and painful nodules covering their body and have not had an approved treatment option for their disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent has already transformed the treatment landscape of several diseases driven by type 2 inflammation – including atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis – and been prescribed to more than half a million patients around the world for its approved indications. With this approval  those suffering with prurigo nodularis finally have a medicine to address the debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease.""Story continues""Until today  there were limited treatment options to manage the relentless itch and associated sensations of burning and stinging skin that can negatively impact the lives of patients struggling with prurigo nodularis "" said Naimish Patel  M.D  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for prurigo nodularis patients by alleviating the key hallmarks of the disease  such as reducing itch and achieving clearer skin. With Dupixent now approved in two diseases in dermatology where type 2 inflammation is a central driver  we look forward to further evaluating the potential of inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 in other chronic skin diseases.""The FDA approval is based on data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Efficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch  clearing of skin  or both:About three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 20% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 12 weeks  compared to 16% and 22% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME2More than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 16% for placeboMore than three times as many Dupixent patients (39% and 32%) experienced both a clinically meaningful reduction in itch and clear or almost clear skin  compared to 9% and 9% of placebo patients at 24 weeksThe safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. The most common adverse events (≥2%) from pooled PRIME and PRIME2 data more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  2% placebo)  conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent  1% placebo)  herpes infection (3% Dupixent  0% placebo)  dizziness (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  muscle pain (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  and diarrhea (3% Dupixent  1% placebo).A regulatory filing for prurigo nodularis is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are also planned in 2022.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful  with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are about 75 000 adults in the U.S. living with prurigo nodularis and are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis.In PRIME and PRIME2  the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks  respectively. Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale)  and the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent 300 mg is administered with a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen every two weeks following an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as prurigo nodularis  atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP and EoE.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION & INDICATIONSDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations.

Sports betting & online gaming business declined by -2.8% due to a high comparison basis in H1 2021 and discontinued operations in some jurisdictions at Bet-at-Home8 in the first half. Excluding the impact of discontinued operations  Sports betting & online gaming business recorded a solid +4% growth in H1 2022 (constant exchange rates).This is reflected as follows by business:€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change % constant currency Production 929.4 1168.3 25.7% Distribution 110.4 159.6 44.4% Other 66.1 76.3 15.3 Content production & distribution 1 106.0 1 404.2 27.0% 22.1% Sportsbook 333.8 322.3 -3.5% Casino 50.0 46.5 -7.0% Poker 21.6 23.2 7.1% Other 3.2 4.6 44.9% Sports betting & online gaming 408.7 396.6 -3.0% -2.8% TOTAL REVENUE 1 514.7 1 800.8 18.9% 15.6%Content production & distribution:The strong double-digit revenue growth was well spread across the two activities: Content production was driven by new show deliveries (such as “Pride and Prejudice” in the US  “Pekin Express” and “Laura Pausini” in Italy)  the return to seasonal pre-covid production pace in the US (such as “Big Brother Celebrity”  “Masterchef”)  repeat business with formats recommission (such as “Survivor” in Australia)  a favorable production phasing with early deliveries of programs and  to a lower extent  bolt-on acquisitions. Distribution also performed well both with linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted formats. This also includes a good trend in selling new formats in different territories.Overall  the number of hours of in the catalog at the end of June 2022 reached about 134 000 hours  up +9% versus December 2021.Sports betting & online gaming:Revenue decreased by -3.0% in absolute terms to €396.6m in H1 2022. The decline was largely attributable to a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (Euro 2020 football tournament in June / July 2021)  positive impact of lockdowns in 2021 and some activities at Bet-at-home which were discontinued in the course of 2021.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued operations in some jurisdictions of Bet-at-home  revenues of the business were up +4% during the first half with a solid performance of Betclic entity (+5% revenue growth)  while partly offset by Bet-at-home  down -16%.Overall  Unique Active Players increased by +7% in H1 2022 versus H1 2021  illustrating the attractiveness of the platform. This comes in particular from the permanent enrichment of product services with high added-value content and a cutting-edge digital platform  continuing to provide its players with a safe and responsible gaming environment thanks to the development of advanced AI tools and processes  putting the player at the core of business and bringing individual support to players in need.ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA amounted to €300.7m  up +16.0% in H1 2022  splitting into +31.1% to €198.3m for Content production & distribution and -4.6% for Sports betting & online gaming as a result of revenue trend.Adjusted EBITDA margin came at 16.7% versus 17.1% in H1 2021  demonstrating FL Entertainment sound business model. Increased profitability of Content production & distribution mostly derived from increased revenue. Profitability of Sports betting & online gaming reduced on the back of the lower performance of Bet-at-home.The increase in external and personnel expenses was mainly driven by Content production & distribution  which grew in lockstep with its revenue growth  illustrating the dynamism of the activity and variability of the costs.In € million H1 2021 H1 2022 % change Content production & distribution 151.2 198.3 31.1% Sports betting & online gaming 108.2 103.2 -4.6% Holding (0.1) (0.7) Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 16.0% Content production & distribution 13.7% 14.1% Sports betting & online gaming 26.5% 26.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin 17.1% 16.7%NORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMEH1 2022 Normalized P&L highlights the performance of the group without any impact of one-off items related to reorganization & business combination.Comments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 reported P&L.In € million H1 2021Reported H1 2022Reported H1 2022Adjusted from merger Transaction impact H1 2022Normalized P&L (1) (2) (1) – (2) Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 300.7 - 300.7 Restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (14.6) 5.4 (95.8) (107.8) 12.0 LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses (79.1) (76.6) (76.6) (33.0) (43.6) Depreciation and amortization (excl D&A fiction) (54.1) (59.0) (59.0) - (59.0) Operating profit/(loss) 111.5 170.4 69.2 (140.8) 210.0 Cost of net debt (66.0) (73.6) (73.6) 0.0 (73.6) Other finance income/(costs) (10.6) (85.6) (82.7) (93.5) 10.8 Net financial income/(expense) (76.6) (159.2) (156.3) (93.5) (62.8) Share of net income from associates & joint ventures (1.4) (1.5) (1.5) - (1.5) Earnings before provision for income taxes 33.6 9.7 (88.7) (234.3) 145.7 Income tax expenses (9.4) (27.8) (27.8) - (27.8) Profit/(loss) from continuing operations 24.2 (18.2) (116.5) (234.3) 117.8 Net income/(loss) for the period of withh: 24.2 (18.2) (116.5) (234.3) 117.8 Non-controlling interests 11.3 2.1 2.1 - 2.1 Shareholders 12.8 (20.2) (118.5) (234.3) 115.8 Restructuring costs & other non-recurring items 14.6 (5.4) 95.8 107.8 (12.0) LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses 79.1 76.6 76.6 33.0 43.6 Other financial income 10.6 85.6 82.7 93.5 (10.8) Adjusted Net income 128.5 138.7 138.7 0.0 138.7One-off items related to the transaction:FL Entertainment recorded one-off items from the Group re-organization and listing transaction that occurred in H1 2022 and until 5 July 2022.

Other financial income and expenses as of June 2022 amounted to +€10.8m  compared to - €10.6m for the first half of 2021 mainly explained by gains on exchange rates and derivates during H1 2022.Income tax expensesThe tax charge in H1 2022 totaled -€28m compared to -€9m in H1 2021  representing an effective tax rate of 17.8% compared with 11.2% respectively.The change is mostly explained by a particularly low effective income tax interest rate in H1 2021 due to the use of significant loss carry-forward in 2021 for Sports betting & online gaming business.Adjusted net incomeAs a result of the above  adjusted net income rose by +7.9% to €138.7m in H1 2022 from €128.5m in H1 2021.FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBT IN H1 2022HIGH FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSION IN H1 2022The Group improved significantly its adjusted free cash flow in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 thanks to positive adjusted EBITDA and tight control of cash expenses: capex remained stable while change in working capital increased on the back of timing differences for betting taxes’ payment. The rise in income taxes paid was attributable to greater use of tax loss carry-forward in H1 2021.Adjusted free cash flow conversion after capex and leases payment amounted to 83%.€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 16.0% Capex (28.8) (28.6) Total cash outflows for leases that are not recognised as rental expenses (22.3) (22.8) Adjusted free cash flow 208.2 249.3 19.7% Changes in working capital* (62.1) (68.9) Income tax paid (17.4) (33.0) Adjusted operating free cash flow 128.7 147.4 14.5%*Excludes LTIP paid and exceptional items cash-outSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION AND DE-LEVERAGINGIncluding the full impact of the transaction as of 5 July 2022  net financial debt decreased to €2 155m as of 30 June 2022 compared to €2 269m as of 31 December 2021  primarily driven by the performance of adjusted EBITDA.

September 28  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the U.S. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.Naimish Patel  M.DHead of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi“Until today  there were limited treatment options to manage the relentless itch and associated sensations of burning and stinging skin that can negatively impact the lives of patients struggling with prurigo nodularis. Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for prurigo nodularis patients by alleviating the key hallmarks of the disease  such as reducing itch and achieving clearer skin. With Dupixent now approved in two diseases in dermatology where type 2 inflammation is a central driver  we look forward to further evaluating the potential of inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 in other chronic skin diseases.”George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer  Regeneron“Patients living with prurigo nodularis must often contend with dozens  if not hundreds  of itchy and painful nodules covering their body and have not had an approved treatment option for their disease. Dupixent has already transformed the treatment landscape of several diseases driven by type 2 inflammation – including atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis – and been prescribed to more than half a million patients around the world for its approved indications. With this approval  those suffering with prurigo nodularis finally have a medicine to address the debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease.”The FDA approval is based on data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Efficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch  clearing of skin  or both:About three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 20% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME.44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 12 weeks  compared to 16% and 22% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME2.More than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 16% for placebo.More than three times as many Dupixent patients (39% and 32%) experienced both a clinically meaningful reduction in itch and clear or almost clear skin  compared to 9% and 9% of placebo patients at 24 weeks.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. The most common adverse events (≥2%) from pooled PRIME and PRIME2 data more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  2% placebo)  conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent  1% placebo)  herpes infection (3% Dupixent  0% placebo)  dizziness (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  muscle pain (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  and diarrhea (3% Dupixent  1% placebo).A regulatory filing for prurigo nodularis is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are also planned in 2022.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful  with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are about 75 000 adults in the U.S. living with prurigo nodularis and are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis.In PRIME and PRIME2  the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks  respectively. Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale)  and the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent 300 mg is administered with a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen every two weeks following an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as prurigo nodularis  atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP and EoE.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the U.S. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.""Patients living with prurigo nodularis must often contend with dozens  if not hundreds  of itchy and painful nodules covering their body and have not had an approved treatment option for their disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent has already transformed the treatment landscape of several diseases driven by type 2 inflammation – including atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis – and been prescribed to more than half a million patients around the world for its approved indications. With this approval  those suffering with prurigo nodularis finally have a medicine to address the debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease.""""Until today  there were limited treatment options to manage the relentless itch and associated sensations of burning and stinging skin that can negatively impact the lives of patients struggling with prurigo nodularis "" said Naimish Patel  M.D  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for prurigo nodularis patients by alleviating the key hallmarks of the disease  such as reducing itch and achieving clearer skin. With Dupixent now approved in two diseases in dermatology where type 2 inflammation is a central driver  we look forward to further evaluating the potential of inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 in other chronic skin diseases.""The FDA approval is based on data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Efficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch  clearing of skin  or both:About three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 20% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 12 weeks  compared to 16% and 22% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME2More than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 16% for placeboMore than three times as many Dupixent patients (39% and 32%) experienced both a clinically meaningful reduction in itch and clear or almost clear skin  compared to 9% and 9% of placebo patients at 24 weeksThe safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. The most common adverse events (≥2%) from pooled PRIME and PRIME2 data more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  2% placebo)  conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent  1% placebo)  herpes infection (3% Dupixent  0% placebo)  dizziness (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  muscle pain (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  and diarrhea (3% Dupixent  1% placebo).A regulatory filing for prurigo nodularis is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are also planned in 2022.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful  with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are about 75 000 adults in the U.S. living with prurigo nodularis and are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis.In PRIME and PRIME2  the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks  respectively. Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale)  and the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent 300 mg is administered with a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen every two weeks following an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as prurigo nodularis  atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP and EoE.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION & INDICATIONSDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the U.S. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.""Patients living with prurigo nodularis must often contend with dozens  if not hundreds  of itchy and painful nodules covering their body and have not had an approved treatment option for their disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent has already transformed the treatment landscape of several diseases driven by type 2 inflammation – including atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis – and been prescribed to more than half a million patients around the world for its approved indications. With this approval  those suffering with prurigo nodularis finally have a medicine to address the debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease.""""Until today  there were limited treatment options to manage the relentless itch and associated sensations of burning and stinging skin that can negatively impact the lives of patients struggling with prurigo nodularis "" said Naimish Patel  M.D  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for prurigo nodularis patients by alleviating the key hallmarks of the disease  such as reducing itch and achieving clearer skin. With Dupixent now approved in two diseases in dermatology where type 2 inflammation is a central driver  we look forward to further evaluating the potential of inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 in other chronic skin diseases.""The FDA approval is based on data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Efficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch  clearing of skin  or both:About three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 20% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 12 weeks  compared to 16% and 22% for placebo  the primary endpoint in PRIME2More than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks  compared to 18% and 16% for placeboMore than three times as many Dupixent patients (39% and 32%) experienced both a clinically meaningful reduction in itch and clear or almost clear skin  compared to 9% and 9% of placebo patients at 24 weeksThe safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. The most common adverse events (≥2%) from pooled PRIME and PRIME2 data more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent  2% placebo)  conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent  1% placebo)  herpes infection (3% Dupixent  0% placebo)  dizziness (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  muscle pain (3% Dupixent  1% placebo)  and diarrhea (3% Dupixent  1% placebo).A regulatory filing for prurigo nodularis is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are also planned in 2022.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful  with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are about 75 000 adults in the U.S. living with prurigo nodularis and are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis.In PRIME and PRIME2  the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks  respectively. Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale)  and the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis  Dupixent 300 mg is administered with a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen every two weeks following an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as prurigo nodularis  atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP and EoE.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid.

The rise in income taxes paid was attributable to greater use of tax loss carry-forward in H1 2021.Adjusted free cash flow conversion after capex and leases payment amounted to 83%.€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 16.0% Capex (28.8) (28.6) Total cash outflows for leases that are not recognised as rental expenses (22.3) (22.8) Adjusted free cash flow 208.2 249.3 19.7% Changes in working capital* (62.1) (68.9) Income tax paid (17.4) (33.0) Adjusted operating free cash flow 128.7 147.4 14.5%*Excludes LTIP paid and exceptional items cash-outSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION AND DE-LEVERAGINGIncluding the full impact of the transaction as of 5 July 2022  net financial debt decreased to €2 155m as of 30 June 2022 compared to €2 269m as of 31 December 2021  primarily driven by the performance of adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in net debt came mainly from adjusted free cash flows of the period for -€147m and cash proceeds received following the transaction  partly offset by vendor loans for €525m  net acquisitions for €46m and €74m interests recognized during H1 2022.Based on net debt adjusted from the transaction  the Group's leverage reduced to 3.3x as of 30 June 2022 versus 3.7x as at 31 December 2021.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed.
