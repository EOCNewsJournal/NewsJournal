Notably  the first half of 2022 has been marked by an important milestone for MaaT Pharma as we started our pivotal single-arm  open-label Phase 3 trial. We are satisfied with the ongoing patient enrollment for this trial  despite the public health context in the first half of the year. We are looking forward to initiating a Phase 2b for our second drug candidate  MaaT033  by the end of this year. Additionally  the construction of our new cGMP manufacturing facility is taking shape  which will be key to prepare for the entry of the first of our MaaT03X candidates into clinical study by the end of 2023. MaaT03X  a new generation of co-cultured drug candidates  is a donor-independent  highly scalable  and indication-specific product design  which has the potential to be a game-changer in improving patient responses to immunotherapies. We have watched closely the positive vote from an Advisory Committee convened by the FDA1 for the first marketing authorization application for a microbiome drug product to treat infectious diseases  that uses technology similar to our native technology. In this context  we hope to soon see the first approval of such a candidate  which would represent a major regulatory milestone for the whole industry.”Key Financial ResultsThe key unaudited financial results for the first half of 2022 are as follows:Income StatementIn thousands of euros 06/30/2022 06/30/2021 Revenue 494 385 Cost of Goods Sold (72) (27) Gross Margin 422 357 Other Income 1 793 1 189 Sales and distribution costs (140) (87) General and administrative costs (2 115) (1 058) Research and development costs (7 328) (4 384) Operating income (expense) (7 368) (3 983) Financial Income 0 0 Financial Expense (50) (64) Net financial income (expense) (49) (64) Income (loss) before income tax (7 417) (4 047) Income tax expense - - Net Income (loss) for the period (7 417) (4 047) Prepared in accordance with international standards  IFRSRevenues totaled €0.5 million for the half year ended June 30  2022  which include compensation invoiced from the compassionate access program generating a gross margin of €0.4 million.Operating loss amounted to €7.4 million compared with €4.0 million in the first half of 2021  an increase of €3.4 million. This increase reflects the growth of research and development costs which have risen from €4.4 million in the first half of 2021 to €7.3 million in 2022  representing an overall increase of €2.9 million and fully consistent with the advancement of activities  offset in part the R&D tax credit of €1.8 million included in “Other Income”:MaaT013: Phase 3 clinical trial  ARES  was initiated with the first patient dosed in March 2022. Regulatory authorization was obtained by the Company  to date  in six European countries – France  Germany  Spain  Austria  Belgium  and Italy. MaaT Pharma continues to pursue the Early Access Program in France as in 2021  allowing patients to benefit from early access to the MaaT013 therapy  mainly for the treatment of acute Graft-vs-host-Disease. As of today  the Company has safely treated over 140 patients with MaaT013 in Europe. The proof-of-concept Phase 2a trial  PICASSO  was initiated in April 2022 to evaluate MaaT013’s impact on the efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma. The trial is sponsored by AP-HP with MaaT Pharma supplying drug candidates and performing the microbiome profiling of patients using its proprietary gutPrint® platform.MaaT033: Phase 1b clinical trial  CIMON  has been completed with confirmation of principal positive results in June 2022 enabling the Company to define the dosing regimen for the next development phase.Phase 1b clinical trial  CIMON  has been completed with confirmation of principal positive results in June 2022 enabling the Company to define the dosing regimen for the next development phase. MaaT03x: Pre-clinical trials proceed as planned.Pre-clinical trials proceed as planned. Partnership with Skyepharma to establish cGMP manufacturing facility dedicated to ecosystem microbiome-based therapeutics which is expected to be operational in 2023. A second down payment was made to Skyepharma by the Company in the first half of 2022.General and administrative expenses amounted to €2.1 million for the first half of 2022 compared with €1.1 million in 2021 reflecting the structuring of the Company to meet the needs of being listed on the Euronext exchange and in support of the clinical and development programs and the associated infrastructure required.The net loss amounts to €7.4 million as of June 30  2022  compared with €4.0 million as of June 30  2021  reflecting the growth of the Company and in particular the investment in R&D.Average employees evolved from 32 in the first half of 2021 to 43 in 2022 following the strengthening of clinical operations  clinical development  manufacturing  quality assurance  and administrative teams.Cash PositionAs of June 30  2022  total cash and cash equivalents were €38.4 million  as compared to €43.3 million as of December 31  2021.The net decrease in cash position of €4.9 million between December 31  2021  and June 30  2022  is primarily due to cash used to finance operations for €7.1 million  cash used for investing of €0.2 million  offset by net cash inflows related to financing activities of €2.4 million essentially from the receipt of funds of €2.7 million in bank loans from BNP Paribas and Caisse d’Epargne Rhone Alpes (CERA). Total financial debt (including lease liabilities) totaled €8.3 million as of June 30  2022  of which €1.0 million relates to state-backed loans (“PGE”). Additional draws down  up to €4.4 million  are expected to be made in the second half of 2022 from existing facilities signed with CIC and Bpifrance.Based on the development plans and corresponding cash needs  the Company believes it has sufficient cash to finance its activities up until the end of the third quarter of 2023.Major milestones achieved in the first half of 2022Clinical and operational developmentIn Europe  MaaT013  the Company’s lead asset  is currently being evaluated in two clinical trials launched in Q1 2022:Ongoing pivotal open-label  single-arm Phase 3 trial in Europe evaluating the safety and efficacy of MaaT013 in acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease.Ongoing randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial  sponsored by AP-HP  evaluating MaaT013 in combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) for patients with metastatic melanoma.In the U.S.  interactions are ongoing with the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to extend MaaT013 clinical trial in the U.S.  which remains on clinical hold following an FDA communication received in August 2022 requiring additional information on the safety and efficacy of the Company’s “pooling” approach.In June 2022  the Company confirmed positive topline results for its Phase 1b trial evaluating MaaT033  the Company’s oral-form drug candidate  for patients with blood cancer. Having demonstrated promising preliminary and interim engraftment data  the study was completed early in January 2022.In February 2022  the Company announced its partnership with Skyepharma to build the largest cGMP facility in France entirely dedicated to microbiome-based drug candidates  expected to be operational in 2023. The investment is shared by MaaT Pharma and Skyepharma totaling €8.1 million.Next key milestones expectedEnd of second half of 2022In Q4 2022  the Company expects to initiate a pivotal Phase 2b trial evaluating MaaT033  the first oral drug candidate  to prevent complication of allo-HSCT2.

Enrichment of Worldline’s value proposalin the dynamic marketplaces and platforms vertical...,WORLDLINE SAWorldline to acquire a 40% stakein Online Payment Platform B.V.Enrichment of Worldline’s value proposalin the dynamic marketplaces and platforms verticalParis  La Défense  September 29  2022 – Worldline [Euronext: WLN]  a global leader in payment services  announces an agreement for the acquisition of a 40% stake in Online Payment Platform B.V.  an online Payment Service Provider with a dedicated payment solution for marketplaces and platforms.Marketplaces and platforms: a fast growing e-commerce marketTransactions through marketplaces and platforms make up approximately one third of the European e-commerce volumes and are expected to increase to more than half in 2025.Business and consumer habits across the globe have undoubtedly evolved during the Covid-19 pandemic. From accelerating e-commerce trends and the transition from cash to digital payments  to encouraging innovative companies and disruptive entrepreneurs to launch new platforms  whilst existing retailers were stimulated to create their own marketplaces.Traditionally  the majority of e-commerce transactions take place on B2C web shops where payments are supported by a few global PSPs. The dynamics of marketplace and platform payments however require expertise that differs from the traditional e-commerce market. Such skills involve dealing with large quantities of merchants with a relatively low volume of sales  and the handling of escrow payments with dispute and mediation management even between consumers for marketplaces that cover as well C2C (ie Consumer to Consumer) business.Online Payment Platform (OPP)  a Dutch online PSP focused on e-commerce marketplacesFounded in 2011  Online Payment Platform (OPP) is a Dutch online PSP co-led by its founder Richard Straver  and Maurice Jongmans  CEO. The company focuses on digital payments for marketplaces and platforms with a specific focus in the C2C segment. With a team of over 60 employees they offer their services in the entire European Union and the UK  passporting their Dutch PI licence which they obtained in 2014. OPP serves over a hundred marketplaces and platforms  such as e-Bay Kleinanzeigen  Marktplaats (both part of Adevinta)  Gumtree  Royal FloraHolland and PayPal. OPP has a strong expertise in customer support for marketplaces  including fast merchant onboarding and dispute management.Story continuesIn this rapidly changing industry  OPP is perfectly positioned to comprehensively target the C2C marketplaces’ need to outsource their payment requirements and to focus on significant growth opportunities in the B2B and B2C marketplaces segments.Richard Straver  founder of OPP  stated: “We are proud to join forces with the European leader in payments  Worldline. We can leverage each other’s strengths to improve the service offering to OPP’s client base  and roll it out to new geographies for new clients. Our team is delighted to join the Worldline family and embark on this incredibly exciting next growth chapter.”Strategic rationaleOPP was looking for a global strategic partner to accelerate its growth and to expand within Worldline core European markets to be able to quickly capture the fast growing market opportunity of marketplaces and platforms. Worldline  being a global payments leader  fits that profile perfectly.The transaction enriches the growth profile of Worldline  and enables synergy for both parties involved through Worldline’s sale infrastructure. This transaction is perfectly in line with Worldline’s strategic roadmap as it expands its exposure into e-commerce and brings a proven technological brick with a unique solution built from the ground up.Marc-Henri Desportes  Deputy CEO of Worldline  stated: “I am very happy to announce today that we’ve signed an agreement for this strategic investment in OPP. This enables Worldline to get access to the exciting growth market of digital marketplaces and platforms via OPP’s European footprint and market leading scalable technology  as we continue to establish Worldline as a truly global paytech leader.”Key items of the transactionWorldline to buy a 40% minority stake in OPP in 2022The remaining 60% owned by both the founder and the CEO of OPPExpected closing by the end of 2022Call option to buy the remaining 60% in 2026The completion of the transaction is subject to approval from the Dutch Central Bank.

Sports betting & online gaming business declined by -2.8% due to a high comparison basis in H1 2021 and discontinued operations in some jurisdictions at Bet-at-Home8 in the first half. Excluding the impact of discontinued operations  Sports betting & online gaming business recorded a solid +4% growth in H1 2022 (constant exchange rates).This is reflected as follows by business:€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change % constant currency Production 929.4 1168.3 25.7% Distribution 110.4 159.6 44.4% Other 66.1 76.3 15.3 Content production & distribution 1 106.0 1 404.2 27.0% 22.1% Sportsbook 333.8 322.3 -3.5% Casino 50.0 46.5 -7.0% Poker 21.6 23.2 7.1% Other 3.2 4.6 44.9% Sports betting & online gaming 408.7 396.6 -3.0% -2.8% TOTAL REVENUE 1 514.7 1 800.8 18.9% 15.6%Content production & distribution:The strong double-digit revenue growth was well spread across the two activities: Content production was driven by new show deliveries (such as “Pride and Prejudice” in the US  “Pekin Express” and “Laura Pausini” in Italy)  the return to seasonal pre-covid production pace in the US (such as “Big Brother Celebrity”  “Masterchef”)  repeat business with formats recommission (such as “Survivor” in Australia)  a favorable production phasing with early deliveries of programs and  to a lower extent  bolt-on acquisitions. Distribution also performed well both with linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted formats. This also includes a good trend in selling new formats in different territories.Overall  the number of hours of in the catalog at the end of June 2022 reached about 134 000 hours  up +9% versus December 2021.Sports betting & online gaming:Revenue decreased by -3.0% in absolute terms to €396.6m in H1 2022. The decline was largely attributable to a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (Euro 2020 football tournament in June / July 2021)  positive impact of lockdowns in 2021 and some activities at Bet-at-home which were discontinued in the course of 2021.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued operations in some jurisdictions of Bet-at-home  revenues of the business were up +4% during the first half with a solid performance of Betclic entity (+5% revenue growth)  while partly offset by Bet-at-home  down -16%.Overall  Unique Active Players increased by +7% in H1 2022 versus H1 2021  illustrating the attractiveness of the platform. This comes in particular from the permanent enrichment of product services with high added-value content and a cutting-edge digital platform  continuing to provide its players with a safe and responsible gaming environment thanks to the development of advanced AI tools and processes  putting the player at the core of business and bringing individual support to players in need.ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA amounted to €300.7m  up +16.0% in H1 2022  splitting into +31.1% to €198.3m for Content production & distribution and -4.6% for Sports betting & online gaming as a result of revenue trend.Adjusted EBITDA margin came at 16.7% versus 17.1% in H1 2021  demonstrating FL Entertainment sound business model. Increased profitability of Content production & distribution mostly derived from increased revenue. Profitability of Sports betting & online gaming reduced on the back of the lower performance of Bet-at-home.The increase in external and personnel expenses was mainly driven by Content production & distribution  which grew in lockstep with its revenue growth  illustrating the dynamism of the activity and variability of the costs.In € million H1 2021 H1 2022 % change Content production & distribution 151.2 198.3 31.1% Sports betting & online gaming 108.2 103.2 -4.6% Holding (0.1) (0.7) Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 16.0% Content production & distribution 13.7% 14.1% Sports betting & online gaming 26.5% 26.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin 17.1% 16.7%NORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMEH1 2022 Normalized P&L highlights the performance of the group without any impact of one-off items related to reorganization & business combination.Comments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 reported P&L.In € million H1 2021Reported H1 2022Reported H1 2022Adjusted from merger Transaction impact H1 2022Normalized P&L (1) (2) (1) – (2) Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 300.7 - 300.7 Restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (14.6) 5.4 (95.8) (107.8) 12.0 LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses (79.1) (76.6) (76.6) (33.0) (43.6) Depreciation and amortization (excl D&A fiction) (54.1) (59.0) (59.0) - (59.0) Operating profit/(loss) 111.5 170.4 69.2 (140.8) 210.0 Cost of net debt (66.0) (73.6) (73.6) 0.0 (73.6) Other finance income/(costs) (10.6) (85.6) (82.7) (93.5) 10.8 Net financial income/(expense) (76.6) (159.2) (156.3) (93.5) (62.8) Share of net income from associates & joint ventures (1.4) (1.5) (1.5) - (1.5) Earnings before provision for income taxes 33.6 9.7 (88.7) (234.3) 145.7 Income tax expenses (9.4) (27.8) (27.8) - (27.8) Profit/(loss) from continuing operations 24.2 (18.2) (116.5) (234.3) 117.8 Net income/(loss) for the period of withh: 24.2 (18.2) (116.5) (234.3) 117.8 Non-controlling interests 11.3 2.1 2.1 - 2.1 Shareholders 12.8 (20.2) (118.5) (234.3) 115.8 Restructuring costs & other non-recurring items 14.6 (5.4) 95.8 107.8 (12.0) LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses 79.1 76.6 76.6 33.0 43.6 Other financial income 10.6 85.6 82.7 93.5 (10.8) Adjusted Net income 128.5 138.7 138.7 0.0 138.7One-off items related to the transaction:FL Entertainment recorded one-off items from the Group re-organization and listing transaction that occurred in H1 2022 and until 5 July 2022.

Of this amount:Cost of net debt amounted to -€73.6m in H1 2022 vs -€66.0m in H1 2021  mostly attributable to a higher level of interest charges explained by a timing effect of interest charges related to Betclic loan issued on 13 December 2021.Other financial income and expenses as of June 2022 amounted to +€10.8m  compared to - €10.6m for the first half of 2021 mainly explained by gains on exchange rates and derivates during H1 2022.Income tax expensesThe tax charge in H1 2022 totaled -€28m compared to -€9m in H1 2021  representing an effective tax rate of 17.8% compared with 11.2% respectively.The change is mostly explained by a particularly low effective income tax interest rate in H1 2021 due to the use of significant loss carry-forward in 2021 for Sports betting & online gaming business.Adjusted net incomeAs a result of the above  adjusted net income rose by +7.9% to €138.7m in H1 2022 from €128.5m in H1 2021.FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBT IN H1 2022HIGH FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSION IN H1 2022The Group improved significantly its adjusted free cash flow in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 thanks to positive adjusted EBITDA and tight control of cash expenses: capex remained stable while change in working capital increased on the back of timing differences for betting taxes’ payment. The rise in income taxes paid was attributable to greater use of tax loss carry-forward in H1 2021.Adjusted free cash flow conversion after capex and leases payment amounted to 83%.€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change Adjusted EBITDA 259.3 300.7 16.0% Capex (28.8) (28.6) Total cash outflows for leases that are not recognised as rental expenses (22.3) (22.8) Adjusted free cash flow 208.2 249.3 19.7% Changes in working capital* (62.1) (68.9) Income tax paid (17.4) (33.0) Adjusted operating free cash flow 128.7 147.4 14.5%*Excludes LTIP paid and exceptional items cash-outSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION AND DE-LEVERAGINGIncluding the full impact of the transaction as of 5 July 2022  net financial debt decreased to €2 155m as of 30 June 2022 compared to €2 269m as of 31 December 2021  primarily driven by the performance of adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in net debt came mainly from adjusted free cash flows of the period for -€147m and cash proceeds received following the transaction  partly offset by vendor loans for €525m  net acquisitions for €46m and €74m interests recognized during H1 2022.Based on net debt adjusted from the transaction  the Group’s leverage reduced to 3.3x as of 30 June 2022 versus 3.7x as at 31 December 2021.

Let’s take a closer look at how this commitment is being brought to life in our hotels every day and  in particular  at ibis Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.Our hotels serve more than 150 million meals a year. As restaurateurs  through food  we can take concrete action to shape the future of travel and deliver a more sustainable hospitality model. Because today’s model is no longer viable.

Under the leadership of Frederic Ferreira  Food & Beverage Director & Deputy Director  the F&B team has deployed numerous eco-responsible actions  from waste reduction  sorting and recycling to harvesting rainwater and eliminating single-use plastic.""A few years ago  we realized that it was time  more than ever  to act against food waste. This awakening was the starting point of our actions."" - FRÉDÉRIC FERREIRA  Food & Beverage Director & Deputy Director  ibis Paris CDG Airport.Swinging into action in the kitchensSince March 2022  the hotel has been equipped with Orbisk  smart connected e-scales that use advanced image recognition. The monitor and dashboard allow teams to compare and track food waste based on KPIs  such as food waste volumes per week and avoided CO2 emissions. The teams have decided to take this further  for example  by adding a compost heap for peelings  gathering individual unused packaged products after breakfast and launching a no-waste campaign to raise customer awareness.Concrete results for the environment and businessThis no-waste approach is already repeating results. Everyone in the team is much more aware of just how important reducing  sorting and recycling waste are – and has concrete tools to make a difference. In the longer term  the team will be able to reduce food waste by 50%  while also boosting their business objectives.ibis Paris CDG Airport— Photo by AccorChanging mentalities and ways of workingReflecting evolving behaviors and more sustainable values  this shift towards putting sustainability on the table every day is taking place across all Accor hotels.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEuronext delivered a €167 million pay-day to five Irish finance houses – Davy  Goodbody Stockbrokers  Cantor Fitzgerald  Investec and the now defunct Campbell O’Connor – when it acquired the Irish Stock Exchange from them in 2018.However  the pan-European bourse operator  also owner of the Amsterdam  Brussels  Paris  Lisbon  Oslo and Milan stock exchanges  is making headway in recouping its investment.The latest set of annual accounts of The Irish Stock Exchange plc  which now trades as Euronext Dublin  show that the business has paid and pledged over €43.4 million of dividends to its parent since 2019.

From accelerating e-commerce trends and the transition from cash to digital payments  to encouraging innovative companies and disruptive entrepreneurs to launch new platforms  whilst existing retailers were stimulated to create their own marketplaces.Traditionally  the majority of e-commerce transactions take place on B2C web shops where payments are supported by a few global PSPs. The dynamics of marketplace and platform payments however require expertise that differs from the traditional e-commerce market. Such skills involve dealing with large quantities of merchants with a relatively low volume of sales  and the handling of escrow payments with dispute and mediation management even between consumers for marketplaces that cover as well C2C (ie Consumer to Consumer) business.Online Payment Platform (OPP)  a Dutch online PSP focused on e-commerce marketplacesFounded in 2011  Online Payment Platform (OPP) is a Dutch online PSP co-led by its founder Richard Straver  and Maurice Jongmans  CEO. The company focuses on digital payments for marketplaces and platforms with a specific focus in the C2C segment.

OPP serves over a hundred marketplaces and platforms  such as e-Bay Kleinanzeigen  Marktplaats (both part of Adevinta)  Gumtree  Royal FloraHolland and PayPal. OPP has a strong expertise in customer support for marketplaces  including fast merchant onboarding and dispute management.In this rapidly changing industry  OPP is perfectly positioned to comprehensively target the C2C marketplaces’ need to outsource their payment requirements and to focus on significant growth opportunities in the B2B and B2C marketplaces segments.Richard Straver  founder of OPP  stated: “We are proud to join forces with the European leader in payments  Worldline. We can leverage each other’s strengths to improve the service offering to OPP’s client base  and roll it out to new geographies for new clients. Our team is delighted to join the Worldline family and embark on this incredibly exciting next growth chapter.”Strategic rationaleOPP was looking for a global strategic partner to accelerate its growth and to expand within Worldline core European markets to be able to quickly capture the fast growing market opportunity of marketplaces and platforms. Worldline  being a global payments leader  fits that profile perfectly.The transaction enriches the growth profile of Worldline  and enables synergy for both parties involved through Worldline’s sale infrastructure. This transaction is perfectly in line with Worldline’s strategic roadmap as it expands its exposure into e-commerce and brings a proven technological brick with a unique solution built from the ground up.Marc-Henri Desportes  Deputy CEO of Worldline  stated: “I am very happy to announce today that we’ve signed an agreement for this strategic investment in OPP. This enables Worldline to get access to the exciting growth market of digital marketplaces and platforms via OPP’s European footprint and market leading scalable technology  as we continue to establish Worldline as a truly global paytech leader.”Key items of the transactionWorldline to buy a 40% minority stake in OPP in 2022The remaining 60% owned by both the founder and the CEO of OPPExpected closing by the end of 2022Call option to buy the remaining 60% in 2026The completion of the transaction is subject to approval from the Dutch Central Bank.

Sports betting & online gaming business declined by -2.8% due to a high comparison basis in H1 2021 and discontinued operations in some jurisdictions at Bet-at-Home8 in the first half. Excluding the impact of discontinued operations  Sports betting & online gaming business recorded a solid +4% growth in H1 2022 (constant exchange rates).This is reflected as follows by business:€m H1 2021 H1 2022 % change % constant currency Production 929.4 1168.3 25.7% Distribution 110.4 159.6 44.4% Other 66.1 76.3 15.3 Content production & distribution 1 106.0 1 404.2 27.0% 22.1% Sportsbook 333.8 322.3 -3.5% Casino 50.0 46.5 -7.0% Poker 21.6 23.2 7.1% Other 3.2 4.6 44.9% Sports betting & online gaming 408.7 396.6 -3.0% -2.8% TOTAL REVENUE 1 514.7 1 800.8 18.9% 15.6%Content production & distribution:The strong double-digit revenue growth was well spread across the two activities: Content production was driven by new show deliveries (such as “Pride and Prejudice” in the US  “Pekin Express” and “Laura Pausini” in Italy)  the return to seasonal pre-covid production pace in the US (such as “Big Brother Celebrity”  “Masterchef”)  repeat business with formats recommission (such as “Survivor” in Australia)  a favorable production phasing with early deliveries of programs and  to a lower extent  bolt-on acquisitions. Distribution also performed well both with linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted formats. This also includes a good trend in selling new formats in different territories.Overall  the number of hours of in the catalog at the end of June 2022 reached about 134 000 hours  up +9% versus December 2021.Sports betting & online gaming:Revenue decreased by -3.0% in absolute terms to €396.6m in H1 2022. The decline was largely attributable to a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (Euro 2020 football tournament in June / July 2021)  positive impact of lockdowns in 2021 and some activities at Bet-at-home which were discontinued in the course of 2021.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued operations in some jurisdictions of Bet-at-home  revenues of the business were up +4% during the first half with a solid performance of Betclic entity (+5% revenue growth)  while partly offset by Bet-at-home  down -16%.Overall  Unique Active Players increased by +7% in H1 2022 versus H1 2021  illustrating the attractiveness of the platform.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed.

The remaining ordinary shares sold in the Global Offering were primarily purchased by the Company’s existing U.S. and European investors. Bpifrance Participations S.A.  an existing shareholder of the Company  has agreed to purchase approximately 4.86% of the total number of ordinary shares (including those sold in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. On this basis  after completion of the Global Offering  Bpifrance Participations S.A. and Deep Track Capital will hold approximately 6.97% and 7.60%  respectively  of the share capital of the Company.The European Private Placement was open only to qualified investors as such term is defined in article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14  2017.Estimated Proceeds from the Global OfferingThe gross proceeds of the sale of 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $99.9 million (€102.9 million). The Company estimates that the net proceeds of the Global Offering will be approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  after deducting approximately $6.0 million (€6.2 million) in underwriting commissions and approximately $0.7 million (€0.8 million) in offering expenses.UnderwritingThe Global Offering is subject to an underwriting agreement covering the entirety of the Global Offering. The underwriting agreement was entered into on September 29  2022 in connection with the determination of the Global Offering Price.The underwriting agreement does not constitute a “garantie de bonne fin” within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).Reasons for the Offering – Use of ProceedsThe Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering as follows: approximately 50% to finance the co-development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against Lyme disease (VLA15); approximately 40% to finance the development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (VLA1553); approximately 5% to finance the development of two of its preclinical vaccine candidates  VLA1554 and VLA2112; and the remaining 5% for working capital and for general corporate purposes.As of June 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €336.2 million. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents  together with the net proceeds of the Global Offering of approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the end of 2024.DilutionThe 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) issued in the Global Offering will represent a dilution of approximately 17.9% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.82%.Terms and Conditions of the Securities to be Issued – Closing and DeliveryThe closing and delivery of the Global Offering will occur  on or about October 4  2022.The ordinary shares offered in the Global Offering  including those underlying ADSs  will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Paris (Compartment B) on the same trading line as the existing shares under the same ISIN code FR0004056851 and under the ticker “VLA” and are expected to be admitted to trading on October 4  2022.DocumentationThe Company has filed a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the ADSs and ordinary shares in the Global Offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 12  2022 which was declared effective on August 19  2022.

At this instance  no further challenges are available. The Company is registering a provision of approximately US$109 000 according to the amount stated in the March 19  2021 ruling for this case.RISK MANAGEMENT: For more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 5 of the Group's 2022 Half-year Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN"": This statement is made taking into account the global health crisis and economic fallout caused by the pandemic Covid-19. There is instability in our markets and globally that could impact on Group activities in ways that are currently unpredictable. To account for the unpredictable conditions  in forecasting future cash flows in our assessment of Going Concern  Management has made certain extraordinary assumptions. Specifically  we have:Forecasted a materially negative impact on revenue for the years 2023 and 2024. Forecasted expenses to remain approximately at the levels they are as on date of publication of our 2022 Annual Report  meaning we are assuming (for Going Concern assessment only) that the Group has no more flexibility to drive down expenses further. Assumed that the Group will be able to continue to defer junior debt and to negotiate terms for repayment as liquidity becomes available. Assumed no development nor material construction  but do assume some repurposing of existing real estate to accommodate for changes in demand. Forecasted no extraordinary one-time events that may impact positively or negatively on the Group's cash flows  though such events are possible particularly given the environment. Assumed a stable regulatory environment in all countries with existing operations  and have forecasted receiving no governmental support apart from what has already been received.Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future  which Management and the Directors have defined as being at least the next 12 months from the filing of this 2022 Half-year Report. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (vii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Half-year Report  the Group forecasts operating with low levels of reserves and working capital. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period  which ability to liquidate assets is contingent on market factors that are not within the control of the Group.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

10811,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4543766-azelis-defensive-idea-fast-changing-world,Azelis: A Defensive Idea In A Fast-Changing World (OTCMKTS:AZLGF),Azelis is a service provider to the food & beverage and specialty chemicals industry. Click here for a full investment analysis.,ollo/E+ via Getty ImagesIntroductionAzelis (OTCPK:AZLGF) is a service provider to the specialty chemicals and the food ingredients industry. That doesn't sound very exciting but one of Azelis' core areas of expertise is working on innovative formulations for its clients. The two images below from Azelis' corporate presentation show examples of what the company deals with on a daily basis.Azelis Investor RelationsAzelis is also working its magic in the specialty chemicals industry and I found this specific case quite interesting.Azelis Investor RelationsWhile these are obviously just some examples  it gives you an idea of what Azelis does for its customers.Yahoo FinanceAzelis has its primary listing on Euronext Brussels where it is trading with AZE as its ticker symbol and considering the average daily volume exceeds 60 000 shares per day  I would strongly recommend to trade in Azelis' shares using the facilities of Euronext Brussels. As there are just under 234 million shares outstanding  the current market capitalization of the company is approximately 5.15B EUR.Azelis reported surprisingly strong results in the first semesterI wouldn't say Azelis is completely immune to economic shocks as a disappointing result for its customer base may reduce the R&D budgets which would  directly and indirectly  hurt Azelis as well. But for the time being  the company's financial performance remains exceptionally strong.In the first half of 2022  the company reported 54% revenue increase  and even if one would isolate the impact from M&A activities  the organic revenue growth was almost 28% and that is pretty impressive.Azelis Investor RelationsAs you can see above  the company reported a total revenue of almost 2.03B EUR resulting in a gross profit of just under 490M EUR. This means the 54% reported revenue increase resulted in a 65% gross profit increase.The operating profit actually more than doubled to 212M EUR and this  in combination with a decreasing financial expense (lower cost debt and a lower gross debt level)  the pre-tax income jumped from 75M EUR to 191M EUR. An increase of in excess of 150%.The net income came in at 141.7M EUR of which about 138.8M EUR was attributable to the common shareholders of Azelis with almost 2.9M EUR attributable to the non-controlling interests. The EPS in the first half of the year was 0.59 EUR. On an annualized basis this would yield a result of 1.2 EUR per share (and likely higher given Azelis' continuous acquisition spree) and based on the current share price of in excess of 20 EUR per share  the stock does not look very appealing.There is  however  more than meets the eye here as Azelis runs a very capex-light business model and the depreciation and amortization expenses are a multiple of the effective capex and lease expenses.As you can see on the cash flow statement below  the company reported an operating cash flow of 96M EUR but unsurprisingly  there are a few adjustments we need to make here. First of all  we need to deduct an additional 10M EUR in taxes as the total income tax was approximately 49M EUR as per the income statement but Azelis only paid 38.8M EUR in cash taxes.Secondly  the operating cash flow also includes a 101M EUR investment in the working capital position. So on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was 187M EUR. And after deducting the 10M EUR in lease payments  the adjusted operating cash flow was 177M EUR.Azelis Investor RelationsAnd as the total capex was just 8.5M EUR  the free cash flow result was approximately 168M EUR and I estimate about 165M EUR of this was attributable to the common shareholders of Azelis. This represents a free cash flow per share of 0.70 EUR and that makes the stock already more attractive.Azelis continues to pursue an M&A strategy whereby it identifies and acquires smaller bolt-on acquisitions. In the first half of the year  Azelis closed the acquisition of five companies while it expects to complete five more acquisitions in the current semester. The total commitment to acquire these five companies in the first half of the year was 172M EUR but these companies should add about 190M in annualized revenue. If Azelis can replicate its own EBITDA margins of approximately 12% on these acquisitions  the total EBITDA generated by the acquired companies would be around 24M EUR indicating an EBITDA multiple of 8 as acquisition cost which is pretty reasonable.Azelis' capital allocation priorities are pretty clear. The company pays a very symbolic dividend and prefers to use its incoming free cash flow to pursue new acquisitions to continue to grow the business.I'm fine with a 'buy and build' strategy on the condition the balance sheet can handle it. As of the end of June  Azelis had approximately 386M EUR in cash while the gross debt increased to 1.29B EUR for a net debt position of approximately 900M EUR (excluding lease obligations). That is still fine considering I am expecting an EBITDA north of 500M EUR for the year. Azelis is guiding for a full-year EBITA (excluding depreciation expenses) of 410-425M EUR but the company may be a bit more conservative. In any case  even using a 450M EUR full-year EBITDA would still result in a debt ratio of just around two times EBITDA. Not bad at all.Investment thesisAzelis doesn't have a lot of competitors and it's difficult to figure out a fair value for the shares. But considering the free cash flow yield will come in at around 6.5% and the current EV/EBITDA ratio is just around 13 (which is more than okay for a relatively defensive company)  I will be keeping an eye on Azelis.The stock isn't in bargain territory yet and right now there are plenty of other opportunities available. I'm not a buyer of Azelis at the current share price but will monitor its progress and cash flow evolution.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.45,0.16,0.38,True,English,"['Defensive Idea', 'Fast-Changing World', 'Azelis', 'OTCMKTS', 'AZLGF', 'incoming free cash flow', 'lower gross debt level', ""Azelis' capital allocation priorities"", 'free cash flow result', 'working capital position', 'food ingredients industry', 'R&D budgets', 'M&A activities', 'lower cost debt', 'operating cash flow', 'current market capitalization', 'cash flow statement', 'average daily volume', 'decreasing financial expense', 'net debt position', 'organic revenue growth', 'specialty chemicals industry', 'continuous acquisition spree', 'capex-light business model', '101M EUR investment', 'M&A strategy', 'Azelis Investor Relations', 'additional 10M EUR', 'total income tax', 'current share price', '65% gross profit increase', 'operating profit', 'net income', 'income statement', 'current semester', 'financial performance', 'acquisition cost', 'total revenue', 'cash taxes', 'disappointing result', 'pre-tax income', '54% revenue increase', 'total capex', 'total commitment', 'annualized revenue', 'daily basis', 'Getty Images', 'service provider', 'core areas', 'innovative formulations', 'two images', 'corporate presentation', 'specific case', 'Yahoo Finance', 'primary listing', 'Euronext Brussels', 'ticker symbol', 'strong results', 'first semester', 'economic shocks', 'customer base', 'first half', '141.7M EUR', 'common shareholders', 'non-controlling interests', 'The EPS', 'amortization expenses', 'effective capex', 'lease expenses', 'lease payments', 'smaller bolt', 'symbolic dividend', 'balance sheet', 'lease obligations', 'full-year EBITA', 'total EBITDA', 'annualized basis', 'EBITDA margins', 'depreciation expenses', '234 million shares', 'new acquisitions', 'five companies', '1.2 EUR', '20 EUR', '60,000 shares', 'ollo/E+', 'Introduction', 'OTCPK', 'AZLGF', 'expertise', 'clients', 'examples', 'company', 'magic', 'idea', 'customers', 'day', 'facilities', '15B', 'time', 'impact', '3B', '490M', '212M', 'combination', '75M', '191M', 'excess', '2.9M', 'stock', 'eye', '96M', 'adjustments', '49M', '187M', '177M', '8.5M', '168M', '165M', '172M', '190M', '24M', 'buy', 'build', 'condition', 'June', '386M', '1.29B', '900M', '500M']",2022-09-30,2022-09-30,seekingalpha.com

The Company is registering a provision of approximately US$109 000 according to the amount stated in the March 19  2021 ruling for this case.RISK MANAGEMENT: For more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 5 of the Group's 2022 Half-year Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN"": This statement is made taking into account the global health crisis and economic fallout caused by the pandemic Covid-19. There is instability in our markets and globally that could impact on Group activities in ways that are currently unpredictable. To account for the unpredictable conditions  in forecasting future cash flows in our assessment of Going Concern  Management has made certain extraordinary assumptions. Specifically  we have:Forecasted a materially negative impact on revenue for the years 2023 and 2024. Forecasted expenses to remain approximately at the levels they are as on date of publication of our 2022 Annual Report  meaning we are assuming (for Going Concern assessment only) that the Group has no more flexibility to drive down expenses further. Assumed that the Group will be able to continue to defer junior debt and to negotiate terms for repayment as liquidity becomes available. Assumed no development nor material construction  but do assume some repurposing of existing real estate to accommodate for changes in demand. Forecasted no extraordinary one-time events that may impact positively or negatively on the Group's cash flows  though such events are possible particularly given the environment. Assumed a stable regulatory environment in all countries with existing operations  and have forecasted receiving no governmental support apart from what has already been received.Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future  which Management and the Directors have defined as being at least the next 12 months from the filing of this 2022 Half-year Report. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (vii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Half-year Report  the Group forecasts operating with low levels of reserves and working capital. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period  which ability to liquidate assets is contingent on market factors that are not within the control of the Group.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

For that reason  we have decided to step away from the opportunity to monetize our Europa seed portfolio this year and we will reevaluate once a calmer environment has returned.”Francois Trausch  CEO of Allianz Real Estate  said: “We value our ongoing relationship with our long-term partner VGP and we continue to find the logistics asset class in Europe attractive. VGP’s pipeline portfolio remains a promising opportunity for Allianz Real Estate being built at prime locations  with quality tenants and to high ESG standards.”The closing transaction for the VGP Park München joint venture is anticipated to be conducted before end of year. A decision on the timing of the Europa seed portfolio closing is expected to be taken next year. In the meantime  bank financing facilities are available and the Group is evaluating all financing options.CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing) Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

DDHT is also the group's pool of human resources to train solution operators  both for the logistics sector (Countbot solution) and for the security sector (ISS Spotter solutions). For the 1st half of 2022  the DDHT division achieved a turnover of €6.2 million and a slightly positive current operating income (€18.4 K).Delta Drone International and its operational subsidiaries (DDI): following the sale at the beginning of the year of the Israeli subsidiary Parazero  DDI is now exclusively present in Africa and Australia  mainly in the southern hemisphere. It is developing a drone services activity for the mining and agriculture sectors. Operating historically in Africa (South Africa  Ghana  Namibia  Zambia  Ivory Coast) where its Rocketmine brand is the market leader  DDI has been developing since 2021 in Australia. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDI division achieved a turnover of €1.9 million and a negative current operating income (-€836 K)  mostly impacted by the weight of significant ""governance costs""  of the order of €300 K annually  which was terminated during the period.Story continuesUDT – United Drone Technologies : UDT is an investment company  which therefore does not achieve any turnover or bear any operating costs. UDT holds stakes  still in the minority  in 5 young companies in the drone sector  3 French companies (Donecle  Elistair  Diodon)  1 Swiss company (Aero41) and 1 Israeli company (Sightec). In 2021  the transition of the group's accounts to IFRS standards led to the recognition of €4.2 million as ""other financial income and expenses""  reflecting the appreciation of the value of the portfolio in relation to the initial investment. For the first half of 2022  the continued development of certain holdings led to the recognition of revenue of €1 million.DDSA (Delta Drone SA and its French support subsidiaries): in addition to its role as the group's parent company  this branch supports the R&D investments necessary for the development of Countbot (logistics) and ISS Spotter (security) professional solutions. It is also responsible for their production and marketing. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDSA division achieved a turnover of €0.5 million and a negative current operating income (-€4.8 million)  which corresponds to the bulk of the group's consolidated loss.The objective of achieving financial equilibrium is primarily due to a new impetus from the DDSA branchThe beginning of 2022 will have been marked by the end of heavy R&D investments and the beginning of the commercialization of the Countbot and ISS Spotter systems. Commercial contacts are now numerous and should lead  from the end of the financial year and especially in 2023  to a very significant growth in turnover within the DDSA branch.However  it appeared necessary  in parallel  to work on the significant reduction of operating expenses. It is in this logic that two waves of workforce reduction were carried out  the first in May (6 employees concerned) and the second in September (9 employees concerned). In the end  these departures  combined with several resignations  will make it possible to start the 2023 financial year with a payroll divided by more than 2  i.e.  an annual amount of around €2 million (against €4.8 million previously). At the same time  the reduction in other external expenses should reduce their amount from €2.5 million to €1.5 million year-on-year.Finally  the placement under backup of the subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering (DDE) on August 31  2022 is intended to leave open all opportunities for the evolution of this entity.Finalization of the financing method through the equitization of simple bondsReminder of the modalities of equitization of the OSDelta Drone (the ""Company"") has issued  in two tranches carried out on July 15  2022 and September 15  2022 in the context of reserved issues for the benefit of certain investors  a total number of 60 000 simple bonds (""OS"") with a nominal value of € 56 at a price of € 50 each representing a bond issue of a principal amount total of €3.36 million  for a gross product of €3 million.The issuance of the SO is part of the implementation of a mechanism called ""equitization"" of the OS  by (i) the constitution of a management trust (the ""Trust"") for the benefit of the holders of OS who have decided to transfer their OS to the Trust and (ii) the issuance of warrants for shares called ""equitization"" (the ""BSA E "" "") for the benefit of the Fiducie  whose terms and conditions of exercise will make it possible  from an economic point of view  to transform the SOs thus transferred into shares.Incorporation of a Trust: on September 15  2022  the Company incorporated the Trust  which is managed by equities Gestion as trustee (the ""Trustee"") under a trust agreement entered into on the same day between the Trustee and the Company (the ""Trust Agreement"").Membership in the Trust: all PO holders joined the Trust between September 15  2022 and September 29  2022 and contributed to the Trust all of the 60 000 OS issued by the Company. Holders of SO who have joined the Trust will be reimbursed in cash through the net proceeds of the sale on the market  by the Trust  of the shares issued in connection with the equitization.Redemption by the Company of the SOs held by the Trust: in order to facilitate the os equitization mechanism  all the OSes transferred to the Trust were repurchased today by the Company at par plus interest accrued from September 15  2022 to September 30  2022 inclusive. The repurchase price of the OS is the subject of a seller credit granted by the Trust to the Company (the ""Seller Credit"").Issuance of BSA E : in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement  the Company has today issued to the Trustee  as part of a reserved issue decided on the basis of the 7th resolution of the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of December 27  2021  500 000 000 BSA E whose main characteristics are presented in the Appendix and whose full features are available on the Company's website.BSA E will not be admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market or on any other financial market.Exercise of BSA E by the Trustee: BSA E are exercisable for a period of three years from their issuance  i.e. until September 30  2025. The Trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust  is responsible for exercising the E-BSAs by offsetting claims with the Seller's Credit  and then selling as and when on the market  under strict terms defined in the Trust Agreement  the new shares resulting from the exercise of the BSA E (the ""New Shares"").The exercise of the BSA E will not give rise to any fundraising for the Company to the extent that the BSA E will be exercised only by offsetting against certain  liquid and due claims that the holder of BSA E will hold against the Company under the Seller Credit. The duration that will be necessary to proceed with the full repayment of the Seller Credit by the equitization mechanism will essentially depend on the liquidity of the Delta Drone share on the market.The terms and conditions for the exercise of the E-BSAs and the sale of the underlying shares are available on the Company's website.At the end of the Exercise Period  all BSA E that has not been exercised will be automatically null and void. In addition  the BSA E will automatically lapse once the claim that the holder of BSA E will hold on the Company in respect of the Seller Credit has been fully repaid.Distribution of the proceeds of disposal of the New Shares: as soon as all the New Shares issued as part of the equitization relating to the transferred OS have been transferred by the Trust  the Trustee will proceed to the distribution in cash  among the holders of OS who brought them to the Trust  of the net proceeds of disposal on the Market of the New Shares.New SharesThe New Shares will be ordinary shares bearing current enjoyment which will confer on their holder  upon delivery  all the rights attached to the existing ordinary shares detailed in the Articles of Association of the Company.The New Shares will be the subject of applications for admission to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares of the Company and negotiable on the same line as the existing shares (ISIN code: FR0014009LP0).DilutionAs an indication  the impact of the issuance of the E-bonds on consolidated equity per share on the basis of (i) equity as at June 30  2022  i.e. €20 939 542  and (ii) the number of shares comprising the Company's capital at the date of this press release  i.e. 6 617 563 shares  would be as follows:Share of equity (in euros) Undiluted base Diluted base (1) Before issuing the New Shares 3.1642 0.6901 After issue of 25 055 928 New Shares resulting from the exercise of BSA E (2) 0 7672 0 4616(1) Theoretical calculation based on the conversion of all orNAN not converted to date and Free Shares Awarded  not yet created.(2) Theoretical calculation of the number of New Shares carried out on the basis of the closing price of the Company's share on September 30  2022  i.e. 1.490 euros  an estimate of the exercise price of the BSA E equal to 90% of this value and an amount of OS of 3 360 thousand eurosAs an indication  the impact of the issuance of the BSA E on the participation in the capital of a shareholder holding 1% of the company's share capital prior to the transaction and not participating in it  on the basis of the number of shares comprising the company's capital at the date of this press release  i.e. 6 617 563 shares  would be as follows:Shareholder participation (%) Undiluted base Diluted base (1) Before issuing the New Shares 1.00% 0.18% After issue of 25 055 928 New Shares resulting from the exercise of BSA E (2) 0.21% 0.11%(1) Theoretical calculation based on the conversion of all orNAN not converted to date and Free Shares Awarded  not yet created.(2) Theoretical calculation of the number of New Shares carried out on the basis of the closing price of the Company's share on September 30  2022  i.e 1.490 euros  an estimate of the exercise price of the BSA E equal to 90% of this value and an amount of OS of 3 360 thousand eurosAbout Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

Connecting artists and fans through engaging experiences is an essential part of our growth strategy  and adding livestreaming capabilities to our portfolio is a key component to deliver on this ambition. Driift has already built an unparalleled reputation for bringing groundbreaking livestreams to music fans all over the world  and we consider that the addition of Dreamstage's tech and sales platform will take the business to the next level. We have full confidence in the Driift team to deliver fantastic results.""Investing in both businesses in 2021 and 2022  Deezer remained a minority shareholder in Driift  and became a majority shareholder in Dreamstage  before the transaction. As a result of the business combination and its additional investment  Deezer will become the largest shareholder of Driift.Founded in August 2020 by Ric Salmon and Brian Message of ATC Management  Driift has delivered a succession of premium quality livestreamed events for some of the world's biggest artists and performers  collaborating with multiple creative and distribution partners  and winning major awards including a BAFTA for ""Glastonbury Festival: Live at Worthy Farms"" produced in cooperation with BBC Studios.In May 2022  Dreamstage provided the platform for Driift's hugely successful global livestream for Little Mix from London's O2 Arena  facilitating sales of over 85 000 tickets worldwide  showcasing strong synergies between both businesses.Ric Salmon  CEO Driift said  ""This is an exciting new chapter for Driift.

The aggregate gross proceeds are therefore expected to be approximately €102.9 million  equivalent to approximately $99.9 million based on the exchange rate of €1.00 = $0.9706  the exchange rate reported by the European Central Bank on September 29  2022  before deducting underwriting commissions and estimated expenses payable by the Company.All securities to be sold in the Global Offering will be offered by the Company. The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “VALN” and the ordinary shares are listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris“) under the symbol “VLA.”Goldman Sachs  Jefferies  Guggenheim Securities and Bryan  Garnier & Co. are acting as joint bookrunners for the Global Offering (together  the “Underwriters”).Pricing of the Global Offering and DiscountThe offering price was set at €4.90 per ordinary share  corresponding to a price of $9.51 per ADS.The offering price of the ordinary shares represents a discount of 3.92% from the closing price on September 29  2022 and of 8.39% from the reference price determined by the Company pursuant to the 24th resolution of the Company’s annual combined general meeting held on June 23  2022. The reference price determined by the Company is the volume weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris over the last three consecutive trading days preceding the determination of the offering price (i.e. September 27  2022 to September 29  2022)  as chosen by the Company’s Management Board.Type of Global Offering – Capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights reserved to a category of purchasersThe ordinary shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights and for the benefit of a specified category of persons within the meaning of Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) authorized by the decisions of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and Management Board held on September 29  2022 and pursuant to the 24th resolution of the Company’s annual combined general meeting held on June 23  2022. Under the authority granted by the shareholders in the 24th resolution  the ordinary shares could only be purchased initially by (i) natural persons and legal entities  including companies  trusts or investment funds  organized under French or foreign law  that routinely invest in the pharmaceutical  biotechnological or medical technology sectors; and/or (ii) companies  institutions or entities of any type  French or foreign  that do a significant part of their business in the pharmaceutical  cosmetic  chemical or medical devices and/or technologies or research in these sectors. In order to purchase ordinary shares in the Global Offering  potential investors were required to execute and provide to the Underwriters an investor letter representing that they satisfy the foregoing investor criteria.Deep Track Capital  a new shareholder of the Company  has agreed to purchase an aggregate of approximately 50.06% of the total number of ordinary shares (including those sold in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. The remaining ordinary shares sold in the Global Offering were primarily purchased by the Company’s existing U.S. and European investors. Bpifrance Participations S.A.  an existing shareholder of the Company  has agreed to purchase approximately 4.86% of the total number of ordinary shares (including those sold in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. On this basis  after completion of the Global Offering  Bpifrance Participations S.A. and Deep Track Capital will hold approximately 6.97% and 7.60%  respectively  of the share capital of the Company.The European Private Placement was open only to qualified investors as such term is defined in article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14  2017.Estimated Proceeds from the Global OfferingThe gross proceeds of the sale of 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $99.9 million (€102.9 million). The Company estimates that the net proceeds of the Global Offering will be approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  after deducting approximately $6.0 million (€6.2 million) in underwriting commissions and approximately $0.7 million (€0.8 million) in offering expenses.UnderwritingThe Global Offering is subject to an underwriting agreement covering the entirety of the Global Offering. The underwriting agreement was entered into on September 29  2022 in connection with the determination of the Global Offering Price.The underwriting agreement does not constitute a “garantie de bonne fin” within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).Reasons for the Offering – Use of ProceedsThe Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering as follows: approximately 50% to finance the co-development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against Lyme disease (VLA15); approximately 40% to finance the development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (VLA1553); approximately 5% to finance the development of two of its preclinical vaccine candidates  VLA1554 and VLA2112; and the remaining 5% for working capital and for general corporate purposes.As of June 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €336.2 million. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents  together with the net proceeds of the Global Offering of approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the end of 2024.DilutionThe 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) issued in the Global Offering will represent a dilution of approximately 17.9% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.82%.Terms and Conditions of the Securities to be Issued – Closing and DeliveryThe closing and delivery of the Global Offering will occur  on or about October 4  2022.The ordinary shares offered in the Global Offering  including those underlying ADSs  will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Paris (Compartment B) on the same trading line as the existing shares under the same ISIN code FR0004056851 and under the ticker “VLA” and are expected to be admitted to trading on October 4  2022.DocumentationThe Company has filed a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the ADSs and ordinary shares in the Global Offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 12  2022 which was declared effective on August 19  2022.

For that reason  we have decided to step away from the opportunity to monetize our Europa seed portfolio this year and we will reevaluate once a calmer environment has returned.”Francois Trausch  CEO of Allianz Real Estate  said: “We value our ongoing relationship with our long-term partner VGP and we continue to find the logistics asset class in Europe attractive. VGP’s pipeline portfolio remains a promising opportunity for Allianz Real Estate being built at prime locations  with quality tenants and to high ESG standards.”The closing transaction for the VGP Park München joint venture is anticipated to be conducted before end of year. A decision on the timing of the Europa seed portfolio closing is expected to be taken next year. In the meantime  bank financing facilities are available and the Group is evaluating all financing options.CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing) Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Driift is acquiring Dreamstage and will be further strengthened by an additional £4M investment from Deezer. The acquisition brings together Driift's award winning production capabilities with Dreamstage's best-in-class technology and commerce platform. The combined business will continue under the Driift name as an independent entity  run by CEO Ric Salmon and COO Claire Mas. With a total investment from Deezer of around $7M[1] this year  Driift has secured enough funds to execute on its business plan and accelerate growth.The Smile Livestream. Image Credit: Wunmi Onibudo (PRNewsfoto/Deezer Deezer UK Limited)Jeronimo Folgueira  CEO of Deezer said  ""As the home of music  this is a milestone moment for Deezer. Connecting artists and fans through engaging experiences is an essential part of our growth strategy  and adding livestreaming capabilities to our portfolio is a key component to deliver on this ambition. Driift has already built an unparalleled reputation for bringing groundbreaking livestreams to music fans all over the world  and we consider that the addition of Dreamstage's tech and sales platform will take the business to the next level. We have full confidence in the Driift team to deliver fantastic results.""Investing in both businesses in 2021 and 2022  Deezer remained a minority shareholder in Driift  and became a majority shareholder in Dreamstage  before the transaction. As a result of the business combination and its additional investment  Deezer will become the largest shareholder of Driift.Founded in August 2020 by Ric Salmon and Brian Message of ATC Management  Driift has delivered a succession of premium quality livestreamed events for some of the world's biggest artists and performers  collaborating with multiple creative and distribution partners  and winning major awards including a BAFTA for ""Glastonbury Festival: Live at Worthy Farms"" produced in cooperation with BBC Studios.In May 2022  Dreamstage provided the platform for Driift's hugely successful global livestream for Little Mix from London's O2 Arena  facilitating sales of over 85 000 tickets worldwide  showcasing strong synergies between both businesses.Ric Salmon  CEO Driift said  ""This is an exciting new chapter for Driift. Over the past two years we have become genuine pioneers in the livestreaming space. We've collaborated with certain of the world's most talented artists  filmmakers and creators to deliver online events that have been part of the latest redefinition of the livestreaming format. Our team has shown a proven ability to innovate  selling hundreds of thousands of tickets and generating millions of dollars in revenues already"".""Through Deezer's investment  we are confident that our upward trajectory will accelerate. We are delighted to welcome Dreamstage's hugely talented team of developers  engineers and customer service personnel into the company. We can now offer a fully integrated livestreaming solution to our partners  with production  promotion and what we see as a market-leading technology and revenue generating platform under one roof. It is a major cultural shift  and we look forward to bringing an even greater range of live experiences to truly global audiences.""The transaction reinforces Deezer's commitment to the fast-growing music livestreaming market  which shows continued growth in audience numbers and a clear willingness to pay for quality content and add-ons such as merchandising and virtual meet-and-greets. The fact that virtual concerts ticket sales are expected to generate worldwide up to $2 billion in 2022  and up to around $5 billion annually by 2028 (Source: MIDiA – Jan-2022) strengthens Deezer's positioning.Driift and Deezer would like to thank Dreamstage's founders Thomas Hesse  Scott Chasin and Jan Vogler for their work in building Dreamstage over the past years  and for contributing to the success of this transaction. Deezer would also like to thank Driift co-founders  and current co-owners ATC Management and Beggars Group  for their commitment and contribution in the merger.

DDHT is also the group's pool of human resources to train solution operators  both for the logistics sector (Countbot solution) and for the security sector (ISS Spotter solutions). For the 1st half of 2022  the DDHT division achieved a turnover of €6.2 million and a slightly positive current operating income (€18.4 K).and its operational subsidiaries (DDHT): from its historical business in private security  DDHT contributes strongly to the dronification of the security sector by deploying a combined offer with security agents and technological means that are similar to ""cyber-agents"". DDHT is also the group's pool of human resources to train solution operators  both for the logistics sector (Countbot solution) and for the security sector (ISS Spotter solutions). For the 1st half of 2022  the DDHT division achieved a turnover of €6.2 million and a slightly positive current operating income (€18.4 K). Delta Drone International and its operational subsidiaries (DDI): following the sale at the beginning of the year of the Israeli subsidiary Parazero  DDI is now exclusively present in Africa and Australia  mainly in the southern hemisphere. It is developing a drone services activity for the mining and agriculture sectors. Operating historically in Africa (South Africa  Ghana  Namibia  Zambia  Ivory Coast) where its Rocketmine brand is the market leader  DDI has been developing since 2021 in Australia. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDI division achieved a turnover of €1.9 million and a negative current operating income (-€836 K)  mostly impacted by the weight of significant ""governance costs""  of the order of €300 K annually  which was terminated during the period.UDT – United Drone Technologies : UDT is an investment company  which therefore does not achieve any turnover or bear any operating costs. UDT holds stakes  still in the minority  in 5 young companies in the drone sector  3 French companies (Donecle  Elistair  Diodon)  1 Swiss company (Aero41) and 1 Israeli company (Sightec). In 2021  the transition of the group's accounts to IFRS standards led to the recognition of €4.2 million as ""other financial income and expenses""  reflecting the appreciation of the value of the portfolio in relation to the initial investment. For the first half of 2022  the continued development of certain holdings led to the recognition of revenue of €1 million.: UDT is an investment company  which therefore does not achieve any turnover or bear any operating costs. UDT holds stakes  still in the minority  in 5 young companies in the drone sector  3 French companies (Donecle  Elistair  Diodon)  1 Swiss company (Aero41) and 1 Israeli company (Sightec). In 2021  the transition of the group's accounts to IFRS standards led to the recognition of €4.2 million as ""other financial income and expenses""  reflecting the appreciation of the value of the portfolio in relation to the initial investment. For the first half of 2022  the continued development of certain holdings led to the recognition of revenue of €1 million. DDSA (Delta Drone SA and its French support subsidiaries): in addition to its role as the group's parent company  this branch supports the R&D investments necessary for the development of Countbot (logistics) and ISS Spotter (security) professional solutions. It is also responsible for their production and marketing. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDSA division achieved a turnover of €0.5 million and a negative current operating income (-€4.8 million)  which corresponds to the bulk of the group's consolidated loss.The objective of achieving financial equilibrium is primarily due to a new impetus from the DDSA branchThe beginning of 2022 will have been marked by the end of heavy R&D investments and the beginning of the commercialization of the Countbot and ISS Spotter systems. Commercial contacts are now numerous and should lead  from the end of the financial year and especially in 2023  to a very significant growth in turnover within the DDSA branch.However  it appeared necessary  in parallel  to work on the significant reduction of operating expenses. It is in this logic that two waves of workforce reduction were carried out  the first in May (6 employees concerned) and the second in September (9 employees concerned). In the end  these departures  combined with several resignations  will make it possible to start the 2023 financial year with a payroll divided by more than 2  i.e.  an annual amount of around €2 million (against €4.8 million previously). At the same time  the reduction in other external expenses should reduce their amount from €2.5 million to €1.5 million year-on-year.Finally  the placement under backup of the subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering (DDE) on August 31  2022 is intended to leave open all opportunities for the evolution of this entity.Finalization of the financing method through the equitization of simple bondsReminder of the modalities of equitization of the OSDelta Drone (the ""Company"") has issued  in two tranches carried out on July 15  2022 and September 15  2022 in the context of reserved issues for the benefit of certain investors  a total number of 60 000 simple bonds (""OS"") with a nominal value of € 56 at a price of € 50 each representing a bond issue of a principal amount total of €3.36 million  for a gross product of €3 million.The issuance of the SO is part of the implementation of a mechanism called ""equitization"" of the OS  by (i) the constitution of a management trust (the ""Trust"") for the benefit of the holders of OS who have decided to transfer their OS to the Trust and (ii) the issuance of warrants for shares called ""equitization"" (the ""BSA E "" "") for the benefit of the Fiducie  whose terms and conditions of exercise will make it possible  from an economic point of view  to transform the SOs thus transferred into shares.Incorporation of a Trust: on September 15  2022  the Company incorporated the Trust  which is managed by equities Gestion as trustee (the ""Trustee"") under a trust agreement entered into on the same day between the Trustee and the Company (the ""Trust Agreement"").Membership in the Trust: all PO holders joined the Trust between September 15  2022 and September 29  2022 and contributed to the Trust all of the 60 000 OS issued by the Company. Holders of SO who have joined the Trust will be reimbursed in cash through the net proceeds of the sale on the market  by the Trust  of the shares issued in connection with the equitization.Redemption by the Company of the SOs held by the Trust: in order to facilitate the os equitization mechanism  all the OSes transferred to the Trust were repurchased today by the Company at par plus interest accrued from September 15  2022 to September 30  2022 inclusive. The repurchase price of the OS is the subject of a seller credit granted by the Trust to the Company (the ""Seller Credit"").Issuance of BSA E : in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement  the Company has today issued to the Trustee  as part of a reserved issue decided on the basis of the 7th resolution of the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of December 27  2021  500 000 000 BSA E whose main characteristics are presented in the Appendix and whose full features are available on the Company's website.BSA E will not be admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market or on any other financial market.Exercise of BSA E by the Trustee: BSA E are exercisable for a period of three years from their issuance  i.e. until September 30  2025. The Trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust  is responsible for exercising the E-BSAs by offsetting claims with the Seller's Credit  and then selling as and when on the market  under strict terms defined in the Trust Agreement  the new shares resulting from the exercise of the BSA E (the ""New Shares"").The exercise of the BSA E will not give rise to any fundraising for the Company to the extent that the BSA E will be exercised only by offsetting against certain  liquid and due claims that the holder of BSA E will hold against the Company under the Seller Credit. The duration that will be necessary to proceed with the full repayment of the Seller Credit by the equitization mechanism will essentially depend on the liquidity of the Delta Drone share on the market.The terms and conditions for the exercise of the E-BSAs and the sale of the underlying shares are available on the Company's website.At the end of the Exercise Period  all BSA E that has not been exercised will be automatically null and void. In addition  the BSA E will automatically lapse once the claim that the holder of BSA E will hold on the Company in respect of the Seller Credit has been fully repaid.Distribution of the proceeds of disposal of the New Shares: as soon as all the New Shares issued as part of the equitization relating to the transferred OS have been transferred by the Trust  the Trustee will proceed to the distribution in cash  among the holders of OS who brought them to the Trust  of the net proceeds of disposal on the Market of the New Shares.New SharesThe New Shares will be ordinary shares bearing current enjoyment which will confer on their holder  upon delivery  all the rights attached to the existing ordinary shares detailed in the Articles of Association of the Company.The New Shares will be the subject of applications for admission to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares of the Company and negotiable on the same line as the existing shares (ISIN code: FR0014009LP0).DilutionAs an indication  the impact of the issuance of the E-bonds on consolidated equity per share on the basis of (i) equity as at June 30  2022  i.e. €20 939 542  and (ii) the number of shares comprising the Company's capital at the date of this press release  i.e. 6 617 563 shares  would be as follows:Share of equity (in euros) Undiluted base Diluted base (1) Before issuing the New Shares 3.1642 0.6901 After issue of 25 055 928 New Shares resulting from the exercise of BSA E (2) 0 7672 0 4616(1) Theoretical calculation based on the conversion of all orNAN not converted to date and Free Shares Awarded  not yet created.(2) Theoretical calculation of the number of New Shares carried out on the basis of the closing price of the Company's share on September 30  2022  i.e. 1.490 euros  an estimate of the exercise price of the BSA E equal to 90% of this value and an amount of OS of 3 360 thousand eurosAs an indication  the impact of the issuance of the BSA E on the participation in the capital of a shareholder holding 1% of the company's share capital prior to the transaction and not participating in it  on the basis of the number of shares comprising the company's capital at the date of this press release  i.e. 6 617 563 shares  would be as follows:Shareholder participation (%) Undiluted base Diluted base (1) Before issuing the New Shares 1.00% 0.18% After issue of 25 055 928 New Shares resulting from the exercise of BSA E (2) 0.21% 0.11%(1) Theoretical calculation based on the conversion of all orNAN not converted to date and Free Shares Awarded  not yet created.(2) Theoretical calculation of the number of New Shares carried out on the basis of the closing price of the Company's share on September 30  2022  i.e 1.490 euros  an estimate of the exercise price of the BSA E equal to 90% of this value and an amount of OS of 3 360 thousand eurosAbout Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

Such conditions will be discussed with Health Canada during the procedure.An assessment named Advance Consideration  performed by a Health Canada Adjudicating Committee  is necessary before being granted authorization to file under NOC/c policy.This assessment was made based on a pre-submission package sent by AB Science including  efficacy data of study AB10015  long-term survival data (75 months average follow-up from diagnosis) of study AB10015  and safety data.An estimated 3 000 Canadians are currently living with ALS. Each year approximately 1 000 Canadians die from ALS. A similar number of Canadians are diagnosed with ALS each year.Under the NOC/c policy  Health Canada has a target of 200 calendar days maximum to review the application.Filing for conditional Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for masitinib in the treatment of amyo trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)AB Science filed an application for conditional Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Alsitek (masitinib) in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The application is based on results from the phase 2/3 AB10015 study and its long-term survival follow-up. Study AB10015 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial over a 48-week treatment period  conducted with 394 ALS patients and evaluating Alsitek in combination with riluzole versus riluzole alone.This decision to file followed a pre-submission meeting held with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Rapporteur during which new data generated with Alsitek in ALS were presented  in particular  a clinical benefit in terms of a 25-month increase in median overall survival for patients with moderate ALS  which is a cohort that closely resembles newly diagnosed patients. During the pre-submission meeting  AB Science also presented how issues listed in the previous CHMP assessment for Alsitek on ALS (EMA/406203/2018) were resolved  in particular:The mode of action of Alsitek in ALS  which has been well-demonstrated and published in peer-reviewed publications.A remonitoring of all efficacy and safety data and a complete reassessment of the Alsitek safety database.Additional analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint  imputing all missing data for early discontinuation  and a conservative analysis imputing missing data with a penalty for patients who discontinued Alsitek for lack of efficacy or toxicity. These analyses were positive  and all showed a treatment effect in favor of Alsitek and convergent with the primary analysis.Long-term follow-up survival data showing a significant benefit in favor of Alsitek in moderate ALS patients (between group difference in median OS of +25 months  hazard ratio 0.56 (95%CI [0.32;0.96])).This application has now been validated by EMA and review by the CHMP has begun. The CHMP has a target of 210 active evaluation days to review the application.Launch of a confirmatory Phase 3 study with masitinib in progressive forms of multiple sclerosisAB Science announced that it has been authorized by the French Medicine Agency  ANSM  to initiate a Phase III study (AB20009) evaluating masitinib in patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) or non-active Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (nSPMS). The study will enroll 800 patients from numerous study centers with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 to 6.0 and absence of T1 Gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the effect of masitinib on time to confirmed disability progression  with progression defined as 1-point worsening when EDSS baseline score ≤5.5  or 0.5 if baseline score >5.5 from randomization to week 96.This confirmatory study follows successful completion of a first Phase 2B/3 study (AB07002) in primary progressive (PPMS) and non-active secondary progressive (nSPMS) multiple sclerosis. This study met its primary analysis endpoint  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative change on EDSS with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.0256).Positive recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to continue both Phase 2 studies in Covid-19AB Science announced the continuation of the Phase 2 study evaluating masitinib in combination with isoquercetin in COVID-19  following the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). This randomized (1:1)  open-label  phase 2 study (AB20001) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of masitinib plus isoquercetin in hospitalised patients with moderate COVID-19 (WHO 7-point ordinal scale level 4) or severe COVID-19 (level 5). The study is planned to recruit 200 patients (over 18 years of age with no upper age limit). The primary objective is to improve the clinical status of patients after 15 days of treatment  as measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale.The interim analysis was conducted with one third of the patients evaluated  as planned. The purpose of the interim analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment. The DSMB recommends continuing the study without restrictions in moderate patients (level 4  i.e. hospitalized patients with oxygen supply <6 L/min with SpO2 maintained ≥92%). In line with this recommendation  AB Science has made the decision to continue the study only in moderate patients. The study is therefore now planned to include 200 patients at level 4 of the ordinal scale.AB Science also announced the continuation of the second Phase 2 study evaluating the antiviral activity of masitinib in patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19  following the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). This randomized (1:1)  double-blind  phase 2 study (AB21002) in 78 patients  is designed to evaluate the anti-viral efficacy of masitinib in non-hospitalized patients who are at risk of developing severe COVID-19 and in hospitalized patients with need of oxygen (via face mask or nasal cannula).The analysis was to assess the safety of the treatment and was based on the first 50% of the patient targeted recruitment. The DSMB indicated that there was no safety concern and recommended continuation of the study without restrictions.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2022The operating loss as of June 30  2022 was 9 562 K€  compared to a loss of 6 040 K€ as of June 30  2021  i.e. an increase in the operating loss of 3 522 K€ (58.3%).Operating income  exclusively made up of sales related to the operation of a veterinary medicine  amounted to 629 K€ as of June 30  2022 compared to 818 K€ one year earlierOperating expenses amounted to 10 192 K€ as of June 30  2022  compared to 6 858 K€ as of June 30  2021  an increase of 48.6%.Marketing expenses increased by 7.2% from 236 K€ as of June 30  2021 to 253 K€ as of June 30  2022.Administrative expenses increased by 26.9%  from 1 326 K€ as of June 30  2021 to 1 682 K€ as of June 30  2022.Research and development expenses increased by 2 800 K€  i.e 52.8 %  from 5 299 K€ as of June 30  2021 to 8 099 K€ as of June 30  2022. This variation is mainly explained by: the decrease in the research tax credit (600 K€)  due to the end of the doubling of subcontracting expenses to public research laboratories in the calculation of the research tax credit base from 2022  the recognition at 30 June 2021 of income related to the cancellation of old accounts payable (860 K€)  and the recognition on 30 June 2022 of the valuation of warrants (414 K€)The financial income as of June 30  2022 is a gain of 2 424 K€ compared to a loss of 1 386 K€ one year earlier. The gain of 2 424 K€ as of 30 June 2022 is mainly related to the recognition of the change in fair value between 31 December 2021 and 30 June 2022 of the preference shares resulting from the conversion of the bonds in December 2016 (class C) and of the preference shares issued in September 2020 (class D)  i.e. a financial gain of 2 244 K€ with no impact on cash over the period.The net loss as of June 30  2022 amounts to 7 141 K€ compared to a loss of 4 655 K€ as of June 30  2021.The following table summarizes the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2022 prepared in accordance with IFRS  and comparative information with the first half of 2021:In thousands of euros  except for share data 30/06/2022 30/06/2021 Net turnover 629 818 Cost of sales and marketing expenses (158) 3 Marketing expenses (253) (236) Administrative expenses (1 682) (1 326) Research and development expenses (8 099) (5 299) Operating income (9 562) (6 040) Financial income 3 847 1 469 Financier expenses (1 423) (83) Financial income 2 424 1 386 Net income (7 141) (4 655) Other comprehensive income for the period net of tax 174 184 Total comprehensive income for the period (6 967) (4 470) Basic earnings per share - in euros (0.15) (0.10) Diluted earnings per share - in euros (0.15) (0.10)In thousands of euros 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Cash and cash equivalents 7 643 8 721 Total Assets 21 585 21 271 Equity (29 530) (23 198) Non-current liabilities 31 949 26 986 Trade payables 12 733 11 368 Current liabilities 19 166 17 482OTHER CORPORATE INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2022 AND SINCE JUNE 30  2022Financing of USD 8.5 million through the issuance of bonds with attached warrantsAB Science reached an agreement with a historical investor on a financing of USD 8.5 million through the issuance of bonds convertible into new ordinary shares with attached warrants (OCABSA).50 000 OCABSA will be issued  representing a nominal value of USD 8.5 million. It will reinforce the cash position of AB Science for the development of its clinical research program.50 000 convertible bonds will be issued at their par value of USD 170 0 each (the “PV”)  representing a total par value of USD 8.5 million.Decision of the Enforcement Committee of the French market regulator (AMF) following the investigation relating to the financial information and the market for AB Science shares  opened in September 20 17On March 24  2022  the AMF Enforcement Committee ruled that there was no privileged information  neither at the time of the two capital increases carried out by AB Science on March 24 and 27  2017  nor at the time Alain Moussy sold a part of his shares on March 31  2017. The AMF Enforcement Committee therefore completely exonerated Alain Moussy  prosecuted for insider trading  and found that AB Science had not failed to comply with its disclosure obligations at the time of these capital increases in March 2017.The AMF Enforcement Committee nevertheless considered that AB Science should have communicated as early as April 7  2017 the high probability of a negative opinion from the European Medicine Agency (EMA) on the marketing authorization application for masitinib for the treatment of mastocytosis and ordered AB Science to pay the sum of one million euros.In application of its internal procedures  AB Science had nevertheless put in place a deferral of privileged information from this date of April 7  2017  considering that the delay in communication was in the interest of the Company and in line with industry practices of not communicating before the final vote of the CHMP  or else withdrawing the registration dossier  which AB Science had no intention to do.Given this difference in assessment concerning a technical point relating to one of the criteria for the deferred communication of privileged information  as well as the amount of penalty  AB Science has decided to appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal. The President of AMF also appealed against the Enforcement Committee's decision.Other eventsConsiderations arising from the Russia-Ukraine warRussia launched invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  which  alongside humanitarian concerns  may also have an impact on the health research ecosystem in the form of delays in the conduct of clinical trials.

Photograph: Nick BradshawDigital therapeutics company HealthBeacon saw the business gather “significant momentum” in the first half of 2022  reporting an increase in revenues and an expansion of its client base in interim results published on Friday.The Dublin-based company saw its revenue climb 57 per cent to €867 000 in the six months to the end of June from the same period last year.However  gross profits at the company  which listed on the Euronext Growth Dublin last December  tumbled 72 per cent  from €313 000 in the six months to the end of June 2021 to €87 000  while the group’s gross profit margin narrowed from 57 per cent to 10 per cent in the first half.Operating in 17 countries across Europe and North America  the Irish-headquartered company develops products for managing injectable medications for patients in the home. It deployed 10 206 units of its products in the first half of the year  an increase of 144 per cent from 4 182 in the six months to June 2021  and is targeting 100 000 units deployed by the end of 2023.READ MOREHealthBeacon said that its margins decreased “due to an increase in data and connectivity costs. It reported an operating loss of €6.2 million in the first six months of 2022  partially due to rising wage and salary costs  including a non-cash share compensation expense of €1 million as the group increased its headcount from 53 in the first half of 2021 to 73 by the end of June this year.The company also said that  having inked a multimillion euro deal last year with North American home appliances distributor Hamilton Beach  the roll-out of its direct-to-consumer partnership with the company had been “slower than anticipated”. It meant that HealthBeacon “generated revenue on the initial unit sale to Hamilton Beach and did not generate revenue from the sell-through to the end user”.However  the Jim Joyce-helmed company said it still expects to grow tenfold by the end of 2024 and expects 15 000 units to be deployed by the end of 2022. HealthBeacon said it had placed build orders for 35 000 orders to meet anticipated demand from clients and managed to resolve a supply chain delay over the period related to microchip components.“We generated significant momentum  despite some meaningful global supply chain challenges  adding important new clients  new products  key hires and expanding our capabilities  infrastructure and routes to market ” Mr Joyce said in a statement.“The progress we have made to date  particularly in the speciality pharmacy services channel  has set the foundation for us to become market leaders and to provide a tenfold increase in the number of patients using our technology in 2024 ” he said  adding that the company is “excited by the progression” the business has made since its listing last December.In September  the company announced a commercial partnership with the American Pharmacists Association Foundation  a charitable foundation connected with the professional and advocacy body of the same name  to roll out its injection management care system to patients beginning this year.Aimed at helping patients to manage their injectable medicines  the technology will be integrated into the association’s own support system.,neutral,0.35,0.6,0.05,mixed,0.23,0.1,0.67,True,English,"['Significant momentum', 'HealthBeacon', 'revenues', 'meaningful global supply chain challenges', 'North American home appliances distributor', 'HealthBeacon chief executive Jim Joyce', 'cash share compensation expense', 'speciality pharmacy services channel', 'injection management care system', 'American Pharmacists Association Foundation', 'supply chain delay', 'Euronext Growth Dublin', 'multimillion euro deal', 'initial unit sale', 'Jim Joyce-helmed company', 'gross profit margin', 'Digital therapeutics company', 'The Dublin-based company', 'important new clients', 'first six months', 'Mr Joyce', 'support system', 'gross profits', 'charitable foundation', 'first half', 'Nick Bradshaw', 'significant momentum', 'client base', 'interim results', '57 per cent', '10 per cent', 'injectable medications', '144 per cent', 'connectivity costs', 'operating loss', 'rising wage', 'salary costs', 'Hamilton Beach', 'consumer partnership', 'microchip components', 'key hires', 'commercial partnership', 'advocacy body', 'same name', 'injectable medicines', 'new products', 'Irish-headquartered company', 'same period', 'build orders', 'market leaders', 'tenfold increase', 'end user', '35,000 orders', 'progression', 'business', 'listing', 'Photograph', 'revenues', 'expansion', 'Friday', 'June', 'group', '17 countries', 'Europe', 'patients', '10,206 units', 'year', '100,000 units', 'READ', 'margins', 'data', 'headcount', 'roll', 'sell', '15,000 units', 'demand', 'capabilities', 'infrastructure', 'routes', 'statement', 'number', 'technology', 'September', 'professional']",2022-09-30,2022-09-30,irishtimes.com
