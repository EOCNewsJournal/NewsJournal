10800,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valneva-announces-pricing-102-9-051100400.html,Valneva Announces Pricing of €102.9 Million Global Offering of American Depositary Shares and Ordinary Shares,Saint Herblain (France)  September 30  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) (the “Company”)  a specialty vaccine company  announced today...,VALNEVASaint Herblain (France)  September 30  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) (the “Company”)  a specialty vaccine company  announced today the pricing of 21 000 000 ordinary shares in a global offering to specified categories of investors comprised of a public offering of 375 000 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”)  each representing two ordinary shares  in the United States (the “U.S. Offering”) and a concurrent private placement of 20 250 000 ordinary shares in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States (the “European Private Placement” and together with the U.S. Offering  the “Global Offering”).As a result of excess demand  the Company upsized the issuance from a previously announced anticipated amount of $40 million. The aggregate gross proceeds are therefore expected to be approximately €102.9 million  equivalent to approximately $99.9 million based on the exchange rate of €1.00 = $0.9706  the exchange rate reported by the European Central Bank on September 29  2022  before deducting underwriting commissions and estimated expenses payable by the Company.All securities to be sold in the Global Offering will be offered by the Company. The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “VALN” and the ordinary shares are listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris“) under the symbol “VLA.”Goldman Sachs  Jefferies  Guggenheim Securities and Bryan  Garnier & Co. are acting as joint bookrunners for the Global Offering (together  the “Underwriters”).Pricing of the Global Offering and DiscountThe offering price was set at €4.90 per ordinary share  corresponding to a price of $9.51 per ADS.The offering price of the ordinary shares represents a discount of 3.92% from the closing price on September 29  2022 and of 8.39% from the reference price determined by the Company pursuant to the 24th resolution of the Company’s annual combined general meeting held on June 23  2022. The reference price determined by the Company is the volume weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris over the last three consecutive trading days preceding the determination of the offering price (i.e. September 27  2022 to September 29  2022)  as chosen by the Company’s Management Board.Story continuesType of Global Offering – Capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights reserved to a category of purchasersThe ordinary shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights and for the benefit of a specified category of persons within the meaning of Article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) authorized by the decisions of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and Management Board held on September 29  2022 and pursuant to the 24th resolution of the Company’s annual combined general meeting held on June 23  2022. Under the authority granted by the shareholders in the 24th resolution  the ordinary shares could only be purchased initially by (i) natural persons and legal entities  including companies  trusts or investment funds  organized under French or foreign law  that routinely invest in the pharmaceutical  biotechnological or medical technology sectors; and/or (ii) companies  institutions or entities of any type  French or foreign  that do a significant part of their business in the pharmaceutical  cosmetic  chemical or medical devices and/or technologies or research in these sectors. In order to purchase ordinary shares in the Global Offering  potential investors were required to execute and provide to the Underwriters an investor letter representing that they satisfy the foregoing investor criteria.Deep Track Capital  a new shareholder of the Company  has agreed to purchase an aggregate of approximately 50.06% of the total number of ordinary shares (including those sold in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. The remaining ordinary shares sold in the Global Offering were primarily purchased by the Company’s existing U.S. and European investors. Bpifrance Participations S.A.  an existing shareholder of the Company  has agreed to purchase approximately 4.86% of the total number of ordinary shares (including those sold in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. On this basis  after completion of the Global Offering  Bpifrance Participations S.A. and Deep Track Capital will hold approximately 6.97% and 7.60%  respectively  of the share capital of the Company.The European Private Placement was open only to qualified investors as such term is defined in article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14  2017.Estimated Proceeds from the Global OfferingThe gross proceeds of the sale of 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $99.9 million (€102.9 million). The Company estimates that the net proceeds of the Global Offering will be approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  after deducting approximately $6.0 million (€6.2 million) in underwriting commissions and approximately $0.7 million (€0.8 million) in offering expenses.UnderwritingThe Global Offering is subject to an underwriting agreement covering the entirety of the Global Offering. The underwriting agreement was entered into on September 29  2022 in connection with the determination of the Global Offering Price.The underwriting agreement does not constitute a “garantie de bonne fin” within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).Reasons for the Offering – Use of ProceedsThe Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering as follows: approximately 50% to finance the co-development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against Lyme disease (VLA15); approximately 40% to finance the development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (VLA1553); approximately 5% to finance the development of two of its preclinical vaccine candidates  VLA1554 and VLA2112; and the remaining 5% for working capital and for general corporate purposes.As of June 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €336.2 million. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents  together with the net proceeds of the Global Offering of approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the end of 2024.DilutionThe 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) issued in the Global Offering will represent a dilution of approximately 17.9% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.82%.Terms and Conditions of the Securities to be Issued – Closing and DeliveryThe closing and delivery of the Global Offering will occur  on or about October 4  2022.The ordinary shares offered in the Global Offering  including those underlying ADSs  will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Paris (Compartment B) on the same trading line as the existing shares under the same ISIN code FR0004056851 and under the ticker “VLA” and are expected to be admitted to trading on October 4  2022.DocumentationThe Company has filed a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the ADSs and ordinary shares in the Global Offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 12  2022 which was declared effective on August 19  2022.

The Group is evaluating the conversion of its 6 703 m2 of offices to apartments: Given the pre-sale performance of the hotel conversion into condominium apartments  the Group has begun an analysis of the conversion of its office complex (located in the same building).

The Group will keep shareholders apprised.From the six months ended June 30  2022 until the date of publication of this 2022 Half-year Report  the Group has engaged in the following material events:Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units: The Group has now sold the majority of the units with possible completion of this transaction in the first half of 2023. Guatemala Tax Cases: In November 2019  the Third Economic court issued a resolution against the arguments of Thunderbird de Guatemala in a case related to 2009 tax period for an approximate amount of $100 thousand. An Administrative Cassation Appeal was filed in July 2021 before the Third Economic Court alleging that the judge omitted some of the arguments and facts presented by Thunderbird de Guatemala. On July 20  2022  Thunderbird de Guatemala was served with the Supreme Court Resolution 01002-2021-00644  in which was decided to maintain the prior decisions against the Company interests. At this instance  no further challenges are available. The Company is registering a provision of approximately US$109 000 according to the amount stated in the March 19  2021 ruling for this case.RISK MANAGEMENT: For more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 5 of the Group's 2022 Half-year Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN"": This statement is made taking into account the global health crisis and economic fallout caused by the pandemic Covid-19. There is instability in our markets and globally that could impact on Group activities in ways that are currently unpredictable. To account for the unpredictable conditions  in forecasting future cash flows in our assessment of Going Concern  Management has made certain extraordinary assumptions. Specifically  we have:Forecasted a materially negative impact on revenue for the years 2023 and 2024. Forecasted expenses to remain approximately at the levels they are as on date of publication of our 2022 Annual Report  meaning we are assuming (for Going Concern assessment only) that the Group has no more flexibility to drive down expenses further. Assumed that the Group will be able to continue to defer junior debt and to negotiate terms for repayment as liquidity becomes available. Assumed no development nor material construction  but do assume some repurposing of existing real estate to accommodate for changes in demand. Forecasted no extraordinary one-time events that may impact positively or negatively on the Group's cash flows  though such events are possible particularly given the environment. Assumed a stable regulatory environment in all countries with existing operations  and have forecasted receiving no governmental support apart from what has already been received.Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future  which Management and the Directors have defined as being at least the next 12 months from the filing of this 2022 Half-year Report. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (vii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Half-year Report  the Group forecasts operating with low levels of reserves and working capital. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period  which ability to liquidate assets is contingent on market factors that are not within the control of the Group.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION (Expressed in thousands of United States dollars) for the half-year ended June 30  2022  were approved by the Board of Directors on September 29  2022  and are contained in the Half-year Report for 2022 posted at www.thunderbirdresorts.com.

Click here for a full investment analysis.,ollo/E+ via Getty ImagesIntroductionAzelis (OTCPK:AZLGF) is a service provider to the specialty chemicals and the food ingredients industry. That doesn't sound very exciting but one of Azelis' core areas of expertise is working on innovative formulations for its clients. The two images below from Azelis' corporate presentation show examples of what the company deals with on a daily basis.Azelis Investor RelationsAzelis is also working its magic in the specialty chemicals industry and I found this specific case quite interesting.Azelis Investor RelationsWhile these are obviously just some examples  it gives you an idea of what Azelis does for its customers.Yahoo FinanceAzelis has its primary listing on Euronext Brussels where it is trading with AZE as its ticker symbol and considering the average daily volume exceeds 60 000 shares per day  I would strongly recommend to trade in Azelis' shares using the facilities of Euronext Brussels. As there are just under 234 million shares outstanding  the current market capitalization of the company is approximately 5.15B EUR.Azelis reported surprisingly strong results in the first semesterI wouldn't say Azelis is completely immune to economic shocks as a disappointing result for its customer base may reduce the R&D budgets which would  directly and indirectly  hurt Azelis as well. But for the time being  the company's financial performance remains exceptionally strong.In the first half of 2022  the company reported 54% revenue increase  and even if one would isolate the impact from M&A activities  the organic revenue growth was almost 28% and that is pretty impressive.Azelis Investor RelationsAs you can see above  the company reported a total revenue of almost 2.03B EUR resulting in a gross profit of just under 490M EUR. This means the 54% reported revenue increase resulted in a 65% gross profit increase.The operating profit actually more than doubled to 212M EUR and this  in combination with a decreasing financial expense (lower cost debt and a lower gross debt level)  the pre-tax income jumped from 75M EUR to 191M EUR. An increase of in excess of 150%.The net income came in at 141.7M EUR of which about 138.8M EUR was attributable to the common shareholders of Azelis with almost 2.9M EUR attributable to the non-controlling interests. The EPS in the first half of the year was 0.59 EUR. On an annualized basis this would yield a result of 1.2 EUR per share (and likely higher given Azelis' continuous acquisition spree) and based on the current share price of in excess of 20 EUR per share  the stock does not look very appealing.There is  however  more than meets the eye here as Azelis runs a very capex-light business model and the depreciation and amortization expenses are a multiple of the effective capex and lease expenses.As you can see on the cash flow statement below  the company reported an operating cash flow of 96M EUR but unsurprisingly  there are a few adjustments we need to make here. First of all  we need to deduct an additional 10M EUR in taxes as the total income tax was approximately 49M EUR as per the income statement but Azelis only paid 38.8M EUR in cash taxes.Secondly  the operating cash flow also includes a 101M EUR investment in the working capital position. So on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was 187M EUR. And after deducting the 10M EUR in lease payments  the adjusted operating cash flow was 177M EUR.Azelis Investor RelationsAnd as the total capex was just 8.5M EUR  the free cash flow result was approximately 168M EUR and I estimate about 165M EUR of this was attributable to the common shareholders of Azelis. This represents a free cash flow per share of 0.70 EUR and that makes the stock already more attractive.Azelis continues to pursue an M&A strategy whereby it identifies and acquires smaller bolt-on acquisitions. In the first half of the year  Azelis closed the acquisition of five companies while it expects to complete five more acquisitions in the current semester. The total commitment to acquire these five companies in the first half of the year was 172M EUR but these companies should add about 190M in annualized revenue. If Azelis can replicate its own EBITDA margins of approximately 12% on these acquisitions  the total EBITDA generated by the acquired companies would be around 24M EUR indicating an EBITDA multiple of 8 as acquisition cost which is pretty reasonable.Azelis' capital allocation priorities are pretty clear. The company pays a very symbolic dividend and prefers to use its incoming free cash flow to pursue new acquisitions to continue to grow the business.I'm fine with a 'buy and build' strategy on the condition the balance sheet can handle it. As of the end of June  Azelis had approximately 386M EUR in cash while the gross debt increased to 1.29B EUR for a net debt position of approximately 900M EUR (excluding lease obligations). That is still fine considering I am expecting an EBITDA north of 500M EUR for the year. Azelis is guiding for a full-year EBITA (excluding depreciation expenses) of 410-425M EUR but the company may be a bit more conservative. In any case  even using a 450M EUR full-year EBITDA would still result in a debt ratio of just around two times EBITDA. Not bad at all.Investment thesisAzelis doesn't have a lot of competitors and it's difficult to figure out a fair value for the shares. But considering the free cash flow yield will come in at around 6.5% and the current EV/EBITDA ratio is just around 13 (which is more than okay for a relatively defensive company)  I will be keeping an eye on Azelis.The stock isn't in bargain territory yet and right now there are plenty of other opportunities available. I'm not a buyer of Azelis at the current share price but will monitor its progress and cash flow evolution.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.45,0.16,0.38,True,English,"['Defensive Idea', 'Fast-Changing World', 'Azelis', 'OTCMKTS', 'AZLGF', 'incoming free cash flow', 'lower gross debt level', ""Azelis' capital allocation priorities"", 'free cash flow result', 'working capital position', 'food ingredients industry', 'R&D budgets', 'M&A activities', 'lower cost debt', 'operating cash flow', 'current market capitalization', 'cash flow statement', 'average daily volume', 'decreasing financial expense', 'net debt position', 'organic revenue growth', 'specialty chemicals industry', 'continuous acquisition spree', 'capex-light business model', '101M EUR investment', 'M&A strategy', 'Azelis Investor Relations', 'additional 10M EUR', 'total income tax', 'current share price', '65% gross profit increase', 'operating profit', 'net income', 'income statement', 'current semester', 'financial performance', 'acquisition cost', 'total revenue', 'cash taxes', 'disappointing result', 'pre-tax income', '54% revenue increase', 'total capex', 'total commitment', 'annualized revenue', 'daily basis', 'Getty Images', 'service provider', 'core areas', 'innovative formulations', 'two images', 'corporate presentation', 'specific case', 'Yahoo Finance', 'primary listing', 'Euronext Brussels', 'ticker symbol', 'strong results', 'first semester', 'economic shocks', 'customer base', 'first half', '141.7M EUR', 'common shareholders', 'non-controlling interests', 'The EPS', 'amortization expenses', 'effective capex', 'lease expenses', 'lease payments', 'smaller bolt', 'symbolic dividend', 'balance sheet', 'lease obligations', 'full-year EBITA', 'total EBITDA', 'annualized basis', 'EBITDA margins', 'depreciation expenses', '234 million shares', 'new acquisitions', 'five companies', '1.2 EUR', '20 EUR', '60,000 shares', 'ollo/E+', 'Introduction', 'OTCPK', 'AZLGF', 'expertise', 'clients', 'examples', 'company', 'magic', 'idea', 'customers', 'day', 'facilities', '15B', 'time', 'impact', '3B', '490M', '212M', 'combination', '75M', '191M', 'excess', '2.9M', 'stock', 'eye', '96M', 'adjustments', '49M', '187M', '177M', '8.5M', '168M', '165M', '172M', '190M', '24M', 'buy', 'build', 'condition', 'June', '386M', '1.29B', '900M', '500M']",2022-09-30,2022-10-01,seekingalpha.com

EBITDA: Peru property EBITDA increased by $64 thousand and adjusted EBITDA by $99 thousand over the same period in 2021. The increases were driven by a $439 thousand increase in revenue over the same period  while expenses were controlled given the inflationary environment.B. Profit / (Loss): Based on Continuing Operations  the Group experienced a Profit of $241 thousand  a decline of $160 thousand as compared to Half-year 2021. While cash expenses below the EBITDA line improved  the decline in income was driven by higher non-cash expenses.C. Net Debt: There was essentially nil progress in net debt in the period. We do expect to announce material progress with net debt by the end of the fiscal year 2022.1. IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON 2021 AND BEYONDCovid-19 continues to impact on our markets. Having said that  Management has stabilized its operations and its cash management. To be prudent  however  we maintain unchanged our Management Statement on Going Concern as last updated in our 2021 Annual Report.2. SHAREHOLDER MANDATE AND OUR ASSETSWe continue to pursue decisions that support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions. Please read the following carefully.A. Peru Real Estate Assets: As of the publication of this 2022 Half-year Report  the Group completed the process to convert a 66-suite hotel into a condominium apartment building of 66 units for sale. In the same mixed-use building  the Group also continues to own approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 158 underground parking spaces. Please note the following:The Group completed the conversion of the 66-suite hotel into condominiums. Sales are advancing. We project to have completed sale of all condominiums in the first half of 2023.The Group is evaluating the conversion of its 6 703 m2 of offices to apartments. Given the pre-sale performance of the hotel conversion into condominium apartments  the Group has begun an analysis of the conversion of its office complex (located in the same building).

There is instability in our markets and globally that could impact on Group activities in ways that are currently unpredictable. To account for the unpredictable conditions  in forecasting future cash flows in our assessment of Going Concern  Management has made certain extraordinary assumptions. Specifically  we have:Forecasted a materially negative impact on revenue for the years 2023 and 2024. Forecasted expenses to remain approximately at the levels they are as on date of publication of our 2022 Annual Report  meaning we are assuming (for Going Concern assessment only) that the Group has no more flexibility to drive down expenses further. Assumed that the Group will be able to continue to defer junior debt and to negotiate terms for repayment as liquidity becomes available. Assumed no development nor material construction  but do assume some repurposing of existing real estate to accommodate for changes in demand. Forecasted no extraordinary one-time events that may impact positively or negatively on the Group's cash flows  though such events are possible particularly given the environment. Assumed a stable regulatory environment in all countries with existing operations  and have forecasted receiving no governmental support apart from what has already been received.Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future  which Management and the Directors have defined as being at least the next 12 months from the filing of this 2022 Half-year Report. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (vii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Half-year Report  the Group forecasts operating with low levels of reserves and working capital. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period  which ability to liquidate assets is contingent on market factors that are not within the control of the Group.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

VGP’s pipeline portfolio remains a promising opportunity for Allianz Real Estate being built at prime locations  with quality tenants and to high ESG standards.”The closing transaction for the VGP Park München joint venture is anticipated to be conducted before end of year. A decision on the timing of the Europa seed portfolio closing is expected to be taken next year.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

DDHT is also the group's pool of human resources to train solution operators  both for the logistics sector (Countbot solution) and for the security sector (ISS Spotter solutions). For the 1st half of 2022  the DDHT division achieved a turnover of €6.2 million and a slightly positive current operating income (€18.4 K).Delta Drone International and its operational subsidiaries (DDI): following the sale at the beginning of the year of the Israeli subsidiary Parazero  DDI is now exclusively present in Africa and Australia  mainly in the southern hemisphere. It is developing a drone services activity for the mining and agriculture sectors. Operating historically in Africa (South Africa  Ghana  Namibia  Zambia  Ivory Coast) where its Rocketmine brand is the market leader  DDI has been developing since 2021 in Australia. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDI division achieved a turnover of €1.9 million and a negative current operating income (-€836 K)  mostly impacted by the weight of significant ""governance costs""  of the order of €300 K annually  which was terminated during the period.Story continuesUDT – United Drone Technologies : UDT is an investment company  which therefore does not achieve any turnover or bear any operating costs. UDT holds stakes  still in the minority  in 5 young companies in the drone sector  3 French companies (Donecle  Elistair  Diodon)  1 Swiss company (Aero41) and 1 Israeli company (Sightec). In 2021  the transition of the group's accounts to IFRS standards led to the recognition of €4.2 million as ""other financial income and expenses""  reflecting the appreciation of the value of the portfolio in relation to the initial investment. For the first half of 2022  the continued development of certain holdings led to the recognition of revenue of €1 million.DDSA (Delta Drone SA and its French support subsidiaries): in addition to its role as the group's parent company  this branch supports the R&D investments necessary for the development of Countbot (logistics) and ISS Spotter (security) professional solutions. It is also responsible for their production and marketing. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDSA division achieved a turnover of €0.5 million and a negative current operating income (-€4.8 million)  which corresponds to the bulk of the group's consolidated loss.The objective of achieving financial equilibrium is primarily due to a new impetus from the DDSA branchThe beginning of 2022 will have been marked by the end of heavy R&D investments and the beginning of the commercialization of the Countbot and ISS Spotter systems. Commercial contacts are now numerous and should lead  from the end of the financial year and especially in 2023  to a very significant growth in turnover within the DDSA branch.However  it appeared necessary  in parallel  to work on the significant reduction of operating expenses. It is in this logic that two waves of workforce reduction were carried out  the first in May (6 employees concerned) and the second in September (9 employees concerned). In the end  these departures  combined with several resignations  will make it possible to start the 2023 financial year with a payroll divided by more than 2  i.e.  an annual amount of around €2 million (against €4.8 million previously). At the same time  the reduction in other external expenses should reduce their amount from €2.5 million to €1.5 million year-on-year.Finally  the placement under backup of the subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering (DDE) on August 31  2022 is intended to leave open all opportunities for the evolution of this entity.Finalization of the financing method through the equitization of simple bondsReminder of the modalities of equitization of the OSDelta Drone (the ""Company"") has issued  in two tranches carried out on July 15  2022 and September 15  2022 in the context of reserved issues for the benefit of certain investors  a total number of 60 000 simple bonds (""OS"") with a nominal value of € 56 at a price of € 50 each representing a bond issue of a principal amount total of €3.36 million  for a gross product of €3 million.The issuance of the SO is part of the implementation of a mechanism called ""equitization"" of the OS  by (i) the constitution of a management trust (the ""Trust"") for the benefit of the holders of OS who have decided to transfer their OS to the Trust and (ii) the issuance of warrants for shares called ""equitization"" (the ""BSA E "" "") for the benefit of the Fiducie  whose terms and conditions of exercise will make it possible  from an economic point of view  to transform the SOs thus transferred into shares.Incorporation of a Trust: on September 15  2022  the Company incorporated the Trust  which is managed by equities Gestion as trustee (the ""Trustee"") under a trust agreement entered into on the same day between the Trustee and the Company (the ""Trust Agreement"").Membership in the Trust: all PO holders joined the Trust between September 15  2022 and September 29  2022 and contributed to the Trust all of the 60 000 OS issued by the Company. Holders of SO who have joined the Trust will be reimbursed in cash through the net proceeds of the sale on the market  by the Trust  of the shares issued in connection with the equitization.Redemption by the Company of the SOs held by the Trust: in order to facilitate the os equitization mechanism  all the OSes transferred to the Trust were repurchased today by the Company at par plus interest accrued from September 15  2022 to September 30  2022 inclusive. The repurchase price of the OS is the subject of a seller credit granted by the Trust to the Company (the ""Seller Credit"").Issuance of BSA E : in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement  the Company has today issued to the Trustee  as part of a reserved issue decided on the basis of the 7th resolution of the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of December 27  2021  500 000 000 BSA E whose main characteristics are presented in the Appendix and whose full features are available on the Company's website.BSA E will not be admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market or on any other financial market.Exercise of BSA E by the Trustee: BSA E are exercisable for a period of three years from their issuance  i.e. until September 30  2025. The Trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust  is responsible for exercising the E-BSAs by offsetting claims with the Seller's Credit  and then selling as and when on the market  under strict terms defined in the Trust Agreement  the new shares resulting from the exercise of the BSA E (the ""New Shares"").The exercise of the BSA E will not give rise to any fundraising for the Company to the extent that the BSA E will be exercised only by offsetting against certain  liquid and due claims that the holder of BSA E will hold against the Company under the Seller Credit. The duration that will be necessary to proceed with the full repayment of the Seller Credit by the equitization mechanism will essentially depend on the liquidity of the Delta Drone share on the market.The terms and conditions for the exercise of the E-BSAs and the sale of the underlying shares are available on the Company's website.At the end of the Exercise Period  all BSA E that has not been exercised will be automatically null and void. In addition  the BSA E will automatically lapse once the claim that the holder of BSA E will hold on the Company in respect of the Seller Credit has been fully repaid.Distribution of the proceeds of disposal of the New Shares: as soon as all the New Shares issued as part of the equitization relating to the transferred OS have been transferred by the Trust  the Trustee will proceed to the distribution in cash  among the holders of OS who brought them to the Trust  of the net proceeds of disposal on the Market of the New Shares.New SharesThe New Shares will be ordinary shares bearing current enjoyment which will confer on their holder  upon delivery  all the rights attached to the existing ordinary shares detailed in the Articles of Association of the Company.The New Shares will be the subject of applications for admission to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares of the Company and negotiable on the same line as the existing shares (ISIN code: FR0014009LP0).DilutionAs an indication  the impact of the issuance of the E-bonds on consolidated equity per share on the basis of (i) equity as at June 30  2022  i.e. €20 939 542  and (ii) the number of shares comprising the Company's capital at the date of this press release  i.e. 6 617 563 shares  would be as follows:Share of equity (in euros) Undiluted base Diluted base (1) Before issuing the New Shares 3.1642 0.6901 After issue of 25 055 928 New Shares resulting from the exercise of BSA E (2) 0 7672 0 4616(1) Theoretical calculation based on the conversion of all orNAN not converted to date and Free Shares Awarded  not yet created.(2) Theoretical calculation of the number of New Shares carried out on the basis of the closing price of the Company's share on September 30  2022  i.e. 1.490 euros  an estimate of the exercise price of the BSA E equal to 90% of this value and an amount of OS of 3 360 thousand eurosAs an indication  the impact of the issuance of the BSA E on the participation in the capital of a shareholder holding 1% of the company's share capital prior to the transaction and not participating in it  on the basis of the number of shares comprising the company's capital at the date of this press release  i.e. 6 617 563 shares  would be as follows:Shareholder participation (%) Undiluted base Diluted base (1) Before issuing the New Shares 1.00% 0.18% After issue of 25 055 928 New Shares resulting from the exercise of BSA E (2) 0.21% 0.11%(1) Theoretical calculation based on the conversion of all orNAN not converted to date and Free Shares Awarded  not yet created.(2) Theoretical calculation of the number of New Shares carried out on the basis of the closing price of the Company's share on September 30  2022  i.e 1.490 euros  an estimate of the exercise price of the BSA E equal to 90% of this value and an amount of OS of 3 360 thousand eurosAbout Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

In order to purchase ordinary shares in the Global Offering  potential investors were required to execute and provide to the Underwriters an investor letter representing that they satisfy the foregoing investor criteria.Deep Track Capital  a new shareholder of the Company  has agreed to purchase an aggregate of approximately 50.06% of the total number of ordinary shares (including those sold in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. The remaining ordinary shares sold in the Global Offering were primarily purchased by the Company’s existing U.S. and European investors. Bpifrance Participations S.A.  an existing shareholder of the Company  has agreed to purchase approximately 4.86% of the total number of ordinary shares (including those sold in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. On this basis  after completion of the Global Offering  Bpifrance Participations S.A. and Deep Track Capital will hold approximately 6.97% and 7.60%  respectively  of the share capital of the Company.The European Private Placement was open only to qualified investors as such term is defined in article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 14  2017.Estimated Proceeds from the Global OfferingThe gross proceeds of the sale of 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) in the Global Offering are expected to be approximately $99.9 million (€102.9 million). The Company estimates that the net proceeds of the Global Offering will be approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  after deducting approximately $6.0 million (€6.2 million) in underwriting commissions and approximately $0.7 million (€0.8 million) in offering expenses.UnderwritingThe Global Offering is subject to an underwriting agreement covering the entirety of the Global Offering. The underwriting agreement was entered into on September 29  2022 in connection with the determination of the Global Offering Price.The underwriting agreement does not constitute a “garantie de bonne fin” within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).Reasons for the Offering – Use of ProceedsThe Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering as follows: approximately 50% to finance the co-development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against Lyme disease (VLA15); approximately 40% to finance the development and marketing of its vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (VLA1553); approximately 5% to finance the development of two of its preclinical vaccine candidates  VLA1554 and VLA2112; and the remaining 5% for working capital and for general corporate purposes.As of June 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €336.2 million. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents  together with the net proceeds of the Global Offering of approximately $93.1 million (€96.0 million)  will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the end of 2024.DilutionThe 21 000 000 ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) issued in the Global Offering will represent a dilution of approximately 17.9% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva’s capital before the Global Offering will now hold a stake of 0.82%.Terms and Conditions of the Securities to be Issued – Closing and DeliveryThe closing and delivery of the Global Offering will occur  on or about October 4  2022.The ordinary shares offered in the Global Offering  including those underlying ADSs  will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Paris (Compartment B) on the same trading line as the existing shares under the same ISIN code FR0004056851 and under the ticker “VLA” and are expected to be admitted to trading on October 4  2022.DocumentationThe Company has filed a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the ADSs and ordinary shares in the Global Offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 12  2022 which was declared effective on August 19  2022.

For that reason  we have decided to step away from the opportunity to monetize our Europa seed portfolio this year and we will reevaluate once a calmer environment has returned.”Francois Trausch  CEO of Allianz Real Estate  said: “We value our ongoing relationship with our long-term partner VGP and we continue to find the logistics asset class in Europe attractive. VGP’s pipeline portfolio remains a promising opportunity for Allianz Real Estate being built at prime locations  with quality tenants and to high ESG standards.”The closing transaction for the VGP Park München joint venture is anticipated to be conducted before end of year. A decision on the timing of the Europa seed portfolio closing is expected to be taken next year. In the meantime  bank financing facilities are available and the Group is evaluating all financing options.CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing) Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Connecting artists and fans through engaging experiences is an essential part of our growth strategy  and adding livestreaming capabilities to our portfolio is a key component to deliver on this ambition. Driift has already built an unparalleled reputation for bringing groundbreaking livestreams to music fans all over the world  and we consider that the addition of Dreamstage's tech and sales platform will take the business to the next level. We have full confidence in the Driift team to deliver fantastic results.""Investing in both businesses in 2021 and 2022  Deezer remained a minority shareholder in Driift  and became a majority shareholder in Dreamstage  before the transaction. As a result of the business combination and its additional investment  Deezer will become the largest shareholder of Driift.Founded in August 2020 by Ric Salmon and Brian Message of ATC Management  Driift has delivered a succession of premium quality livestreamed events for some of the world's biggest artists and performers  collaborating with multiple creative and distribution partners  and winning major awards including a BAFTA for ""Glastonbury Festival: Live at Worthy Farms"" produced in cooperation with BBC Studios.In May 2022  Dreamstage provided the platform for Driift's hugely successful global livestream for Little Mix from London's O2 Arena  facilitating sales of over 85 000 tickets worldwide  showcasing strong synergies between both businesses.Ric Salmon  CEO Driift said  ""This is an exciting new chapter for Driift. Over the past two years we have become genuine pioneers in the livestreaming space. We've collaborated with certain of the world's most talented artists  filmmakers and creators to deliver online events that have been part of the latest redefinition of the livestreaming format. Our team has shown a proven ability to innovate  selling hundreds of thousands of tickets and generating millions of dollars in revenues already"".""Through Deezer's investment  we are confident that our upward trajectory will accelerate. We are delighted to welcome Dreamstage's hugely talented team of developers  engineers and customer service personnel into the company. We can now offer a fully integrated livestreaming solution to our partners  with production  promotion and what we see as a market-leading technology and revenue generating platform under one roof. It is a major cultural shift  and we look forward to bringing an even greater range of live experiences to truly global audiences.""The transaction reinforces Deezer's commitment to the fast-growing music livestreaming market  which shows continued growth in audience numbers and a clear willingness to pay for quality content and add-ons such as merchandising and virtual meet-and-greets. The fact that virtual concerts ticket sales are expected to generate worldwide up to $2 billion in 2022  and up to around $5 billion annually by 2028 (Source: MIDiA – Jan-2022) strengthens Deezer's positioning.Driift and Deezer would like to thank Dreamstage's founders Thomas Hesse  Scott Chasin and Jan Vogler for their work in building Dreamstage over the past years  and for contributing to the success of this transaction.

DDHT is also the group's pool of human resources to train solution operators  both for the logistics sector (Countbot solution) and for the security sector (ISS Spotter solutions). For the 1st half of 2022  the DDHT division achieved a turnover of €6.2 million and a slightly positive current operating income (€18.4 K).and its operational subsidiaries (DDHT): from its historical business in private security  DDHT contributes strongly to the dronification of the security sector by deploying a combined offer with security agents and technological means that are similar to ""cyber-agents"". DDHT is also the group's pool of human resources to train solution operators  both for the logistics sector (Countbot solution) and for the security sector (ISS Spotter solutions). For the 1st half of 2022  the DDHT division achieved a turnover of €6.2 million and a slightly positive current operating income (€18.4 K). Delta Drone International and its operational subsidiaries (DDI): following the sale at the beginning of the year of the Israeli subsidiary Parazero  DDI is now exclusively present in Africa and Australia  mainly in the southern hemisphere. It is developing a drone services activity for the mining and agriculture sectors. Operating historically in Africa (South Africa  Ghana  Namibia  Zambia  Ivory Coast) where its Rocketmine brand is the market leader  DDI has been developing since 2021 in Australia. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDI division achieved a turnover of €1.9 million and a negative current operating income (-€836 K)  mostly impacted by the weight of significant ""governance costs""  of the order of €300 K annually  which was terminated during the period.UDT – United Drone Technologies : UDT is an investment company  which therefore does not achieve any turnover or bear any operating costs. UDT holds stakes  still in the minority  in 5 young companies in the drone sector  3 French companies (Donecle  Elistair  Diodon)  1 Swiss company (Aero41) and 1 Israeli company (Sightec). In 2021  the transition of the group's accounts to IFRS standards led to the recognition of €4.2 million as ""other financial income and expenses""  reflecting the appreciation of the value of the portfolio in relation to the initial investment. For the first half of 2022  the continued development of certain holdings led to the recognition of revenue of €1 million.: UDT is an investment company  which therefore does not achieve any turnover or bear any operating costs. UDT holds stakes  still in the minority  in 5 young companies in the drone sector  3 French companies (Donecle  Elistair  Diodon)  1 Swiss company (Aero41) and 1 Israeli company (Sightec). In 2021  the transition of the group's accounts to IFRS standards led to the recognition of €4.2 million as ""other financial income and expenses""  reflecting the appreciation of the value of the portfolio in relation to the initial investment. For the first half of 2022  the continued development of certain holdings led to the recognition of revenue of €1 million. DDSA (Delta Drone SA and its French support subsidiaries): in addition to its role as the group's parent company  this branch supports the R&D investments necessary for the development of Countbot (logistics) and ISS Spotter (security) professional solutions. It is also responsible for their production and marketing. For the 1st half of 2022  the DDSA division achieved a turnover of €0.5 million and a negative current operating income (-€4.8 million)  which corresponds to the bulk of the group's consolidated loss.The objective of achieving financial equilibrium is primarily due to a new impetus from the DDSA branchThe beginning of 2022 will have been marked by the end of heavy R&D investments and the beginning of the commercialization of the Countbot and ISS Spotter systems. Commercial contacts are now numerous and should lead  from the end of the financial year and especially in 2023  to a very significant growth in turnover within the DDSA branch.However  it appeared necessary  in parallel  to work on the significant reduction of operating expenses. It is in this logic that two waves of workforce reduction were carried out  the first in May (6 employees concerned) and the second in September (9 employees concerned). In the end  these departures  combined with several resignations  will make it possible to start the 2023 financial year with a payroll divided by more than 2  i.e.  an annual amount of around €2 million (against €4.8 million previously). At the same time  the reduction in other external expenses should reduce their amount from €2.5 million to €1.5 million year-on-year.Finally  the placement under backup of the subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering (DDE) on August 31  2022 is intended to leave open all opportunities for the evolution of this entity.Finalization of the financing method through the equitization of simple bondsReminder of the modalities of equitization of the OSDelta Drone (the ""Company"") has issued  in two tranches carried out on July 15  2022 and September 15  2022 in the context of reserved issues for the benefit of certain investors  a total number of 60 000 simple bonds (""OS"") with a nominal value of € 56 at a price of € 50 each representing a bond issue of a principal amount total of €3.36 million  for a gross product of €3 million.The issuance of the SO is part of the implementation of a mechanism called ""equitization"" of the OS  by (i) the constitution of a management trust (the ""Trust"") for the benefit of the holders of OS who have decided to transfer their OS to the Trust and (ii) the issuance of warrants for shares called ""equitization"" (the ""BSA E "" "") for the benefit of the Fiducie  whose terms and conditions of exercise will make it possible  from an economic point of view  to transform the SOs thus transferred into shares.Incorporation of a Trust: on September 15  2022  the Company incorporated the Trust  which is managed by equities Gestion as trustee (the ""Trustee"") under a trust agreement entered into on the same day between the Trustee and the Company (the ""Trust Agreement"").Membership in the Trust: all PO holders joined the Trust between September 15  2022 and September 29  2022 and contributed to the Trust all of the 60 000 OS issued by the Company. Holders of SO who have joined the Trust will be reimbursed in cash through the net proceeds of the sale on the market  by the Trust  of the shares issued in connection with the equitization.Redemption by the Company of the SOs held by the Trust: in order to facilitate the os equitization mechanism  all the OSes transferred to the Trust were repurchased today by the Company at par plus interest accrued from September 15  2022 to September 30  2022 inclusive. The repurchase price of the OS is the subject of a seller credit granted by the Trust to the Company (the ""Seller Credit"").Issuance of BSA E : in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement  the Company has today issued to the Trustee  as part of a reserved issue decided on the basis of the 7th resolution of the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of December 27  2021  500 000 000 BSA E whose main characteristics are presented in the Appendix and whose full features are available on the Company's website.BSA E will not be admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market or on any other financial market.Exercise of BSA E by the Trustee: BSA E are exercisable for a period of three years from their issuance  i.e. until September 30  2025. The Trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust  is responsible for exercising the E-BSAs by offsetting claims with the Seller's Credit  and then selling as and when on the market  under strict terms defined in the Trust Agreement  the new shares resulting from the exercise of the BSA E (the ""New Shares"").The exercise of the BSA E will not give rise to any fundraising for the Company to the extent that the BSA E will be exercised only by offsetting against certain  liquid and due claims that the holder of BSA E will hold against the Company under the Seller Credit. The duration that will be necessary to proceed with the full repayment of the Seller Credit by the equitization mechanism will essentially depend on the liquidity of the Delta Drone share on the market.The terms and conditions for the exercise of the E-BSAs and the sale of the underlying shares are available on the Company's website.At the end of the Exercise Period  all BSA E that has not been exercised will be automatically null and void.

Such conditions will be discussed with Health Canada during the procedure.An assessment named Advance Consideration  performed by a Health Canada Adjudicating Committee  is necessary before being granted authorization to file under NOC/c policy.This assessment was made based on a pre-submission package sent by AB Science including  efficacy data of study AB10015  long-term survival data (75 months average follow-up from diagnosis) of study AB10015  and safety data.An estimated 3 000 Canadians are currently living with ALS. Each year approximately 1 000 Canadians die from ALS. A similar number of Canadians are diagnosed with ALS each year.Under the NOC/c policy  Health Canada has a target of 200 calendar days maximum to review the application.Filing for conditional Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for masitinib in the treatment of amyo trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)AB Science filed an application for conditional Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Alsitek (masitinib) in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The application is based on results from the phase 2/3 AB10015 study and its long-term survival follow-up. Study AB10015 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial over a 48-week treatment period  conducted with 394 ALS patients and evaluating Alsitek in combination with riluzole versus riluzole alone.This decision to file followed a pre-submission meeting held with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Rapporteur during which new data generated with Alsitek in ALS were presented  in particular  a clinical benefit in terms of a 25-month increase in median overall survival for patients with moderate ALS  which is a cohort that closely resembles newly diagnosed patients. During the pre-submission meeting  AB Science also presented how issues listed in the previous CHMP assessment for Alsitek on ALS (EMA/406203/2018) were resolved  in particular:The mode of action of Alsitek in ALS  which has been well-demonstrated and published in peer-reviewed publications.A remonitoring of all efficacy and safety data and a complete reassessment of the Alsitek safety database.Additional analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint  imputing all missing data for early discontinuation  and a conservative analysis imputing missing data with a penalty for patients who discontinued Alsitek for lack of efficacy or toxicity. These analyses were positive  and all showed a treatment effect in favor of Alsitek and convergent with the primary analysis.Long-term follow-up survival data showing a significant benefit in favor of Alsitek in moderate ALS patients (between group difference in median OS of +25 months  hazard ratio 0.56 (95%CI [0.32;0.96])).This application has now been validated by EMA and review by the CHMP has begun. The CHMP has a target of 210 active evaluation days to review the application.Launch of a confirmatory Phase 3 study with masitinib in progressive forms of multiple sclerosisAB Science announced that it has been authorized by the French Medicine Agency  ANSM  to initiate a Phase III study (AB20009) evaluating masitinib in patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) or non-active Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (nSPMS). The study will enroll 800 patients from numerous study centers with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 to 6.0 and absence of T1 Gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the effect of masitinib on time to confirmed disability progression  with progression defined as 1-point worsening when EDSS baseline score ≤5.5  or 0.5 if baseline score >5.5 from randomization to week 96.This confirmatory study follows successful completion of a first Phase 2B/3 study (AB07002) in primary progressive (PPMS) and non-active secondary progressive (nSPMS) multiple sclerosis. This study met its primary analysis endpoint  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative change on EDSS with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.0256).Positive recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to continue both Phase 2 studies in Covid-19AB Science announced the continuation of the Phase 2 study evaluating masitinib in combination with isoquercetin in COVID-19  following the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). This randomized (1:1)  open-label  phase 2 study (AB20001) is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of masitinib plus isoquercetin in hospitalised patients with moderate COVID-19 (WHO 7-point ordinal scale level 4) or severe COVID-19 (level 5). The study is planned to recruit 200 patients (over 18 years of age with no upper age limit). The primary objective is to improve the clinical status of patients after 15 days of treatment  as measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale.The interim analysis was conducted with one third of the patients evaluated  as planned. The purpose of the interim analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment. The DSMB recommends continuing the study without restrictions in moderate patients (level 4  i.e. hospitalized patients with oxygen supply <6 L/min with SpO2 maintained ≥92%). In line with this recommendation  AB Science has made the decision to continue the study only in moderate patients. The study is therefore now planned to include 200 patients at level 4 of the ordinal scale.AB Science also announced the continuation of the second Phase 2 study evaluating the antiviral activity of masitinib in patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19  following the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). This randomized (1:1)  double-blind  phase 2 study (AB21002) in 78 patients  is designed to evaluate the anti-viral efficacy of masitinib in non-hospitalized patients who are at risk of developing severe COVID-19 and in hospitalized patients with need of oxygen (via face mask or nasal cannula).The analysis was to assess the safety of the treatment and was based on the first 50% of the patient targeted recruitment. The DSMB indicated that there was no safety concern and recommended continuation of the study without restrictions.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2022The operating loss as of June 30  2022 was 9 562 K€  compared to a loss of 6 040 K€ as of June 30  2021  i.e. an increase in the operating loss of 3 522 K€ (58.3%).Operating income  exclusively made up of sales related to the operation of a veterinary medicine  amounted to 629 K€ as of June 30  2022 compared to 818 K€ one year earlierOperating expenses amounted to 10 192 K€ as of June 30  2022  compared to 6 858 K€ as of June 30  2021  an increase of 48.6%.Marketing expenses increased by 7.2% from 236 K€ as of June 30  2021 to 253 K€ as of June 30  2022.Administrative expenses increased by 26.9%  from 1 326 K€ as of June 30  2021 to 1 682 K€ as of June 30  2022.Research and development expenses increased by 2 800 K€  i.e 52.8 %  from 5 299 K€ as of June 30  2021 to 8 099 K€ as of June 30  2022. This variation is mainly explained by: the decrease in the research tax credit (600 K€)  due to the end of the doubling of subcontracting expenses to public research laboratories in the calculation of the research tax credit base from 2022  the recognition at 30 June 2021 of income related to the cancellation of old accounts payable (860 K€)  and the recognition on 30 June 2022 of the valuation of warrants (414 K€)The financial income as of June 30  2022 is a gain of 2 424 K€ compared to a loss of 1 386 K€ one year earlier. The gain of 2 424 K€ as of 30 June 2022 is mainly related to the recognition of the change in fair value between 31 December 2021 and 30 June 2022 of the preference shares resulting from the conversion of the bonds in December 2016 (class C) and of the preference shares issued in September 2020 (class D)  i.e. a financial gain of 2 244 K€ with no impact on cash over the period.The net loss as of June 30  2022 amounts to 7 141 K€ compared to a loss of 4 655 K€ as of June 30  2021.The following table summarizes the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2022 prepared in accordance with IFRS  and comparative information with the first half of 2021:In thousands of euros  except for share data 30/06/2022 30/06/2021 Net turnover 629 818 Cost of sales and marketing expenses (158) 3 Marketing expenses (253) (236) Administrative expenses (1 682) (1 326) Research and development expenses (8 099) (5 299) Operating income (9 562) (6 040) Financial income 3 847 1 469 Financier expenses (1 423) (83) Financial income 2 424 1 386 Net income (7 141) (4 655) Other comprehensive income for the period net of tax 174 184 Total comprehensive income for the period (6 967) (4 470) Basic earnings per share - in euros (0.15) (0.10) Diluted earnings per share - in euros (0.15) (0.10)In thousands of euros 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Cash and cash equivalents 7 643 8 721 Total Assets 21 585 21 271 Equity (29 530) (23 198) Non-current liabilities 31 949 26 986 Trade payables 12 733 11 368 Current liabilities 19 166 17 482OTHER CORPORATE INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2022 AND SINCE JUNE 30  2022Financing of USD 8.5 million through the issuance of bonds with attached warrantsAB Science reached an agreement with a historical investor on a financing of USD 8.5 million through the issuance of bonds convertible into new ordinary shares with attached warrants (OCABSA).50 000 OCABSA will be issued  representing a nominal value of USD 8.5 million. It will reinforce the cash position of AB Science for the development of its clinical research program.50 000 convertible bonds will be issued at their par value of USD 170 0 each (the “PV”)  representing a total par value of USD 8.5 million.Decision of the Enforcement Committee of the French market regulator (AMF) following the investigation relating to the financial information and the market for AB Science shares  opened in September 20 17On March 24  2022  the AMF Enforcement Committee ruled that there was no privileged information  neither at the time of the two capital increases carried out by AB Science on March 24 and 27  2017  nor at the time Alain Moussy sold a part of his shares on March 31  2017. The AMF Enforcement Committee therefore completely exonerated Alain Moussy  prosecuted for insider trading  and found that AB Science had not failed to comply with its disclosure obligations at the time of these capital increases in March 2017.The AMF Enforcement Committee nevertheless considered that AB Science should have communicated as early as April 7  2017 the high probability of a negative opinion from the European Medicine Agency (EMA) on the marketing authorization application for masitinib for the treatment of mastocytosis and ordered AB Science to pay the sum of one million euros.In application of its internal procedures  AB Science had nevertheless put in place a deferral of privileged information from this date of April 7  2017  considering that the delay in communication was in the interest of the Company and in line with industry practices of not communicating before the final vote of the CHMP  or else withdrawing the registration dossier  which AB Science had no intention to do.Given this difference in assessment concerning a technical point relating to one of the criteria for the deferred communication of privileged information  as well as the amount of penalty  AB Science has decided to appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal. The President of AMF also appealed against the Enforcement Committee's decision.Other eventsConsiderations arising from the Russia-Ukraine warRussia launched invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  which  alongside humanitarian concerns  may also have an impact on the health research ecosystem in the form of delays in the conduct of clinical trials. At the date of publication of the December 31  2021 annual report  there were no significant delays or impacts on the studies monitored in Russia and Ukraine.Other securities transactionsDuring the first half of 2022  56 990 share subscription warrants and 5 000 stock-options were granted.Other informationAB Science confirms its eligibility for PEA-PME (a share savings plan aimed at providing finance to SMEs) in accordance with decree no. 2014-283 of 4 March 2014 taken for the application of article 70 of law no. 2013-1278 of 29 December 2013 of finance for 2014 fixing the eligibility of companies for PEA-PME  i.e. less than 5 000 employees on the one hand  an annual turnover of less than 1 500 million euros or a total balance sheet of less than 2 000 million euros  on the other hand.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

Photograph: Nick BradshawDigital therapeutics company HealthBeacon saw the business gather “significant momentum” in the first half of 2022  reporting an increase in revenues and an expansion of its client base in interim results published on Friday.The Dublin-based company saw its revenue climb 57 per cent to €867 000 in the six months to the end of June from the same period last year.However  gross profits at the company  which listed on the Euronext Growth Dublin last December  tumbled 72 per cent  from €313 000 in the six months to the end of June 2021 to €87 000  while the group’s gross profit margin narrowed from 57 per cent to 10 per cent in the first half.Operating in 17 countries across Europe and North America  the Irish-headquartered company develops products for managing injectable medications for patients in the home. It deployed 10 206 units of its products in the first half of the year  an increase of 144 per cent from 4 182 in the six months to June 2021  and is targeting 100 000 units deployed by the end of 2023.READ MOREHealthBeacon said that its margins decreased “due to an increase in data and connectivity costs. It reported an operating loss of €6.2 million in the first six months of 2022  partially due to rising wage and salary costs  including a non-cash share compensation expense of €1 million as the group increased its headcount from 53 in the first half of 2021 to 73 by the end of June this year.The company also said that  having inked a multimillion euro deal last year with North American home appliances distributor Hamilton Beach  the roll-out of its direct-to-consumer partnership with the company had been “slower than anticipated”. It meant that HealthBeacon “generated revenue on the initial unit sale to Hamilton Beach and did not generate revenue from the sell-through to the end user”.However  the Jim Joyce-helmed company said it still expects to grow tenfold by the end of 2024 and expects 15 000 units to be deployed by the end of 2022. HealthBeacon said it had placed build orders for 35 000 orders to meet anticipated demand from clients and managed to resolve a supply chain delay over the period related to microchip components.“We generated significant momentum  despite some meaningful global supply chain challenges  adding important new clients  new products  key hires and expanding our capabilities  infrastructure and routes to market ” Mr Joyce said in a statement.“The progress we have made to date  particularly in the speciality pharmacy services channel  has set the foundation for us to become market leaders and to provide a tenfold increase in the number of patients using our technology in 2024 ” he said  adding that the company is “excited by the progression” the business has made since its listing last December.In September  the company announced a commercial partnership with the American Pharmacists Association Foundation  a charitable foundation connected with the professional and advocacy body of the same name  to roll out its injection management care system to patients beginning this year.Aimed at helping patients to manage their injectable medicines  the technology will be integrated into the association’s own support system.,neutral,0.35,0.6,0.05,mixed,0.23,0.1,0.67,True,English,"['Significant momentum', 'HealthBeacon', 'revenues', 'meaningful global supply chain challenges', 'North American home appliances distributor', 'HealthBeacon chief executive Jim Joyce', 'cash share compensation expense', 'speciality pharmacy services channel', 'injection management care system', 'American Pharmacists Association Foundation', 'supply chain delay', 'Euronext Growth Dublin', 'multimillion euro deal', 'initial unit sale', 'Jim Joyce-helmed company', 'gross profit margin', 'Digital therapeutics company', 'The Dublin-based company', 'important new clients', 'first six months', 'Mr Joyce', 'support system', 'gross profits', 'charitable foundation', 'first half', 'Nick Bradshaw', 'significant momentum', 'client base', 'interim results', '57 per cent', '10 per cent', 'injectable medications', '144 per cent', 'connectivity costs', 'operating loss', 'rising wage', 'salary costs', 'Hamilton Beach', 'consumer partnership', 'microchip components', 'key hires', 'commercial partnership', 'advocacy body', 'same name', 'injectable medicines', 'new products', 'Irish-headquartered company', 'same period', 'build orders', 'market leaders', 'tenfold increase', 'end user', '35,000 orders', 'progression', 'business', 'listing', 'Photograph', 'revenues', 'expansion', 'Friday', 'June', 'group', '17 countries', 'Europe', 'patients', '10,206 units', 'year', '100,000 units', 'READ', 'margins', 'data', 'headcount', 'roll', 'sell', '15,000 units', 'demand', 'capabilities', 'infrastructure', 'routes', 'statement', 'number', 'technology', 'September', 'professional']",2022-09-30,2022-10-01,irishtimes.com
