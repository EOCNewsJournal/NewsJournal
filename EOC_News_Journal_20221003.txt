PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator – and is also a Phase 2 ready ADPKD asset  subject to additional financing.Thomas Kuhn  CEO of Poxel  commented: “As we have decided to focus PXL770 development efforts exclusively in rare diseases on the basis of our promising data  this Orphan Drug Designation for PXL770 in ADPKD further strengthens the value of this Phase 2 ready program. ADPKD is an inherited form of chronic kidney disease where the unmet need is high  with only one approved drug which is associated with significant safety-tolerability challenges. The pathophysiology of ADPKD involves altered kidney metabolism and there is a strong rationale for AMPK activation as a therapeutic approach. This summer  we completed the preclinical assessment of PXL770 in ADPKD demonstrating compelling benefits of strong suppression of cyst formation in vitro and in vivo and presented these results at recent scientific meetings. We have initiated development program planning and further regulatory interactions.”Poxel recently announced that PXL770 development will focus exclusively on rare diseases  starting with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and ADPKD  driven by promising data which showed strong potential in multiple rare metabolic indications.Preclinical results for PXL770 in ADPKD were presented in oral sessions at two recent scientific meetings:59 th European Renal Association Congress; Paris May 19-22  2022 (Pascale Gluais  Director Pharmacology  Poxel)European Renal Association Congress; Paris May 19-22  2022 (Pascale Gluais  Director Pharmacology  Poxel) 5th European Workshop on AMPK and AMPK-related kinases; Glasgow September 27-29 (Sophie Bozec  Senior VP  R&D Pharmacology and Scientific Communication  Poxel)Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)ODD is granted by the FDA to novel therapeutics for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation1 gives a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.About ADPKDAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth leading cause of renal failure and the most common inherited cause of kidney disease. In ADPKD  fluid-filled cysts develop and enlarge in both kidneys  eventually leading to kidney failure. Other complications and clinical manifestations include: abdominal pain  urinary symptoms  liver cysts and cardiovascular disorders. More than 50 percent of people with ADPKD will develop kidney failure by age 50. Once a person has kidney failure  dialysis or a transplant are the only options.About PXL770PXL770 is a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. AMPK is a central regulator of multiple metabolic pathways leading to the control of lipid metabolism  glucose homeostasis and inflammation. Based on its central metabolic role  targeting AMPK offers the opportunity to pursue a wide range of indications to treat chronic metabolic diseases.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). In rare diseases  development of PXL770  a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  is focused on the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

We will now work to update all relevant label information and materials with the aim to increase access to Jyseleca so that European patients who may benefit from the treatment are able to receive it.”The Type II variation application was submitted to the EMA in June 2022  supported by interim data on the primary  secondary and exploratory endpoints at Week 13 and 26 for subjects who met a prespecified sperm decrease at these timepoints (up to Week 52) from the ongoing MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies  investigating the potential effect of filgotinib use on semen parameters and sex hormones in adult patients with IBD and various RC.Following assessment of the interim data by the CHMP  it was concluded in the opinion that the data did not reveal a difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients who had a 50% or more decrease from baseline in semen parameters at week 13 (pooled primary endpoint: filgotinib 6.7%  placebo 8.3%) and at week 26. Further  CHMP concluded that the data did not show any relevant changes in sex hormone levels or change from baseline in semen parameters across treatment groups. Overall  CHMP concluded that these clinical data were not suggestive of filgotinib-related effects on testicular function.Story continuesFollowing the positive CHMP opinion  the language in the section of the Special Warnings and Precautions about the potential effect of filgotinib on sperm production and male fertility will be removed from the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)  and the MANTA/MANTA-RAy studies will be removed from the Risk Management Plan (RMP).The design of the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies was published in Advances in Therapy in June 20222  and Galapagos is planning to publish the results in a peer-reviewed medical journal next year.About filgotinibFilgotinib is marketed as Jyseleca (200mg and 100mg tablets) in the European Union (incl. Norway)  Great Britain  and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Filgotinib is also marketed as Jyseleca (200mg tablets) in the European Union (incl. Norway)  Great Britain  and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response with  lost response to  or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. A global Phase 3 program with filgotinib is ongoing in Crohn’s Disease. More information about clinical trials can be accessed at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.The European Summary of Product Characteristics for filgotinib  which includes contraindications and special warnings and precautions  is available at www.ema.europa.eu. The Great Britain Summary of Product Characteristics for filgotinib can be found at www.medicines.org.uk/emc and the Northern Ireland Summary of Product Characteristics for filgotinib can be found at www.emcmedicines.com/en-GB/northernireland  respectively. The interview form from the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare is available at www.info.pmda.go.jp.Jyseleca® is a trademark of Galapagos NV and Gilead Sciences  Inc. or its related companies. Except for filgotinib’s approval as Jyseleca for the treatment of moderately to severely RA and UC by the relevant regulatory authorities in the European Union  Great Britain  and Japan  our drug candidates are investigational; their efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studiesMANTA is a long-term  placebo-controlled Phase 2 safety study in men with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD) to assess semen parameters while taking filgotinib. MANTA-RAy is a similar study in men with active rheumatoid arthritis  psoriatic arthritis  ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis. These studies were designed with the input of the relevant health authority and are not powered for statistical comparison between groups. For the primary endpoint analysis  databases of both studies were pooled  and the results were announced in March 2021.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

The transaction concluded through the completion of Noble's recommended voluntary public share exchange offer to the shareholders of Maersk Drilling. The companies are now operating as a single organization as of October 3  2022.Noble's President and Chief Executive Officer  Robert Eifler  commented ""Today marks an exciting new chapter as we bring together these two exceptional companies. The fundamental industrial logic of the combination is clear and has only grown stronger over the past year  driven by steady improvements in the offshore drilling market and a deeper appreciation of the immense talent across this newly combined team. I'd personally like to thank the employees of both companies for their sustained focus on safety  integrity  and service as we have worked through this demanding transaction process. I look forward to supporting this team through a rapid integration as we aim to position Noble as a new and dynamic leader in offshore drilling.""Charles M. (Chuck) Sledge  Noble's Chairman of the Board of Directors  added: ""Today's combination of Noble and Maersk Drilling represents a defining moment in the history of offshore drilling. We are excited to join forces with Maersk Drilling's talented team and embark on this journey together as a combined company. I am confident that Noble is now better positioned to deliver enhanced value to all our customers and shareholders.""Consistent with the strategic rationale described in the merger announcement  the combination creates significant operational and financial opportunities for Noble's customers  shareholders  and employees through:A World Class Fleet – among the youngest and highest specification fleets in the industry  with global scale and diversification and a combined track record of industry-leading utilization.Enhanced Customer Experience – uniting two complementary cultures that are focused on best-in-class safety and customer satisfaction as well as a commitment to being an industry leader around sustainability and innovation.Highly Attractive Financial Characteristics – supported by contract backlog (as of October 3  2022 ) of over $4 billion and a conservative balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity  Noble is set up to be a strong platform for cash flow generation and distribution potential.Significant Accretion from Scale and Synergies – annual cost synergies of at least $125 million   which are expected to be realized within two years after closing  with Noble's cost-competitiveness meaningfully enhanced via scale.Noble has received preliminary commitments from a group of banks to enter into a $350 million  3-year term loan to replace the existing Maersk Drilling syndicated facilities. Additionally  Noble has received a preliminary commitment for a $150 million  3-year term loan to replace the existing Maersk Drilling loan with Danish Ship Finance. Each loan has an indicative initial interest rate of Term SOFR plus 3.50% with margin increases beginning in year two. The loans remain subject to final documentation and customary closing conditions  which Noble anticipates will be completed during the fourth quarter.Noble expects to close the previously announced sale of five jackup rigs (Noble Hans Deul  Noble Sam Hartley  Noble Sam Turner  Noble Houston Colbert  and Noble Lloyd Noble  together the ""Remedy Rigs"") to Shelf Drilling Ltd. on October 5th for cash proceeds of $375 million.Additionally  results from the exchange offer for Maersk Drilling shares show a strong preference for settlement in Noble shares rather than cash  with less than $2 million estimated cash required at settlement relative to the $50 million maximum cash settlement amount. Separately  the cash versus shares settlement split pertaining to the compulsory purchase (""squeeze-out"") of the 9.97% minority of Maersk Drilling shareholders that did not tender their shares in the exchange offer will be known upon completion of the squeeze-out in mid-November 2022 (as further set out below).Based on the closing of the business combination  investors should not rely on Noble's previously issued financial guidance for 2022  which is no longer applicable on a combined company basis. Noble will update the market with refreshed financial guidance in the near future.Concurrent with today's closing announcement  Noble has published an updated fleet status report that can be found at www.noblecorp.com.THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS REGULATORY AND STOCK EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTSReference is made to the voluntary public share exchange offer by Noble to the shareholders of Maersk Drilling to acquire the entire share capital in Maersk Drilling (excluding any treasury shares) in connection with the business combination between Noble Corporation and Maersk Drilling (the ""Business Combination"") as announced on August 8  2022 (the ""Exchange Offer""). The Exchange Offer was made pursuant to the business combination agreement (the ""Business Combination Agreement"") to combine Noble Corporation and Maersk Drilling  which was announced on November 10  2021.Admission to trading and official listing of the Noble Shares on Nasdaq CopenhagenOn September 8  2022  Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S (""Nasdaq Copenhagen"") provided their conditional approval for the admission to trading and official listing of Noble Shares (in the form of share entitlements) on Nasdaq Copenhagen under the symbol ""NOBLE"".

Further  Noble issued 14 539 883 warrants (""Noble Warrants) to former holders of warrants exercisable for shares in Noble Corporation in connection with the closing of the Cayman Merger. Additional information about the Noble Warrants may be found on Noble's website at www.noblecorp.com.In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer  Noble has issued 60 137 000 Noble Shares to the former holders of Maersk Drilling shares or Acceptance Shares  as applicable (such number of Noble Shares not adjusted for cash settlement of fractional shares  which will result in a minor capital decrease post-completion)  and delivered DKK 5 292 351 to Maersk Drilling shareholders who elected to receive exchange offer consideration in cash (plus additional cash paid in connection with the settlement of any fractional entitlements to Noble Shares). As a result of the completion of the Exchange Offer and the issuance of Noble Shares  there are 130 490 759 Noble Shares issued and outstanding and 14 539 883 Noble Warrants outstanding as of this date.Initiation of compulsory purchase and delisting of Maersk DrillingAs acceptances representing more than 90% of the outstanding share capital and voting rights in Maersk Drilling have been obtained by Noble in the Exchange Offer  Noble has decided to exercise its rights under the Danish Companies Act to conduct a compulsory purchase of the Maersk Drilling shares held by the remaining minority shareholders of Maersk Drilling.Further  Maersk Drilling has submitted an application to Nasdaq Copenhagen for the removal from trading and official listing of all Maersk Drilling shares from Nasdaq Copenhagen. On September 23  2022  Nasdaq Copenhagen approved this request  as a result of which the delisting will be effective from October 4  2022  and the last day of trading and official listing for Maersk Drilling Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen will be on October 3  2022. Maersk Drilling shareholders who have not accepted the Exchange Offer will not be able to trade the shares in Maersk Drilling on Nasdaq Copenhagen after October 3  2022 but will instead have their shares purchased in connection with the compulsory purchase conducted by Topco in accordance with sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act.The compulsory purchase conducted by Topco in accordance with sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act will be initiated on October 4  2022. As a result of the compulsory purchase  all remaining Maersk Drilling shareholders  who have not accepted the Exchange Offer and have not sold their Maersk Drilling shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen prior to the delisting becoming effective  will be requested to transfer their Maersk Drilling shares to Noble within the four week compulsory purchase period beginning on Tuesday  October 4  2022 and ending on Wednesday  November 2  2022 at 23:59 CET in accordance with section 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act. Such Maersk Drilling shareholders can elect to exchange their Maersk Drilling shares for a number of Noble Shares equal to the share consideration offered to Maersk Drilling shareholders who have accepted the Exchange Offer  or alternatively  a full cash alternative  which will amount to DKK 340.98 (USD 46.79) per Maersk Drilling share.If a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects to exchange its shares in Maersk Drilling for Noble Shares  then such shareholder will initially receive acceptance shares (the ""Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares""). Such Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares will not be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen and will therefore not be tradeable on Nasdaq Copenhagen. The Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares received in connection with the compulsory purchase are expected to be exchanged for Noble Shares (in the form of share entitlements) on or around November 11  2022.If a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects to receive the full cash alternative  then such shareholder will receive the full cash alternative for the compulsory purchase of their Maersk Drilling shares expectedly on or around November 11  2022  and the ownership of such Maersk Drilling shares held by minority shareholders will be concurrently transferred to Noble.Any remaining Maersk Drilling shareholders who have not voluntarily accepted to transfer their Maersk Drilling shares to Noble prior to the expiry of the four week period ending on Wednesday  November 2  2022  will automatically receive the full cash alternative for the compulsory purchase of their Maersk Drilling Shares expectedly on or around November 14  2022.Separate press releases and announcements in the IT system of the Danish Business Authority will be made by Noble when the compulsory purchase has been resolved in accordance with the relevant provisions set out in sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act.According to the Danish Tax Authority  if a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects the share-for-share exchange  then for Danish tax purposes the sales price of the Maersk Drilling shares shall be determined on the basis of the closing price of the Noble shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen the day when the respective Maersk Drilling shareholder informs the Danish Tax Authority of the election to exchange the Maersk Drilling Shares to Noble Shares. The tax disposal date is therefore prior to the date on which the Noble shares are delivered and are available for trading (which is expected to be on or around November 11  2022). For Danish tax purposes  the sales price of the Maersk Drilling shares which are purchased for cash in connection with the compulsory purchase  is the received cash amount (i.e. DKK 340.98 for each Maersk Drilling shares).Assumption of Maersk Drilling RSUs and adoption of long-term incentive programsFor purposes of assuming the RSUs (as defined herein) in Maersk Drilling currently held by the executive officers and key employees of Maersk Drilling  Noble today announces the approval and adoption of (i) the RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Executive Management 2022 (the ""Executive RSU Plan"") and (ii) the RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Key Employees 2022 (the ""Key Employee RSU Plan"" and  together with the Executive RSU Plan  the ""RSU Plans"").Under the RSU Plans  the participants will be eligible to receive a number of restricted share units (""RSUs""). Under the RSU Plans  the executive officers may also be eligible to receive performance-based restricted share units (""PSUs""). The participants will be granted RSUs free of charge under the RSU Plans. Grants of RSUs may take place on a revolving basis and neither grant nor vesting of RSUs depend on the achievement of specific goals. The vesting period for the RSUs is three years from the date of grant  subject to the participant's continued employment with the Noble group. Upon vesting  the participants will receive free of charge a number of Noble Shares equal to the number of RSUs vested to the extent they have not lapsed. In case of a participant's resignation during the vesting period  non-vested RSUs will lapse. In addition  the participants may be subject to ownership requirements pursuant to their individual employment agreements.On October 3  2022  in connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer and the Business Combination  the Noble board of directors adopted a resolution  whereby each RSU in Maersk Drilling granted under the Maersk Drilling RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Executive Management 2019 and the Maersk Drilling RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Key Employees (the ""Maersk Drilling RSU Plans"") shall be assumed by Noble under the corresponding RSU Plans and be converted into an RSU  on substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) as applicable to the original RSUs in Maersk Drilling prior to the closing of the Business Combination  representing the right to receive Noble Shares (collectively  the ""Converted Executive RSUs"").Vesting for Converted Executive RSUs will accelerate for Maersk Drilling executive management and certain other employees of Maersk Drilling who are party to agreements that provide for enhanced severance protections in the event of termination of employment following the Business Combination.About Noble CorporationNoble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry.

Consolidated income statement items exclude therefore  in accordance with IFRS 5  the divested activities.Given the date of disposal of the activities  June 30  2022  the closing date of the financial year  the financial performance is presented below on a like for like basis* including the divested businesses and reconciled with the reported figures in accordance with IFRS 5.On September 30  2022  the Supervisory Board  under the chairmanship of Martin Ducroquet  reviewed the statutory and consolidated financial statements for FY 2021 - 2022 as approved by the General Management and certified by the company's statutory Auditors.Key figuresConsolidated Accounts(in € million)2021-2022Excluding IFRS 5 - not restated for divested activities 2021-2022 2020-2021 Variations Revenue 2 202.6 2 891.7 2 778.6 +4.1% Current operating income 52.8 96.6 100.4 -3.7% Net result 35.4 35.4 57.1 -38.-%Message from Guillaume Debrosse - Chief Executive Officer:""The group was confronted in the 2021-2022 financial year with a series of particularly unfavorable external phenomena to which the teams reacted with commitment and efficiency. The review of the profitability perspectives for our ready-to-use fresh food business in North America  which is weighing on the group's performance in the short term  and which is also linked to this environment  does not call into question the relevance of this acquisition  which is perfectly aligned with our mission ""to inspire the transition toward a plant-based diet to contribute to people’s well-being and planet health."" This mission is based on a strategy of strong brands  again experiencing growth during the financial year  and on a financial situation strengthened by the capital opening of the long life business (canned and frozen) in North America. Given this environment  the group is embarking on the 2022-2023 financial year with appropriate caution while continuing its transformation.""Story continuesRevenueAt € 2 891.7 million  the group's revenue (excluding the effect of IFRS 5)  including the long life business activities in North America  increased by +1.8% on a like for like basis(1) and +4.1% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) over FY 2021-2022 (July 1  2021 - June 30  2022).Currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of +2.3% on the group's growth this year  notably with a significant appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars.Adjusted by IFRS 5  revenue amounted to 2 202.6 million euro  compared with 2 163.6 million euro last financial year.Activity by Geographic RegionTotal consolidated revenue(in € million)2021-2022Excluding IFRS 5 - not restated for divested activities 2021-2022 2020-2021 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Europe Zone 1 357.3 1 357.3 1 271.7 6.7% 6.9% Non-Europe Zone 845.3 1 534.4 1 506.9 1.8% -2.4% Total 2 202.6 2 891.7 2 778.6 4.1% 1.8%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated revenue(in € million)Total consolidated revenue(in € million) 2021-2022Excluding IFRS 5 - not restated for divested activities 2021-2022 2020-2021 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Canned 958.4 1 149.3 1 087.7 5.7% 4.4% Frozen 238.4 736.6 655.1 12.4% 8.8% Fresh processed 1 005.9 1 005.9 1 035.8 -2.9% -5.3% Total 2 202.6 2 891.7 2 778.6 4.1% 1.8%Europe ZoneThe revenue for the Europe Zone  representing 46.9% of the business activity in FY 2021-2022 (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) posted a high growth rate of +6.7% on reported figures and +6.9% on a like for like basis(1)  growth recorded in all technologies. Branded sales grew by circa +4.-% in the retail sector  resulting  in particular for Cassegrain  in market share gains in both volume and value  in line with the group's strategy. Food service business  mainly frozen and fresh  grew by more than 30%  exceeding the market's recovery rate  resulting in a return to a level of activity close to that of the pre-covid period.Non-Europe ZoneRevenue (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) for the non-Europe Zone in FY 2021-2022  including the canned and frozen activities in North America  represented 53.1% of total revenue  down -2.4% on a like for like(1) and up +1.8% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5).In North America  the long life activities (canned and frozen)  partially divested on June 30  2022  posted solid growth over the financial year as a whole  driven  as in Europe  by the strong growth in the food service business in both Canada and the United States along with the resilience of the retail sector despite its normalization following the Covid 19 sanitary crisis.The ready-to-use fresh activities of the Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit declined significantly over the financial year. This decline is explained by significant price increases aimed at preserving margins in a particularly inflationary environment  a less dynamic market  and the cessation of sales of non-contributing ranges to certain clients  which was not offset by new contract wins.In Eurasia  the brands (Bonduelle and Globus) posted growth over the financial year as a whole  despite a Q4 marked by geopolitical tensions and their impacts on consumption and inflation.Operating Profitability(in € million)2021-2022Excluding IFRS 5 - not restated for divested activities 2021-2022 2020-2021 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Revenue 2 202.6 2 891.7 2 778.6 +4.1% +1.8% Current operating profitability 52.8 96.6 100.4 -3.7% -4.-% Current operating margin rate 2.4% 3.3% 3.6% -27 bps -21 bpsFor FY 2021-2022  the Bonduelle Group's current operating profitability stands at € 96 6 million at constant exchange rate compared to € 100.4 last financial year  i.e.  a current operating margin of 3.3% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) and 3.4% on a like-for-like basis(1).Adjusted by IFRS 5 and the partial disposal of the long life business activities in North America (BALL)  the current operating result amounts to € 52.8 million compared to € 55.2 million last financial year.The group had to face a multiplication of adverse factors during the financial year: the continuing sanitary crisis  unfavorable weather conditions impacting agricultural crops and industrial performance  the first wave of inflation emphasized by the geopolitical context and the disorganization of supply chains.In addition  and in relation to some of these factors  the fresh ready-to-use business in North America continued to weigh on the group's performance  which could not be fully offset by the improved performance of the other canned and frozen operating segments in Europe  North America  and Eastern Europe.While lower than the guidance set at the beginning of the year  this current operating profitability demonstrates the group's resilience  its control of overheads  its operating efficiency  and its pricing power  with price increases negotiated to offset cost increases.Non-recurring items for the financial year amount to € 23.7 million (excl. IFRS 5).The main components are on the one hand an income of € 144.7 million relating to the accounting capital gain on the disposal of the canned and frozen food activities in North America  on the other hand an expense of € 107.- million relating to an impairment of tangible and intangible assets (goodwill and industrial assets) linked to a review of the profitability forecasts for the ready-to-use fresh food business activity in North America  as well as the various costs linked to organizational changes and the closure of activities.After taking this non-recurring income into account  the Bonduelle Group's operating income (excl. IFRS 5) amounts to € 120.3 million  compared with € 97.2 million the previous financial year.Net ResultThe net financial expense (excl. IFRS 5) stands at € -17.6 million against € -17.3 million last financial year  recording a stable borrowing cost and a positive exchange rate result. The average interest rate relating to the cost of financial debt stands at 1.61% compared to 1.79% a year earlier  as the group benefited from particularly attractive financing conditions on the commercial paper market (NeuCP).The result of the equity method shows an expense of € -5.2 million (against € -0.6 million in the previous year) relating to the results and depreciation of certain investments in start-ups as well as the costs of acquiring the minority stake in the new group of long life business activities in North America resulting from the partial disposal on June 30  2022.Excluding IFRS 5  the income tax expense stands at € 62.1 million against € 22.2 million last financial year and represents an effective tax rate of 60.4% taking into account on the one hand the taxation of the capital gain on the sale of the long life business activities in North America at a reduced rate and  on the other hand  in accordance with the revised profitability forecast for the ready-to-use fresh food business in North America  an impairment of deferred taxes for an amount of € 29.9 million. After considering the tax charge and the financial income  the Bonduelle Group's net income for FY 2021-2022 stands at € 35.4 million compared with € 57.1 million  last financial year  or 1.2% of turnover (excluding the IFRS 5 effect). The implementation of the IFRS 5 standard has no impact on the net result.Financial SituationJune 30  2020 Reported figures June 30  2020 Excl.

Once IFRS 16 standard is taken into account  the group's debt stands at € 362.9 million and debt leverage(3) at 1.72 based on the same recurring EBITDA excluding the IFRS 5 effect.HighlightsStatus of the fresh ready-to-use business activity in North AmericaAs announced on July 11  2022  the difficulties encountered by the ready-to-use fresh business operating segment in North America have led the group to review the profitability perspective of this business. The in-depth analysis of the market and the margins of the various product lines led the group to recognize  on the basis of future cash flows  an impairment of intangible assets (goodwill) and underperforming industrial assets  as well as the non-recognition of deferred tax assets for an amount of € 136.9 million on June 30  2022.Bonduelle announces the capital opening of Bonduelle Americas Long Life to the Fonds de solidarité FTQ and CDPQOn June 30  2022  the Bonduelle Group obtained the approval from U.S and Canadian regulatory authorities and the waiver of conditions precedent allowing it to finalize the agreement with the institutional investors Fonds de solidarité FTQ and CDPQ  for the acquisition  in equal shares between them  of 65% of Bonduelle Americas Long Life (BALL) and on the basis of an enterprise value at 100% of C$ 850 million (approximately € 625 million)  or an EBITDA multiple for 2020-2021 of 8.2x.With a revenue of C$ 989 million for financial year 2021-2022  this business activity is dedicated to the processing and marketing of canned and frozen vegetables in the United States and Canada  in the retail supermarket and food service sectors  with private labels  third party brands and own brands such as Arctic Gardens and Del Monte. This operation enables the group to continue to deploy its activities  particularly in brands  in line with its strategic priorities and its ambition of sustainable growth with positive impact.Bonduelle recorded in the income statement  on the line “Income from discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS 5  the capital gain of this transaction amounting to a net amount of € 132.4 million (after disposal costs and taxes)  equal to the difference between the fair value of the de-consolidated assets and their book value at that date. The assets and liabilities of these companies were de-consolidated and Bonduelle recognized the fair value of 35% of the retained interest in these entities  now called Nortera Foods  amounting to € 84 million  as an asset in the balance sheet under equity interests.Bonduelle's business activities in Ukraine and RussiaIn accordance with its press release of March 17  2022  the Bonduelle Group has suspended all development investment projects in Russia at this point and has decided to dedicate all profits made since February 24  2022  and during the financial year from Russian sales to the future reconstruction of Ukraine  its infrastructure  and its agricultural and food ecosystems. The amount of net profit  resulting from the sales made in Russia from February 24  2022  to June 30  2022  as determined by the Board of Directors  is € 1.2 million. As the method of reinvestment of this amount has not yet been identified  no impact has been recorded in the financial statements for 2021-2022.In Ukraine  which represents a limited part of the group's revenue  and which has no industrial presence  commercial activity is gradually resuming after several weeks of interruption.OutlooksBased on the new scope  now excluding long life activities in North America  and given a particularly uncertain and volatile environment  the Bonduelle Group is targeting  at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation  a revenue growth  integrating price increases aimed at offsetting cost inflation  from 8 to 11% and a current operating margin stable at 2.5%  representing an increase in current operating profitability close to 15%.The General Management will propose at the Annual General Meeting of December 1  2022 the payment of a dividend of €0.30 per share.(1) at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows:For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.In the specific case of the 2021-2022 financial year  the items relating to the North American canned and frozen activities divested on June 30  2022 are included for the full financial year.(2) net financial debt / equity(3) net financial debt / recurring EBITDAAlternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

The transaction concluded through the completion of Noble's recommended voluntary public share exchange offer to the shareholders of Maersk Drilling. The companies are now operating as a single organization as of October 3  2022.Noble's President and Chief Executive Officer  Robert Eifler  commented ""Today marks an exciting new chapter as we bring together these two exceptional companies. The fundamental industrial logic of the combination is clear and has only grown stronger over the past year  driven by steady improvements in the offshore drilling market and a deeper appreciation of the immense talent across this newly combined team. I'd personally like to thank the employees of both companies for their sustained focus on safety  integrity  and service as we have worked through this demanding transaction process. I look forward to supporting this team through a rapid integration as we aim to position Noble as a new and dynamic leader in offshore drilling.""Charles M. (Chuck) Sledge  Noble's Chairman of the Board of Directors  added: ""Today's combination of Noble and Maersk Drilling represents a defining moment in the history of offshore drilling. We are excited to join forces with Maersk Drilling's talented team and embark on this journey together as a combined company. I am confident that Noble is now better positioned to deliver enhanced value to all our customers and shareholders.""Consistent with the strategic rationale described in the merger announcement  the combination creates significant operational and financial opportunities for Noble's customers  shareholders  and employees through:A World Class Fleet – among the youngest and highest specification fleets in the industry  with global scale and diversification and a combined track record of industry-leading utilization.Story continuesEnhanced Customer Experience – uniting two complementary cultures that are focused on best-in-class safety and customer satisfaction as well as a commitment to being an industry leader around sustainability and innovation.Highly Attractive Financial Characteristics – supported by contract backlog (as of October 3  2022) of over $4 billion and a conservative balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity  Noble is set up to be a strong platform for cash flow generation and distribution potential.Significant Accretion from Scale and Synergies – annual cost synergies of at least $125 million  which are expected to be realized within two years after closing  with Noble's cost-competitiveness meaningfully enhanced via scale.Noble has received preliminary commitments from a group of banks to enter into a $350 million  3-year term loan to replace the existing Maersk Drilling syndicated facilities. Additionally  Noble has received a preliminary commitment for a $150 million  3-year term loan to replace the existing Maersk Drilling loan with Danish Ship Finance. Each loan has an indicative initial interest rate of Term SOFR plus 3.50% with margin increases beginning in year two. The loans remain subject to final documentation and customary closing conditions  which Noble anticipates will be completed during the fourth quarter.Noble expects to close the previously announced sale of five jackup rigs (Noble Hans Deul  Noble Sam Hartley  Noble Sam Turner  Noble Houston Colbert  and Noble Lloyd Noble  together the ""Remedy Rigs"") to Shelf Drilling Ltd. on October 5th for cash proceeds of $375 million.Additionally  results from the exchange offer for Maersk Drilling shares show a strong preference for settlement in Noble shares rather than cash  with less than $2 million estimated cash required at settlement relative to the $50 million maximum cash settlement amount. Separately  the cash versus shares settlement split pertaining to the compulsory purchase (""squeeze-out"") of the 9.97% minority of Maersk Drilling shareholders that did not tender their shares in the exchange offer will be known upon completion of the squeeze-out in mid-November 2022 (as further set out below).Based on the closing of the business combination  investors should not rely on Noble's previously issued financial guidance for 2022  which is no longer applicable on a combined company basis. Noble will update the market with refreshed financial guidance in the near future.Concurrent with today's closing announcement  Noble has published an updated fleet status report that can be found at www.noblecorp.com.THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS REGULATORY AND STOCK EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTSReference is made to the voluntary public share exchange offer by Noble to the shareholders of Maersk Drilling to acquire the entire share capital in Maersk Drilling (excluding any treasury shares) in connection with the business combination between Noble Corporation and Maersk Drilling (the ""Business Combination"") as announced on August 8  2022 (the ""Exchange Offer""). The Exchange Offer was made pursuant to the business combination agreement (the ""Business Combination Agreement"") to combine Noble Corporation and Maersk Drilling  which was announced on November 10  2021.Admission to trading and official listing of the Noble Shares on Nasdaq CopenhagenOn September 8  2022  Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S (""Nasdaq Copenhagen"") provided their conditional approval for the admission to trading and official listing of Noble Shares (in the form of share entitlements) on Nasdaq Copenhagen under the symbol ""NOBLE"".

Further  Noble issued 14 539 883 warrants (""Noble Warrants) to former holders of warrants exercisable for shares in Noble Corporation in connection with the closing of the Cayman Merger. Additional information about the Noble Warrants may be found on Noble's website at www.noblecorp.com.In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer  Noble has issued 60 137 000 Noble Shares to the former holders of Maersk Drilling shares or Acceptance Shares  as applicable (such number of Noble Shares not adjusted for cash settlement of fractional shares  which will result in a minor capital decrease post-completion)  and delivered DKK 5 292 351 to Maersk Drilling shareholders who elected to receive exchange offer consideration in cash (plus additional cash paid in connection with the settlement of any fractional entitlements to Noble Shares). As a result of the completion of the Exchange Offer and the issuance of Noble Shares  there are 130 490 759 Noble Shares issued and outstanding and 14 539 883 Noble Warrants outstanding as of this date.Initiation of compulsory purchase and delisting of Maersk DrillingAs acceptances representing more than 90% of the outstanding share capital and voting rights in Maersk Drilling have been obtained by Noble in the Exchange Offer  Noble has decided to exercise its rights under the Danish Companies Act to conduct a compulsory purchase of the Maersk Drilling shares held by the remaining minority shareholders of Maersk Drilling.Further  Maersk Drilling has submitted an application to Nasdaq Copenhagen for the removal from trading and official listing of all Maersk Drilling shares from Nasdaq Copenhagen. On September 23  2022  Nasdaq Copenhagen approved this request  as a result of which the delisting will be effective from October 4  2022  and the last day of trading and official listing for Maersk Drilling Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen will be on October 3  2022. Maersk Drilling shareholders who have not accepted the Exchange Offer will not be able to trade the shares in Maersk Drilling on Nasdaq Copenhagen after October 3  2022 but will instead have their shares purchased in connection with the compulsory purchase conducted by Topco in accordance with sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act.The compulsory purchase conducted by Topco in accordance with sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act will be initiated on October 4  2022. As a result of the compulsory purchase  all remaining Maersk Drilling shareholders  who have not accepted the Exchange Offer and have not sold their Maersk Drilling shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen prior to the delisting becoming effective  will be requested to transfer their Maersk Drilling shares to Noble within the four week compulsory purchase period beginning on Tuesday  October 4  2022 and ending on Wednesday  November 2  2022 at 23:59 CET in accordance with section 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act. Such Maersk Drilling shareholders can elect to exchange their Maersk Drilling shares for a number of Noble Shares equal to the share consideration offered to Maersk Drilling shareholders who have accepted the Exchange Offer  or alternatively  a full cash alternative  which will amount to DKK 340.98 (USD 46.79) per Maersk Drilling share.If a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects to exchange its shares in Maersk Drilling for Noble Shares  then such shareholder will initially receive acceptance shares (the ""Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares""). Such Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares will not be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen and will therefore not be tradeable on Nasdaq Copenhagen. The Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares received in connection with the compulsory purchase are expected to be exchanged for Noble Shares (in the form of share entitlements) on or around November 11  2022.If a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects to receive the full cash alternative  then such shareholder will receive the full cash alternative for the compulsory purchase of their Maersk Drilling shares expectedly on or around November 11  2022  and the ownership of such Maersk Drilling shares held by minority shareholders will be concurrently transferred to Noble.Any remaining Maersk Drilling shareholders who have not voluntarily accepted to transfer their Maersk Drilling shares to Noble prior to the expiry of the four week period ending on Wednesday  November 2  2022  will automatically receive the full cash alternative for the compulsory purchase of their Maersk Drilling Shares expectedly on or around November 14  2022.Separate press releases and announcements in the IT system of the Danish Business Authority will be made by Noble when the compulsory purchase has been resolved in accordance with the relevant provisions set out in sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act.According to the Danish Tax Authority  if a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects the share-for-share exchange  then for Danish tax purposes the sales price of the Maersk Drilling shares shall be determined on the basis of the closing price of the Noble shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen the day when the respective Maersk Drilling shareholder informs the Danish Tax Authority of the election to exchange the Maersk Drilling Shares to Noble Shares. The tax disposal date is therefore prior to the date on which the Noble shares are delivered and are available for trading (which is expected to be on or around November 11  2022). For Danish tax purposes  the sales price of the Maersk Drilling shares which are purchased for cash in connection with the compulsory purchase  is the received cash amount (i.e. DKK 340.98 for each Maersk Drilling shares).Assumption of Maersk Drilling RSUs and adoption of long-term incentive programsFor purposes of assuming the RSUs (as defined herein) in Maersk Drilling currently held by the executive officers and key employees of Maersk Drilling  Noble today announces the approval and adoption of (i) the RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Executive Management 2022 (the ""Executive RSU Plan"") and (ii) the RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Key Employees 2022 (the ""Key Employee RSU Plan"" and  together with the Executive RSU Plan  the ""RSU Plans"").Under the RSU Plans  the participants will be eligible to receive a number of restricted share units (""RSUs""). Under the RSU Plans  the executive officers may also be eligible to receive performance-based restricted share units (""PSUs""). The participants will be granted RSUs free of charge under the RSU Plans. Grants of RSUs may take place on a revolving basis and neither grant nor vesting of RSUs depend on the achievement of specific goals. The vesting period for the RSUs is three years from the date of grant  subject to the participant's continued employment with the Noble group. Upon vesting  the participants will receive free of charge a number of Noble Shares equal to the number of RSUs vested to the extent they have not lapsed. In case of a participant's resignation during the vesting period  non-vested RSUs will lapse. In addition  the participants may be subject to ownership requirements pursuant to their individual employment agreements.On October 3  2022  in connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer and the Business Combination  the Noble board of directors adopted a resolution  whereby each RSU in Maersk Drilling granted under the Maersk Drilling RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Executive Management 2019 and the Maersk Drilling RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Key Employees (the ""Maersk Drilling RSU Plans"") shall be assumed by Noble under the corresponding RSU Plans and be converted into an RSU  on substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) as applicable to the original RSUs in Maersk Drilling prior to the closing of the Business Combination  representing the right to receive Noble Shares (collectively  the ""Converted Executive RSUs"").Vesting for Converted Executive RSUs will accelerate for Maersk Drilling executive management and certain other employees of Maersk Drilling who are party to agreements that provide for enhanced severance protections in the event of termination of employment following the Business Combination.About Noble CorporationNoble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry.

It is also provided that in the event that on December 31  2023  one or several tranches are not drawn down for a reason exclusively and directly imputable to Néovacs  Pharnext will be re-credited of the amount corresponding to the commitment fee applied to the tranche(s) that has (or have) not been drawn down.The discount offered for the subscription of each tranche of Bonds (from the second tranche onwards only)  depends on their respective date of issuance (expected to occur from September 2022 to July 2023 but which may occur  at the latest  until December 2023): each tranche of Bonds other than the first tranche will be subscribed at a discount equal to 1% per month elapsed between the date of signature of the Financing Agreement and the date of issuance of the relevant tranche.Accordingly  on an indicative basis  the total amount of the discount on the basis of a nominal amount of EUR 21 093 800 would amount to EUR 393.800 in the event that all of the Bonds Tranches are paid according to the envisioned timetable  i.e. until July 2023  it being noted that this amount may be higher in the event that the drawdown of the tranches spans beyond July 2023 and in any event  until December 2023 at the latest.This Financing Agreement follows the press release published by Néovacs on August 8  2022[1] in connection with its proposed financing to Pharnext and with the press release published on August 23  2022 [2] by Pharnext in connection with the grant of a EUR 2.5 million loan granted by Néovacs.As part of entering into the Financing Agreement  GTO 13 and Pharnext also renegotiated their agreement dated June 4  2021  for the issuance of convertible or exchangeable bonds into new and/or existing shares with subscription warrants (""OCEANE-BSA"") attached  as amended in December 2021  in January 2022 and on June 6  2022  (the ""Amendment"").The Amendment  executed on September 30  2022  therefore provides that the maximum nominal amount of OCEANE that may still be issued by Pharnext under this program now amounts to a total of EUR 26 million  divided into thirteen tranches of EUR 2 million each  to be subscribed monthly by GTO 13 and subject to certain conditions (including  in addition to certain customary conditions  Néovacs meeting its financing undertakings toward Pharnext under the Financing Agreement  Pharnext's market capitalization not dropping below EUR 2 million over a period of ten days prior to the payment of each tranche and GTO 13's holding of Pharnext securities being below 400% of the market capitalization as a result of the payment of the tranche)  over the period from December 20  2022[3] to December 20  2023 included. This results in the maximum nominal amount being reduced to EUR 62 million with respect to this financing program (as opposed to EUR 81 million as initially provided).The maximum nominal amount of OCEANE that may still be issued by Pharnext under the Amendment (EUR 26 million) is below the maximum nominal amount of EUR 45 millions of OCEANE that could previously still be drawn down by Pharnext until June 2024 under the agreement in force (against December 2023 now)  and as a result of this change  the dilutive impact with respect to Pharnext shareholders under this program has been diminished. No further commitment fees shall be paid to GTO 13 upon payment of each tranche.Néovacs and Pharnext are currently parties to separate financing agreements with entities that are part of the Alpha Blue Ocean group. Those entities of the Alpha Blue Ocean group hold shares and/or securities giving access to  respectively  Pharnext share capital and Néovacs share capital  may therefore  depending on the conversions of OCEANE and/or the sales of shares made on the market  be in a position to hold a more or less substantial number of shares of each issuer. It is however specified that these entities from the Alpha Blue Ocean group (or any other entity of from the Alpha Blue Ocean group itself or its corporate officers) are not members of the boards of directors of Néovacs or of Pharnext and that at the date of execution of the Amendment  taking into account the number of Pharnext shares held by GTO 13 (less than 1%)  as indicated by GTO 13  Pharnext considered that entering into the Amendment was not subject to special approval as required under the laws applicable to regulated agreements.A financing to bring about the development of PXT3003 drug candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type IA (CMT1A)This financing by Néovacs will support Pharnext operations and cash requirements  in particular the Phase III PREMIER pivotal clinical trial assessing its PTX3003 drug candidate in CMT1A  a rare debilitating peripheral neuropathy with currently no existing approved therapy.The preliminary results of this trial are expected to be announced in Q4 2023. If positive  they will form the basis of a filing for the authorization to market PXT3003 as a treatment for CMT1A with the FDA in the United States of America and with the EMA in Europe.A financing that (i) pays and replaces the EUR 12 million loan granted in June 2022 by GTO 13 (Alpha Blue Ocean) and (ii) completes the existing financing in the form of OCEANE-BSA granted by GTO 13 with the maximum amount now reduced to EUR 26 million  to be drawn before December 2023.This new financing by Néovacs will allow Pharnext to terminate  after the early repayment (without penalty) of an existing outstanding debt of EUR 5.5 million and interest for approximately EUR 125 842  under the fixed-rate loan of a maximum total amount of EUR 12 million  with an annual interest rate of 9.5%  entered into with GTO 13 (member of the Alpha Blue Ocean group) on June 7  2022. As part of this transaction  GTO 13 shall release all of the security interests it currently holds (on intellectual property rights  bank accounts and insurance receivables)  which will then be put in place for the benefit of Néovacs as part of the Financing Agreement.With regard to the financing program through the issuance of OCEANE-BSAs  entered into with GTO 13[4]  GTO has undertaken on September 30  2022  in relation to the Amendment (to the issuance agreement executed on June 4  2021  as later amended)  to subscribe in cash for tranches of OCEANE-BSAs for a net amount of EUR 2 million per month  starting in December 2022 and ending in December 2023 inclusive (i.e. thirteen tranches for a maximum total of EUR 26 million). The subscription undertaking for each tranche is subject to certain conditions (including  in addition to certain customary conditions  Néovacs meeting its financing undertakings toward Pharnext under the Financing Agreement  Pharnext's market capitalization not dropping below EUR 2 million over a period of ten days preceding the payment of each tranche and GTO 13's holding of Pharnext securities being below 400% of the market capitalization as a result of the payment of the trancheGTO 13 held   at the date of execution of the Amendment  a little less than 1% of the shares and voting rights of Pharnext.A repayment in full of the outstanding debt under the loan entered into on August 22  2022  with Néovacs and the implementation of a new financing by Néovacs via the issuance of simple bonds with BSA attached.The Financing Agreement for a total nominal amount of EUR 21 093 800 (EUR 20.7 million net)  provides for the issuance of a first tranche of Bonds for a nominal amount of EUR 10.7 million (EUR 10.7 million net)  of which EUR 2.5 million will be used to repay the principal amount of the loan granted by Néovacs to Pharnext in August 2022[5] .The Financing Agreement provides for the drawing afterwards by Pharnext of ten additional tranches  including two tranches of a net amount of EUR 2.5 million  respectively  in October and November 2022  then of EUR 1 million net  respectively  in December 2022 and January 2023  and finally of EUR 500 000 net per month from February 2023 to July 2023 inclusive.The Financing Agreement and the Amendment  as well as the issuance of the Bonds and the warrants attached thereto (BSAP et BSAE) were respectively authorized by the Board of Directors of Pharnext on September 26  2022 and their final terms were definitively set  by sub-delegation of the Board of Directors  by the Chief Executive Officer of Pharnext on September 30  2022  on the basis of the 11th resolution (Delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors to increase the share capital by issuing ordinary shares and/or any other securities  with cancellation of the shareholders' preferential subscription rights  in favor of a category of persons meeting certain characteristics (creditors of the Company)) of the Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of Pharnext dated March 21  2022.At the date of execution of the Financing agreement and taking into account the terms and conditions of the BSAP et BSAE (as defined below)  theOCEANE-BSA  the Financing Agreement and of the Amendment  the Company considers that the available amounts with respect to authorized issuance  as adopted in the 11th resolution mentioned above (i.e.  a nominal amount of EUR 27 331 461.1914  out of the EUR 30 000 000 initially authorized  on the basis of the current nominal value per share of EUR 0.0002)  are sufficient to allow  as the case may be  the issuance of corresponding new shares.(i) Share warrants attached to the Bonds will allow Néovacs to subscribe to up to one third of the share capital of Pharnext  as from January 1  2024  and for a period of 5 yearsUnder the Financing Agreement  Néovacs will be allocated  immediately upon execution  a number of Pharnext share warrants attached to the Bonds equal to 50% of the number of Pharnext outstanding shares on the day preceding the date of execution of the Financing Agreement (the ""BSAP"").These BSAP will potentially allow Néovacs to subscribe for up to one third (post dilution) of the share capital of Pharnext  from January 1  2024  until September 30  2027 at the latest  each BSAP giving a right to subscribe for one Pharnext share (subject to re-adjustment of parity every six months).The main terms and conditions of the Bonds and the BSAP to be issued are detailed at the end of this press release.It is specified that under the Financing Agreement  Pharnext has undertaken to communicate to the market its cash position dated as of less than three (3) calendar days as soon as this cash position drops  as the case may be  below EUR 2 750 000. Pursuant to this obligation  Pharnext hereby specifies that its cash position after the payment of the first tranche of the Bonds will be equal to approximately EUR 2.6 million.(ii) Implementation of a trust (fiducie) to facilitate the exercise of share warrants and the sale of corresponding Pharnext shares  strictly pursuant to applicable rulesNéovacs will implement a trust (fiducie-gestion) (the ""Trust"") with respect to which Néovacs will be both settlor and beneficiary for the purposes of handling all of the transactions in relation to Pharnext share capital benefiting Néovacs under the Financing Agreement.In concrete terms  Neovacs will transfer to the Trust all of the Bonds  BSAP  receivables (including commitment fees and interest incurred)  rights and obligations held towards Pharnext under the Financing Agreement. Pharnext shall then issue  free of charge  warrants to subscribe for Pharnext shares (the ""BSAE"") to the Trust. The Trust will then be responsible for exercising the BSAE by offsetting them against certain receivables (detailed below) that it will then hold against Pharnext.The fiducie-gestion is a transaction by which a settle (here  Néovacs alone) transfers goods  rights and pledges  present or future  to a trustee (here  the company Equitis Gestion) which  keeping them separate from its own assets  act with a determined purpose for the benefit of one (or several) beneficiary(ies) (here  Néovacs). Acting independently from the settlor and the beneficiary (Néovacs undertaking  moreover  to implement measures necessary to ensure that at all times the trustee may not be considered as a person closely associated to Néovacs within the meaning of Article 3.1.26 of the MAR Regulation).The Financing Agreement thus provides that the Trust will proceed with the equitization of the receivables in shares (i.e.  the conversion of a liquid receivable  due and payable in shares by way of set off) it will hold with respect to Pharnext  namely:the interest and fees relating to the EUR 2.5 million loan granted by Neovacs to Pharnext in August 2022  i.e.  a total amount of EUR 50 000;the interest on the outstanding Bonds (equal to 1% per month);the commitment fee due by Pharnext to Neovacs under the Financing Agreement  i.e.  an amount corresponding to 5% of the nominal amount of each tranche of Bonds (a total amount of EUR 1 110 200 in the event of the issuance of all tranches from September 2022 to July 2023)subject to certain conditions (detailed in the characteristics of the Bonds)  the principal amount of the Bonds.This equitization will consist of the exercise  by the trustee (Equitis Gestion)  of the BSAE and  if applicable  subject to the applicable contractual provisions  as from January 2024  of the BSAP  by way of set-off against the receivables held against Pharnext  following their transfer to the Trust. The Pharnext shares so created and held by the trustee (on behalf of the Trust) will be sold on the market in accordance with the terms and conditions described hereinafter.The Financing Agreement provides that  following the decision to exercise  if any  by the Trust  the BSAE or BSAP  the sales of Pharnext shares by the Trust may not represent more than 15% of the daily traded volumes. This rate may be increased to 30% in the event of the occurrence of certain events[6]. The purpose of the Trust is not to retain the shares issued upon exercise of the BSAE (and  if applicable  the BSAP) insofar as the sale of these new shares is part of the equitization process.(iii) Néovacs will be entitled to a seat on the Board of Directors of PharnextThe Financing Agreement between Neovacs and Pharnext provides for the co-opting of a director appointed by Neovacs to sit on the board of directors of Pharnext as of the formation of the Trust  which is expected to occur in the weeks following the execution of the Financing Agreement.Impact of the transaction in terms of management of liquidity risk and financing horizonThe execution of the Financing Agreement and of the Amendment allows Pharnext to  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  continue the development of PXT3003 for the treatment of CMT1A and to bring Pharnext closer to the end of its pivotal Phase III PREMIER clinical trial. With the cumulated financing resulting from these agreements of a total amount potentially available of EUR 46.7 million net (including approximately EUR 38.6 million net after repayment of EUR 5.6 million net and of EUR 2.5 million net worth of outstanding debt toward  respectively  GTO 13 and Néovacs)  and subject to satisfaction by each party (Pharnext  Néovacs and GTO 13) of its obligations  Pharnext considers that it be able to finance its operations and the PREMIER trial (first results expected in Q4 2023)  with a cash runway to Q1 2024.Main risks associated with the Financing Agreement and the AmendmentPharnext considers that the main risks associated with the Financing Agreement with Néovacs and the Amendment with GTO 13 (Alpha Blue Ocean) (it being specified that the risks relating to OCEANE-BSA have already been mentioned when the issuance program was launched on June 4  2021  prior to being modified under the Amendment) are the following:Both financing programs provide for the issuance of several types of complex securities (OCEANE-BSA with respect to GTO 13  and simple bonds with share warrants attached with respect to Néovacs giving access to the share capital of Pharnext and including notably a debt component;Satisfaction of the respective obligations of GTO 13 and Néovacs depend on the satisfaction by each party of their respective financing obligations according to the contemplated timeframe for the drawing for the benefit of Pharnext;The volume of completion of the financing program is uncertain and will depend on  among others  market conditions (notably  with respect to certain conditions provided in the Amendment in relation to the minimum market capitalization of Pharnext (EUR 2 million) during at least ten days prior to a drawing and to GTO 13's holding of Pharnext securities being below 400% of the market capitalization at the result of the payment of the given tranche;Both ongoing financing programs will result respectively in dilution by virtue of (i) the issuance of new shares in the event BSAE are exercised (the exercise price being in this instance paid by set off with the receivables for interests and fees held by Néovacs against Pharnext and transferred to the Trust) as well as  as the case may be  of BSAP  the exercise price being in this instance paid by set-off with all or part of the nominal value of the outstanding Bonds. The dilution that might result from the issuance of new shares is shown in the tables below;GTO 13 and the Trust will sell  respectively and independently  the shares newly issued at their discretion  which may affect the volatility  liquidity and market price of the shares of the Company. Although the process of ordered transfer by the Trust described above aims at limiting the effect thereof  the transfer of new shares issued from the exercise of BSAE (as the case may be  and subject to contractual provisions  as from January 2024 of BSAP)) will likely drive down Pharnext share price and have an effect on the market price of Pharnext shares. It is recalled that although this effect  taking into consideration the considered volumes  is expected to stay below the effect (if any) of the transfers carried out by GTO 13 following the conversion (if any) of the OCEANE that it holds or may be in a position to hold  the combined effect of independent and non-concerted transfers carried out the same day by the Trust and GTO 13 may have an effect on and drive down the market price of Pharnext shares.Potential dilutive impact resulting from the Financing Agreement and of the Amendment and theoretical effect of the issuance of new shares resulting from both the exercise of BSAE  BSAP(Financing Agreement with Néovacs) and of OCEANE (Amendment with GTO 13)The market capitalization of the Company at the close of market on September 30  2022  was approximately EUR 2.4 million (EUR €0.0006 per Pharnext share  including EUR €0.0002 of nominal value).As an example only  the table below features the hypothetical effect on the capital structure of (i) the conversion of (a) all of the OCEANE currently held by GTO 13 (a nominal amount equal to EUR 7.3 million at the date of this press release)  as well as of (b) all of the 13 tranches OCEANE which are provided to be subscribed for under the Amendment (a nominal amount equal to EUR 26 million) and of (ii) the exercise in totality of (a) the BSAE (exercisable as from the formation of the Trust) and of (b) BSAP (exercisable by the Trust as from 2024).Maximum potential dilution generated by the conversion of the totality of OCEANE-BSA and the exercise of the totality of the BSAE and the BSAP by a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital before the financing*Hypothetical impact as an example of the issuance on the investment of a shareholder currently holding 1° of the share capital of the Company (on the basis of the number of shares composing the share capital of the Company as of September 30  2022  i.e.  3 989 334 569 shares)Shareholder's interest Non diluted basis Diluted basis** Before the issuance 1.00 % 1.00 % After the issuance only of new shares resulting from the conversion of the outstanding OCEANE (*) 0.00 % 0.20 % After the issuance only of new shares resulting from the issuance and then the conversion of the 13 tranches of OCEANE to be issued pursuant to the Amendment (*) 0.00 % 0.07 % After the issuance only of new shares resulting from the exercise of the totality of the BSA P (***) 0.00 % 0.10 % After the issuance only of new shares resulting from the exercise of the totality of the BSA E (***) 0.00 % 0.16 % TOTAL After the issuance of new shares resulting from the conversion of the totality of the outstanding OCEANE and those to be issued (*) and of the exercise of the totality of BSA E et BSA P pursuant to their respective terms (**) 1.00 % 0.03 %* Theoretical computation carried out with respect to OCEANE on the basis of a conversion price equal to 94% of the lowest VWAP (as published by Bloomberg) over a period of fifteen (15) consecutive trading days preceding today's date  i.e.  0.0005 x 94% = 0.0005€.** The exercise of the totality of dilutive instruments may give rise to the issuance of a maximum indicative number of 132 888 862512 shares.*** assuming the subscription of the totality of the tranches of Bonds as provided by the Financing AgreementMonitoring of the number of Bonds  BSAP and BSAE on the one hand  and of OCEANE-BSA held by GTO 13 on the other hand  and of the new shares resulting from their exercise and/or conversion (if any)Pharnext will maintain on its website a table tracking the number of Bonds  outstanding BSAP and BSAE and will continue  as it does already  to also maintain a table tracking the number of OCEANE held by GTO 13 as well as the number of new Pharnext shares resulting  respectively  from their exercise or conversion  as applicable  by GTO 13 or by the Trust.Dr. David Horn Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Pharnext  commented: ""We are grateful to Néovacs' investment in Pharnext. The Neovacs investment will allow us to further advance the development of PXT3003 in CMT1A. This will bring us one step closer to the completion of our pivotal Phase III trial  PREMIER and the announcement of top-line results in Q4 2023. PXT3003 could represent the first treatment specifically approved in CMT1A and has the potential to bring hope to thousands of patients who suffer in their everyday life from this rare and debilitating peripheral neuropathy.Implementation of a reverse stock split procedurePharnext announced today  by way of a separate press release  the launch of a reverse stock split on the shares comprising its capital stock whereby one new share with a nominal value of 1 euro will equal 5 000 old shares with a nominal value of 0.0002 euro  as authorized by the Shareholders' meeting held on June 17th  2022  under the eighth resolution.It is specified that the transaction is expected to begin  as from the BALO publication expected to occur on October 7  2022  to start the operation on October 24  2022 and that the suspension of conversions and of exercises of securities is expected to occur from Friday  October 21  2022  to Tuesday  November 22  2022. It is recalled in this regard that no exercise of BSAE may occur  as the case may be  during the suspension period.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments.

The share purchase agreement signed on August 17  2022 was subject to the finalization of a €90 million bank loan  which was confirmed last Friday September 30 by the Group’s bank syndicate with LCL  BNP  Credit Agricole Ile de France  BRED and CIC. The acquisition price was paid with the Group’s cash  and partially with the €90 million financing. This acquisition will allow Eurobio Scientific to complete its commercial portfolio with a portfolio of 100% proprietary products among the most efficient in the field of HLA1 diagnostics in order to assess the compatibility between donors and recipients in the context of organ and marrow transplants. It will also strengthen its geographical footprint  mainly in Europe and the USA.One of the world leaders in HLA typing for graft compatibilityFounded in 2005 in Utrecht  the Netherlands  GenDx specializes in the molecular diagnostics of transplants by HLA typing of organs or patients as part of the evaluation of compatibility between donors and recipients. Among others  it is one of the pioneers of typing based on genomic sequencing (SBT or Sequencing Based Typing) for which it currently offers high-resolution solutions based on the most recent NGS2 technologies.GenDx develops and markets a complete family of products which includes:- reagents for performing HLA typing by sequencing;- software for analyzing sequencing results  customized for different sequencing techniques and platforms;- training modules  facilitating the adoption of its solutions by its customers.The company has more than 80 employees  mainly based in the Netherlands  including a sales force present in Benelux  Germany and the USA. In 2021  GenDx generated €17 million in revenue  for €6.9 million in EBITDA. During the first half of 2022  GenDx's revenue is estimated at €11.2 million  for €5.4 million of EBITDA3.An acquisition with strong potential for growth and value creationIn 2021  transplantation diagnostics accounted for 23.8% of Eurobio Scientific Group's (the “Group”) non-COVID revenue  i.e. 20 million euros. The acquisition of GenDx should enable the consolidation of the Group's presence in this specialty and generate new international development synergies.The main synergies linked to this acquisition are:- a strong complementarity of transplantation activities: Eurobio Scientific is currently only a distributor in France where GenDx has no direct presence;- R&D complementarity: GenDx supplements the Group's scientific and technical expertise with significant know-how in HLA and NGS within teams operating in a center of excellence in Utrecht;- GenDx's technological advance in the digitization of diagnostics  through algorithms and software developed by its bioinformatics specialists;- an extension of the international commercial presence by the direct presence of GenDx in the Netherlands  Germany and North America where it will supplement the local capacities of Eurobio Scientific  and by its distributors in the rest of Europe  Asia and the rest of the world.The valuation of this transaction is in line with those of recent acquisitions involving similar assets in the field of medical diagnostics. The various synergies that were identified  will also be added to GenDx’s current value. These synergies will mainly derive from the strong complementarity in terms of R&D  the extension of the Group’s commercial presence and resulting cross-sales  and more generally the new dynamics originating from the mix of expertise : commercial for Eurobio Scientific and scientific for GenDx.Better access to care and advances in medicine are resulting in a growing demand for transplants. However  this is hampered by the availability of organs to be transplanted. A precise and rapid diagnosis  making it possible to increase the success rate of these surgeries  promotes a better balance between supply and demand. The transplant diagnostics market is therefore growing rapidly  and the technological and commercial strength of the new entity resulting from the merger of Eurobio Scientific and GenDx  should make it a leading player.Denis Fortier  Deputy Managing Director and co-CEO of Eurobio Scientific  Chairman of EurobioNext  declares: ""This operation is transformative for Eurobio Scientific and is fully in line with the development strategy that we have been successfully pursuing for several years and which is based on a direct presence in Europe and an increase in the share of proprietary products. The strong complementarity between our two groups should make it possible to increase the advance of our Group both technologically  geographically and commercially”.Hervé Duchesne de Lamotte  Deputy Managing Director and CFO of Eurobio Scientific  adds: ""This merger  which has the support of our financial partners  will allow Eurobio Scientific to significantly increase the share of proprietary products in its turnover and therefore its profitability. The size of the financing associated with this transaction also gives Eurobio Scientific the means to steadily pursue the development of the Group”.“We are particularly proud of this acquisition of GenDx which will further strengthen the added value of Eurobio Scientific's innovation. It is the fruit of historical relations between Denis Fortier and Wietse Mulder  two entrepreneurs who share the same vision of the development of their business. We are convinced that GenDx will play an important role in the development of Eurobio Scientific around NGS technology as well as on the two challenges of the future which are preventive medicine and smart health”  comments Arthur Vigneras  Investment Director with NextStage AM.Wietse Mulder  CEO and co-founder of GenDx  adds “For GenDx it was important to get closer to a group led by entrepreneurs. Eurobio Scientific  through its demonstrated agility during the COVID crisis and its complementarity with our activities  quickly appeared to us as the best partner to ensure the continued development of transplantation activities  while strengthening the technological base of our new Group. On a more personal note  I am delighted to join this new group and enable the creation of a leading player in the field of molecular diagnostics in Europe ”.Cash and bank loan financingThe acquisition was financed in part by the Group's own cash and in part by a loan from a syndicate bringing together the Group's banks  LCL  BNP  Crédit Agricole Ile de France  BRED and CIC. The loan is for a total amount of 90 million euros. It will be amortized half-yearly over a period of six years for 63 million euros  and will be repayable in fine at the end of the seventh year for 27 million euros. The interest rate will be EURIBOR4 plus a margin varying according to certain financial ratios and ranging between 0.9 and 1.6% for the amortized tranche  and between 1.75 and 2.45% for the in fine tranche. A portion of this loan will be used to repay the outstanding balance of the March 2020 syndicated loan  for approximately €4.5 million. During a three-year period  Eurobio Scientific may expand the loan by €40 million  in order to preserve financial resources activable for new investments or potentially new acquisitions.List of participants in the transactionEurobio Scientific: Denis Fortier (Deputy Managing Director  co-CEO) and Hervé Duchesne de Lamotte (Deputy Managing Director  CFO)  Jean-Michel Carle (President and CEO)NextStage AM: Grégoire Sentilhes (Co-founder  Chairman and CEO)  Arthur Vignéras (Investment Director) and Emilio Johnston (Associate)M&A Buyside Advisor: Rothschild & Co.

We will now work to update all relevant label information and materials with the aim to increase access to Jyseleca so that European patients who may benefit from the treatment are able to receive it.”The Type II variation application was submitted to the EMA in June 2022  supported by interim data on the primary  secondary and exploratory endpoints at Week 13 and 26 for subjects who met a prespecified sperm decrease at these timepoints (up to Week 52) from the ongoing MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies  investigating the potential effect of filgotinib use on semen parameters and sex hormones in adult patients with IBD and various RC.Following assessment of the interim data by the CHMP  it was concluded in the opinion that the data did not reveal a difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients who had a 50% or more decrease from baseline in semen parameters at week 13 (pooled primary endpoint: filgotinib 6.7%  placebo 8.3%) and at week 26. Further  CHMP concluded that the data did not show any relevant changes in sex hormone levels or change from baseline in semen parameters across treatment groups. Overall  CHMP concluded that these clinical data were not suggestive of filgotinib-related effects on testicular function.Following the positive CHMP opinion  the language in the section of the Special Warnings and Precautions about the potential effect of filgotinib on sperm production and male fertility will be removed from the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)  and the MANTA/MANTA-RAy studies will be removed from the Risk Management Plan (RMP).The design of the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studies was published in Advances in Therapy in June 20222  and Galapagos is planning to publish the results in a peer-reviewed medical journal next year.About filgotinibFilgotinib is marketed as Jyseleca (200mg and 100mg tablets) in the European Union (incl. Norway)  Great Britain  and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Filgotinib is also marketed as Jyseleca (200mg tablets) in the European Union (incl. Norway)  Great Britain  and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response with  lost response to  or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. A global Phase 3 program with filgotinib is ongoing in Crohn’s Disease.

The interview form from the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare is available at www.info.pmda.go.jp.Jyseleca® is a trademark of Galapagos NV and Gilead Sciences  Inc. or its related companies. Except for filgotinib’s approval as Jyseleca for the treatment of moderately to severely RA and UC by the relevant regulatory authorities in the European Union  Great Britain  and Japan  our drug candidates are investigational; their efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the MANTA and MANTA-RAy studiesMANTA is a long-term  placebo-controlled Phase 2 safety study in men with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD) to assess semen parameters while taking filgotinib. MANTA-RAy is a similar study in men with active rheumatoid arthritis  psoriatic arthritis  ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis. These studies were designed with the input of the relevant health authority and are not powered for statistical comparison between groups. For the primary endpoint analysis  databases of both studies were pooled  and the results were announced in March 2021.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

Overbond will integrate certain MTS BondsPro fixed income price data to enhance the coverage and precision of its AI-generated fixed income data feeds and automated trading solutions  and MTS BondsPro clients will gain access to Overbond's fixed income prices and liquidity-confidence scores.Fixed income trading has been re-shaped by the development of new financial products  the emergence of electronic all-to-all platforms  and the rise of non-dealer liquidity providers using algorithmic and high-frequency trading. Now  fixed income traders face heightened volatility and evaporating liquidity against a backdrop of rate hikes  inflation  and recessionary concerns.In this environment  electronic and automated trading have become the new standards. These require precise  live data but significant fixed income data gaps persist because there is no unified  central source for bond trade data. Aggregating the available data into executable prices and liquidity measures requires sophisticated AI and cloud-based processing for models  and most bond trading desks lack the resources and expertise to do this in-house.Overbond partners with the world's largest trading venues and capital markets data providers to bring AI and cloud-based aggregated data and automated trading solutions to fixed income trading desks around the globe. Through its partnership with MTS BondsPro  Overbond AI will be able to integrate an additional 10 million price updates daily across 25 000 investment grade (IG)  high yield (HY) and emerging market (EM) bonds. In turn  MTS data will now include Overbond liquidity confidence scores and best executable pricing. The MTS BondsPro data adds a previously untapped layer of information to AI fixed income data aggregation because it includes firm  executable prices in real time.""Using post-trade data to generate real-time aggregated data feeds is challenging because of the time lag between the execution of the trade and the release of its associated data  and because only a limited proportion of bonds trade in a given day. By providing firm  executable prices in real time  MTS BondsPro fills the data gap between post-trade data and real-time—but non-binding―quotes. Integrating this additional layer of information into Overbond will increase the coverage  the precision and the discovery of best-executable pricing and liquidity in the fixed income markets "" said Vuk Magdelinic  CEO of Overbond.""We are excited to be able to add Overbond AI-generated fixed income prices and liquidity scores to the already robust data we offer our clients  and to work with Overbond to increase the quality of data and information available to our clients"" said David Parker  Head of MTS Markets International.About OverbondOverbond is a developer of process-redefining  AI-driven data and analytics and trade automation solutions for the global fixed income markets.

Click here to read why SPGI stock may be attractive for long-term investors.,"SeanShotOverview of S&P GlobalS&P Global (NYSE:NYSE:SPGI) is a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings  benchmarks  analytics  and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Its capital market clients include major asset managers  investment banks  commercial banks  insurance companies  exchanges  trading firms and issuers; while its commodity market clients include producers  traders and intermediaries in energy  petrochemicals  metals  and agriculture. In February 2020  S&P Global completed the acquisition of IHS Markit Ltd  which has enabled it to expand the scope of its offerings into transportation and engineering.Today  the company comprises of six operating divisions  and owns a portfolio of iconic brands in the information services industry (figure 1):(1) S&P Global Ratings: an independent provider of credit ratings  research  and analytics  offering investors and other market participants information  ratings  and benchmarks. Credit ratings is one of several tools investors use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments(2) S&P Global Market Intelligence: a global provider of multi-asset class data  research  and analytical capabilities  which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services. It provides investors  government agencies  corporations  and universities with the necessary trading data  firm and industry and competitive dynamics  to perform market evaluations(3) S&P Dow Jones Indices: a provider of transparent benchmarks for investing  trading  and to create new innovative products to monitor world markets. The division provides and maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors  wealth managers and institutional investors  the best-known of which are the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Index. In addition  the division also manages commodity  sector  ESG  multi-asset  dividend-oriented  cryptocurrency  factor-based  and other thematic indices(4) S&P Global Commodity Insights: (previously Platts): a provider of information and benchmarks for the commodity and energy markets(5) S&P Global Mobility: a provider of information solutions serving the full automotive value chain including OEM vehicle manufacturers  automotive suppliers  mobility service providers  retailers  consumers  and finance and insurance companies(6) S&P Global Engineering Solutions: a leading provider of engineering standards and related technical knowledge.Figure 1: Portfolio of brands under the S&P Global umbrellaS&P Global investor presentationRevenue and operating income by segmentS&P Global's quarterly revenue has grown by almost 50% to ~$3 billion (figure 2  olive dashed line) following the close of the IHS Markit acquisition in early 2022.Figure 2: S&P Global quarterly revenue by divisionCreated by author using publicly available financial data(Note: The company's Platts division was renamed Commodity Insights following the close of the IHS Markit acquisition. Q1 and Q2 2021 numbers were adjusted for comparability)Segment financialsHistorically  a majority of S&P Global's revenues were derived from its Ratings division. The percentage of revenues from Ratings decreased due to the IHS Markit acquisition and the slowdown in debt issuance as debt markets reacted to the Federal Reserve's rate hikes (figure 3  grey line). However  the Ratings division still accounts for almost half of total operating income (figure 4  grey line).Figure 3: S&P Global quarterly revenue mix breakdownCreated by author using publicly available financial dataFigure 4: S&P Global's quarterly operating income mix breakdownCreated by author using publicly available financial data(Note: Market Intelligence operating income for 1Q2022 excludes a $1.3 billion one-time gain for the sale of assets related to the IHS Markit acquisition)As Mobility and Engineering Solutions are small  I have mentally combined them with Commodity Insights (which I loosely call ""Platt successors"") for the ease of evaluation (figure 5).Figure 5: S&P Global quarterly revenue of the four segments as I see itCreated by author using publicly available financial dataRevenue by regionThe US accounts for about 60% of total revenues  but all the company's operating regions are growing at similar rates (figure 6).Figure 6: S&P Global quarterly revenue by regionCreated by author using publicly available financial dataEmployees by regionInterestingly  64% of all employees are based in Asia  almost three times the number in the US (figure 7). I note that several of S&P Global's overseas offices in India are located outside central business districts  particularly in Ahmedabad  Gurgaon  Hyderabad  Kolkata  Pune. This indicates to me that the company has likely offshored a substantial portion of its human capital-intensive jobs to lower-cost regions outside the US to keep employee compensation expenses down.Figure 7: S&P Global employees by regionS&P Global investor presentationInvestment thesisMy investment thesis is that S&P Global's divisions are leaders in oligopolistic industries. The company produces substantial recurring revenue  enjoys strong operating leverage  has demonstrated consistent growth  and is well positioned to leverage artificial intelligence/machine learning technologies to provide more value to its customers.Leaders in oligopolistic industriesEach of S&P Global's divisions are leading players. They have recognized and respected brand names as well as the scale that enables the divisions to have both a greater breadth of market coverage and broader distribution channels. The combination of these factors creates a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle which results in a significant competitive moat that limits new entrants and the ability of smaller players to grow market share.These businesses compete in oligopolistic industries  which should facilitate pricing stability and minimize the risk of indiscriminate price cuts even if demand weakens with a slowing economy resulting from the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.S&P Global RatingsAs I wrote in a previous article  the credit rating industry has consolidated into an oligopolistic structure. The big three - S&P Ratings  Moody's (MCO)  and Fitch - have captured a collective global market share of 95% - of which Moody's and S&P Ratings have about 40% share each  while Fitch has about 15%. To loosen their dominance  the regulators at the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) expanded the list of NRSRO (Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations) to nine firms (figure 8  click here for details on categories)  making room for smaller firms such as DBRS and Kroll Bond Rating Agency to become viable competitors in the ratings business. However  the smaller players have struggle to gain share.Figure 8: List of NRSROsSEC websiteS&P Global Market IntelligenceS&P's Market Intelligence division competes against Moody's Analytics  FactSet (FDS)  Bloomberg L.P.  as well as Refinitiv - a wholly owned subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L)  all of which provide curated data and analytics to customers seeking to grow  improve efficiency  or manage risk. It also competes against a number of smaller web-based providers of market intelligence.There are several large business information service providers that are focused on different areas and are less competitive with S&P Market Intelligence. For example  Thomson Reuters (TRI) and Wolters Kluwer (AEX:WKL) are more targeted at areas such as legal  tax  regulatory/compliance  IT  and other areas that S&P Market Intelligence has less of a presence and emphasis.S&P Global IndicesWhile the S&P 500 Index is among the widest used stock indices  S&P Global Indices also manages global  regional  sector  thematic  factor-based  ESG  and other indices (figure 8). The division's competitors include (figure 9):Figure 9: S&P Indices competitorsCompetitor Representative Products and Indices MSCI (MSCI) MSCI World Index as well as sector  country  factor  and fixed income indices Nasdaq (NASD) Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) FTSE Group / London Stock Exchange FTSE Global Total Cap Index FTSE Global All Cap Index FTSE All-World Index Nikkei Shimbun Nikkei 225 Index Deutsche Börse Group Euro STOXX 50 Euro STOXX 600 Russell Indexes Russell 3000 Russell 1000 Cboe (CBOE) CBOE Volatility Index Value Line (VALU) Value Line Composite Index Wilshire Associates Wilshire 5000 Wilshire 4500 Euronext (formerly Paris Bourse) CAC 40 Click to enlargeIn addition  S&P Indices also competes indirectly against asset managers and ETF providers ranging from large  diversified institutions such as BlackRock (BLK) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) to focused and niche players such as ARK Invest.Commodity Insights  Mobility  and Engineering SolutionsThese divisions compete with Verisk's (VRSK) Wood MacKenzie division  Bloomberg  Thomson-Reuters  Argus  Genscape  as well as a number of industry consulting firms.High proportion of stable recurring revenueA healthy proportion of S&P Global's revenue have recurring characteristics  which provides some stability to earnings. I categorize S&P Global's revenues into four categories (figure 10):Figure 10: Nature of S&P Global revenuesNature of revenue Sources % revenues Subscription (subject to renewals) Market Intelligence  Commodity Insight  Mobility  and Engineering subscriptions: Indices subscription: >85% of division revenues (except for mobility: ~77%) <20% of Indices revenues Performance-linked recurring Recurring variable: Asset-linked feeds: Sales usage-based royalties: Market Intelligence: based on trades  AUM  or positions valued Index royalties: Fees based on assets of underlying ETF/mutual funds Fees based on derivative index pricing data trading volumes 9% of division revenues 66% of Indices revenue relatively di minimus Non-transactional Revenues driven by customer demand Ratings surveillance & research fees Conference events  consulting & analytics 45% of Ratings revenue Non-subscription /transactional Revenues linked to transactions and exposed to exogenous factors (e.g.  interest rates) Ratings for new issuances of debt/bank loans 55% of Ratings revenue Click to enlargeSubscription revenue has almost doubled (figure 11  blue line) due to the acquisition of IHS-Markit (which has a higher percentage of subscriptions) and now constitutes about 58% of total revenues (figure 12  blue line). Performance-linked recurring revenue has also increased to about 12% of total revenues (orange lines) but non-transactional and non-subscription / transactional revenues have declined (green and red lines).Figure 11: S&P Global quarterly revenues by recurrenceCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataFigure 12: S&P Global quarterly revenues by recurrence as percentage of total revenuesCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataThe decline in non-transactional and non-subscription/transactional revenues is primarily due to weakness in the Ratings business  which has seen corporate bond and structured finance issuances plummet in Q2 2022 as higher interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve rate hikes have made debt more expensive for issuers (figure 13).Figure 13: Global corporate bond and structured finance issuancesQ2 2022 SEC 10-Q filingPowerful operating leverage and IHS Markit integration synergiesThe economic model for information service providers is very attractive as the incremental cost of providing the same or repackaged information to an additional customer is nearly zero  so the gross margin on the incremental revenue is very high. Furthermore  additional overhead needed to support the additional sale in relatively modest. As such  S&P Global has and will continue to benefit from operating leverage as its revenues grow.In the five years ended December 2021  S&P Global's operating margin expanded by 1000 basis points (bps) (figure 14  red line). Over the same period  IHS Markit's margin  while lower than S&P Global's  also trended up until it was acquired by S&P Global in January 2022 (orange line).Figure 14: S&P Global's trailing twelve-month operating margins vs peersCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataS&P Global's margin contraction of over 1300 bps since the beginning of 2022 was largely because IHS Markit's divisions  which generally had lower margins  were folded into Platts successor entities  i.e.  Commodity Insights  Mobility  and Engineering Solutions (figure 15  red line).Figure 15: S&P Global quarterly operating margins  by segmentCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataS&P Global's free cash flow (as defined by cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) has also expanded over the last five years (figure 16  red line). The jump in 2022 was a result of the cash received from the sales of assets (including CUSIP Global Services; Leveraged Commentary and Data (LCD); Coal  Metals and Mining; and PetroChem Wire and its base chemicals business) required by anti-trust regulators as a condition for their approval of the IHS-Markit acquisition. As such  it is less indicative of the company's longer term cash flow generation.Figure 16: S&P Global trailing twelve-month free cash flow margins vs peersCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataEven though S&P Global's operating margin has ticked down and there is near-term risk of further compression if revenues contract  I believe the company's operating margin is likely expand over the intermediate to long term due to three powerful factors:(1) as revenues growth  the operating leverage will drive margin upwards;(2) the ~$350 million in identified revenue synergies  of which 50% is expected to be realized by 2024; and(3) the ~$600 million in identified integration synergies representing about 10% of current run-rate operating income  of which 80% is expected to be realized by 2023.Continued revenue growthSince 2017  S&P Global's trailing twelve-month revenue  including revenues acquired through the IHS Markit acquisition  has grown by almost 70% (figure 17  green line).Figure 17: S&P Global trailing twelve-month revenues vs peersCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataThe company's fully diluted per-share revenue has decelerated due to the additional shares issued for the acquisition (figure 18  Q2  brown line).Figure 18: S&P Global quarterly per-share revenuesCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataEven though short-term revenue is likely to be impacted by a weakening economy and high interest rates  I believe long term revenues will inevitably grow as customers demand more information to make better investments and trades  compete more effective  grow revenues  and improve their supply chain and operating efficiencies.Creating more value for customers with S&P's Kensho technologyAccording to consulting firms Accenture (ACN) and Garner Group  the proportion of unstructured data  i.e.  data in all shapes and sizes  including text  images  media  sensor data and other formats that is not organized in a traditional rowithcolumn format  is estimated at about 80% or higher. These irregularities and ambiguities are difficult for traditional software applications to process.S&P Global's Kensho technology overcomes some of these challenges. Acquired in 2018  Kensho applies AI-based natural language processing to transcribe complex text documents  images  and speech  builds machine learning models to extract and classify data across the company's data lake datasets  adds structure to unstructured and semi-structured data  and helps customers transform both company-owned and third-party unstructured data into valuable and actionable business insights.In the Q1 and Q2 2022 earnings calls  management remarked that data from IHS Markit has doubled the training datasets for Kensho  and that it will be integrating the technology across the company to automate processes and increase efficiencies  particularly in its Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights divisions. For example  the company has implemented Kensho Market-On-Close to speed up price assessments in multiple different markets  customers have applied Kensho Link to create their own data maps  and over 300 000 users have used Kensho's Codex tool to extract and navigate information in Capital IQ Pro.I believe this is just the beginning of what AI and machine learning technologies can do to unlock data in S&P Global's datasets to create more value for more customers. If Kensho's technologies live up to expectations  it could be a game changer that enables S&P Global to pull ahead of its competitors.Valuation and leverageValuationS&P Global's earnings yield (the reciprocal of the price-earnings ratio  figure 19) is just under 4% and roughly in line with its closest competitors (Moody's and Verisk) and 10-year treasury yields. I note that it is understated because the numerator  Q2 2022 trailing twelve-month earnings  reflects less than 6 months of acquired IHS Markit earnings.Figure 19: S&P Global earnings yield vs peersCreated by authoring using publicly available financial and stock price dataThe company's free cash flow yield jumped in 2022 because of cash received from divestitures required by regulators for the approval of the IHS Markit acquisition (figure 20  orange line). Similarly  Verisk's free cash flow yield also grew (blue line) as a result of divestments it made to refocus on its insurance operations.Figure 20: S&P Global free cash flow yield vs peersCreated by authoring using publicly available financial and stock price dataLeverage and interest expensesAs of June 30  2022  S&P Global had $10.7 billion in long term debt outstanding  substantially all of which are locked in at highly attractive rates (figure 21). A substantial amount of the debt is due for refinancing in 2027. If rates remain high or continue to rise and the company chooses not to pay down the debt with cash flow from operations  it may have to refinance the debt at higher rates  which will cause interest expenses to rise.In 2021  the company made the wise decision to enter into a series of interest rate swaps (aggregate outstanding notional value of $1.4 billion) which mitigates this refinancing risk.Figure 21: Debt outstanding as of June 30  2022Q2 2022 SEC 10-Q filingConcernsNear-term slowdown due to high interest ratesThere are downside risks to near-term revenues resulting from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation  including:Increased risk of a near-term recession that could force budget-constrained clients to cut back on Market Intelligence  Commodity Insights  Mobility  and Engineering Solutions subscriptions;Fewer bond and structured finance issuances as higher interest rates drive up the cost of debt for issuers. Figure 22 illustrates the inverse correlation between S&P Ratings revenues (orange line) and 10-year treasury rates (green dashed line);Revenues linked to assets based on S&P's market indices / benchmarks  and revenues dependent on trading volume or the number of trades could decline along with the equity/capital market valuations; andS&P Global's customer base could consolidate  leading to fewer subscriptions.Figure 22: The inverse relationship between S&P Ratings quarterly revenues and 10-year treasury ratesCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataCost inflation pressuresInflationary pressures have driven up S&P Global's costs. The company's gross margin has declined since the close of the IHS Markit acquisition (figure 23  brown bars). However  as IHS Markit's gross margins are 1500 bps lower than S&P Global's (figure 24  orange line vs red line)  it is difficult to separate the impact of IHS Markit's lower gross margins from rising costs.In mitigation  I believe information service providers have some degree of pricing power as customers are unlikely to cancel their subscriptions to important or even mission critical information and data over relatively small price increases.In any event  I will be closely watching how these variables develop over the coming quarters.Figure 23: S&P Global quarterly gross profit marginsCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataFigure 24: S&P Global vs IHS Markit trailing twelve-month gross marginsCreated by authoring using publicly available financial dataSummary",neutral,0.14,0.85,0.01,negative,0.01,0.27,0.72,True,English,"['S&P Global', 'Reliable Long-Term Grower', 'Additional Upside', 'AI-Created Value', 'Customers', 'S&P Global quarterly revenue mix breakdown', 'quarterly operating income mix breakdown', 'S&P Global investor presentation', 'S&P Dow Jones Indices', 'S&P Global Market Intelligence', 'S&P Global Commodity Insights', 'S&P Global Engineering Solutions', 'S&P Global umbrella', 'Dow Jones Industrial Index', 'other fixed income investments', 'S&P Global Mobility', 'full automotive value chain', 'Market Intelligence operating income', 'S&P Global Ratings', 'S&P Global employees', 'other market participants information', 'S&P 500 index', 'other thematic indices', 'total operating income', 'six operating divisions', 'IHS Markit Ltd', 'new innovative products', 'OEM vehicle manufacturers', 'related technical knowledge', '$1.3 billion one-time gain', 'central business districts', 'human capital-intensive jobs', 'employee compensation expenses', 'commodity market clients', 'mobility service providers', 'IHS Markit acquisition', 'capital market clients', 'major asset managers', 'olive dashed line', 'several tools investors', 'necessary trading data', 'multi-asset class data', 'information services industry', 'global provider', 'market evaluations', 'information solutions', 'operating regions', 'automotive suppliers', 'trading firms', 'desktop services', 'wealth managers', 'engineering standards', 'index benchmarks', 'commodity markets', 'grey line', 'financial data', 'independent ratings', 'investment banks', 'commercial banks', 'insurance companies', 'credit ratings', 'analytical capabilities', 'government agencies', 'competitive dynamics', 'world markets', 'wide variety', 'investment advisors', 'Q2 2021 numbers', 'debt issuance', 'debt markets', 'Federal Reserve', 'rate hikes', 'four segments', 'similar rates', 'overseas offices', 'substantial portion', 'lower-cost regions', 'Investment thesis', 'total revenues', 'institutional investors', 'leading provider', 'independent provider', 'iconic brands', 'energy markets', 'Segment financials', 'Ratings division', 'cross-asset analytics', 'The US', 'Platts division', 'transparent benchmarks', 'SeanShot', 'Overview', 'NYSE', 'SPGI', 'exchanges', 'issuers', 'producers', 'traders', 'intermediaries', 'petrochemicals', 'metals', 'agriculture', 'February', 'scope', 'offerings', 'transportation', 'company', 'portfolio', 'figure', 'research', 'decisions', 'purchasing', 'bonds', 'corporations', 'universities', 'investing', 'addition', 'sector', 'ESG', 'dividend-oriented', 'cryptocurrency', 'factor', 'based', 'retailers', 'consumers', 'finance', 'close', 'early 2022', 'author', 'Note', 'Q1', 'comparability', 'majority', 'percentage', 'slowdown', 'half', '1Q2022', 'sale', 'assets', 'ease', 'Asia', 'India', 'Ahmedabad', 'Gurgaon', 'Hyderabad', 'Kolkata', 'Pune.']",2022-10-03,2022-10-03,seekingalpha.com

Oct. 3  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Eurofins Viracor  a leader in infectious disease and immunology testing  launches EBV inSIGHT™  a functional T Cell test to measure CD4 and CD8 Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cell immune response. The test joins the innovative inSIGHT diagnostic portfolio of virus-specific cell mediated immunity tests offered by Viracor.EBV is a common risk factor for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in patients following solid organ transplant (SOT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). PTLD can arise due to immunosuppression and the loss of T cells that typically control EBV reactivation.The test targets EBV cell lysate  BZLF1 (lytic phase)  and EBNA3 (latent phase) antigens; reporting Interferon-γ (IFN-gamma)  as well as polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells. The presence of virus specific polyfunctional T cells has been found to be an indicator of highly functional T cell response. Research has shown patients with PTLD have shown impaired function and a low proportion of polyfunctional T Cells.1 Additionally  in the case of EBV induced PTLD  research has also found that highly functional EBV Specific CD8 T Cells are required to control an infection.2Quantitative EBV DNA PCR can also be used to monitor the course of the disease  aid in the early diagnosis of PTLD  and monitor response to treatment.To learn more  please visit: https://www.eurofins-viracor.com/clinical/test-menu/33217-ebv-insight-t-cell-immunity/1.

The review of the profitability perspectives for our ready-to-use fresh food business in North America  which is weighing on the group's performance in the short term  and which is also linked to this environment  does not call into question the relevance of this acquisition  which is perfectly aligned with our mission ""to inspire the transition toward a plant-based diet to contribute to people’s well-being and planet health."" This mission is based on a strategy of strong brands  again experiencing growth during the financial year  and on a financial situation strengthened by the capital opening of the long life business (canned and frozen) in North America. Given this environment  the group is embarking on the 2022-2023 financial year with appropriate caution while continuing its transformation.""RevenueAt € 2 891.7 million  the group's revenue (excluding the effect of IFRS 5)  including the long life business activities in North America  increased by +1.8% on a like for like basis(1) and +4.1% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) over FY 2021-2022 (July 1  2021 - June 30  2022).Currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of +2.3% on the group's growth this year  notably with a significant appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars.Adjusted by IFRS 5  revenue amounted to 2 202.6 million euro  compared with 2 163.6 million euro last financial year.Activity by Geographic RegionTotal consolidated revenue(in € million)2021-2022Excluding IFRS 5 - not restated for divested activities 2021-2022 2020-2021 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Europe Zone 1 357.3 1 357.3 1 271.7 6.7% 6.9% Non-Europe Zone 845.3 1 534.4 1 506.9 1.8% -2.4% Total 2 202.6 2 891.7 2 778.6 4.1% 1.8%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated revenue(in € million)Total consolidated revenue(in € million) 2021-2022Excluding IFRS 5 - not restated for divested activities 2021-2022 2020-2021 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Canned 958.4 1 149.3 1 087.7 5.7% 4.4% Frozen 238.4 736.6 655.1 12.4% 8.8% Fresh processed 1 005.9 1 005.9 1 035.8 -2.9% -5.3% Total 2 202.6 2 891.7 2 778.6 4.1% 1.8%Europe ZoneThe revenue for the Europe Zone  representing 46.9% of the business activity in FY 2021-2022 (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) posted a high growth rate of +6.7% on reported figures and +6.9% on a like for like basis(1)  growth recorded in all technologies. Branded sales grew by circa +4.-% in the retail sector  resulting  in particular for Cassegrain  in market share gains in both volume and value  in line with the group's strategy. Food service business  mainly frozen and fresh  grew by more than 30%  exceeding the market's recovery rate  resulting in a return to a level of activity close to that of the pre-covid period.Non-Europe ZoneRevenue (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) for the non-Europe Zone in FY 2021-2022  including the canned and frozen activities in North America  represented 53.1% of total revenue  down -2.4% on a like for like(1) and up +1.8% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5).In North America  the long life activities (canned and frozen)  partially divested on June 30  2022  posted solid growth over the financial year as a whole  driven  as in Europe  by the strong growth in the food service business in both Canada and the United States along with the resilience of the retail sector despite its normalization following the Covid 19 sanitary crisis.The ready-to-use fresh activities of the Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit declined significantly over the financial year. This decline is explained by significant price increases aimed at preserving margins in a particularly inflationary environment  a less dynamic market  and the cessation of sales of non-contributing ranges to certain clients  which was not offset by new contract wins.In Eurasia  the brands (Bonduelle and Globus) posted growth over the financial year as a whole  despite a Q4 marked by geopolitical tensions and their impacts on consumption and inflation.Operating Profitability(in € million)2021-2022Excluding IFRS 5 - not restated for divested activities 2021-2022 2020-2021 VariationReported figures VariationLike for like basis(1) Revenue 2 202.6 2 891.7 2 778.6 +4.1% +1.8% Current operating profitability 52.8 96.6 100.4 -3.7% -4.-% Current operating margin rate 2.4% 3.3% 3.6% -27 bps -21 bpsFor FY 2021-2022  the Bonduelle Group's current operating profitability stands at € 96 6 million at constant exchange rate compared to € 100.4 last financial year  i.e.  a current operating margin of 3.3% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) and 3.4% on a like-for-like basis(1).Adjusted by IFRS 5 and the partial disposal of the long life business activities in North America (BALL)  the current operating result amounts to € 52.8 million compared to € 55.2 million last financial year.The group had to face a multiplication of adverse factors during the financial year: the continuing sanitary crisis  unfavorable weather conditions impacting agricultural crops and industrial performance  the first wave of inflation emphasized by the geopolitical context and the disorganization of supply chains.In addition  and in relation to some of these factors  the fresh ready-to-use business in North America continued to weigh on the group's performance  which could not be fully offset by the improved performance of the other canned and frozen operating segments in Europe  North America  and Eastern Europe.While lower than the guidance set at the beginning of the year  this current operating profitability demonstrates the group's resilience  its control of overheads  its operating efficiency  and its pricing power  with price increases negotiated to offset cost increases.Non-recurring items for the financial year amount to € 23.7 million (excl. IFRS 5).The main components are on the one hand an income of € 144.7 million relating to the accounting capital gain on the disposal of the canned and frozen food activities in North America  on the other hand an expense of € 107.- million relating to an impairment of tangible and intangible assets (goodwill and industrial assets) linked to a review of the profitability forecasts for the ready-to-use fresh food business activity in North America  as well as the various costs linked to organizational changes and the closure of activities.After taking this non-recurring income into account  the Bonduelle Group's operating income (excl. IFRS 5) amounts to € 120.3 million  compared with € 97.2 million the previous financial year.Net ResultThe net financial expense (excl. IFRS 5) stands at € -17.6 million against € -17.3 million last financial year  recording a stable borrowing cost and a positive exchange rate result. The average interest rate relating to the cost of financial debt stands at 1.61% compared to 1.79% a year earlier  as the group benefited from particularly attractive financing conditions on the commercial paper market (NeuCP).The result of the equity method shows an expense of € -5.2 million (against € -0.6 million in the previous year) relating to the results and depreciation of certain investments in start-ups as well as the costs of acquiring the minority stake in the new group of long life business activities in North America resulting from the partial disposal on June 30  2022.Excluding IFRS 5  the income tax expense stands at € 62.1 million against € 22.2 million last financial year and represents an effective tax rate of 60.4% taking into account on the one hand the taxation of the capital gain on the sale of the long life business activities in North America at a reduced rate and  on the other hand  in accordance with the revised profitability forecast for the ready-to-use fresh food business in North America  an impairment of deferred taxes for an amount of € 29.9 million. After considering the tax charge and the financial income  the Bonduelle Group's net income for FY 2021-2022 stands at € 35.4 million compared with € 57.1 million  last financial year  or 1.2% of turnover (excluding the IFRS 5 effect). The implementation of the IFRS 5 standard has no impact on the net result.Financial SituationJune 30  2020 Reported figures June 30  2020 Excl.

Once IFRS 16 standard is taken into account  the group's debt stands at € 362.9 million and debt leverage(3) at 1.72 based on the same recurring EBITDA excluding the IFRS 5 effect.HighlightsStatus of the fresh ready-to-use business activity in North AmericaAs announced on July 11  2022  the difficulties encountered by the ready-to-use fresh business operating segment in North America have led the group to review the profitability perspective of this business. The in-depth analysis of the market and the margins of the various product lines led the group to recognize  on the basis of future cash flows  an impairment of intangible assets (goodwill) and underperforming industrial assets  as well as the non-recognition of deferred tax assets for an amount of € 136.9 million on June 30  2022.Bonduelle announces the capital opening of Bonduelle Americas Long Life to the Fonds de solidarité FTQ and CDPQOn June 30  2022  the Bonduelle Group obtained the approval from U.S and Canadian regulatory authorities and the waiver of conditions precedent allowing it to finalize the agreement with the institutional investors Fonds de solidarité FTQ and CDPQ  for the acquisition  in equal shares between them  of 65% of Bonduelle Americas Long Life (BALL) and on the basis of an enterprise value at 100% of C$ 850 million (approximately € 625 million)  or an EBITDA multiple for 2020-2021 of 8.2x.With a revenue of C$ 989 million for financial year 2021-2022  this business activity is dedicated to the processing and marketing of canned and frozen vegetables in the United States and Canada  in the retail supermarket and food service sectors  with private labels  third party brands and own brands such as Arctic Gardens and Del Monte. This operation enables the group to continue to deploy its activities  particularly in brands  in line with its strategic priorities and its ambition of sustainable growth with positive impact.Bonduelle recorded in the income statement  on the line “Income from discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS 5  the capital gain of this transaction amounting to a net amount of € 132.4 million (after disposal costs and taxes)  equal to the difference between the fair value of the de-consolidated assets and their book value at that date. The assets and liabilities of these companies were de-consolidated and Bonduelle recognized the fair value of 35% of the retained interest in these entities  now called Nortera Foods  amounting to € 84 million  as an asset in the balance sheet under equity interests.Bonduelle's business activities in Ukraine and RussiaIn accordance with its press release of March 17  2022  the Bonduelle Group has suspended all development investment projects in Russia at this point and has decided to dedicate all profits made since February 24  2022  and during the financial year from Russian sales to the future reconstruction of Ukraine  its infrastructure  and its agricultural and food ecosystems. The amount of net profit  resulting from the sales made in Russia from February 24  2022  to June 30  2022  as determined by the Board of Directors  is € 1.2 million. As the method of reinvestment of this amount has not yet been identified  no impact has been recorded in the financial statements for 2021-2022.In Ukraine  which represents a limited part of the group's revenue  and which has no industrial presence  commercial activity is gradually resuming after several weeks of interruption.OutlooksBased on the new scope  now excluding long life activities in North America  and given a particularly uncertain and volatile environment  the Bonduelle Group is targeting  at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation  a revenue growth  integrating price increases aimed at offsetting cost inflation  from 8 to 11% and a current operating margin stable at 2.5%  representing an increase in current operating profitability close to 15%.The General Management will propose at the Annual General Meeting of December 1  2022 the payment of a dividend of €0.30 per share.(1) at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows:For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.In the specific case of the 2021-2022 financial year  the items relating to the North American canned and frozen activities divested on June 30  2022 are included for the full financial year.(2) net financial debt / equity(3) net financial debt / recurring EBITDAAlternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

The transaction concluded through the comp…","SUGAR LAND  Texas  Oct. 3  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Noble Corporation plc (""Noble"") today announced that the business combination with The Drilling Company of 1972 A/S (""Maersk Drilling"") has been successfully completed. The transaction concluded through the completion of Noble's recommended voluntary public share exchange offer to the shareholders of Maersk Drilling. The companies are now operating as a single organization as of October 3  2022.Noble's President and Chief Executive Officer  Robert Eifler  commented ""Today marks an exciting new chapter as we bring together these two exceptional companies. The fundamental industrial logic of the combination is clear and has only grown stronger over the past year  driven by steady improvements in the offshore drilling market and a deeper appreciation of the immense talent across this newly combined team. I'd personally like to thank the employees of both companies for their sustained focus on safety  integrity  and service as we have worked through this demanding transaction process. I look forward to supporting this team through a rapid integration as we aim to position Noble as a new and dynamic leader in offshore drilling.""Charles M. (Chuck) Sledge  Noble's Chairman of the Board of Directors  added: ""Today's combination of Noble and Maersk Drilling represents a defining moment in the history of offshore drilling. We are excited to join forces with Maersk Drilling's talented team and embark on this journey together as a combined company. I am confident that Noble is now better positioned to deliver enhanced value to all our customers and shareholders.""Consistent with the strategic rationale described in the merger announcement  the combination creates significant operational and financial opportunities for Noble's customers  shareholders  and employees through:A World Class Fleet – among the youngest and highest specification fleets in the industry  with global scale and diversification and a combined track record of industry-leading utilization.Enhanced Customer Experience – uniting two complementary cultures that are focused on best-in-class safety and customer satisfaction as well as a commitment to being an industry leader around sustainability and innovation.Highly Attractive Financial Characteristics – supported by contract backlog (as of October 3  2022 ) of over $4 billion and a conservative balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity  Noble is set up to be a strong platform for cash flow generation and distribution potential.Significant Accretion from Scale and Synergies – annual cost synergies of at least $125 million   which are expected to be realized within two years after closing  with Noble's cost-competitiveness meaningfully enhanced via scale.Noble has received preliminary commitments from a group of banks to enter into a $350 million  3-year term loan to replace the existing Maersk Drilling syndicated facilities. Additionally  Noble has received a preliminary commitment for a $150 million  3-year term loan to replace the existing Maersk Drilling loan with Danish Ship Finance. Each loan has an indicative initial interest rate of Term SOFR plus 3.50% with margin increases beginning in year two. The loans remain subject to final documentation and customary closing conditions  which Noble anticipates will be completed during the fourth quarter.Noble expects to close the previously announced sale of five jackup rigs (Noble Hans Deul  Noble Sam Hartley  Noble Sam Turner  Noble Houston Colbert  and Noble Lloyd Noble  together the ""Remedy Rigs"") to Shelf Drilling Ltd. on October 5th for cash proceeds of $375 million.Additionally  results from the exchange offer for Maersk Drilling shares show a strong preference for settlement in Noble shares rather than cash  with less than $2 million estimated cash required at settlement relative to the $50 million maximum cash settlement amount. Separately  the cash versus shares settlement split pertaining to the compulsory purchase (""squeeze-out"") of the 9.97% minority of Maersk Drilling shareholders that did not tender their shares in the exchange offer will be known upon completion of the squeeze-out in mid-November 2022 (as further set out below).Based on the closing of the business combination  investors should not rely on Noble's previously issued financial guidance for 2022  which is no longer applicable on a combined company basis. Noble will update the market with refreshed financial guidance in the near future.Concurrent with today's closing announcement  Noble has published an updated fleet status report that can be found at www.noblecorp.com.THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS REGULATORY AND STOCK EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTSReference is made to the voluntary public share exchange offer by Noble to the shareholders of Maersk Drilling to acquire the entire share capital in Maersk Drilling (excluding any treasury shares) in connection with the business combination between Noble Corporation and Maersk Drilling (the ""Business Combination"") as announced on August 8  2022 (the ""Exchange Offer""). The Exchange Offer was made pursuant to the business combination agreement (the ""Business Combination Agreement"") to combine Noble Corporation and Maersk Drilling  which was announced on November 10  2021.Admission to trading and official listing of the Noble Shares on Nasdaq CopenhagenOn September 8  2022  Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S (""Nasdaq Copenhagen"") provided their conditional approval for the admission to trading and official listing of Noble Shares (in the form of share entitlements) on Nasdaq Copenhagen under the symbol ""NOBLE"".

Further  Noble issued 14 539 883 warrants (""Noble Warrants) to former holders of warrants exercisable for shares in Noble Corporation in connection with the closing of the Cayman Merger. Additional information about the Noble Warrants may be found on Noble's website at www.noblecorp.com.In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer  Noble has issued 60 137 000 Noble Shares to the former holders of Maersk Drilling shares or Acceptance Shares  as applicable (such number of Noble Shares not adjusted for cash settlement of fractional shares  which will result in a minor capital decrease post-completion)  and delivered DKK 5 292 351 to Maersk Drilling shareholders who elected to receive exchange offer consideration in cash (plus additional cash paid in connection with the settlement of any fractional entitlements to Noble Shares). As a result of the completion of the Exchange Offer and the issuance of Noble Shares  there are 130 490 759 Noble Shares issued and outstanding and 14 539 883 Noble Warrants outstanding as of this date.Initiation of compulsory purchase and delisting of Maersk DrillingAs acceptances representing more than 90% of the outstanding share capital and voting rights in Maersk Drilling have been obtained by Noble in the Exchange Offer  Noble has decided to exercise its rights under the Danish Companies Act to conduct a compulsory purchase of the Maersk Drilling shares held by the remaining minority shareholders of Maersk Drilling.Further  Maersk Drilling has submitted an application to Nasdaq Copenhagen for the removal from trading and official listing of all Maersk Drilling shares from Nasdaq Copenhagen. On September 23  2022  Nasdaq Copenhagen approved this request  as a result of which the delisting will be effective from October 4  2022  and the last day of trading and official listing for Maersk Drilling Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen will be on October 3  2022. Maersk Drilling shareholders who have not accepted the Exchange Offer will not be able to trade the shares in Maersk Drilling on Nasdaq Copenhagen after October 3  2022 but will instead have their shares purchased in connection with the compulsory purchase conducted by Topco in accordance with sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act.The compulsory purchase conducted by Topco in accordance with sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act will be initiated on October 4  2022. As a result of the compulsory purchase  all remaining Maersk Drilling shareholders  who have not accepted the Exchange Offer and have not sold their Maersk Drilling shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen prior to the delisting becoming effective  will be requested to transfer their Maersk Drilling shares to Noble within the four week compulsory purchase period beginning on Tuesday  October 4  2022 and ending on Wednesday  November 2  2022 at 23:59 CET in accordance with section 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act. Such Maersk Drilling shareholders can elect to exchange their Maersk Drilling shares for a number of Noble Shares equal to the share consideration offered to Maersk Drilling shareholders who have accepted the Exchange Offer  or alternatively  a full cash alternative  which will amount to DKK 340.98 (USD 46.79) per Maersk Drilling share.If a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects to exchange its shares in Maersk Drilling for Noble Shares  then such shareholder will initially receive acceptance shares (the ""Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares""). Such Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares will not be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen and will therefore not be tradeable on Nasdaq Copenhagen. The Compulsory Purchase Acceptance Shares received in connection with the compulsory purchase are expected to be exchanged for Noble Shares (in the form of share entitlements) on or around November 11  2022.If a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects to receive the full cash alternative  then such shareholder will receive the full cash alternative for the compulsory purchase of their Maersk Drilling shares expectedly on or around November 11  2022  and the ownership of such Maersk Drilling shares held by minority shareholders will be concurrently transferred to Noble.Any remaining Maersk Drilling shareholders who have not voluntarily accepted to transfer their Maersk Drilling shares to Noble prior to the expiry of the four week period ending on Wednesday  November 2  2022  will automatically receive the full cash alternative for the compulsory purchase of their Maersk Drilling Shares expectedly on or around November 14  2022.Separate press releases and announcements in the IT system of the Danish Business Authority will be made by Noble when the compulsory purchase has been resolved in accordance with the relevant provisions set out in sections 70-72 of the Danish Companies Act.According to the Danish Tax Authority  if a Maersk Drilling shareholder elects the share-for-share exchange  then for Danish tax purposes the sales price of the Maersk Drilling shares shall be determined on the basis of the closing price of the Noble shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen the day when the respective Maersk Drilling shareholder informs the Danish Tax Authority of the election to exchange the Maersk Drilling Shares to Noble Shares. The tax disposal date is therefore prior to the date on which the Noble shares are delivered and are available for trading (which is expected to be on or around November 11  2022). For Danish tax purposes  the sales price of the Maersk Drilling shares which are purchased for cash in connection with the compulsory purchase  is the received cash amount (i.e. DKK 340.98 for each Maersk Drilling shares).Assumption of Maersk Drilling RSUs and adoption of long-term incentive programsFor purposes of assuming the RSUs (as defined herein) in Maersk Drilling currently held by the executive officers and key employees of Maersk Drilling  Noble today announces the approval and adoption of (i) the RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Executive Management 2022 (the ""Executive RSU Plan"") and (ii) the RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Key Employees 2022 (the ""Key Employee RSU Plan"" and  together with the Executive RSU Plan  the ""RSU Plans"").Under the RSU Plans  the participants will be eligible to receive a number of restricted share units (""RSUs""). Under the RSU Plans  the executive officers may also be eligible to receive performance-based restricted share units (""PSUs""). The participants will be granted RSUs free of charge under the RSU Plans. Grants of RSUs may take place on a revolving basis and neither grant nor vesting of RSUs depend on the achievement of specific goals. The vesting period for the RSUs is three years from the date of grant  subject to the participant's continued employment with the Noble group. Upon vesting  the participants will receive free of charge a number of Noble Shares equal to the number of RSUs vested to the extent they have not lapsed. In case of a participant's resignation during the vesting period  non-vested RSUs will lapse. In addition  the participants may be subject to ownership requirements pursuant to their individual employment agreements.On October 3  2022  in connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer and the Business Combination  the Noble board of directors adopted a resolution  whereby each RSU in Maersk Drilling granted under the Maersk Drilling RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Executive Management 2019 and the Maersk Drilling RSU Long-Term Incentive Program for Key Employees (the ""Maersk Drilling RSU Plans"") shall be assumed by Noble under the corresponding RSU Plans and be converted into an RSU  on substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) as applicable to the original RSUs in Maersk Drilling prior to the closing of the Business Combination  representing the right to receive Noble Shares (collectively  the ""Converted Executive RSUs"").Vesting for Converted Executive RSUs will accelerate for Maersk Drilling executive management and certain other employees of Maersk Drilling who are party to agreements that provide for enhanced severance protections in the event of termination of employment following the Business Combination.About Noble CorporationNoble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry.

With a total investment from Deezer of around $7M[1] this year  Driift has secured enough funds to execute on its business plan and accelerate growth.(Photo : Wunmi Onibudo/ Deezer)READ ALSO: Deezer Announces Return of Amsterdam Dance Event ChannelJeronimo Folgueira  CEO of Deezer said  ""As the home of music  this is a milestone moment for Deezer. Connecting artists and fans through engaging experiences is an essential part of our growth strategy  and adding livestreaming capabilities to our portfolio is a key component to deliver on this ambition. Driift has already built an unparalleled reputation for bringing groundbreaking livestreams to music fans all over the world  and we consider that the addition of Dreamstage's tech and sales platform will take the business to the next level. We have full confidence in the Driift team to deliver fantastic results.""Investing in both businesses in 2021 and 2022  Deezer remained a minority shareholder in Driift  and became a majority shareholder in Dreamstage  before the transaction. As a result of the business combination and its additional investment  Deezer will become the largest shareholder of Driift.Founded in August 2020 by Ric Salmon and Brian Message of ATC Management  Driift has delivered a succession of premium quality livestreamed events for some of the world's biggest artists and performers  collaborating with multiple creative and distribution partners  and winning major awards including a BAFTA for ""Glastonbury Festival: Live at Worthy Farms"" produced in cooperation with BBC Studios.In May 2022  Dreamstage provided the platform for Driift's hugely successful global livestream for Little Mix from London's O2 Arena  facilitating sales of over 85 000 tickets worldwide  showcasing strong synergies between both businesses.Ric Salmon  CEO Driift said  ""This is an exciting new chapter for Driift. Over the past two years we have become genuine pioneers in the livestreaming space. We've collaborated with certain of the world's most talented artists  filmmakers and creators to deliver online events that have been part of the latest redefinition of the livestreaming format. Our team has shown a proven ability to innovate  selling hundreds of thousands of tickets and generating millions of dollars in revenues already"".""Through Deezer's investment  we are confident that our upward trajectory will accelerate. We are delighted to welcome Dreamstage's hugely talented team of developers  engineers and customer service personnel into the company. We can now offer a fully integrated livestreaming solution to our partners  with production  promotion and what we see as a market-leading technology and revenue generating platform under one roof. It is a major cultural shift  and we look forward to bringing an even greater range of live experiences to truly global audiences.""The transaction reinforces Deezer's commitment to the fast-growing music livestreaming market  which shows continued growth in audience numbers and a clear willingness to pay for quality content and add-ons such as merchandising and virtual meet-and-greets. The fact that virtual concerts ticket sales are expected to generate worldwide up to $2 billion in 2022  and up to around $5 billion annually by 2028 (Source: MIDiA - Jan-2022) strengthens Deezer's positioning.Driift and Deezer would like to thank Dreamstage's founders Thomas Hesse  Scott Chasin and Jan Vogler for their work in building Dreamstage over the past years  and for contributing to the success of this transaction. Deezer would also like to thank Driift co-founders  and current co-owners ATC Management and Beggars Group  for their commitment and contribution in the merger. ATC and Beggars will remain significant shareholders in the newly merged entity  with ATC holding 2 of the 5 board seats.Following the completion of the transaction  Deezer will fully consolidate Driift's results of operations and its balance sheet.RELATED ARTICLE: Deezer Brings Back the 90s with New 'InVersions' CompilationThis article is owned by Tech TimesWritten by Jessel Thomasⓒ 2022 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Oct. 3  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Eurofins Viracor  a leader in infectious disease and immunology testing  launches EBV inSIGHT™  a functional T Cell test to measure CD4 and CD8 Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cell immune response. The test joins the innovative inSIGHT diagnostic portfolio of virus-specific cell mediated immunity tests offered by Viracor.EBV is a common risk factor for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in patients following solid organ transplant (SOT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). PTLD can arise due to immunosuppression and the loss of T cells that typically control EBV reactivation.The test targets EBV cell lysate  BZLF1 (lytic phase)  and EBNA3 (latent phase) antigens; reporting Interferon-γ (IFN-gamma)  as well as polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells. The presence of virus specific polyfunctional T cells has been found to be an indicator of highly functional T cell response. Research has shown patients with PTLD have shown impaired function and a low proportion of polyfunctional T Cells.1 Additionally  in the case of EBV induced PTLD  research has also found that highly functional EBV Specific CD8 T Cells are required to control an infection.2Quantitative EBV DNA PCR can also be used to monitor the course of the disease  aid in the early diagnosis of PTLD  and monitor response to treatment.To learn more  please visit: https://www.eurofins-viracor.com/clinical/test-menu/33217-ebv-insight-t-cell-immunity/1.

The 2022 bi-annual financial report will be available on the company's website tonight ( DMS-Imaging.com )  in the Investors area.2022 bi-annual resultsThe operation of assets contribution in the medical imaging activities of DMS Group being effective since January 1st  2022  the first semester 2022 constitutes the first semester of consolidation for the DMS Imaging company newly constituted. In the first semester 2021  no consolidated accounts had been established. The 1st semester 2021 proforma corresponds to the data of the medical imaging pole of DMS Group published in the bi-annual accounts 2021 of DMS Group.Audited data in M€IFRS standard S1 2021consolidated S1 2021proforma S1 2022consolidated Turnover - 17.9 18.2 EBITDA - 1.7 1.9 EBITDA margin (in %) - 9.7% 10.3% Recurring operating income - 0.6 0.7 Operating income - 0.6 -3.9 Group's attributable net income - 0.5 -4.0Over the 1st semester 2022  DMS Imaging reached a turnover of 18.2 M€  slightly progressing by +2% in comparison with the 1st semester 2021 proforma.In Radiology  the bi-annual turnover reached 15.3 M€ (-3%). The turnover realized in the framework of the distribution agreements (Fujifilm  Carestream and Canon) is highly increasing by +120% in France and in the United States. These commercial agreements represent for the first time over 50% of the radiology activity (53%) on a semester  against 34% last year on the same period. In Bone densitometry  the activity remains very dynamic with a growth of +38% in the 1st semester 2022  at 2.9 M€  supported by the dynamism of export sales.The bi-annual 2022 EBITDA reached 1.9 M€  representing an EBITDA margin of 10.3%. EBITDA margin proforma of the 1st semester 2021 was established at 9.7%.The improvement of the operational profitability is the result of the increase of the commercial margin rate and the effects of the costs rationalization plan implemented in early 2021. This improvement constitutes a performance all the more solid that it was performed in a context of high tensions in terms of supply  requiring more mobilization from DMS Imaging's procurement  supply chain  R&D and production teams.After considering the interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  the recurring operating income is established at 0.7 M€  representing a recurring operating margin of 3.8%.The other products and operational charges reach -4.6 M€  with no impact on the company's treasury. They are constituted (i) of a charge to provisions of 1.6 M€ for the impairment of a tax receivable deemed non-recoverable following the change of control of the company  and (ii) a purely accounting listing charge of 3.0 M€ (IFRS 2) recorded in the context of the contribution of the medical imaging division of DMS Group to DMS Imaging.After accounting of a financial result of -0.1 M€  the group's attributable net income reached -4.0 M€ during the 1st semester 2022.Balance sheet situation on June 30th  2022The operation of partial assets contribution in the medical imaging activities of DMS Group has been effective since January 1st  2022. The proforma balance sheet on December 31st  2021  presents consolidated financial information on the assets and liabilities of the medical imaging division of DMS Group as of that date.Audited consolidated data in M€IFRS standard 31/122021 30/062022 Audited consolidated data in M€ - IFRS standards 31/122021 30/062022 Non-current assets 12 3 12 1 Equity 10 8 12 2 Current assets 21 5 24 1 Financial liabilities 8 2 10 1 Including Stocks 11 6 12 5 Rental debts (IFRS 16) 5 3 5 0 Including Customers 6 5 7 9 Suppliers 6 6 7 7 Treasury 2 4 3 7 Other liabilities 5 4 4 9 Total assets 36 3 39 9 Total liabilities 36 3 39 9Non-current assets include 5.5 M€ of tangible assets and 6.4 M€ of intangible assets (including 5.9 M€ of capitalized R&D).Within current assets  stock amounted to 12.5 M€ on June 3rd  2022  essentially consisting of raw materials. The customer debt claim amounted 7.9 M€.The available treasury was 3.7 M€ on June 30th  2022.On the liabilities side  consolidated equity amounted to 12.2 M€ at the end of the first semester.Financial debts reached 10.1 M€  consisting of (i) 6.8 M€ of bank loans including 5.9 M€ of SGL (State Guaranteed Loan)  (ii) 2.0 M€ in repayable advances  and (iii) 1.3 M€ in debt to the factor.PerspectivesIn Radiology  the end of the year 2022 will be marked by many conventions and trade shows (French Days of Radiology from October 7th to 10th in Paris  Medica from November 14th to 17th in Düsseldorf (Germany)  Radiological Society of North America from November 27th to December 1st in Chicago (United States)) during which DMS Imaging and its partners Fujifilm and Carestream will multiply the presentations of their new X-ray table Platinum Néo  future key product of the company whose international deployment starts during the 2nd semester 2022.The Platinum Néo is the first solution available on the market with a ""machine intelligence"" engine to significantly optimize workflow  but also increase reliability and quality of associated diagnoses as well as the securing of the examination at the service of the patient and the medical profession.The imaging pole of the American Hospital of Paris  under the direction of Professor Sarrazin  decided to equip itself with this new X-ray table  clearly showing its ambition to continue on the way to excellence by choosing the highest technological level. The installation of the radiology room occurred during summer 2022. The national and international dimension of the American Hospital will be a first-class showcase for DMS Imaging in the framework of the international launch of the Platinum Néo.In July 2022  DMS Imaging won for 4 years  the UniHA referencing  1st French public purchaser in the health sector and 1st cooperative purchasing network for French public hospitals  for its remote-controlled radiology tables solutions. This referencing reinforce the positioning of DMS Imaging as French leader on this market segment. During the 1st semester  the remote-controlled radiology tables sold by the group in France  under the Apelem brand or through its distribution agreements  represented 26% of all tables sold on the market (source: SNITEM - French National Association for Medical Technologies and Industries).The company continues its progress in the MC2 project  aiming to develop two new high-end imaging solutions  an X-ray mobile and a C-arm for operating rooms manufactured in France  which will reinforce DMS Imaging's range of products by 2024. Consecutively to the conclusion of the strategic partnership with the company Micro-X for the supply of cold cathode X-ray tubes in April 2022  the first integration tests of this technology in the X-ray mobile are underway. This solution will be presented in 2023  during the French Days of Radiology  to be commercialized in 2024.Following the extension of the distribution agreement with Fujifilm  DMS Imaging sold its first Platinum DRF X-ray table in the area Africa - Middle East during the 3rd quarter 2022. This market  new area addressed by Fujifilm  constitutes a new growth vector for DMS Imaging.Finally  to face the difficulties in terms of supply  especially for some electronic components or parts  during the last months  DMS Imaging had to review its production schedule during summer  resulting in delivery delays in the third quarter of 2022. However  these delays do not impact the expected activity level over the exercise.In Bone densitometry  the commercial dynamic remains sustained  and the order book is at a high level for the upcoming quarters.
