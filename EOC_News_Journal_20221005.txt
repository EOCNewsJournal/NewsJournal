She joins us as we are generating exciting preclinical results for our first co-cultured candidate aimed at improving clinical responses in patients with solid tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors ” said Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “In this context  Nathalie will be instrumental in driving and expanding our scientific innovation and preclinical drug development strategy. I welcome Nathalie to the executive team and look forward to her contributions as we pursue our mission to provide the benefits of microbiome modulation to cancer patients.”MaaT Pharma has established clinical proof of concept for its high-richness  high-diversity  native  donor-derived MET-N approach  with more than 140 patients treated in Europe to date in haemato-oncology with its drug candidates MaaT013 (for the treatment of aGvHD1) and MaaT033 (for the treatment of patients receiving allo-HSCT2)  with promising safety and efficacy results.

With an exciting discovery pipeline and AI-powered engine  I am thrilled to join MaaT Pharma to guide the development of its next generation of therapies  to build the company’s momentum with the immuno-oncology program and to expand its early-stage drug development in this field.”Prior to joining MaaT Pharma  Dr. Corvaïa was the Head of Immuno-oncology Research at The Pierre Fabre Immunology Center (CIPF) in France where she was responsible for the institute’s research activities in immuno-oncology from early-stage product discovery to Phase 1 entry  including GMP production of its products including biologics and live products.

The Odd-lot Offer facilitated the disposal by Eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium  without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active Shareholders the ability to opt-out of such a disposal. The Odd-lot Offer is to the benefit of shareholders as a whole as it will lower the Company’s cost base. Following the implementation of the Odd-lot Offer  the number of certificated shareholders has been reduced by approximately 81.37 per cent. (3 114 shareholders).As set out in the announcement made on 24 August 2022  the purchase price of £4.82 per share represents a 5 per cent. premium to the volume weighted average price of Kenmare ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange over the five trading days prior to 24 August 2022.Eligible Odd-lot Holders who have validly elected to sell their Odd-lots will receive their payment by cheque. Shareholders with a registered address in Ireland will be paid in euros by cheque and shareholders with a registered address in the United Kingdom will be paid in sterling (GBP) by cheque.It is expected that cheques will be despatched no later than 17 October 2022  at the risk of the relevant Odd-lot Holder.Story continuesThe shares purchased by the Company represent approximately 0.097 per cent. of the existing issued share capital of the Company and will be cancelled. Following this cancellation  the Company’s issued ordinary share capital will be 94 829 551 Ordinary Shares and the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 94 829 551.

The Outlook on the rating is Stable.Fitch sees the statement by VGP and Allianz  as issued last Friday  in relation to the postponement of the seed portfolio closing for the Europa joint venture as a market-induced pause  not cessation of JV transfers.VGP has adequate liquidity to fund 2H22 and FY23 committed capex (much of it pre-let) even if monetisation of assets to JVs are postponed. The pro forma €730 million end-1H22 cash includes the €1 billion of bond proceeds raised in January 2022 (at a blended 2% fixed coupon) and the completed JV closures in 1H22 and July 2022. Additionally  VGP is expected to receive the Munich JV minimum proceeds of €73 million in 2H22 and other sources. This compares to committed capex of around €500 million to be spent and €150 million of debt maturing until end-June 2023.In its rating affirmation of September 2022  Fitch had calculated that despite an assumed 12% decline in valuations of VGP’s development programme assets  when they are transferred to the JVs  the disposal proceeds would adequately cover VGP’s build-to-cost capital outlay. Furthermore  those assets are income-producing (around 90% pre-let) which supports values.Fitch’s analytical approach of ‘VGP as HoldCo’ simulates a scenario of no further transfersto the JVs  effectively leading to VGP funding development and completed assets on its balance sheet. If we assume no further transfers in 2023 and 2024 in Fitch’s updated rating case  ‘VGP as HoldCo’ metrics remain consistent within Fitch’s rating sensitivities for upgrade and downgrade. This is because the size of the current land bank is not anonerous capital outlay and  as per company policy  completed assets are substantially income-producing.Story continuesFor further details please refer to the Fitch corresponding press release on the rating agency website: https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/vgp-announcement-reflects-property-valuation-uncertainties-03-10-2022 .CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing) Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

The 2022 Thales Consumer Digital Trust Index: A Consumer Confidence in Data Security Report  conducted by Op…,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New research from Thales has revealed that there is a lack of consumer trust across industries to protect their personal data. The 2022 Thales Consumer Digital Trust Index: A Consumer Confidence in Data Security Report  conducted by Opinium  and in partnership with the University of Warwick  found that Social Media companies (18%)  Government (14%) and Media & Entertainment organisations (12%) all had the lowest level of consumer trust when it comes to keeping their personal data secure.In contrast  the research found that Banking & Finance (42%)  Healthcare Providers (37%) and Consumer Technology Companies (32%) were the most trusted industries by consumers to protect their sensitive information. Based on a survey of more than 21 000 consumers worldwide  the report highlights how global citizens react to data exposures – both in personal behaviours and in attitudes towards companies that experienced a data breach  and the levels of trust they place across a wide range of industries as well as governments.There were also significant differences between the levels of trust consumers have across countries when it comes to the security of their personal data. Consumers across Germany (23%)  Australia  the UK and France (20%) were the least trusting nations when it comes to the protection of personal data and digital services. In comparison  consumers across Brazil (95%)  Mexico (92%) and UAE (91%)  reported the highest levels of trust. These differences in trust among countries are likely the result of the data protection regulations  such as GDPR  that generate a broader awareness of the right to privacy and lack of trust.Consumers feel the impactThe report found the vast majority (82%) of consumers worldwide reported a negative impact on their lives following a data breach. Fraudulent use of their financial information (31%)  fraudulent use of their Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (25%) and targeted for tailored scams based on their information (25%) being the main impacts. Interestingly  financial fraud was reported the highest across each country  with the only exception being:Germany (PII fraud: 31%)Japan (identity theft: 30%)UK (tailored scams: 25%)Consumers protecting themselvesWhen it comes to protecting themselves  a fifth (21%) of consumers worldwide have stopped using a company that have suffered a data breach. In fact  one in ten (8%) have taken legal action against a company  with a similar figure (9%) considering it.Furthermore  Banking & Financial Services are where the majority of consumers (69%) are likely to spend most of their time adding additional security measures to protect and secure the personal data they store with them. This is followed by securing email communication (54%)  social media (48%) and online shopping or ecommerce (44%). Only a third (33%) of consumers spend time implementing additional security measures in healthcare and only a quarter (24%) implement it for travel-related industries.Carsten Maple  Professor of Cyber Systems Engineering  WMG and the University of Warwick  comments: “Data breaches are so commonplace now  it is interesting and important to ascertain what consumers feel about this issue  which sectors they trust and what they feel needs to be done. This report provides new insights into these issues  highlighting that there is a lack of trust in social media companies protecting consumer data  which might be expected. However  there is also strong distrust in governments protecting data. What's more  it shows that a significant number of those that have suffered a breach have taken clear action  including withdrawing from the service or taking legal action.”Actions speak louder than wordsWhen it comes to what should happen to organisations that suffer a data breach  consumers across the world agree that better data security measures  such as encryption and user authentication protocols  should be implemented. More than half (54%) believe this should be mandatory. This was closely followed by  compensating victims (53%)  employing specialists to ensure it doesn’t happen again  (46%)  being responsible for finding victims data and having it returned (43%)  following more stringent regulation (42%).Of interest to regulators  is that the lowest priority from consumers to take action against those companies that had a data breach was for them to receive large fines  with just above three in 10 (31%) believing that this should be done.Philippe Vallée  Thales’ Executive Vice-President  Digital Identity and Security  comments: “Consumers around the world have shown how important security is to them when it comes to digital services and their personal data. Whilst many would assume that compensation would come out top of the agenda  it is the protection of the system and future users that came out on top. What’s more  almost twice as many consumers wanted to ensure that the risks of future data breaches were mitigated by implementing better encryption and authentication protocols than receiving large fines  which indicates that they want to see real tangible change when it comes to security practices used.“It’s clear that there is growing acceptance amongst consumers that there is risk and reward to their own cybersecurity; putting more time and emphasis on securing those parts of their online lives that mean the most to them. However  with data continually becoming more valuable  this should serve as only a lesson to those across other industries in practicing best practice and implementing good cyber hygiene.”About the 2022 Thales Consumer Digital Trust IndexThe 2022 Thales Consumer Digital Trust Index was based on a global Opinium survey commissioned by Thales of more than 21 000 consumers.

The Odd-lot Offer facilitated the disposal by Eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium  without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active Shareholders the ability to opt-out of such a disposal. The Odd-lot Offer is to the benefit of shareholders as a whole as it will lower the Company’s cost base. Following the implementation of the Odd-lot Offer  the number of certificated shareholders has been reduced by approximately 81.37 per cent. (3 114 shareholders).As set out in the announcement made on 24 August 2022  the purchase price of £4.82 per share represents a 5 per cent. premium to the volume weighted average price of Kenmare ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange over the five trading days prior to 24 August 2022.Eligible Odd-lot Holders who have validly elected to sell their Odd-lots will receive their payment by cheque. Shareholders with a registered address in Ireland will be paid in euros by cheque and shareholders with a registered address in the United Kingdom will be paid in sterling (GBP) by cheque.It is expected that cheques will be despatched no later than 17 October 2022  at the risk of the relevant Odd-lot Holder.The shares purchased by the Company represent approximately 0.097 per cent. of the existing issued share capital of the Company and will be cancelled. Following this cancellation  the Company’s issued ordinary share capital will be 94 829 551 Ordinary Shares and the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 94 829 551.

They share their journey from Adrian’s first farm in South Africa to becoming international ambassadors for the preservation of wildlife  establishing the Community Conservation Fund Africa (CCFA) and working with Bear Grylls. They discuss their belief that as eco-tourism becomes more important than ever it is important to integrate communities and spearhead education and awareness programs in order to raise awareness and appreciation of our precious planet and precarious ecologies.Mantis is a leading conservation-focused hotel group with curated hotels  eco-lodges and waterways experiences located all over the world. Rooted in conservation  Mantis has been offering eco-tourism  safaris and adventure travel for more than 20 years. Its founder  Adrian Gardiner  has created a global travel and tourism business which all grew from his first farm near Port Elizabeth in 1992. “Before I knew it  I had something like 25 000 acres  11 000 hectares ” he recalls. ”I realized is that I could put back what was traditionally there  and that was the big five - lion  leopard  black rhinoceros  African bush elephant  and the African buffalo. We were rewilding and bringing back what had existed there  and this rewilding was deeply important to us. At the time the area was malaria free  so we became one of the first game experiences in Southern Africa without having to take Malaria pills. So when South Africa opened up for 1995 Rugby World Cup the world came to us and the rest is history.”The spirit of conservation  wildlife and community grew and became the founding principles of the Mantis group when it formed in 2000.“In 2018 we set up the Community Conservation Fund of Africa (CCFA)  because without the community being looked after and engaged  the animals don't benefit ” explained Paul Gardiner. “You've got to look after the one to be able to look after the other. It’s a crucial part of the DNA of our group today.”As Mantis has grown  so has its spirit of adventure and discovery  which has led to a collaboration with the world-renowned Bear Grylls. “We work with Bear on what we call location based entertainment  taking what he does on TV and bringing it to life for travelers  families and corporate guests. I love the work we do with Bear getting kids back outdoors  getting them muddy  building tree houses  climbing trees and lighting fires  all this stuff that a lot of us grew up with  certainly in South Africa  we did. So much of that is taken away from kids today  especially when they are stuck in front of their devices. So we are trying to change that. And what better place to start than in the hospitality industry ” said Paul.Duncan talks about the importance of purpose  action sustainability and inspiring experiences for both guests and employees.Paul agreed  adding; “We all know hospitality is going to go through the roof in the coming years. More specifically  eco-tourism post COVID. I think the world has woken up to the fact that we've got to adjust. So I think there's going to be some amazing opportunities for youngsters entering the hospitality and tourism industry to start embracing this precious planet of ours.”Adrian added: “It’s an industry where you are continually migrating and seeing people  meeting people  making a difference to their lives – it’s invigorating.”The Heart of Hospitality podcast is part of a pan-European industry platform of the same name  built to tell stories of the sector and its people. Accor is inviting stories from across the industry to be shared via #HeartOfHospitalityFor more information and more stories from hospitality  visit https://heart-of-hospitality.com/.BIOGRAPHY: ADRIAN GARDINERBorn in Zambia in 1943  Adrian Gardiner’s passion for nature coupled with his strong entrepreneurial skill was forged from an early age. His love of wildlife came from his father who worked for a cattle ranching business and who took his son camping in the bush and hunting from an early age. His entrepreneurial skills were formed when he attended Falcon College in Bulawayo  Zimbabwe. As one of the first 60 boys who were the initial intake of the new school  he was instrumental in helping to build the school from the ground up  from literally building their school classrooms to planting the sports fields. He soon understood that success was only possible with a good team  a clear vision and a focused passion.From Zimbabwe he travelled to Cape Town to further his studies but  like many successful business people  he struggled at college taking 7 years to do a 3-year course. Academia was not for him. Whilst learning the ropes working for various Cape Town firms  it was evident that Adrian was not content working for other people and by the age of 29 he had moved from Cape Town to Nelson Mandela Bay.And so began a love affair with the city of Port Elizabeth (also referred to as PE  now officially called Nelson Mandla Bay). As a rapidly developing location  the city offered exciting new business opportunities which Adrian relished. For the next 20 years  he embarked on a rollercoaster ride of building companies in a multitude of industries from swimming pool development to garage swing doors  pagers to crane hire.Having enjoyed commercial success  Adrian was able to ‘return to the land’ so to speak by developing a new venture into tourism in the early 1990’s. He began with 2 000 hectares of eroded  degraded and abused land. A small insignificant piece of valley bushveld  and from this  he grew the first private game reserve in the region  which is now 25 000 hectares in size and has seen the re-introduction of all the large game that once thrived in the Eastern Cape. He was the first person to put the Eastern Cape on the tourist map and today the area is a booming tourist destination and home to countless other private game reserves. It was with this game reserve which has since become a blueprint internationally for successful sustainable conservation tourism  and its development was instrumental in forming the next phase in Adrian’s life.On seeing the success of rewilding a degraded piece of land  Adrian was able to replicate the model a few years later  by creating further private game reserves. With two wildlife reserves flourishing  Adrian then founded the parent company Mantis in 2000. The name Mantis relates to the San people who revere the Praying Mantis and protect it as the most important animal in their ecosystem as ‘if you look after the little things  the big things take care of themselves’. Rather than only securing the inbound business within his game reserves  Adrian recognised the opportunity in providing a consistently high-quality tourism experience from start to finish where properties could join forces under one group  thus providing a one-stop shop for international visitors wishing to travel from West to East along the Garden Route.Mantis  while maintaining its origins in South Africa  then developed their model worldwide with each property being committed to conserving the environment; the Mantis Eco-lodges and Waterways are gateways to responsible exploration of their natural surroundings.As the company has grown  Adrian’s ambitions for Mantis have also grown in two distinct directions; developing Mantis’ global footprint of properties worldwide and using the lessons learnt when developing his first game reserve to educate  support and develop major conservation tourism projects worldwide. In this vein  he is also consulting on wildlife regeneration in numerous African countries. Adrian sees this as a tangible way of giving something back to nature and creating a positive legacy where communities can see the financial benefits in conserving their environment and wildlife. Thus fulfilling the philosophy that is entrenched in our name: Man And Nature Together Is Sustainable (MANTIS).Education is one of Adrian’s great passions and the first groundbreaking move in this sphere was through the establishment of Stenden University in Port Alfred. Adrian together with colleagues and Stenden University in Holland opened the campus in 2001  and Adrian currently serves as chairman of the Board. Stenden is the only university in Southern Africa where you can qualify with a Bachelor’s degree in Hotel Management and Hospitality and a Bachelor’s degree in Disaster Management.Adrian has been married to his wife Shirleyanne for 50 years; they have 3 children  Paul  Murray and Angela all of whom have adopted their father’s entrepreneurial ways and run their own businesses. Paul is the CEO of the Mantis in the UK  and Murray is a partner in their travel business  Giltedge.BIOGRAPHY: PAUL GARDINERPaul Gardiner was born in South Africa in 1973. His career began as a game ranger in South Africa in 1996 on his father’s wildlife reserve  Shamwari  which is a model used by the Gardiner Family to create many reserves in Africa. On seeing the need to give their guests more experiences around the globe  the Gardner family founded Mantis. Mantis is an environmentally conscious collect ion of hotels  eco-escapes and waterways which is based in Port Elizabeth  South Africa. Paul joined the Mantis marketing team in 1998  after four years in the business he headed up the Group’s Sales & Marketing department.In 2002  he emigrated to the United Kingdom where he became the MD of Southern Africa Travel  a UK based Tour Operator and also set up Worldwide Experience. Worldwide Experiences (WWE) takes students from across the globe into Africa and places them in unique conservation-based projects where they work behind the scenes with Mantis’ wildlife veterinarians  ecologists and wildlife management teams. His mission with the WWE team is to now open the experiences up to Chinese students in a partnership that was recently forged with an impressive conservation foundation in this country. In 2006  Paul also co-founded Legacy Ventures – a company that specialises in taking executive MBA students on study tours into emerging countries such as China  India  and South Africa. In 2012 Paul met television personality and adventurer  Bear Grylls. Today they have several businesses together including Bear Grylls Survival Academy  Bear Grylls Survival Challenge  and Bear Grylls Adventure. Mantis Media is the creative arm of Mantis Collection and they’re responsible for taking what Bear does so well on television and bringing it to life for kids  adults  and corporate teams. Essentially  Mantis Media is responsible for all Bear’s location-based entertainment. Through Mantis Media  Bear recently partnered with Merlin Entertainments to develop a $22m Bear Grylls Adventure Park in the UK.Paul leads a team in the UK which manages Mantis’ development beyond the borders of Africa. Paul is now the CEO of Mantis and works very closely with his father  Adrian Gardiner  as they strive to grow Mantis’ portfolio throughout Africa and beyond.Although Paul is based in the UK  he continues to spend some quality time in South Africa – he and the Mantis team are the driving force behind a new pioneering initiative at Mantis Founder’s Lodge which will see the creation of the first ever Eco Lodge Innovation Hub. Paul has also recently launched his very own media platform called ‘The Ecoventurer’ to help spread the word about eco-tourism and the amazing work of conservationists from all walks of life.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The Outlook…,English Dutch4 October 2022  7:00am  Antwerp  Belgium: The Rating Agency Fitch Ratings (‘Fitch’) has reaffirmed the credit rating for VGP NV (‘VGP’ or ‘the Group’) with its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating reaffirmed at 'BBB-'. The Outlook on the rating is Stable.Fitch sees the statement by VGP and Allianz  as issued last Friday  in relation to the postponement of the seed portfolio closing for the Europa joint venture as a market-induced pause  not cessation of JV transfers.VGP has adequate liquidity to fund 2H22 and FY23 committed capex (much of it pre-let) even if monetisation of assets to JVs are postponed. The pro forma €730 million end-1H22 cash includes the €1 billion of bond proceeds raised in January 2022 (at a blended 2% fixed coupon) and the completed JV closures in 1H22 and July 2022. Additionally  VGP is expected to receive the Munich JV minimum proceeds of €73 million in 2H22 and other sources. This compares to committed capex of around €500 million to be spent and €150 million of debt maturing until end-June 2023.In its rating affirmation of September 2022  Fitch had calculated that despite an assumed 12% decline in valuations of VGP’s development programme assets  when they are transferred to the JVs  the disposal proceeds would adequately cover VGP’s build-to-cost capital outlay. Furthermore  those assets are income-producing (around 90% pre-let) which supports values.Fitch’s analytical approach of ‘VGP as HoldCo’ simulates a scenario of no further transfersto the JVs  effectively leading to VGP funding development and completed assets on its balance sheet. If we assume no further transfers in 2023 and 2024 in Fitch’s updated rating case  ‘VGP as HoldCo’ metrics remain consistent within Fitch’s rating sensitivities for upgrade and downgrade. This is because the size of the current land bank is not anonerous capital outlay and  as per company policy  completed assets are substantially income-producing.For further details please refer to the Fitch corresponding press release on the rating agency website: https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/vgp-announcement-reflects-property-valuation-uncertainties-03-10-2022 .CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing) Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Most don't want to be left behind by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  but are grappling with technological complexities.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterSWIFT's head of innovation Nick Kerigan said its trial  which will be followed by more advanced testing over the next year  resembled a bicycle wheel where 14 central and commercial banks in total connected spoke-like into its main hub.The idea is that once scaled-up  banks may need only one main global connection  rather than thousands if they were to set up connections with each counterpart individually.""We believe that the number of connections needed is much fewer "" Kerigan said. ""Therefore  you are likely to have fewer breaks (in the chain) and you are likely to achieve greater efficiency.""CBDCs are being seen as a step forward as they could effectively be programmed to meet both governments' and individuals' specific needs  although they have also raised concerns about privacy and surveillance.SWIFT's trial also tested different underlying CBDC technologies known as Distributed Ledger Technologies. The use of various technologies has also been raised as a potential hurdle for rapid global adoption.There was a separate trial too carried out with Citi  clearing house Clearstream and Northern Trust on 'tokenised' assets - traditional assets like stocks and bonds transformed into digital tokens that can then be issued and traded in real-time.Some countries such as the Bahamas and Nigeria already have CBDCs up and running.

According to SWIFT  the results demonstrated that “CBDCs can be rapidly deployed at scale to facilitate trade and investment between more than 200 countries and territories around the world.”SWIFT is a Belgian messaging system that connects over 11 500 financial institutions worldwide and plays a paramount role in facilitating international transactions. Globally  nine out of 10 central banks are actively exploring digital currencies. Via its collaboration with Capgemini  SWIFT managed to settle transactions using CBDCs based on different distributed ledger technologies  as well as using a fiat-to-CBDC payment network.Fourteen central and commercial banks — including Banque de France  the Deutsche Bundesbank  HSBC  Intesa Sanpaolo  NatWest  SMBC  Standard Chartered  UBS and Wells Fargo — are now collaborating in a testing environment to accelerate the path to full-scale CBDC deployment.In the second experiment  SWIFT demonstrated that its infrastructure could integrate tokenization platforms with different types of cash payments. Working in collaboration with Citi  Clearstream  Northern Trust and SETL  SWIFT explored 70 scenarios simulating the market issuance and secondary market transfers of tokenized bonds  equities and cash. The World Economic Forum estimates the tokenization market could reach $24 trillion by 2027. Regarding the developments  Tom Zschach  chief innovation officer at SWIFT  said:“Digital currencies and tokens have huge potential to shape how we will pay and invest in the future. But that potential can only be unleashed if the different approaches that are being explored have the ability to connect and work together.

Most don't want to be left behind by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  but are grappling with technological complexities.SWIFT's head of innovation Nick Kerigan said its trial  which will be followed by more advanced testing over the next year  resembled a bicycle wheel where 14 central and commercial banks in total connected spoke-like into its main hub.The idea is that once scaled-up  banks may need only one main global connection  rather than thousands if they were to set up connections with each counterpart individually.""We believe that the number of connections needed is much fewer "" Kerigan said. ""Therefore  you are likely to have fewer breaks (in the chain) and you are likely to achieve greater efficiency.""CBDCs are being seen as a step forward as they could effectively be programmed to meet both governments' and individuals' specific needs  although they have also raised concerns about privacy and surveillance.SWIFT's trial also tested different underlying CBDC technologies known as Distributed Ledger Technologies. The use of various technologies has also been raised as a potential hurdle for rapid global adoption.There was a separate trial too carried out with Citi  clearing house Clearstream and Northern Trust on 'tokenised' assets - traditional assets like stocks and bonds transformed into digital tokens that can then be issued and traded in real-time.Story continuesSome countries such as the Bahamas and Nigeria already have CBDCs up and running.

This important step forward builds on SWIFT’s core capabilities and means that as CBDCs and tokens develop  they can be rapidly deployed at scale to facilitate trade and investment between more than 200 countries and territories around the world.Interlinking CBDCs for seamless cross-border paymentsGlobally  nine out of 10 central banks are actively exploring digital currencies — often using different technologies and with a primary focus on domestic use. For the potential of CBDCs to be fully realised across borders  these digital currencies need to overcome inherent differences to interact with each other  as well as with traditional fiat currencies.SWIFT  in collaboration with Capgemini  achieved CBDC-to-CBDC transactions between different DLT networks based on popular Quorum and Corda technologies  as well as fiat-to-CBDC flows between these networks and a real-time gross settlement system. The success showed that the blockchain networks could be interlinked for cross-border payments through a single gateway  and that SWIFT’s new transaction management capabilities could orchestrate all inter-network communication.14 central and commercial banks  including Banque de France  the Deutsche Bundesbank  HSBC  Intesa Sanpaolo  NatWest  SMBC  Standard Chartered  UBS and Wells Fargo  are now collaborating in a testing environment to accelerate the path to full scale deployment.Unlocking the potential of tokenised assetsIn a separate experiment with a different group of participants  SWIFT similarly demonstrated that its infrastructure can serve as an interconnector between multiple tokenisation platforms and different types of cash payment.Working in collaboration with Citi  Clearstream  Northern Trust  and SETL  its technology partner  SWIFT explored 70 scenarios simulating market issuance and secondary market transfers of tokenised bonds  equities and cash. It successfully served as a single access point to various tokenised networks and showed its infrastructure could be used to create  transfer and redeem tokens and update balances between multiple client wallets  as well as provide interoperability between different tokenisation platforms and existing account-based infrastructure.Tokenisation is a relatively nascent market  but the World Economic Forum has estimated it could reach $24tn by 20271. The potential benefits include greater market liquidity and fractionalisation  which could increase access to investment markets for retail investors  and enable institutional investors to build stronger portfolios.Tom Zschach  Chief Innovation Officer at SWIFT  said: “ Digital currencies and tokens have huge potential to shape the way we will all pay and invest in the future. But that potential can only be unleashed if the different approaches that are being explored have the ability to connect and work together. We see inclusivity and interoperability as central pillars of the financial ecosystem  and our innovation is a major step towards unlocking the potential of the digital future. For CBDCs  our solution will enable central banks to connect their own networks simply and directly to all the other payments systems in the world through a single gateway  ensuring the instant and smooth flow of cross-border payments.“ Tokenisation has great potential when it comes to strengthening liquidity in markets and increasing access to investment opportunities  and SWIFT’s existing infrastructure can ensure these benefits can be realised at the earliest opportunity  by as many people as possible.”The experiments are part of SWIFT’s extensive innovation agenda in support of its strategic focus on enabling instant  frictionless and interoperable cross-border transactions. The cooperative  which connects more than 11 500 financial institutions and 4 billion accounts across 200 countries and territories  was created to bridge geographies  technologies and currencies. And it has been transforming the underlying infrastructure of the global economy at pace to meet the rapidly changing requirements of businesses and consumers. This includes a new standard  SWIFT Go  for low value payments  and services like Payment Pre-validation that uses predictive intelligence to pre-check international payments before they begin to prevent common mistakes that cause delays.Full details of the experiments  and the results  can be found here:Connecting digital islands: CBDCsConnecting digital islands: tokenised assetsAbout SWIFTSWIFT is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

The tests demonstrated that its infrastructure could be used to create  transfer and redeem tokens and update balances between multiple client wallets  as well as provide interoperability between different tokenisation platforms and existing account-based infrastructure.Says Zschach: “Tokenisation has great potential when it comes to strengthening liquidity in markets and increasing access to investment opportunities  and Swift’s existing infrastructure can ensure these benefits can be realised at the earliest opportunity  by as many people as possible.”",neutral,0.03,0.95,0.02,positive,0.74,0.25,0.02,True,English,"['global hub', 'tokenised assets', 'Swift', 'role', 'CBDCs', 'real-time gross settlement system', 'new transaction management capabilities', '70 scenarios simulating market issuance', 'different distributed ledger technology', 'secondary market transfers', 'Financial messaging network', 'milestone pilot test', 'chief innovation officer', 'Banque de France', 'full scale deployment', 'seperate Swift-led pilot', 'multiple client wallets', 'different tokenisation platforms', 'existing payment systems', 'other payments systems', 'existing account-based infrastructure', 'different DLT networks', 'technology partner', 'tokenisation systems', 'existing infrastructure', 'cross-border payments', 'DLT) networks', 'digital currencies', 'traditional counterparts', 'popular Quorum', 'Corda technologies', 'single gateway', 'inter-network communication', 'smooth flow', 'commercial banks', 'Deutsche Bundesbank', 'Intesa Sanpaolo', 'Standard Chartered', 'Wells Fargo', 'testing environment', 'common framework', 'global custodians', 'Northern Trust', 'tokenised bonds', 'great potential', 'investment opportunities', 'earliest opportunity', 'many people', 'blockchain networks', 'CBDC transactions', 'CBDC flows', 'Tom Zschach', 'central banks', '14 central', 'results', 'trial', 'assets', 'collaboration', 'Capgemini', 'success', 'CBDCs', 'solution', 'world', 'instant', 'HSBC', 'NatWest', 'SMBC', 'UBS', 'path', 'Finextra', 'CSD', 'Citi', 'Clearstream', 'SETL', 'equities', 'cash', 'tests', 'tokens', 'balances', 'interoperability', 'Says', 'liquidity', 'markets', 'access', 'benefits']",2022-10-05,2022-10-05,finextra.com

Throughout the past six months  we have concentrated our phase III research programs in the field of difficult to treat or resistant hypertension. In this context  we have enrolled the last patient in the FRESH study. This important step will enable us to soon present the results of this study  scheduled for November 7 during the annual conference of the American Heart Association  a major event in the world of cardiology. The presentation of our results during a ""Late-breaking trials"" session dedicated to resistant hypertension demonstrates the interest of the scientific community for novel treatments in the management of this pathology  for which there is little or no alternative. This is why all our teams are proud  committed and determined to be able to change the life of the millions of patients worldwide who are refractory to treatment"".A stronger financial situation reinforced after the capital increase conducted in April 2022During the first half of the 2022 financial year  Quantum Genomics continued to receive payments due under the partnership contracts announced in 2020.Quantum Genomics thus invoiced and collected €2.5 million of income from these partnerships  including €1.9 million of milestones  corresponding to the milestone payments for the first patients recruited in South Korea and Taiwan in the REFRESH study. In addition  €0.6 million was re-invoiced to the partner Biolab for the conduct of the FRESH study in Brazil.Story continuesAt the end of June 2022  operating income was €2.9 million compared with €2.7 million a year earlier. The operating result amounted to (€9.6 million)  compared with (€7.2 million) at the end of June 2021. Personnel expenses remain under control  amid a logical increase in operating expenses due to the continued progress of clinical studies.After accounting for the research tax credit of €1.2 million  net result at June 30  2022 was (€8.8 million). Free cash flow (amount of net disbursements related to operations) was (€11.4 million) over the period.At the end of this half-year  the company's shareholder equity amounted to €19.7 million  compared to €11.4 million at the end of December 2021. This increase is explained by the completion  on April 27  2022  of a €17.5 million capital increase  including €1.9 million subscribed by the pharmaceutical company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar in order to strengthen its cooperation with Quantum Genomics in the context of the marketing and production of firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Turkey.At the end of June 2022  available cash thus reached €19.5 million compared to €13.5 million at December 31  2021  while financial debts were €3.0 million. The latter consist of a €1.5 million state-guaranteed loan granted by BNP and an Innovation R&D loan of €1.5 million obtained from BPIFrance.Cash position as of June 30  2022  allows the Company to fund its activities until the second quarter of 2023. This cash statement does not take into account any payments that may be perceived by the Company from any new pharma partners  especially in the US and in Europe.Summary of financial data at 30 June 2022:Data in €'000 (French standards) 30 JUN 2022 30 JUN 2021 Operating income 2 912.6 2 711.7 Personnel expenses (1 249.9 ) (1 109.7 ) Other operating costs (11 288.2 ) (8 824.8 ) Operating result (9 625.5 ) (7 222.9 ) Financial result (9.6 ) 4.9 Current result before tax (9 635.2 ) (7 218.0 ) Extraordinary result (426.7 ) (130.6 ) Research tax credit 1 212.3 1 168.8 Net result (8 849.5 ) (6 180.2 )Overview of the research programmesThe firibastat development program  now in Phase III for difficult to treat and resistant hypertension  is on track.The last patient in the FRESH study  a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study was enrolled last May  making it possible to have results which will be published shortly on November 7 in the ""late-breaking trials"" session of the prestigious annual conference of the American Heart Association (AHA) in Chicago (USA). The study was supervised by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse event warranting a protocol modification was reported.The Phase III REFRESH study  launched during the 1st half of 2021  was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of a single daily dose of firibastat at 3 months in addition to its long-term safety (6 to 12 months)  and is ongoing. The results of this study  expected mid-2023  and the 6-month safety data will form the basis for the firibastat marketing authorisation application which will be filed with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).In the indication of heart failure  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search continues for a partner to accompany upcoming development activities  and at the same time the development plan is being finalized with relevant Regulatory Authorities.Lastly  during the first half of 2022  Quantum Genomics reinforced its operational teams and its scientific committee by recruiting new and complementary expertise to accompany firbastat registration and support the development of its class of medicinal products with the innovative BAPAI mechanism in new therapeutic indications.Availability of the 6-monthly financial reportThe half-year accounts were approved by the Board of Directors which met on October 4  2022. The procedures for the limited review of the half-year financial information by the Statutory Auditor have been completed and their report has been published.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (S…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today reported topline results from the LIFT Home study  evaluating the safety and feasibility of ARC-EX Therapy when used at home. ARC-EX Therapy is a proprietary non-invasive spinal cord stimulation technology designed to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and other movement disabilities. The Company recently reported its Up-LIFT pivotal study evaluating ARC-EX Therapy in clinics achieved its primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in upper extremity strength and function.“Today’s results from the LIFT Home study support the potential for ARC-EX Therapy to be used safely at home  which would enable people with spinal cord injury to live even more independently ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We expect to launch first in clinics  but as the community gains more experience with ARC-EX Therapy  we envision many patients will also want to use this technology at home.”“To maximize recovery after spinal cord injury  it’s critical that we develop treatments that can be safely and effectively delivered in the home environment ” said Principal Investigator  Candy Tefertiller  PT  DPT  Ph.D.  NCS  Executive Director of Research and Evaluation at Denver’s Craig Hospital. “Integrating home-based therapy not only facilitates opportunities for ongoing recovery  but also allows therapy to focus on more relevant activities for that specific individual.”The LIFT Home study is a single-arm observational study. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ARC-EX Therapy when used at home. Seventeen people were enrolled at five leading spinal cord injury research centers in the United States: Craig Hospital in Denver  Colorado  Shepherd Center in Atlanta  Georgia  Spaulding Research Institute in Boston  Massachusetts  University of Minnesota  and the University of Washington. Participants performed training on activities of daily living three times per week over a one-month period. Approximately 97% of these sessions were completed without usability issues  supporting the feasibility of home-based treatment. The absence of any device-related adverse events confirmed the favorable safety results observed during the Up-LIFT Study when ARC-EX Therapy was used in clinics.ONWARD plans to discuss the findings from the LIFT Home study with regulatory authorities to define the appropriate approval pathway for home use  with a goal to facilitate access to ARC-EX Therapy for as long as needed without the burden of continued visits to a clinic.About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for a paraplegic (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for a tetraplegic (paralysis of all four limbs). Treatments are urgently needed to restore movement and improve quality of life.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries. ONWARD’s work builds on more than a decade of basic science and preclinical research conducted at the world’s leading neuroscience laboratories. ONWARD’s ARC Therapy  which can be delivered by implantable (ARC-IM) or external (ARC-EX) systems  is designed to deliver targeted  programmed spinal-cord stimulation to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury  ultimately improving their quality of life.ONWARD has received three Breakthrough Device Designations from the U.S. FDA encompassing both ARC-IM and ARC-EX. ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a wearable stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in September 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  evaluating the ability of ARC-EX Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. The company is now preparing marketing approval submissions for the U.S. and Europe. ARC-IM consists of an implantable pulse generator and lead that is placed near the spinal cord. The company completed its first-in-human use of the ARC-IM neurostimulator in May 2022.ONWARD is headquartered at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven  the Netherlands. It maintains an office in Lausanne  Switzerland  and has a growing U.S. presence in Boston  Massachusetts  USA. For additional information about the company  please visit ONWD.com.

Throughout the past six months  we have concentrated our phase III research programs in the field of difficult to treat or resistant hypertension. In this context  we have enrolled the last patient in the FRESH study. This important step will enable us to soon present the results of this study  scheduled for November 7 during the annual conference of the American Heart Association  a major event in the world of cardiology. The presentation of our results during a ""Late-breaking trials"" session dedicated to resistant hypertension demonstrates the interest of the scientific community for novel treatments in the management of this pathology  for which there is little or no alternative. This is why all our teams are proud  committed and determined to be able to change the life of the millions of patients worldwide who are refractory to treatment"".A stronger financial situation reinforced after the capital increase conducted in April 2022During the first half of the 2022 financial year  Quantum Genomics continued to receive payments due under the partnership contracts announced in 2020.Quantum Genomics thus invoiced and collected €2.5 million of income from these partnerships  including €1.9 million of milestones  corresponding to the milestone payments for the first patients recruited in South Korea and Taiwan in the REFRESH study. In addition  €0.6 million was re-invoiced to the partner Biolab for the conduct of the FRESH study in Brazil.At the end of June 2022  operating income was €2.9 million compared with €2.7 million a year earlier. The operating result amounted to (€9.6 million)  compared with (€7.2 million) at the end of June 2021. Personnel expenses remain under control  amid a logical increase in operating expenses due to the continued progress of clinical studies.After accounting for the research tax credit of €1.2 million  net result at June 30  2022 was (€8.8 million). Free cash flow (amount of net disbursements related to operations) was (€11.4 million) over the period.At the end of this half-year  the company's shareholder equity amounted to €19.7 million  compared to €11.4 million at the end of December 2021. This increase is explained by the completion  on April 27  2022  of a €17.5 million capital increase  including €1.9 million subscribed by the pharmaceutical company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar in order to strengthen its cooperation with Quantum Genomics in the context of the marketing and production of firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Turkey.At the end of June 2022  available cash thus reached €19.5 million compared to €13.5 million at December 31  2021  while financial debts were €3.0 million. The latter consist of a €1.5 million state-guaranteed loan granted by BNP and an Innovation R&D loan of €1.5 million obtained from BPIFrance.Cash position as of June 30  2022  allows the Company to fund its activities until the second quarter of 2023. This cash statement does not take into account any payments that may be perceived by the Company from any new pharma partners  especially in the US and in Europe.Summary of financial data at 30 June 2022:Data in €'000 (French standards) 30 JUN 2022 30 JUN 2021 Operating income 2 912.6 2 711.7 Personnel expenses (1 249.9 ) (1 109.7 ) Other operating costs (11 288.2 ) (8 824.8 ) Operating result (9 625.5 ) (7 222.9 ) Financial result (9.6 ) 4.9 Current result before tax (9 635.2 ) (7 218.0 ) Extraordinary result (426.7 ) (130.6 ) Research tax credit 1 212.3 1 168.8 Net result (8 849.5 ) (6 180.2 )Overview of the research programmesThe firibastat development program  now in Phase III for difficult to treat and resistant hypertension  is on track.The last patient in the FRESH study  a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study was enrolled last May  making it possible to have results which will be published shortly on November 7 in the ""late-breaking trials"" session of the prestigious annual conference of the American Heart Association (AHA) in Chicago (USA). The study was supervised by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse event warranting a protocol modification was reported.The Phase III REFRESH study  launched during the 1st half of 2021  was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of a single daily dose of firibastat at 3 months in addition to its long-term safety (6 to 12 months)  and is ongoing. The results of this study  expected mid-2023  and the 6-month safety data will form the basis for the firibastat marketing authorisation application which will be filed with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).In the indication of heart failure  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search continues for a partner to accompany upcoming development activities  and at the same time the development plan is being finalized with relevant Regulatory Authorities.Lastly  during the first half of 2022  Quantum Genomics reinforced its operational teams and its scientific committee by recruiting new and complementary expertise to accompany firbastat registration and support the development of its class of medicinal products with the innovative BAPAI mechanism in new therapeutic indications.Availability of the 6-monthly financial reportThe half-year accounts were approved by the Board of Directors which met on October 4  2022. The procedures for the limited review of the half-year financial information by the Statutory Auditor have been completed and their report has been published.

This unusual pharmacokinetic profile could be explained by a strong efflux of the active drug by the intestinal efflux pumps from the blood to the GI lumen.The patient case presented suffers from a severe Clostridioides difficile infection. His White Blood Cells count  an inflammatory marker  rapidly dropped after inclusion  remained in the upper limit during 8 days and was normal at the end of the treatment. The diarrhea episodes improved after 6 days of treatment and came back to normal 10 days after treatment after a transient constipation period. DNV3681 concentrations in feces were several order of magnitude higher than DNV3681 MIC901.Georges Gaudriault  Chief Scientific Officer of DEINOVE who attended the ESCMID/ASM conference in Dublin specifies: « The use of DNV3837 is a potential paradigm shift. The intestine is a complex organ and CDI is not simply a topical disease of its epithelium. In order to treat efficiently the infection and avoid the persistence and/or recurrence of the infection  it is critical to treat this organ as a whole. DNV3837 is the first parenteral drug targeting the intestine and generating high exposure of DNV3681 in the intestinal tissue  as showcased today. »***ABOUT CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTIONS (CDI)More than 40% of hospitalized patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have been classified as severe disease associated with higher morbidity and mortality2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies CDI as one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections  ahead of even MRSA3 infections. In the United States  it is estimated that CDI causes nearly half a million disease cases each year  and approximately 29 300 deaths4. This condition is not limited to the United States and recent studies5 show that the incidence of this type of infection is greatly underestimated in other parts of the world  such as Europe and Asia.To date  there is no proven therapeutic solution for CDI patients with severe vomiting  ileus and toxic megacolon. The oral route being compromised  the available treatments  which are mostly oral  have difficulty reaching the intestine because of the patient's pathological condition (reduced gastrointestinal motility  intubation  intestinal perforation  etc.)  and the few antibiotics that could be administered intravenously do not cross the gastrointestinal barrier and therefore do not reach the infection site.ABOUT THE DNV3837 ANTIBIOTIC CANDIDATEDNV3837 – a prodrug6 of the DNV3681 molecule (also known as MCB3681) – is a narrow-spectrum  hybrid oxazolidinone-quinolone synthetic antibiotic targeting only Gram-positive bacteria. It is developed as a highly active first-line treatment targeting C. diff. It has demonstrated significant activity and superiority to reference treatments against isolates of C. diff.  regardless of their virulence (including the hyper virulent BI/NAP1/027 strain).DNV3837 is an intravenous antibiotic that  when converted to its active form DNV3681  crosses the gastrointestinal barrier and accumulates in the intestinal lumen  allowing it to precisely target the infection site. Several Phase I trials (on approximately a hundred healthy volunteers) have shown a high concentration of the antibiotic in stools  a strong marker of its presence in the intestine. It has also demonstrated its ability to eliminate Clostridioides bacteria without affecting the gut microbiota.FDA granted the DNV3837 drug with Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and Fast Track status.For more information on the DNV3837 Phase II clinical trial in Clostridioides difficile infections  visit ClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03988855ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized microbiotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infections  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI - code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has around 50 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.com1 MIC : Minimale Inhibitory Concentration.

As the conditions precedent had been cleared  the two companies were able to complete their business combination.Nicolas Chartier and Guillaume Paoli  co-founders1 of Aramis Group: “We are delighted to officially welcome all the teams from Onlinecars to the Aramis Group family. We are counting on Peter Marolin  Onlinecars’ founder  its co-director Thomas Lang and their teams to continue creating more value for Austrian consumers  while accelerating their profitable growth with the Group’s support. By extending its presence to Austria  Aramis Group continues to expand in Europe to ensure the satisfaction of a growing number of customers and is taking a further step towards achieving its ambition to become Europe’s preferred platform for buying used cars online”.As with the Group’s previous acquisitions  the integration of Onlinecars will generate extensive operational synergies and open up opportunities to share experience. In particular  Aramis Group will enable Onlinecars to benefit from its industrial flow management and refurbishing process optimization expertise  as well as its know-how and the tools from its technological and data platform. Alongside this  Onlinecars will help consolidate the major network of suppliers and brands built up by Aramis Group  which represents one of its many competitive advantages.From an accounting perspective  Onlinecars will be consolidated by Aramis Group from October 1  2022  and will therefore contribute over a full year to the company’s performance for FY 2022-23  running from October 1  2022 to September 30  2023. With this operation  the new combined structure will have pro forma full-year revenues of close to €2 billion.With this accretive acquisition for Aramis Group  €27.2 million will be paid out immediately  followed by an earnout based on the performance for the 2024 calendar year. These two elements give a purchase price for Onlinecars with multiples that are close to Aramis Group’s previous acquisitions and consistent with the market levels currently observed taking into consideration the company’s profitability (EBITDA margin over 3%).For reference  this operation is financed entirely by Stellantis  Aramis Group's majority shareholder  which is fully committed to accompanying and supporting its international strategic expansion. Aramis Group also took the opportunity offered by this operation to secure its financing structure. In the current context  the €200 million revolving credit facility (RCF) was canceled. A new credit line was made available by Stellantis and others were renewed.

Quantum Genomics (Euronext Growth - FR0011648971 - ALQGC)  a biopharmaceutical company specialisin,"05/10/2022 - 18:00Quantum Genomics Publishes its 2022 First Half Resultsand Reviews its ActivityQuantum Genomics (Euronext Growth - FR0011648971 - ALQGC)  a biopharmaceutical company specialising in the development of a new class of medicinal products that act directly on the brain to treat resistant/difficult to treat hypertension and heart-failure  today published its first half 2022 results.Jean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  commented:""Quantum Genomics continues its development trajectory aiming to put a new class of innovative medicinal products on the market. Throughout the past six months  we have concentrated our phase III research programs in the field of difficult to treat or resistant hypertension . In this context  we have enrolled the last patient in the FRESH study. This important step will enable us to soon present the results of this study  scheduled for November 7 during the annual conference of the American Heart Association  a major event in the world of cardiology. The presentation of our results during a ""Late-breaking trials"" session dedicated to resistant hypertension demonstrates the interest of the scientific community for novel treatments in the management of this pathology  for which there is little or no alternative. This is why all our teams are proud  committed and determined to be able to change the life of the millions of patients worldwide who are refractory to treatment"".A stronger financial situation reinforced after the capital increase conducted in April 2022During the first half of the 2022 financial year  Quantum Genomics continued to receive payments due under the partnership contracts announced in 2020.Quantum Genomics thus invoiced and collected €2.5 million of income from these partnerships  including €1.9 million of milestones  corresponding to the milestone payments for the first patients recruited in South Korea and Taiwan in the REFRESH study. In addition  €0.6 million was re-invoiced to the partner Biolab for the conduct of the FRESH study in Brazil.At the end of June 2022  operating income was €2.9 million compared with €2.7 million a year earlier. The operating result amounted to (€9.6 million)  compared with (€7.2 million) at the end of June 2021. Personnel expenses remain under control  whereas it was logical that the progress of the clinical studies resulted in increased operating expenses.After accounting for the research tax credit of €1.2 million  net result at June 30  2022 was (€8.8 million). Free cash flow (amount of net disbursements related to operations) was (€11.4 million) over the period.At the end of this half-year  the company's shareholder equity amounted to €19.7 million  compared to €11.4 million at the end of December 2021. This increase is explained by the completion  on April 27  2022  of a €17.5 million capital increase  including €1.9 million subscribed by the pharmaceutical company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar in order to strengthen its cooperation with Quantum Genomics in the context of the marketing and production of firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Turkey.At the end of June 2022  available cash thus reached €19.5 million compared to €13.5 million at December 31  2021  while financial debts were €3.0 million.
