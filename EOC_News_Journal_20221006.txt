""Therefore  you are likely to have fewer breaks (in the chain) and you are likely to achieve greater efficiency.""CBDCs are being seen as a step forward as they could effectively be programmed to meet both governments' and individuals' specific needs  although they have also raised concerns about privacy and surveillance.SWIFT's trial also tested different underlying CBDC technologies known as Distributed Ledger Technologies. The use of various technologies has also been raised as a potential hurdle for rapid global adoption.There was a separate trial too carried out with Citi  clearing house Clearstream and Northern Trust on 'tokenised' assets - traditional assets like stocks and bonds transformed into digital tokens that can then be issued and traded in real-time.Some countries such as the Bahamas and Nigeria already have CBDCs up and running.

This important step forward builds on SWIFT’s core capabilities and means that as CBDCs and tokens develop  they can be rapidly deployed at scale to facilitate trade and investment between more than 200 countries and territories around the world.Interlinking CBDCs for seamless cross-border paymentsGlobally  nine out of 10 central banks are actively exploring digital currencies — often using different technologies and with a primary focus on domestic use. For the potential of CBDCs to be fully realised across borders  these digital currencies need to overcome inherent differences to interact with each other  as well as with traditional fiat currencies.SWIFT  in collaboration with Capgemini  achieved CBDC-to-CBDC transactions between different DLT networks based on popular Quorum and Corda technologies  as well as fiat-to-CBDC flows between these networks and a real-time gross settlement system. The success showed that the blockchain networks could be interlinked for cross-border payments through a single gateway  and that SWIFT’s new transaction management capabilities could orchestrate all inter-network communication.14 central and commercial banks  including Banque de France  the Deutsche Bundesbank  HSBC  Intesa Sanpaolo  NatWest  SMBC  Standard Chartered  UBS and Wells Fargo  are now collaborating in a testing environment to accelerate the path to full scale deployment.Unlocking the potential of tokenised assetsIn a separate experiment with a different group of participants  SWIFT similarly demonstrated that its infrastructure can serve as an interconnector between multiple tokenisation platforms and different types of cash payment.Working in collaboration with Citi  Clearstream  Northern Trust  and SETL  its technology partner  SWIFT explored 70 scenarios simulating market issuance and secondary market transfers of tokenised bonds  equities and cash. It successfully served as a single access point to various tokenised networks and showed its infrastructure could be used to create  transfer and redeem tokens and update balances between multiple client wallets  as well as provide interoperability between different tokenisation platforms and existing account-based infrastructure.Tokenisation is a relatively nascent market  but the World Economic Forum has estimated it could reach $24tn by 20271. The potential benefits include greater market liquidity and fractionalisation  which could increase access to investment markets for retail investors  and enable institutional investors to build stronger portfolios.Tom Zschach  Chief Innovation Officer at SWIFT  said: “ Digital currencies and tokens have huge potential to shape the way we will all pay and invest in the future. But that potential can only be unleashed if the different approaches that are being explored have the ability to connect and work together. We see inclusivity and interoperability as central pillars of the financial ecosystem  and our innovation is a major step towards unlocking the potential of the digital future. For CBDCs  our solution will enable central banks to connect their own networks simply and directly to all the other payments systems in the world through a single gateway  ensuring the instant and smooth flow of cross-border payments.“ Tokenisation has great potential when it comes to strengthening liquidity in markets and increasing access to investment opportunities  and SWIFT’s existing infrastructure can ensure these benefits can be realised at the earliest opportunity  by as many people as possible.”The experiments are part of SWIFT’s extensive innovation agenda in support of its strategic focus on enabling instant  frictionless and interoperable cross-border transactions. The cooperative  which connects more than 11 500 financial institutions and 4 billion accounts across 200 countries and territories  was created to bridge geographies  technologies and currencies. And it has been transforming the underlying infrastructure of the global economy at pace to meet the rapidly changing requirements of businesses and consumers. This includes a new standard  SWIFT Go  for low value payments  and services like Payment Pre-validation that uses predictive intelligence to pre-check international payments before they begin to prevent common mistakes that cause delays.Full details of the experiments  and the results  can be found here:Connecting digital islands: CBDCsConnecting digital islands: tokenised assetsAbout SWIFTSWIFT is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services.

China is well advanced with real-life trials of an e-yuan  while central bank umbrella group  the Bank for International Settlements  has also been running cross-border trials.SWIFT's main advantage though is that its existing network is already usable in over 200 countries and connects more than 11 500 banks and funds.The Belgium-based firm has gone from being virtually unknown outside banking circles to a household name this year after it cut most of Russia's banks off from its network as part of the West's sanctions for the country's invasion of Ukraine.Kerigan said that kind of move could also happen in a new CBDC system  but doubted whether it would stop countries joining one.""Ultimately what most central banks are looking to do is to provide us with a CBDC for the people  the businesses and the organisations in their jurisdiction.""""So a solution that's fast and efficient and that gains access to as many other countries as possible would seem to be an attractive one.""(Additional reporting by Tom Wilson Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Mark Potter)",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.2,0.15,0.65,True,English,"['central bank digital currency network', 'SWIFT', 'blueprint', 'global central bank digital currency', 'Ana Nicolaci da Costa', 'central bank umbrella group', 'one main global connection', 'different underlying CBDC technologies', 'rapid global adoption', 'Financial messaging system', ""individuals' specific needs"", 'Distributed Ledger Technologies', 'new CBDC system', 'national central banks', 'most central banks', 'many other countries', 'different technologies', 'global lenders', 'digital tokens', 'various technologies', 'main hub', 'main advantage', 'other cryptocurrencies', 'attractive one', 'CBDC) network', '8-month experiment', 'last month', 'Standard Chartered', 'fiat money', '90 per cent', 'technological complexities', 'advanced testing', 'next year', 'bicycle wheel', 'fewer breaks', 'greater efficiency', 'potential hurdle', 'Northern Trust', ""tokenised' assets"", 'traditional assets', 'real-life trials', 'International Settlements', 'cross-border trials', 'Belgium-based firm', 'banking circles', 'household name', 'Additional reporting', 'Tom Wilson', 'Mark Potter', 'commercial banks', 'existing network', 'Nick Kerigan', 'separate trial', '14 central', '11,500 banks', '200 countries', 'LONDON', 'SWIFT', 'blueprint', 'France', 'Germany', 'HSBC', 'UBS', 'CBDCs', 'world', 'bitcoin', 'head', 'innovation', 'idea', 'connections', 'counterpart', 'number', 'chain', 'step', 'concerns', 'privacy', 'surveillance', 'Citi', 'Clearstream', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'real-time', 'Bahamas', 'Nigeria', 'China', 'yuan', 'funds', 'Russia', 'West', 'sanctions', 'country', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'kind', 'move', 'people', 'businesses', 'organisations', 'jurisdiction', 'solution', 'access']",2022-10-05,2022-10-06,channelnewsasia.com

Throughout the past six months  we have concentrated our phase III research programs in the field of difficult to treat or resistant hypertension. In this context  we have enrolled the last patient in the FRESH study. This important step will enable us to soon present the results of this study  scheduled for November 7 during the annual conference of the American Heart Association  a major event in the world of cardiology. The presentation of our results during a ""Late-breaking trials"" session dedicated to resistant hypertension demonstrates the interest of the scientific community for novel treatments in the management of this pathology  for which there is little or no alternative. This is why all our teams are proud  committed and determined to be able to change the life of the millions of patients worldwide who are refractory to treatment"".A stronger financial situation reinforced after the capital increase conducted in April 2022During the first half of the 2022 financial year  Quantum Genomics continued to receive payments due under the partnership contracts announced in 2020.Quantum Genomics thus invoiced and collected €2.5 million of income from these partnerships  including €1.9 million of milestones  corresponding to the milestone payments for the first patients recruited in South Korea and Taiwan in the REFRESH study. In addition  €0.6 million was re-invoiced to the partner Biolab for the conduct of the FRESH study in Brazil.Story continuesAt the end of June 2022  operating income was €2.9 million compared with €2.7 million a year earlier. The operating result amounted to (€9.6 million)  compared with (€7.2 million) at the end of June 2021. Personnel expenses remain under control  amid a logical increase in operating expenses due to the continued progress of clinical studies.After accounting for the research tax credit of €1.2 million  net result at June 30  2022 was (€8.8 million). Free cash flow (amount of net disbursements related to operations) was (€11.4 million) over the period.At the end of this half-year  the company's shareholder equity amounted to €19.7 million  compared to €11.4 million at the end of December 2021. This increase is explained by the completion  on April 27  2022  of a €17.5 million capital increase  including €1.9 million subscribed by the pharmaceutical company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar in order to strengthen its cooperation with Quantum Genomics in the context of the marketing and production of firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Turkey.At the end of June 2022  available cash thus reached €19.5 million compared to €13.5 million at December 31  2021  while financial debts were €3.0 million. The latter consist of a €1.5 million state-guaranteed loan granted by BNP and an Innovation R&D loan of €1.5 million obtained from BPIFrance.Cash position as of June 30  2022  allows the Company to fund its activities until the second quarter of 2023. This cash statement does not take into account any payments that may be perceived by the Company from any new pharma partners  especially in the US and in Europe.Summary of financial data at 30 June 2022:Data in €'000 (French standards) 30 JUN 2022 30 JUN 2021 Operating income 2 912.6 2 711.7 Personnel expenses (1 249.9 ) (1 109.7 ) Other operating costs (11 288.2 ) (8 824.8 ) Operating result (9 625.5 ) (7 222.9 ) Financial result (9.6 ) 4.9 Current result before tax (9 635.2 ) (7 218.0 ) Extraordinary result (426.7 ) (130.6 ) Research tax credit 1 212.3 1 168.8 Net result (8 849.5 ) (6 180.2 )Overview of the research programmesThe firibastat development program  now in Phase III for difficult to treat and resistant hypertension  is on track.The last patient in the FRESH study  a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study was enrolled last May  making it possible to have results which will be published shortly on November 7 in the ""late-breaking trials"" session of the prestigious annual conference of the American Heart Association (AHA) in Chicago (USA). The study was supervised by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse event warranting a protocol modification was reported.The Phase III REFRESH study  launched during the 1st half of 2021  was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of a single daily dose of firibastat at 3 months in addition to its long-term safety (6 to 12 months)  and is ongoing. The results of this study  expected mid-2023  and the 6-month safety data will form the basis for the firibastat marketing authorisation application which will be filed with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).In the indication of heart failure  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search continues for a partner to accompany upcoming development activities  and at the same time the development plan is being finalized with relevant Regulatory Authorities.Lastly  during the first half of 2022  Quantum Genomics reinforced its operational teams and its scientific committee by recruiting new and complementary expertise to accompany firbastat registration and support the development of its class of medicinal products with the innovative BAPAI mechanism in new therapeutic indications.Availability of the 6-monthly financial reportThe half-year accounts were approved by the Board of Directors which met on October 4  2022. The procedures for the limited review of the half-year financial information by the Statutory Auditor have been completed and their report has been published.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (S…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today reported topline results from the LIFT Home study  evaluating the safety and feasibility of ARC-EX Therapy when used at home. ARC-EX Therapy is a proprietary non-invasive spinal cord stimulation technology designed to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and other movement disabilities. The Company recently reported its Up-LIFT pivotal study evaluating ARC-EX Therapy in clinics achieved its primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in upper extremity strength and function.“Today’s results from the LIFT Home study support the potential for ARC-EX Therapy to be used safely at home  which would enable people with spinal cord injury to live even more independently ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We expect to launch first in clinics  but as the community gains more experience with ARC-EX Therapy  we envision many patients will also want to use this technology at home.”“To maximize recovery after spinal cord injury  it’s critical that we develop treatments that can be safely and effectively delivered in the home environment ” said Principal Investigator  Candy Tefertiller  PT  DPT  Ph.D.  NCS  Executive Director of Research and Evaluation at Denver’s Craig Hospital. “Integrating home-based therapy not only facilitates opportunities for ongoing recovery  but also allows therapy to focus on more relevant activities for that specific individual.”The LIFT Home study is a single-arm observational study. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ARC-EX Therapy when used at home. Seventeen people were enrolled at five leading spinal cord injury research centers in the United States: Craig Hospital in Denver  Colorado  Shepherd Center in Atlanta  Georgia  Spaulding Research Institute in Boston  Massachusetts  University of Minnesota  and the University of Washington. Participants performed training on activities of daily living three times per week over a one-month period. Approximately 97% of these sessions were completed without usability issues  supporting the feasibility of home-based treatment. The absence of any device-related adverse events confirmed the favorable safety results observed during the Up-LIFT Study when ARC-EX Therapy was used in clinics.ONWARD plans to discuss the findings from the LIFT Home study with regulatory authorities to define the appropriate approval pathway for home use  with a goal to facilitate access to ARC-EX Therapy for as long as needed without the burden of continued visits to a clinic.About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for a paraplegic (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for a tetraplegic (paralysis of all four limbs). Treatments are urgently needed to restore movement and improve quality of life.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries. ONWARD’s work builds on more than a decade of basic science and preclinical research conducted at the world’s leading neuroscience laboratories. ONWARD’s ARC Therapy  which can be delivered by implantable (ARC-IM) or external (ARC-EX) systems  is designed to deliver targeted  programmed spinal-cord stimulation to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury  ultimately improving their quality of life.ONWARD has received three Breakthrough Device Designations from the U.S. FDA encompassing both ARC-IM and ARC-EX. ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a wearable stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in September 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  evaluating the ability of ARC-EX Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. The company is now preparing marketing approval submissions for the U.S. and Europe. ARC-IM consists of an implantable pulse generator and lead that is placed near the spinal cord. The company completed its first-in-human use of the ARC-IM neurostimulator in May 2022.ONWARD is headquartered at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven  the Netherlands.

Throughout the past six months  we have concentrated our phase III research programs in the field of difficult to treat or resistant hypertension. In this context  we have enrolled the last patient in the FRESH study. This important step will enable us to soon present the results of this study  scheduled for November 7 during the annual conference of the American Heart Association  a major event in the world of cardiology. The presentation of our results during a ""Late-breaking trials"" session dedicated to resistant hypertension demonstrates the interest of the scientific community for novel treatments in the management of this pathology  for which there is little or no alternative. This is why all our teams are proud  committed and determined to be able to change the life of the millions of patients worldwide who are refractory to treatment"".A stronger financial situation reinforced after the capital increase conducted in April 2022During the first half of the 2022 financial year  Quantum Genomics continued to receive payments due under the partnership contracts announced in 2020.Quantum Genomics thus invoiced and collected €2.5 million of income from these partnerships  including €1.9 million of milestones  corresponding to the milestone payments for the first patients recruited in South Korea and Taiwan in the REFRESH study. In addition  €0.6 million was re-invoiced to the partner Biolab for the conduct of the FRESH study in Brazil.At the end of June 2022  operating income was €2.9 million compared with €2.7 million a year earlier. The operating result amounted to (€9.6 million)  compared with (€7.2 million) at the end of June 2021. Personnel expenses remain under control  amid a logical increase in operating expenses due to the continued progress of clinical studies.After accounting for the research tax credit of €1.2 million  net result at June 30  2022 was (€8.8 million). Free cash flow (amount of net disbursements related to operations) was (€11.4 million) over the period.At the end of this half-year  the company's shareholder equity amounted to €19.7 million  compared to €11.4 million at the end of December 2021. This increase is explained by the completion  on April 27  2022  of a €17.5 million capital increase  including €1.9 million subscribed by the pharmaceutical company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar in order to strengthen its cooperation with Quantum Genomics in the context of the marketing and production of firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Turkey.At the end of June 2022  available cash thus reached €19.5 million compared to €13.5 million at December 31  2021  while financial debts were €3.0 million. The latter consist of a €1.5 million state-guaranteed loan granted by BNP and an Innovation R&D loan of €1.5 million obtained from BPIFrance.Cash position as of June 30  2022  allows the Company to fund its activities until the second quarter of 2023. This cash statement does not take into account any payments that may be perceived by the Company from any new pharma partners  especially in the US and in Europe.Summary of financial data at 30 June 2022:Data in €'000 (French standards) 30 JUN 2022 30 JUN 2021 Operating income 2 912.6 2 711.7 Personnel expenses (1 249.9 ) (1 109.7 ) Other operating costs (11 288.2 ) (8 824.8 ) Operating result (9 625.5 ) (7 222.9 ) Financial result (9.6 ) 4.9 Current result before tax (9 635.2 ) (7 218.0 ) Extraordinary result (426.7 ) (130.6 ) Research tax credit 1 212.3 1 168.8 Net result (8 849.5 ) (6 180.2 )Overview of the research programmesThe firibastat development program  now in Phase III for difficult to treat and resistant hypertension  is on track.The last patient in the FRESH study  a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study was enrolled last May  making it possible to have results which will be published shortly on November 7 in the ""late-breaking trials"" session of the prestigious annual conference of the American Heart Association (AHA) in Chicago (USA). The study was supervised by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse event warranting a protocol modification was reported.The Phase III REFRESH study  launched during the 1st half of 2021  was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of a single daily dose of firibastat at 3 months in addition to its long-term safety (6 to 12 months)  and is ongoing. The results of this study  expected mid-2023  and the 6-month safety data will form the basis for the firibastat marketing authorisation application which will be filed with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).In the indication of heart failure  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search continues for a partner to accompany upcoming development activities  and at the same time the development plan is being finalized with relevant Regulatory Authorities.Lastly  during the first half of 2022  Quantum Genomics reinforced its operational teams and its scientific committee by recruiting new and complementary expertise to accompany firbastat registration and support the development of its class of medicinal products with the innovative BAPAI mechanism in new therapeutic indications.Availability of the 6-monthly financial reportThe half-year accounts were approved by the Board of Directors which met on October 4  2022. The procedures for the limited review of the half-year financial information by the Statutory Auditor have been completed and their report has been published.

This unusual pharmacokinetic profile could be explained by a strong efflux of the active drug by the intestinal efflux pumps from the blood to the GI lumen.The patient case presented suffers from a severe Clostridioides difficile infection. His White Blood Cells count  an inflammatory marker  rapidly dropped after inclusion  remained in the upper limit during 8 days and was normal at the end of the treatment. The diarrhea episodes improved after 6 days of treatment and came back to normal 10 days after treatment after a transient constipation period. DNV3681 concentrations in feces were several order of magnitude higher than DNV3681 MIC901.Georges Gaudriault  Chief Scientific Officer of DEINOVE who attended the ESCMID/ASM conference in Dublin specifies: « The use of DNV3837 is a potential paradigm shift. The intestine is a complex organ and CDI is not simply a topical disease of its epithelium. In order to treat efficiently the infection and avoid the persistence and/or recurrence of the infection  it is critical to treat this organ as a whole. DNV3837 is the first parenteral drug targeting the intestine and generating high exposure of DNV3681 in the intestinal tissue  as showcased today. »***ABOUT CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTIONS (CDI)More than 40% of hospitalized patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have been classified as severe disease associated with higher morbidity and mortality2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies CDI as one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections  ahead of even MRSA3 infections. In the United States  it is estimated that CDI causes nearly half a million disease cases each year  and approximately 29 300 deaths4. This condition is not limited to the United States and recent studies5 show that the incidence of this type of infection is greatly underestimated in other parts of the world  such as Europe and Asia.To date  there is no proven therapeutic solution for CDI patients with severe vomiting  ileus and toxic megacolon. The oral route being compromised  the available treatments  which are mostly oral  have difficulty reaching the intestine because of the patient's pathological condition (reduced gastrointestinal motility  intubation  intestinal perforation  etc.)  and the few antibiotics that could be administered intravenously do not cross the gastrointestinal barrier and therefore do not reach the infection site.ABOUT THE DNV3837 ANTIBIOTIC CANDIDATEDNV3837 – a prodrug6 of the DNV3681 molecule (also known as MCB3681) – is a narrow-spectrum  hybrid oxazolidinone-quinolone synthetic antibiotic targeting only Gram-positive bacteria. It is developed as a highly active first-line treatment targeting C. diff. It has demonstrated significant activity and superiority to reference treatments against isolates of C. diff.  regardless of their virulence (including the hyper virulent BI/NAP1/027 strain).DNV3837 is an intravenous antibiotic that  when converted to its active form DNV3681  crosses the gastrointestinal barrier and accumulates in the intestinal lumen  allowing it to precisely target the infection site. Several Phase I trials (on approximately a hundred healthy volunteers) have shown a high concentration of the antibiotic in stools  a strong marker of its presence in the intestine. It has also demonstrated its ability to eliminate Clostridioides bacteria without affecting the gut microbiota.FDA granted the DNV3837 drug with Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and Fast Track status.For more information on the DNV3837 Phase II clinical trial in Clostridioides difficile infections  visit ClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03988855ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized microbiotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infections  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI - code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has around 50 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.com1 MIC : Minimale Inhibitory Concentration.

11068,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/10/05/2528944/0/en/Aramis-Group-Finalization-of-the-acquisition-of-Onlinecars.html,Aramis Group - Finalization of the acquisition of Onlinecars,PRESS RELEASE    Arcueil  October 5  2022     Finalization of the acquisition of Onlinecars  the Austrian market leader for refurbished vehicle sales  ...,English FrenchPRESS RELEASEArcueil  October 5  2022Finalization of the acquisition of Onlinecars the Austrian market leader for refurbished vehicle salesAramis Group [Ticker: ARAMI – ISIN: FR0014003U94]  European leader for B2C online used car sales  operating the Aramisauto  Cardoen  Clicars and CarSupermarket brands in France  Belgium  Spain and the UK respectively  is announcing today that it has finalized its acquisition of Onlinecars in Austria.In June this year  Aramis Group announced that it had made a commitment  subject to minor conditions precedent  particularly concerning antitrust aspects  to acquire all of the capital of Onlinecars (www.onlinecars.at). As the conditions precedent had been cleared  the two companies were able to complete their business combination.Nicolas Chartier and Guillaume Paoli  co-founders1 of Aramis Group: “We are delighted to officially welcome all the teams from Onlinecars to the Aramis Group family. We are counting on Peter Marolin  Onlinecars’ founder  its co-director Thomas Lang and their teams to continue creating more value for Austrian consumers  while accelerating their profitable growth with the Group’s support. By extending its presence to Austria  Aramis Group continues to expand in Europe to ensure the satisfaction of a growing number of customers and is taking a further step towards achieving its ambition to become Europe’s preferred platform for buying used cars online”.As with the Group’s previous acquisitions  the integration of Onlinecars will generate extensive operational synergies and open up opportunities to share experience. In particular  Aramis Group will enable Onlinecars to benefit from its industrial flow management and refurbishing process optimization expertise  as well as its know-how and the tools from its technological and data platform. Alongside this  Onlinecars will help consolidate the major network of suppliers and brands built up by Aramis Group  which represents one of its many competitive advantages.From an accounting perspective  Onlinecars will be consolidated by Aramis Group from October 1  2022  and will therefore contribute over a full year to the company’s performance for FY 2022-23  running from October 1  2022 to September 30  2023. With this operation  the new combined structure will have pro forma full-year revenues of close to €2 billion.With this accretive acquisition for Aramis Group  €27.2 million will be paid out immediately  followed by an earnout based on the performance for the 2024 calendar year. These two elements give a purchase price for Onlinecars with multiples that are close to Aramis Group’s previous acquisitions and consistent with the market levels currently observed taking into consideration the company’s profitability (EBITDA margin over 3%).For reference  this operation is financed entirely by Stellantis  Aramis Group's majority shareholder  which is fully committed to accompanying and supporting its international strategic expansion. Aramis Group also took the opportunity offered by this operation to secure its financing structure. In the current context  the €200 million revolving credit facility (RCF) was canceled. A new credit line was made available by Stellantis and others were renewed. These fixed-rate lines  set up at levels reflecting Stellantis’ financing conditions  without any covenants and repayable at maturity after four and five years  offer a major competitive advantage for Aramis Group in terms of its balance sheet structure. As of September 30  2022  Aramis Group has €255 million of credit lines that can be used without any conditions  with €66 million drawn down (including financing for Onlinecars).***About Aramis GroupAramis Group is the European leader for B2C online used car sales.

JPMorgan  which runs one of the keenly tracked global indices  declined to comment on the matter.While Russia's exclusion in the aftermath of Western sanctions has created space for a new entrant into the indices  growing concentration risk involving the Chinese bond markets has helped burnish New Delhi's allure with global investors.

Before they come to India  they are required to register as an FPI  which takes three to six months. One of the experts said to ET that those smaller index constituents are not willing to back India's inclusion in the JPMorgan global bond index  vetoing the proposal in effect.India’s entry into the global bond indices backed by heavyweight Investors  fundsThe heavyweight and funds such as PIMCO (Pacific Investment Management Company)  the Ashmore Group  Blackrock or Singapore's GIC (formerly known as Government of Singapore Investment Corporation) are  however  in favour of India’s inclusion in the global bond indices. If India is included in the indices  it could ensure potential inflows of up to $30 billion into Indian fixed-income securities.A local debt fund manager said to ET  “For them  it is a way of mitigating concentration risk arising out of China.""These top international funds have been investing in India across asset classes and are well-versed in local laws.While the absence of Russia as a result of Western sanctions made room for a new participant in the indices  the growing concentration risk associated with the Chinese bond has enhanced New Delhi's appeal to international investors  reported ET.Separately  discussions about tax matters and Euroclear settlement are in progress. However  the main barrier is pushback from small funds  who think the administrative burdens and returns are not equitable.The inclusion of India is anticipated to start with an onshore route  where a group of 22 government debt securities would be made available to international bond through the Fully Accessible Route  a special window that allows non-residents to invest without any restrictions.",neutral,0.06,0.86,0.07,negative,0.02,0.11,0.87,True,English,"['Small portfolio investors', 'global bond indices', 'India', 'inclusion', 'three to six months', 'Pacific Investment Management Company', 'local debt fund manager', 'JPMorgan global bond index', 'smaller index constituents', 'global financial heavyweights', 'The Economic Times', 'Indian fixed-income securities', 'Singapore Investment Corporation', '22 government debt securities', 'Fully Accessible Route', 'global bond indices', 'growing concentration risk', 'top international funds', 'international bond', 'local laws', 'Chinese bond', 'onshore route', 'international investors', 'foreign portfolio', 'regulatory environment', 'independent entities', 'potential inflows', 'asset classes', 'Western sanctions', 'new participant', 'New Delhi', 'tax matters', 'Euroclear settlement', 'main barrier', 'administrative burdens', 'special window', ""funds' reluctance"", 'small funds', 'heavyweight Investors', 'Ashmore Group', 'inclusion', 'FPI', 'people', 'know', 'capital', 'costs', 'regulations', 'benefits', 'experts', 'proposal', 'effect', 'entry', 'PIMCO', 'Blackrock', 'GIC', 'favour', 'way', 'China', 'absence', 'Russia', 'result', 'room', 'appeal', 'discussions', 'progress', 'pushback', 'returns', 'non-residents', 'restrictions']",2022-10-06,2022-10-06,business-standard.com

Most don't want to be left behind by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  but are grappling with technological complexities.SWIFT's head of innovation Nick Kerigan said its trial  which will be followed by more advanced testing over the next year  resembled a bicycle wheel where 14 central and commercial banks in total connected spoke-like into its main hub.The idea is that once scaled-up  banks may need only one main global connection  rather than thousands if they were to set up connections with each counterpart individually.""We believe that the number of connections needed is much fewer "" Kerigan said. ""Therefore  you are likely to have fewer breaks (in the chain) and you are likely to achieve greater efficiency.""CBDCs are being seen as a step forward as they could effectively be programmed to meet both governments' and individuals' specific needs  although they have also raised concerns about privacy and surveillance.SWIFT's trial also tested different underlying CBDC technologies known as Distributed Ledger Technologies. The use of various technologies has also been raised as a potential hurdle for rapid global adoption.There was a separate trial too carried out with Citi  clearing house Clearstream and Northern Trust on 'tokenised' assets - traditional assets like stocks and bonds transformed into digital tokens that can then be issued and traded in real-time.Story continuesSome countries such as the Bahamas and Nigeria already have CBDCs up and running. China is well advanced with real-life trials of an e-yuan  while central bank umbrella group  the Bank for International Settlements  has also been running cross-border trials.SWIFT's main advantage though is that its existing network is already usable in over 200 countries and connects more than 11 500 banks and funds.The Belgium-based firm has gone from being virtually unknown outside banking circles to a household name this year after it cut most of Russia's banks off from its network as part of the West's sanctions for the country's invasion of Ukraine.Kerigan said that kind of move could also happen in a new CBDC system  but doubted whether it would stop countries joining one.""Ultimately what most central banks are looking to do is to provide us with a CBDC for the people  the businesses and the organisations in their jurisdiction.""""So a solution that's fast and efficient and that gains access to as many other countries as possible would seem to be an attractive one.""(Additional reporting by Tom Wilson Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Mark Potter)",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.26,0.18,0.56,True,English,"['central bank digital currency network', 'SWIFT', 'blueprint', 'global central bank digital currency', 'Ana Nicolaci da Costa', 'central bank umbrella group', 'one main global connection', 'different underlying CBDC technologies', 'rapid global adoption', 'Financial messaging system', ""individuals' specific needs"", 'Distributed Ledger Technologies', 'new CBDC system', 'national central banks', 'most central banks', 'many other countries', 'different technologies', 'global lenders', 'digital tokens', 'various technologies', 'main hub', 'main advantage', 'other cryptocurrencies', 'attractive one', 'CBDC) network', 'Marc Jones', '8-month experiment', 'last month', 'Standard Chartered', 'fiat money', 'technological complexities', 'advanced testing', 'next year', 'bicycle wheel', 'fewer breaks', 'greater efficiency', 'potential hurdle', 'Northern Trust', ""tokenised' assets"", 'traditional assets', 'real-life trials', 'International Settlements', 'cross-border trials', 'Belgium-based firm', 'banking circles', 'household name', 'Additional reporting', 'Tom Wilson', 'Mark Potter', 'commercial banks', 'existing network', 'Nick Kerigan', 'separate trial', '14 central', '11,500 banks', '200 countries', 'LONDON', 'Reuters', 'SWIFT', 'blueprint', 'France', 'Germany', 'HSBC', 'UBS', 'CBDCs', 'world', 'bitcoin', 'head', 'innovation', 'idea', 'connections', 'counterpart', 'number', 'chain', 'step', 'concerns', 'privacy', 'surveillance', 'Citi', 'Clearstream', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'real-time', 'Story', 'Bahamas', 'Nigeria', 'China', 'yuan', 'funds', 'Russia', 'West', 'sanctions', 'country', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'kind', 'move', 'people', 'businesses', 'organisations', 'jurisdiction', 'solution', 'access']",2022-10-05,2022-10-06,finance.yahoo.com

China is well advanced with real-life trials of an e-yuan  while central bank umbrella group  the Bank for International Settlements  has also been running cross-border trials.SWIFT’s main advantage though is that its existing network is already usable in over 200 countries and connects more than 11 500 banks and funds.The Belgium-based firm has gone from being virtually unknown outside banking circles to a household name this year after it cut most of Russia’s banks off from its network as part of the West’s sanctions for the country’s invasion of Ukraine.Kerigan said that kind of move could also happen in a new CBDC system  but doubted whether it would stop countries joining one.“Ultimately what most central banks are looking to do is to provide us with a CBDC for the people  the businesses and the organisations in their jurisdiction.”“So a solution that’s fast and efficient and that gains access to as many other countries as possible would seem to be an attractive one.”Also Read: Liminal partners with Web3.0 platform ‘Unifarm’Follow us on Twitter  Facebook  LinkedIn,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.2,0.17,0.63,True,English,"['central bank digital currency network', 'SWIFT', 'blueprint', 'global central bank digital currency', 'central bank umbrella group', 'one main global connection', 'different underlying CBDC technologies', 'rapid global adoption', 'Financial messaging system', 'individuals’ specific needs', 'Distributed Ledger Technologies', 'new CBDC system', 'national central banks', 'most central banks', 'many other countries', 'different technologies', 'global lenders', 'digital tokens', 'various technologies', 'main hub', 'main advantage', 'other cryptocurrencies', 'attractive one', 'CBDC) network', '8-month experiment', 'last month', 'Standard Chartered', 'fiat money', 'technological complexities', 'advanced testing', 'next year', 'bicycle wheel', 'fewer breaks', 'greater efficiency', 'potential hurdle', 'Northern Trust', 'tokenised’ assets', 'traditional assets', 'real-life trials', 'International Settlements', 'cross-border trials', 'Belgium-based firm', 'banking circles', 'household name', 'Liminal partners', 'commercial banks', 'existing network', 'Nick Kerigan', 'separate trial', '14 central', '11,500 banks', '200 countries', 'SWIFT', 'blueprint', 'France', 'Germany', 'HSBC', 'UBS', 'CBDCs', 'world', 'bitcoin', 'head', 'innovation', 'idea', 'connections', 'counterpart', 'number', 'chain', 'step', 'concerns', 'privacy', 'surveillance', 'Citi', 'Clearstream', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'real-time', 'Bahamas', 'Nigeria', 'China', 'yuan', 'funds', 'Russia', 'West', 'sanctions', 'country', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'kind', 'move', 'people', 'businesses', 'organisations', 'jurisdiction', 'solution', 'access', 'Web', '3.0 platform', 'Unifarm', 'Twitter', 'Facebook', 'LinkedIn']",2022-10-06,2022-10-06,financialexpress.com

The 20-year contract will supply around 300 gigawatthours of renewable energy every year via a wheeling arrangement to RBM’s smelting and processing facilities in KwaZulu-Natal.With this CPPA  RBM will enjoy a more reliable long-term access to power while reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) by at least 10%  or 237 000 tons per year  the equivalent to removing more than 50 000 cars from the road.The electricity will be generated by Voltalia’s Bolobedu site  a 148 megawatt solar plant to be built in the Limpopo province in north-eastern South Africa. The power plant will benefit from the region’s good solar conditions and grid availability. It will generate green electricity for a volume equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of more than 425 000 inhabitants. Voltalia will ensure the development  construction and operation of the plant. It is expected to begin generating in 2024.As part of its mission  Voltalia will work to ensure the Bolobedu solar project has a positive impact on the environment and on the surrounding communities by creating local employment opportunities. A total workforce of more than 700 people is expected during construction  with a workforce of around 50 people once the plant becomes operational. In support of South Africa’s growing renewable energy sector value chain  Voltalia will also work to source goods and services locally.Story continuesRio Tinto Minerals Chief Executive Sinead Kaufman said: ""The agreement  which is a first step towards reducing RBM’s carbon emissions  is a major milestone and one that is in line with Rio Tinto’s decarbonization strategy. As this solar energy project progresses  we will continue exploring additional renewable solutions that further reduce of our emissions in South Africa and make Richards Bay Minerals a contributor to our net zero commitment"".Voltalia CEO Sébastien Clerc said: ""We are very pleased to support RBM as its decarbonises its industrial activities in South Africa. The Bolobedu photovoltaic power plant will be our biggest project in Africa  after performing construction of a series of other solar plants for us or for clients  in the continent (Zimbabwe  Burundi  Tanzania  Kenya  Mauritania and Egypt). This project is the first of our South African large solar-and-wind portfolio under development  in areas with grid connection available  that will be ready to support our clients to overpass the actual energy crisis with affordable  clean and stable electricity"".Next on the agenda : Third quarter revenues   on October 19  2022 (after market close)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

The Platform is disease agnostic  meaning it can be applied to any disease and is capable of rapidly generating novel targets at scale. These latest milestones provide additional validation for BenevolentAI’s disease-agnostic approach  which has so far delivered five novel targets to AstraZeneca’s portfolio  two for CKD and three for IPF. The collaboration was also expanded for a further three years into two new disease areas — heart failure and systemic lupus erythematosus — in January 2022.Through the collaboration  BenevolentAI integrates AstraZeneca’s data into its biomedical Knowledge Graph  which has the ability to rapidly normalise and contextualise a diverse range of external and internal data from numerous sources including  but not limited to  scientific literature  patents  genetics  chemistry and clinical trials. BenevolentAI and AstraZeneca scientists work side-by-side  using the Platform and Knowledge Graph to interrogate underlying disease mechanisms  frame and test hypotheses and rapidly identify novel targets. New knowledge generated through the disease programmes is also fed back into the Platform  improving the quality of future drug target predictions.Joanna Shields  Chief Executive Officer at BenevolentAI  commented: “We are pleased that AstraZeneca has selected a further two novel targets from our collaboration to enter its portfolio. These milestones provide repeated validation of BenevolentAI’s drug discovery Platform  which has demonstrated significant momentum in identifying novel targets across a range of therapeutic indications. We look forward to further successes in our collaboration.”Mene Pangalos  Executive Vice President  BioPharmaceuticals R&D  AstraZeneca  commented: ""In order to deliver the next wave of life-changing medicines it is important we identify the right drug targets that can transform disease. Our ongoing collaboration with BenevolentAI is helping us to uncover novel rare variants of complex diseases  such as IPF and CKD. By combining the power of AI with human expertise we are bringing new drug targets into our portfolio.”ENDSAbout BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery and development company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.

Now integrated into DEINOVE's discovery process  this Lab-on-a-chip platform significantly accelerates the identification and characterization of bacteria with biological activity of interest  whether in the field of antimicrobials or in many other fields ” declared Alexis RIDEAU  Chief Executive Officer of DEINOVE. He added  “Regarding our Phase II clinical trial  the use of DNV3837 is a potential paradigm shift for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection  as presented yesterday at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in Dublin. Indeed  DNV3837 could become the first intravenous targeted antibiotic therapy in Clostridioides difficile infections.”SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATAThe DEINOVE Group’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30  2022 were certified by the Group’s Statutory Auditors  the firm PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers).PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT(in thousands of euros) 30/06/22 30/06/21 Operating revenues 185 475 Of which operating grants 4 167 Operating costs 4 061 4 142 Of which Research & Development costs 3 411 3 479 Of which General & Administrative costs 650 663 OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (3 876) (3 667) Goodwill amortization 256 256 OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS AFTER GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (4 132) (3 923) PROFIT/LOSS (37) (14) PROFIT/LOSS FROM NON-RECURRING ACTIVITIES 22 19 Income tax and deferred taxes (588) (771) Results from equity affiliates (MEQ) - - CONSOLIDATED GROUP PROFIT/LOSS (3 559) (3 146)(in thousands of euros) 30/06/22 30/06/21 Term deposit - - Provision for impairment of marketable securities - - Cash on hand 1 102 3 843 ICNE & bank overdrafts - - CASH & CASH EQUIVALENTS 1 102 3 843OPERATIONAL PROGRESS DURING THE PERIOD AND POST-CLOSINGPhase II testing the antibiotic candidate DNV3837 in severe Clostridioides difficile infectionThis clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and the pharmacokinetics of DNV3837 in patients with Clostridioides difficile gastrointestinal infection (CDI). This trial is being conducted in the United States  according to a sequential protocol:The first step aims to treat a cohort of 10 patients with moderate to severe CDI with DNV3837. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has completed its review of the safety data from the first part of the trial and considered that the benefit/risk balance of antibiotic therapy with DNV3837 was in favor of continuing the recruitment in this trial. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic  the first part of the trial was limited to 9 patients instead of 10.The second step aims to treat 30 patients with severe CDI will be conducted in an “open-label” manner  as DNV3837 is administered intravenously  while the standards of care are administered orally.The experience acquired during this first part of the study has made it possible to improve the trial protocol  with a reduction in dose by a factor of 4 and a reduction in the duration of administration by a factor of 2  reducing the intravenous treatment from 12 to 6 hours per day. This improvement simplifies the management of the trial for the investigating physicians and their teams.Because of the Covid-19 pandemic impacts  results of the first part of the trial should be published by the end of the half of 2023. New preclinical data and a patient case from the ongoing Phase II trial were presented at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in Dublin on October 5  2022.DEINOVE reaches the first milestones of the Boost-ID project  selected as part of the France Relance plan  with the operational installation of its microfluidic screening platformIn May 2022  the Company announced that it has reached the first objectives and milestones set in the Boost−ID project (Bacteria Optimum Output Screening Tool for treating Infectious Diseases)  selected in early 2021 by the France Relance plan.

The main variances are as follows:Decrease in revenue generated by DEINOVE with a total of €124K or -€137K and −53%. The revenue is generated by: Work carried out in the framework of collaborative research agreements such as the one concluded with DSM (€81K against €84K in 2021); Revenues from the distribution of ingredients produced by DEINOVE and distributed by partners in the cosmetics field (€43K against €177K).Operating subsidies down by €163K  or -98%: Deinove did not receive any major subsidies in the first half of 2022; only State subsidies relating to an apprenticeship contract are recorded in this first half.Reversal of provisions and expense transfers: €57K  of which €47K were generated by a transfer of deferred expenses related to the financing of the convertible bond issue with L1 Capital  and by the reversal of the provision for the end-of-career indemnity (€22K).During the first half of 2022  the Group’s operating expenses reached €4.1M  of which 84% was spent on R&D activities. The net change in operating expenses between the first halves of 2021 and 2022 amounted to -€81K (-2%). Personnel expenses also decreased by 5%  in line with the evolution of the workforce: 44 average full-time equivalents (FTE) in the first half of 2022 compared to 50 in 2021.NET INCOMEThe consolidated net loss for the period amounts to €3.6M  negligibly impacted by exceptional items (positive exceptional result of €22K).The negative financial result of -€37K is mainly due to financial expenses related to the pre-financing of the Research Tax Credit (-€15K) and interest expenses on loans (-€20K).Income tax comprises exclusively the Research Tax Credit. The Group’s receivable for the first half of 2022 has been estimated at €588K (compared to €771K in 2021).NET RESULTIn the first half of 2022  3 299 045 new shares under the convertible bond agreement.The previous contract of July 9  2019 expired on July 9  2021  DEINOVE announced that it had entered into a new agreement for a convertible bond financing with the European Select Growth Opportunities Fund  representing a bond issue of a maximum nominal amount of €10 million  and divided into several tranches of a nominal amount of €500 000 for each tranche. The first tranche of €500 000 was issued simultaneously with the signing of the agreement with European Select Growth Opportunities Fund.The 34 378 066 shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.02 making up the capital as of June 30  2022  are broken down as follows:Year ended June 30  2022 – non-diluted basis Shareholders Number of shares % of holding Voting rights % Funds managed by Truffle Capital 1 765 867 5.14% 3 462 864 9.61% Scientific founders 20 000 0.06% 40 000 0.11% Management and Board members 0 0.00% 0 0.00% Free float 32 592 199 94.81% 32 532 447 90.28% TOTAL 34 378 066 100.00% 36 035 311 100.00%FINANCIAL SITUATIONAs of June 30  2022  the Group's net cash position was EUR 1 102K. This level of cash does not include the drawdown of two new tranches of OCA 2021 for a total amount of EUR 750 000 (EUR 727 500 net of fees) on August 30 and September 30  2022.As indicated in the press release dated August 3  2022  the drawdown of these two tranches and of the next tranche of a nominal amount of EUR 250 000 on November 30  2022  subject to compliance with certain conditions  would extend the Company's cash horizon to November 2022.Thus  given the Company's expense structure and cash flow forecasts  the securing of its financial position remains conditional on its ability to find financing solutions. The continuity of its operations depends on this.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.08,0.89,0.03,mixed,0.2,0.2,0.6,True,English,"['financial results', 'first half', 'DEINOVE', 'advancement', 'programs', '2022', 'France Relance plan Group net income', 'independent Data Safety Monitoring Board', 'first intravenous targeted antibiotic therapy', 'OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION', 'ultra-high throughput bacterial screening', 'Clostridioides difficile gastrointestinal infection', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'operating cost reduction plan', 'ongoing Phase II trial', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'Clostridioides difficile infections', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'French biotech company', 'urgent, global challenge', 'microfluidic droplet technology', 'many other fields', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'potential paradigm shift', 'CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA', 'New preclinical data', 'consolidated financial statements', 'Covid-19 pandemic impacts', 'CONSOLIDATED GROUP PROFIT', 'Group cash position', 'safety data', 'Income tax', 'The DEINOVE Group', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'intravenous treatment', 'antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic candidate', 'operating expenses', 'Operating revenues', 'operating grants', 'Operating costs', 'financial situation', '5 new centers', 'new shares', 'severe CDI', 'First milestones', 'first step', 'Boost-ID project', 'first half', 'lower revenues', 'cosmetic activity', 'R&D', 'OC agreement', '4th tranche', 'ESGO Fund', 'financing solutions', 'strategic execution', 'industrial platform', 'discovery process', 'chip platform', 'biological activity', 'Alexis RIDEAU', 'ESCMID/ASM Conference', 'Statutory Auditors', 'NON-RECURRING ACTIVITIES', 'deferred taxes', 'equity affiliates', 'marketable securities', 'bank overdrafts', 'OPERATIONAL PROGRESS', 'United States', 'sequential protocol', 'moderate to', 'second step', 'open-label” manner', '12 to 6 hours', 'investigating physicians', 'patient case', 'operational inst', 'first part', 'CASH EQUIVALENTS', 'trial protocol', 'LOSS ACCOUNT', 'benefit/risk balance', 'Continuation', 'DNV3837', 'Extension', 'Canada', 'decrease', 'June', '31 December', 'Implementation', 'amendment', 'September', 'March', 'notes', 'amount', 'Search', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'Directors', 'period', 'identification', 'characterization', 'interest', 'antimicrobials', 'use', 'Dublin', 'SUMMARY', 'firm', 'PwC', 'thousands', 'euros', 'Development', 'General', 'Administrative', 'Results', 'MEQ', 'Provision', 'impairment', 'hand', 'ICNE', 'POST-CLOSING', 'efficacy', 'pharmacokinetics', 'patients', 'cohort', 'DSMB', 'review', 'favor', 'recruitment', 'standards', 'care', 'experience', 'study', 'dose', 'factor', 'duration', 'administration', 'day', 'improvement', 'management', 'teams', 'October', '2022']",2022-10-06,2022-10-06,finance.yahoo.com

He added  “Regarding our Phase II clinical trial  the use of DNV3837 is a potential paradigm shift for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection  as presented yesterday at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in Dublin. Indeed  DNV3837 could become the first intravenous targeted antibiotic therapy in Clostridioides difficile infections.”SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATAThe DEINOVE Group’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30  2022 were certified by the Group’s Statutory Auditors  the firm PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers).PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT(in thousands of euros) 30/06/22 30/06/21 Operating revenues 185 475 Of which operating grants 4 167 Operating costs 4 061 4 142 Of which Research & Development costs 3 411 3 479 Of which General & Administrative costs 650 663 OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (3 876) (3 667) Goodwill amortization 256 256 OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS AFTER GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (4 132) (3 923) PROFIT/LOSS (37) (14) PROFIT/LOSS FROM NON-RECURRING ACTIVITIES 22 19 Income tax and deferred taxes (588) (771) Results from equity affiliates (MEQ) - - CONSOLIDATED GROUP PROFIT/LOSS (3 559) (3 146)(in thousands of euros) 30/06/22 30/06/21 Term deposit - - Provision for impairment of marketable securities - - Cash on hand 1 102 3 843 ICNE & bank overdrafts - - CASH & CASH EQUIVALENTS 1 102 3 843OPERATIONAL PROGRESS DURING THE PERIOD AND POST-CLOSINGPhase II testing the antibiotic candidate DNV3837 in severe Clostridioides difficile infectionThis clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and the pharmacokinetics of DNV3837 in patients with Clostridioides difficile gastrointestinal infection (CDI). This trial is being conducted in the United States  according to a sequential protocol:The first step aims to treat a cohort of 10 patients with moderate to severe CDI with DNV3837. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has completed its review of the safety data from the first part of the trial and considered that the benefit/risk balance of antibiotic therapy with DNV3837 was in favor of continuing the recruitment in this trial. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic  the first part of the trial was limited to 9 patients instead of 10.The second step aims to treat 30 patients with severe CDI will be conducted in an “open-label” manner  as DNV3837 is administered intravenously  while the standards of care are administered orally.The experience acquired during this first part of the study has made it possible to improve the trial protocol  with a reduction in dose by a factor of 4 and a reduction in the duration of administration by a factor of 2  reducing the intravenous treatment from 12 to 6 hours per day. This improvement simplifies the management of the trial for the investigating physicians and their teams.Because of the Covid-19 pandemic impacts  results of the first part of the trial should be published by the end of the half of 2023. New preclinical data and a patient case from the ongoing Phase II trial were presented at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in Dublin on October 5  2022.DEINOVE reaches the first milestones of the Boost-ID project  selected as part of the France Relance plan  with the operational installation of its microfluidic screening platformIn May 2022  the Company announced that it has reached the first objectives and milestones set in the Boost−ID project (Bacteria Optimum Output Screening Tool for treating Infectious Diseases)  selected in early 2021 by the France Relance plan.

Under the terms of the Amendment (i) the Investor waives  only for 3 new tranches  i.e. tranches 5  6 and 7 of the Initial Agreement  the drawdown condition according to which  following the subscription of a tranche of OC at the request of the Company  the Investor must not hold more than 25% of the number of shares making up the share capital of DEINOVE  either directly or indirectly via the holding of shares and OC  and (ii) it is accompanied by an increase in the discount granted to the Investor upon conversion of the OC into shares  which is raised from 5% to 15%  for all the tranches already subscribed and the tranches to be issued. It is being specified that the other conditions of the Initial Agreement  as described in the press release of September 14  2021  will continue to apply  and that the 5% discount will apply again to any new tranche subscribed from January 1st  2023 as soon as the share price is higher than €0.28 (adjusted as the case may be from any share split or share consolidation) for a period of three (3) consecutive trading days prior to the date of the request made by the Company to the Investor to subscribe to the new tranche.This 5th tranche of OCA 2021  with a nominal value of EUR 500 000 (EUR 485 000 net of fees) was issued by the Company and fully subscribed by the Investor on August 30  2022. This 6th tranche of OCA 2021  with a nominal value of EUR 250 000 (EUR 242 500 net of fees) was issued by the Company and fully subscribed by the Investor on September 30  2022.FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2022OPERATING REVENUEOperating revenues amounted to €185K  down by €290K and -61% compared to the first half of 2021. The main variances are as follows:Decrease in revenue generated by DEINOVE with a total of €124K or -€137K and −53%. The revenue is generated by: Work carried out in the framework of collaborative research agreements such as the one concluded with DSM (€81K against €84K in 2021); Revenues from the distribution of ingredients produced by DEINOVE and distributed by partners in the cosmetics field (€43K against €177K).Operating subsidies down by €163K  or -98%: Deinove did not receive any major subsidies in the first half of 2022; only State subsidies relating to an apprenticeship contract are recorded in this first half.Reversal of provisions and expense transfers: €57K  of which €47K were generated by a transfer of deferred expenses related to the financing of the convertible bond issue with L1 Capital  and by the reversal of the provision for the end-of-career indemnity (€22K).During the first half of 2022  the Group’s operating expenses reached €4.1M  of which 84% was spent on R&D activities. The net change in operating expenses between the first halves of 2021 and 2022 amounted to -€81K (-2%). Personnel expenses also decreased by 5%  in line with the evolution of the workforce: 44 average full-time equivalents (FTE) in the first half of 2022 compared to 50 in 2021.NET INCOMEThe consolidated net loss for the period amounts to €3.6M  negligibly impacted by exceptional items (positive exceptional result of €22K).The negative financial result of -€37K is mainly due to financial expenses related to the pre-financing of the Research Tax Credit (-€15K) and interest expenses on loans (-€20K).Income tax comprises exclusively the Research Tax Credit. The Group’s receivable for the first half of 2022 has been estimated at €588K (compared to €771K in 2021).NET RESULTIn the first half of 2022  3 299 045 new shares under the convertible bond agreement.The previous contract of July 9  2019 expired on July 9  2021  DEINOVE announced that it had entered into a new agreement for a convertible bond financing with the European Select Growth Opportunities Fund  representing a bond issue of a maximum nominal amount of €10 million  and divided into several tranches of a nominal amount of €500 000 for each tranche. The first tranche of €500 000 was issued simultaneously with the signing of the agreement with European Select Growth Opportunities Fund.The 34 378 066 shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.02 making up the capital as of June 30  2022  are broken down as follows:Year ended June 30  2022 – non-diluted basis Shareholders Number of shares % of holding Voting rights % Funds managed by Truffle Capital 1 765 867 5.14% 3 462 864 9.61% Scientific founders 20 000 0.06% 40 000 0.11% Management and Board members 0 0.00% 0 0.00% Free float 32 592 199 94.81% 32 532 447 90.28% TOTAL 34 378 066 100.00% 36 035 311 100.00%FINANCIAL SITUATIONAs of June 30  2022  the Group's net cash position was EUR 1 102K. This level of cash does not include the drawdown of two new tranches of OCA 2021 for a total amount of EUR 750 000 (EUR 727 500 net of fees) on August 30 and September 30  2022.As indicated in the press release dated August 3  2022  the drawdown of these two tranches and of the next tranche of a nominal amount of EUR 250 000 on November 30  2022  subject to compliance with certain conditions  would extend the Company's cash horizon to November 2022.Thus  given the Company's expense structure and cash flow forecasts  the securing of its financial position remains conditional on its ability to find financing solutions. The continuity of its operations depends on this.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.08,0.89,0.03,mixed,0.2,0.2,0.6,True,English,"['financial results', 'first half', 'DEINOVE', 'advancement', 'programs', '2022', 'independent Data Safety Monitoring Board', 'first intravenous targeted antibiotic therapy', 'OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION', 'ultra-high throughput bacterial screening', 'Clostridioides difficile gastrointestinal infection', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'operating cost reduction plan', 'ongoing Phase II trial', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'Clostridioides difficile infections', 'France Relance plan', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'urgent, global challenge', 'microfluidic droplet technology', 'many other fields', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'potential paradigm shift', 'CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA', 'New preclinical data', 'French biotech company', 'consolidated financial statements', 'Covid-19 pandemic impacts', 'Group net income', 'CONSOLIDATED GROUP PROFIT', 'Group cash position', 'safety data', 'The DEINOVE Group', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'intravenous treatment', 'antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic candidate', 'operating expenses', 'Operating revenues', 'operating grants', 'Operating costs', 'English French', 'financial situation', 'Income tax', '5 new centers', 'new shares', 'severe CDI', 'First milestones', 'first step', 'Boost-ID project', 'first half', 'lower revenues', 'cosmetic activity', 'R&D', 'OC agreement', '4th tranche', 'ESGO Fund', 'financing solutions', 'strategic execution', 'industrial platform', 'discovery process', 'chip platform', 'biological activity', 'Alexis RIDEAU', 'ESCMID/ASM Conference', 'Statutory Auditors', 'NON-RECURRING ACTIVITIES', 'deferred taxes', 'equity affiliates', 'marketable securities', 'bank overdrafts', 'OPERATIONAL PROGRESS', 'United States', 'sequential protocol', 'moderate to', 'second step', 'open-label” manner', '12 to 6 hours', 'investigating physicians', 'patient case', 'first part', 'CASH EQUIVALENTS', 'trial protocol', 'LOSS ACCOUNT', 'benefit/risk balance', 'Continuation', 'DNV3837', 'Extension', 'Canada', 'decrease', 'June', '31 December', 'Implementation', 'amendment', 'September', 'March', 'notes', 'amount', 'Search', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'Directors', 'period', 'identification', 'characterization', 'interest', 'antimicrobials', 'use', 'Dublin', 'SUMMARY', 'firm', 'PwC', 'thousands', 'euros', 'Development', 'General', 'Administrative', 'Results', 'MEQ', 'Provision', 'impairment', 'hand', 'ICNE', 'POST-CLOSING', 'efficacy', 'pharmacokinetics', 'patients', 'cohort', 'DSMB', 'review', 'favor', 'recruitment', 'standards', 'care', 'experience', 'study', 'dose', 'factor', 'duration', 'administration', 'day', 'improvement', 'management', 'teams', 'October', '2022']",2022-10-06,2022-10-06,globenewswire.com

The 20-year contract will supply around 300 gigawatthours of renewable energy every year via a wheeling arrangement to RBM’s smelting and processing facilities in KwaZulu-Natal.With this CPPA  RBM will enjoy a more reliable long-term access to power while reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) by at least 10%  or 237 000 tons per year  the equivalent to removing more than 50 000 cars from the road.The electricity will be generated by Voltalia’s Bolobedu site  a 148 megawatt solar plant to be built in the Limpopo province in north-eastern South Africa. The power plant will benefit from the region’s good solar conditions and grid availability. It will generate green electricity for a volume equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of more than 425 000 inhabitants. Voltalia will ensure the development  construction and operation of the plant. It is expected to begin generating in 2024.As part of its mission  Voltalia will work to ensure the Bolobedu solar project has a positive impact on the environment and on the surrounding communities by creating local employment opportunities. A total workforce of more than 700 people is expected during construction  with a workforce of around 50 people once the plant becomes operational. In support of South Africa’s growing renewable energy sector value chain  Voltalia will also work to source goods and services locally.Rio Tinto Minerals Chief Executive Sinead Kaufman said: ""The agreement  which is a first step towards reducing RBM’s carbon emissions  is a major milestone and one that is in line with Rio Tinto’s decarbonization strategy. As this solar energy project progresses  we will continue exploring additional renewable solutions that further reduce of our emissions in South Africa and make Richards Bay Minerals a contributor to our net zero commitment"".Voltalia CEO Sébastien Clerc said: ""We are very pleased to support RBM as its decarbonises its industrial activities in South Africa. The Bolobedu photovoltaic power plant will be our biggest project in Africa  after performing construction of a series of other solar plants for us or for clients  in the continent (Zimbabwe  Burundi  Tanzania  Kenya  Mauritania and Egypt). This project is the first of our South African large solar-and-wind portfolio under development  in areas with grid connection available  that will be ready to support our clients to overpass the actual energy crisis with affordable  clean and stable electricity"".Next on the agenda : Third quarter revenues   on October 19  2022 (after market close)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

GTT......,English FrenchGTT membrane technology to equip a major international scientific project  the Deep Underground Neutrino ExperimentParis – October 6th  2022. GTT announces that it has been awarded a contract by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to support research work for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment1 (“DUNE”) under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fermi National Laboratory (“Fermilab”). Under this contract  GTT will provide engineering and construction studies for the adaptation of its membrane technology inside a cryostat2 designed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and its partners.DUNE is a major international experiment that aims to increase the understanding of neutrinos. The project takes advantage of the neutrinos produced by the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab  which are subsequently screened in the particle detectors filled with liquid argon. Liquid argon used in this experimental context has to be maintained at an extremely stable temperature of -186°C  in an environment that secures  through perfect tightness  the purity of materials and a high level of thermal isolation.This new contract follows the contract signed by GTT in 2018 with the CERN3  on behalf of the LBNF/DUNE4-US Project. In the framework of this previous collaboration  GTT contributed the final design of the far detector cryostats. The new contract will focus on the inner vessel design installed inside a warm support structure  for the liquid argon near detector.Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and CEO of GTT  declared: “This new contract showcases the reliability and flexibility of the technologies developed by the GTT group. We are proud to provide technologies that can meet the technical and scientific requirements of the DUNE project  and to work with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  one of the most prestigious National Laboratories in the United States.”Fabrice Matichard  Lead Engineer for the LBNF/DUNE-US Near Detector Subproject and Head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Mechanical Engineering department stated: “Our collaboration with GTT will provide the membrane technology for the liquid argon detector. This new cryostat design incorporates features such as the ability to travel on rails and a low-density composite wall to probe neutrinos with the level of precision required by the DUNE experiment.”About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases. For over 50 years  GTT has been designing and providing cutting-edge technologies for a better energy performance  which combine operational efficiency and safety  to equip LNG carriers  floating terminals  land storage  and multi-gas carriers. GTT also develops systems dedicated to the use of LNG as fuel  as well as a full range of services  including digital services in the field of Smart Shipping. The Group is also active in hydrogen through its subsidiary Elogen  which designs and assembles electrolysers notably for the production of green hydrogen.GTT is listed on Euronext Paris  Compartment A (ISIN FR0011726835 Euronext Paris: GTT) and is notably included in SBF 120  Stoxx Europe 600 and MSCI Small Cap indices.For more information  visit www.gtt.fr .Media contact:press@gtt.fr / +33 (0)1 30 23 48 45Investor Relations contact:information-financiere@gtt.fr / + 33 (0)1 30 23 20 871 More information about the DUNE project: https://www.dunescience.org/2 A cryostat is a device by which temperature can be maintained at a very low level.

As the EV market grows rapidly  convenient access to charging has become a priority. In Europe  IHS Markit forecasts that the cumulative deployment of EV charging stations will increase at 24% CAGR during the 2020-30 periodi.The ""Mobilize Powerbox®ii from Software République is an innovative technology demonstrator addressing several key objectives in Europe to:Facilitate access to recharging for all users of EVs.Contribute to the intelligent management of electricity networks.Provide a solution to the cybersecurity risks in the integration of EV charging networks.Strengthen the industrial and technological sovereignty of this new market segment.The charging station  with a power range of 7 to 22 kW  integrates the expertise of:Orange in 4G telecommunications and related services.Renault Group in the architecture of Electric Vehicle charging systems.STMicroelectronics in semiconductors  with its microprocessor (1) and communication coprocessor (2) ensuring an interoperable solution capable of providing intelligent charging services  especially bidirectional V2G (vehicle-to-grid) charging.Thales cybersecurity and data protection - thanks to Thales' secure access and credential management system  which is fully compliant with interoperability standards.The project members also teamed with other technology partners for their expertise  including IoTecha Corp  for the electronic design of the charging station  and LACROIX for its manufacture at Symbiose  the company’s new electronics assembly factory of the future in France. In collaboration with Mobilize — the Renault Group brand dedicated to new mobility — the products of the “Mobilize Powerbox®” range will be marketed in 2023. The bidirectional version will allow the storage capacity of a vehicle's Li-ion battery to be used as an energy source. Without impacting the autonomy required for mobility and with complete simplicity  the system will make it possible to control the flow of energy  to improve the rate of use of renewable energy and to support the electricity network by re-injecting energy into it when needed: a scalable  adaptive charging station that can transform a vehicle into a model power plant. Fifty thousand systems of this type (vehicle and charging station) combined produce the equivalent of a power plant and can thus supplement fossil fuel production. Thus  each owner of the ""Mobilize Powerbox®"" V2G charging station connected to an EV becomes an actor of the ecological transition.With the “Mobilize Powerbox®”  Software République wishes to democratize bidirectional charging functionality and contribute to intelligent energy management. The charging station will be on display at the Mobilize booth (Hall 6) on the media day  October 17  and will be presented by the Software République team at 11 a.m.Technical information(1) ST’s microprocessor (an STM32MP1) is an open platform for the development of industry applications that are increasingly demanding in terms of performance and security.
