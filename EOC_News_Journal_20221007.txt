""For them  it is a way of mitigating concentration risk arising out of China "" said a local debt fund manager.These top global funds have been deploying money in India across asset classes  and are quite familiar with local regulations.Individual investors could not be contacted for comments immediately. JPMorgan  which runs one of the keenly tracked global indices  declined to comment on the matter.While Russia's exclusion in the aftermath of Western sanctions has created space for a new entrant into the indices  growing concentration risk involving the Chinese bond markets has helped burnish New Delhi's allure with global investors.

The 20-year contract will supply around 300 gigawatthours of renewable energy every year via a wheeling arrangement to RBM’s smelting and processing facilities in KwaZulu-Natal.With this CPPA  RBM will enjoy a more reliable long-term access to power while reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) by at least 10%  or 237 000 tons per year  the equivalent to removing more than 50 000 cars from the road.The electricity will be generated by Voltalia’s Bolobedu site  a 148 megawatt solar plant to be built in the Limpopo province in north-eastern South Africa. The power plant will benefit from the region’s good solar conditions and grid availability. It will generate green electricity for a volume equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of more than 425 000 inhabitants. Voltalia will ensure the development  construction and operation of the plant. It is expected to begin generating in 2024.As part of its mission  Voltalia will work to ensure the Bolobedu solar project has a positive impact on the environment and on the surrounding communities by creating local employment opportunities. A total workforce of more than 700 people is expected during construction  with a workforce of around 50 people once the plant becomes operational. In support of South Africa’s growing renewable energy sector value chain  Voltalia will also work to source goods and services locally.Story continuesRio Tinto Minerals Chief Executive Sinead Kaufman said: ""The agreement  which is a first step towards reducing RBM’s carbon emissions  is a major milestone and one that is in line with Rio Tinto’s decarbonization strategy. As this solar energy project progresses  we will continue exploring additional renewable solutions that further reduce of our emissions in South Africa and make Richards Bay Minerals a contributor to our net zero commitment"".Voltalia CEO Sébastien Clerc said: ""We are very pleased to support RBM as its decarbonises its industrial activities in South Africa. The Bolobedu photovoltaic power plant will be our biggest project in Africa  after performing construction of a series of other solar plants for us or for clients  in the continent (Zimbabwe  Burundi  Tanzania  Kenya  Mauritania and Egypt). This project is the first of our South African large solar-and-wind portfolio under development  in areas with grid connection available  that will be ready to support our clients to overpass the actual energy crisis with affordable  clean and stable electricity"".Next on the agenda : Third quarter revenues   on October 19  2022 (after market close)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

The Platform is disease agnostic  meaning it can be applied to any disease and is capable of rapidly generating novel targets at scale. These latest milestones provide additional validation for BenevolentAI’s disease-agnostic approach  which has so far delivered five novel targets to AstraZeneca’s portfolio  two for CKD and three for IPF. The collaboration was also expanded for a further three years into two new disease areas — heart failure and systemic lupus erythematosus — in January 2022.Through the collaboration  BenevolentAI integrates AstraZeneca’s data into its biomedical Knowledge Graph  which has the ability to rapidly normalise and contextualise a diverse range of external and internal data from numerous sources including  but not limited to  scientific literature  patents  genetics  chemistry and clinical trials. BenevolentAI and AstraZeneca scientists work side-by-side  using the Platform and Knowledge Graph to interrogate underlying disease mechanisms  frame and test hypotheses and rapidly identify novel targets. New knowledge generated through the disease programmes is also fed back into the Platform  improving the quality of future drug target predictions.Joanna Shields  Chief Executive Officer at BenevolentAI  commented: “We are pleased that AstraZeneca has selected a further two novel targets from our collaboration to enter its portfolio. These milestones provide repeated validation of BenevolentAI’s drug discovery Platform  which has demonstrated significant momentum in identifying novel targets across a range of therapeutic indications. We look forward to further successes in our collaboration.”Mene Pangalos  Executive Vice President  BioPharmaceuticals R&D  AstraZeneca  commented: ""In order to deliver the next wave of life-changing medicines it is important we identify the right drug targets that can transform disease. Our ongoing collaboration with BenevolentAI is helping us to uncover novel rare variants of complex diseases  such as IPF and CKD. By combining the power of AI with human expertise we are bringing new drug targets into our portfolio.”ENDSAbout BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery and development company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.

This trial is being conducted in the United States  according to a sequential protocol:The first step aims to treat a cohort of 10 patients with moderate to severe CDI with DNV3837. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has completed its review of the safety data from the first part of the trial and considered that the benefit/risk balance of antibiotic therapy with DNV3837 was in favor of continuing the recruitment in this trial. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic  the first part of the trial was limited to 9 patients instead of 10.The second step aims to treat 30 patients with severe CDI will be conducted in an “open-label” manner  as DNV3837 is administered intravenously  while the standards of care are administered orally.The experience acquired during this first part of the study has made it possible to improve the trial protocol  with a reduction in dose by a factor of 4 and a reduction in the duration of administration by a factor of 2  reducing the intravenous treatment from 12 to 6 hours per day. This improvement simplifies the management of the trial for the investigating physicians and their teams.Because of the Covid-19 pandemic impacts  results of the first part of the trial should be published by the end of the half of 2023. New preclinical data and a patient case from the ongoing Phase II trial were presented at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in Dublin on October 5  2022.DEINOVE reaches the first milestones of the Boost-ID project  selected as part of the France Relance plan  with the operational installation of its microfluidic screening platformIn May 2022  the Company announced that it has reached the first objectives and milestones set in the Boost−ID project (Bacteria Optimum Output Screening Tool for treating Infectious Diseases)  selected in early 2021 by the France Relance plan.

The main variances are as follows:Decrease in revenue generated by DEINOVE with a total of €124K or -€137K and −53%. The revenue is generated by: Work carried out in the framework of collaborative research agreements such as the one concluded with DSM (€81K against €84K in 2021); Revenues from the distribution of ingredients produced by DEINOVE and distributed by partners in the cosmetics field (€43K against €177K).Operating subsidies down by €163K  or -98%: Deinove did not receive any major subsidies in the first half of 2022; only State subsidies relating to an apprenticeship contract are recorded in this first half.Reversal of provisions and expense transfers: €57K  of which €47K were generated by a transfer of deferred expenses related to the financing of the convertible bond issue with L1 Capital  and by the reversal of the provision for the end-of-career indemnity (€22K).During the first half of 2022  the Group’s operating expenses reached €4.1M  of which 84% was spent on R&D activities. The net change in operating expenses between the first halves of 2021 and 2022 amounted to -€81K (-2%). Personnel expenses also decreased by 5%  in line with the evolution of the workforce: 44 average full-time equivalents (FTE) in the first half of 2022 compared to 50 in 2021.NET INCOMEThe consolidated net loss for the period amounts to €3.6M  negligibly impacted by exceptional items (positive exceptional result of €22K).The negative financial result of -€37K is mainly due to financial expenses related to the pre-financing of the Research Tax Credit (-€15K) and interest expenses on loans (-€20K).Income tax comprises exclusively the Research Tax Credit. The Group’s receivable for the first half of 2022 has been estimated at €588K (compared to €771K in 2021).NET RESULTIn the first half of 2022  3 299 045 new shares under the convertible bond agreement.The previous contract of July 9  2019 expired on July 9  2021  DEINOVE announced that it had entered into a new agreement for a convertible bond financing with the European Select Growth Opportunities Fund  representing a bond issue of a maximum nominal amount of €10 million  and divided into several tranches of a nominal amount of €500 000 for each tranche. The first tranche of €500 000 was issued simultaneously with the signing of the agreement with European Select Growth Opportunities Fund.The 34 378 066 shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.02 making up the capital as of June 30  2022  are broken down as follows:Year ended June 30  2022 – non-diluted basis Shareholders Number of shares % of holding Voting rights % Funds managed by Truffle Capital 1 765 867 5.14% 3 462 864 9.61% Scientific founders 20 000 0.06% 40 000 0.11% Management and Board members 0 0.00% 0 0.00% Free float 32 592 199 94.81% 32 532 447 90.28% TOTAL 34 378 066 100.00% 36 035 311 100.00%FINANCIAL SITUATIONAs of June 30  2022  the Group's net cash position was EUR 1 102K. This level of cash does not include the drawdown of two new tranches of OCA 2021 for a total amount of EUR 750 000 (EUR 727 500 net of fees) on August 30 and September 30  2022.As indicated in the press release dated August 3  2022  the drawdown of these two tranches and of the next tranche of a nominal amount of EUR 250 000 on November 30  2022  subject to compliance with certain conditions  would extend the Company's cash horizon to November 2022.Thus  given the Company's expense structure and cash flow forecasts  the securing of its financial position remains conditional on its ability to find financing solutions. The continuity of its operations depends on this.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.08,0.89,0.03,mixed,0.2,0.2,0.6,True,English,"['financial results', 'first half', 'DEINOVE', 'advancement', 'programs', '2022', 'France Relance plan Group net income', 'independent Data Safety Monitoring Board', 'first intravenous targeted antibiotic therapy', 'OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION', 'ultra-high throughput bacterial screening', 'Clostridioides difficile gastrointestinal infection', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'operating cost reduction plan', 'ongoing Phase II trial', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'Clostridioides difficile infections', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'French biotech company', 'urgent, global challenge', 'microfluidic droplet technology', 'many other fields', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'potential paradigm shift', 'CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA', 'New preclinical data', 'consolidated financial statements', 'Covid-19 pandemic impacts', 'CONSOLIDATED GROUP PROFIT', 'Group cash position', 'safety data', 'Income tax', 'The DEINOVE Group', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'intravenous treatment', 'antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic candidate', 'operating expenses', 'Operating revenues', 'operating grants', 'Operating costs', 'financial situation', '5 new centers', 'new shares', 'severe CDI', 'First milestones', 'first step', 'Boost-ID project', 'first half', 'lower revenues', 'cosmetic activity', 'R&D', 'OC agreement', '4th tranche', 'ESGO Fund', 'financing solutions', 'strategic execution', 'industrial platform', 'discovery process', 'chip platform', 'biological activity', 'Alexis RIDEAU', 'ESCMID/ASM Conference', 'Statutory Auditors', 'NON-RECURRING ACTIVITIES', 'deferred taxes', 'equity affiliates', 'marketable securities', 'bank overdrafts', 'OPERATIONAL PROGRESS', 'United States', 'sequential protocol', 'moderate to', 'second step', 'open-label” manner', '12 to 6 hours', 'investigating physicians', 'patient case', 'operational inst', 'first part', 'CASH EQUIVALENTS', 'trial protocol', 'LOSS ACCOUNT', 'benefit/risk balance', 'Continuation', 'DNV3837', 'Extension', 'Canada', 'decrease', 'June', '31 December', 'Implementation', 'amendment', 'September', 'March', 'notes', 'amount', 'Search', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'Directors', 'period', 'identification', 'characterization', 'interest', 'antimicrobials', 'use', 'Dublin', 'SUMMARY', 'firm', 'PwC', 'thousands', 'euros', 'Development', 'General', 'Administrative', 'Results', 'MEQ', 'Provision', 'impairment', 'hand', 'ICNE', 'POST-CLOSING', 'efficacy', 'pharmacokinetics', 'patients', 'cohort', 'DSMB', 'review', 'favor', 'recruitment', 'standards', 'care', 'experience', 'study', 'dose', 'factor', 'duration', 'administration', 'day', 'improvement', 'management', 'teams', 'October', '2022']",2022-10-06,2022-10-07,finance.yahoo.com

He added  “Regarding our Phase II clinical trial  the use of DNV3837 is a potential paradigm shift for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection  as presented yesterday at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in Dublin. Indeed  DNV3837 could become the first intravenous targeted antibiotic therapy in Clostridioides difficile infections.”SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATAThe DEINOVE Group’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30  2022 were certified by the Group’s Statutory Auditors  the firm PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers).PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT(in thousands of euros) 30/06/22 30/06/21 Operating revenues 185 475 Of which operating grants 4 167 Operating costs 4 061 4 142 Of which Research & Development costs 3 411 3 479 Of which General & Administrative costs 650 663 OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (3 876) (3 667) Goodwill amortization 256 256 OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS AFTER GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (4 132) (3 923) PROFIT/LOSS (37) (14) PROFIT/LOSS FROM NON-RECURRING ACTIVITIES 22 19 Income tax and deferred taxes (588) (771) Results from equity affiliates (MEQ) - - CONSOLIDATED GROUP PROFIT/LOSS (3 559) (3 146)(in thousands of euros) 30/06/22 30/06/21 Term deposit - - Provision for impairment of marketable securities - - Cash on hand 1 102 3 843 ICNE & bank overdrafts - - CASH & CASH EQUIVALENTS 1 102 3 843OPERATIONAL PROGRESS DURING THE PERIOD AND POST-CLOSINGPhase II testing the antibiotic candidate DNV3837 in severe Clostridioides difficile infectionThis clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and the pharmacokinetics of DNV3837 in patients with Clostridioides difficile gastrointestinal infection (CDI). This trial is being conducted in the United States  according to a sequential protocol:The first step aims to treat a cohort of 10 patients with moderate to severe CDI with DNV3837. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has completed its review of the safety data from the first part of the trial and considered that the benefit/risk balance of antibiotic therapy with DNV3837 was in favor of continuing the recruitment in this trial. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic  the first part of the trial was limited to 9 patients instead of 10.The second step aims to treat 30 patients with severe CDI will be conducted in an “open-label” manner  as DNV3837 is administered intravenously  while the standards of care are administered orally.The experience acquired during this first part of the study has made it possible to improve the trial protocol  with a reduction in dose by a factor of 4 and a reduction in the duration of administration by a factor of 2  reducing the intravenous treatment from 12 to 6 hours per day. This improvement simplifies the management of the trial for the investigating physicians and their teams.Because of the Covid-19 pandemic impacts  results of the first part of the trial should be published by the end of the half of 2023. New preclinical data and a patient case from the ongoing Phase II trial were presented at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in Dublin on October 5  2022.DEINOVE reaches the first milestones of the Boost-ID project  selected as part of the France Relance plan  with the operational installation of its microfluidic screening platformIn May 2022  the Company announced that it has reached the first objectives and milestones set in the Boost−ID project (Bacteria Optimum Output Screening Tool for treating Infectious Diseases)  selected in early 2021 by the France Relance plan.

Under the terms of the Amendment (i) the Investor waives  only for 3 new tranches  i.e. tranches 5  6 and 7 of the Initial Agreement  the drawdown condition according to which  following the subscription of a tranche of OC at the request of the Company  the Investor must not hold more than 25% of the number of shares making up the share capital of DEINOVE  either directly or indirectly via the holding of shares and OC  and (ii) it is accompanied by an increase in the discount granted to the Investor upon conversion of the OC into shares  which is raised from 5% to 15%  for all the tranches already subscribed and the tranches to be issued. It is being specified that the other conditions of the Initial Agreement  as described in the press release of September 14  2021  will continue to apply  and that the 5% discount will apply again to any new tranche subscribed from January 1st  2023 as soon as the share price is higher than €0.28 (adjusted as the case may be from any share split or share consolidation) for a period of three (3) consecutive trading days prior to the date of the request made by the Company to the Investor to subscribe to the new tranche.This 5th tranche of OCA 2021  with a nominal value of EUR 500 000 (EUR 485 000 net of fees) was issued by the Company and fully subscribed by the Investor on August 30  2022. This 6th tranche of OCA 2021  with a nominal value of EUR 250 000 (EUR 242 500 net of fees) was issued by the Company and fully subscribed by the Investor on September 30  2022.FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2022OPERATING REVENUEOperating revenues amounted to €185K  down by €290K and -61% compared to the first half of 2021. The main variances are as follows:Decrease in revenue generated by DEINOVE with a total of €124K or -€137K and −53%. The revenue is generated by: Work carried out in the framework of collaborative research agreements such as the one concluded with DSM (€81K against €84K in 2021); Revenues from the distribution of ingredients produced by DEINOVE and distributed by partners in the cosmetics field (€43K against €177K).Operating subsidies down by €163K  or -98%: Deinove did not receive any major subsidies in the first half of 2022; only State subsidies relating to an apprenticeship contract are recorded in this first half.Reversal of provisions and expense transfers: €57K  of which €47K were generated by a transfer of deferred expenses related to the financing of the convertible bond issue with L1 Capital  and by the reversal of the provision for the end-of-career indemnity (€22K).During the first half of 2022  the Group’s operating expenses reached €4.1M  of which 84% was spent on R&D activities. The net change in operating expenses between the first halves of 2021 and 2022 amounted to -€81K (-2%). Personnel expenses also decreased by 5%  in line with the evolution of the workforce: 44 average full-time equivalents (FTE) in the first half of 2022 compared to 50 in 2021.NET INCOMEThe consolidated net loss for the period amounts to €3.6M  negligibly impacted by exceptional items (positive exceptional result of €22K).The negative financial result of -€37K is mainly due to financial expenses related to the pre-financing of the Research Tax Credit (-€15K) and interest expenses on loans (-€20K).Income tax comprises exclusively the Research Tax Credit. The Group’s receivable for the first half of 2022 has been estimated at €588K (compared to €771K in 2021).NET RESULTIn the first half of 2022  3 299 045 new shares under the convertible bond agreement.The previous contract of July 9  2019 expired on July 9  2021  DEINOVE announced that it had entered into a new agreement for a convertible bond financing with the European Select Growth Opportunities Fund  representing a bond issue of a maximum nominal amount of €10 million  and divided into several tranches of a nominal amount of €500 000 for each tranche. The first tranche of €500 000 was issued simultaneously with the signing of the agreement with European Select Growth Opportunities Fund.The 34 378 066 shares with a nominal value of EUR 0.02 making up the capital as of June 30  2022  are broken down as follows:Year ended June 30  2022 – non-diluted basis Shareholders Number of shares % of holding Voting rights % Funds managed by Truffle Capital 1 765 867 5.14% 3 462 864 9.61% Scientific founders 20 000 0.06% 40 000 0.11% Management and Board members 0 0.00% 0 0.00% Free float 32 592 199 94.81% 32 532 447 90.28% TOTAL 34 378 066 100.00% 36 035 311 100.00%FINANCIAL SITUATIONAs of June 30  2022  the Group's net cash position was EUR 1 102K. This level of cash does not include the drawdown of two new tranches of OCA 2021 for a total amount of EUR 750 000 (EUR 727 500 net of fees) on August 30 and September 30  2022.As indicated in the press release dated August 3  2022  the drawdown of these two tranches and of the next tranche of a nominal amount of EUR 250 000 on November 30  2022  subject to compliance with certain conditions  would extend the Company's cash horizon to November 2022.Thus  given the Company's expense structure and cash flow forecasts  the securing of its financial position remains conditional on its ability to find financing solutions. The continuity of its operations depends on this.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.08,0.89,0.03,mixed,0.2,0.2,0.6,True,English,"['financial results', 'first half', 'DEINOVE', 'advancement', 'programs', '2022', 'independent Data Safety Monitoring Board', 'first intravenous targeted antibiotic therapy', 'OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION', 'ultra-high throughput bacterial screening', 'Clostridioides difficile gastrointestinal infection', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'operating cost reduction plan', 'ongoing Phase II trial', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'Clostridioides difficile infections', 'France Relance plan', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'urgent, global challenge', 'microfluidic droplet technology', 'many other fields', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'potential paradigm shift', 'CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA', 'New preclinical data', 'French biotech company', 'consolidated financial statements', 'Covid-19 pandemic impacts', 'Group net income', 'CONSOLIDATED GROUP PROFIT', 'Group cash position', 'safety data', 'The DEINOVE Group', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'intravenous treatment', 'antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic candidate', 'operating expenses', 'Operating revenues', 'operating grants', 'Operating costs', 'English French', 'financial situation', 'Income tax', '5 new centers', 'new shares', 'severe CDI', 'First milestones', 'first step', 'Boost-ID project', 'first half', 'lower revenues', 'cosmetic activity', 'R&D', 'OC agreement', '4th tranche', 'ESGO Fund', 'financing solutions', 'strategic execution', 'industrial platform', 'discovery process', 'chip platform', 'biological activity', 'Alexis RIDEAU', 'ESCMID/ASM Conference', 'Statutory Auditors', 'NON-RECURRING ACTIVITIES', 'deferred taxes', 'equity affiliates', 'marketable securities', 'bank overdrafts', 'OPERATIONAL PROGRESS', 'United States', 'sequential protocol', 'moderate to', 'second step', 'open-label” manner', '12 to 6 hours', 'investigating physicians', 'patient case', 'first part', 'CASH EQUIVALENTS', 'trial protocol', 'LOSS ACCOUNT', 'benefit/risk balance', 'Continuation', 'DNV3837', 'Extension', 'Canada', 'decrease', 'June', '31 December', 'Implementation', 'amendment', 'September', 'March', 'notes', 'amount', 'Search', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'Directors', 'period', 'identification', 'characterization', 'interest', 'antimicrobials', 'use', 'Dublin', 'SUMMARY', 'firm', 'PwC', 'thousands', 'euros', 'Development', 'General', 'Administrative', 'Results', 'MEQ', 'Provision', 'impairment', 'hand', 'ICNE', 'POST-CLOSING', 'efficacy', 'pharmacokinetics', 'patients', 'cohort', 'DSMB', 'review', 'favor', 'recruitment', 'standards', 'care', 'experience', 'study', 'dose', 'factor', 'duration', 'administration', 'day', 'improvement', 'management', 'teams', 'October', '2022']",2022-10-06,2022-10-07,globenewswire.com

The 20-year contract will supply around 300 gigawatthours of renewable energy every year via a wheeling arrangement to RBM’s smelting and processing facilities in KwaZulu-Natal.With this CPPA  RBM will enjoy a more reliable long-term access to power while reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) by at least 10%  or 237 000 tons per year  the equivalent to removing more than 50 000 cars from the road.The electricity will be generated by Voltalia’s Bolobedu site  a 148 megawatt solar plant to be built in the Limpopo province in north-eastern South Africa. The power plant will benefit from the region’s good solar conditions and grid availability. It will generate green electricity for a volume equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of more than 425 000 inhabitants. Voltalia will ensure the development  construction and operation of the plant. It is expected to begin generating in 2024.As part of its mission  Voltalia will work to ensure the Bolobedu solar project has a positive impact on the environment and on the surrounding communities by creating local employment opportunities. A total workforce of more than 700 people is expected during construction  with a workforce of around 50 people once the plant becomes operational. In support of South Africa’s growing renewable energy sector value chain  Voltalia will also work to source goods and services locally.Rio Tinto Minerals Chief Executive Sinead Kaufman said: ""The agreement  which is a first step towards reducing RBM’s carbon emissions  is a major milestone and one that is in line with Rio Tinto’s decarbonization strategy. As this solar energy project progresses  we will continue exploring additional renewable solutions that further reduce of our emissions in South Africa and make Richards Bay Minerals a contributor to our net zero commitment"".Voltalia CEO Sébastien Clerc said: ""We are very pleased to support RBM as its decarbonises its industrial activities in South Africa. The Bolobedu photovoltaic power plant will be our biggest project in Africa  after performing construction of a series of other solar plants for us or for clients  in the continent (Zimbabwe  Burundi  Tanzania  Kenya  Mauritania and Egypt). This project is the first of our South African large solar-and-wind portfolio under development  in areas with grid connection available  that will be ready to support our clients to overpass the actual energy crisis with affordable  clean and stable electricity"".Next on the agenda : Third quarter revenues   on October 19  2022 (after market close)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

GTT......,English FrenchGTT membrane technology to equip a major international scientific project  the Deep Underground Neutrino ExperimentParis – October 6th  2022. GTT announces that it has been awarded a contract by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to support research work for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment1 (“DUNE”) under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fermi National Laboratory (“Fermilab”). Under this contract  GTT will provide engineering and construction studies for the adaptation of its membrane technology inside a cryostat2 designed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and its partners.DUNE is a major international experiment that aims to increase the understanding of neutrinos. The project takes advantage of the neutrinos produced by the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab  which are subsequently screened in the particle detectors filled with liquid argon. Liquid argon used in this experimental context has to be maintained at an extremely stable temperature of -186°C  in an environment that secures  through perfect tightness  the purity of materials and a high level of thermal isolation.This new contract follows the contract signed by GTT in 2018 with the CERN3  on behalf of the LBNF/DUNE4-US Project. In the framework of this previous collaboration  GTT contributed the final design of the far detector cryostats. The new contract will focus on the inner vessel design installed inside a warm support structure  for the liquid argon near detector.Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and CEO of GTT  declared: “This new contract showcases the reliability and flexibility of the technologies developed by the GTT group. We are proud to provide technologies that can meet the technical and scientific requirements of the DUNE project  and to work with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  one of the most prestigious National Laboratories in the United States.”Fabrice Matichard  Lead Engineer for the LBNF/DUNE-US Near Detector Subproject and Head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Mechanical Engineering department stated: “Our collaboration with GTT will provide the membrane technology for the liquid argon detector. This new cryostat design incorporates features such as the ability to travel on rails and a low-density composite wall to probe neutrinos with the level of precision required by the DUNE experiment.”About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases. For over 50 years  GTT has been designing and providing cutting-edge technologies for a better energy performance  which combine operational efficiency and safety  to equip LNG carriers  floating terminals  land storage  and multi-gas carriers. GTT also develops systems dedicated to the use of LNG as fuel  as well as a full range of services  including digital services in the field of Smart Shipping. The Group is also active in hydrogen through its subsidiary Elogen  which designs and assembles electrolysers notably for the production of green hydrogen.GTT is listed on Euronext Paris  Compartment A (ISIN FR0011726835 Euronext Paris: GTT) and is notably included in SBF 120  Stoxx Europe 600 and MSCI Small Cap indices.For more information  visit www.gtt.fr .Media contact:press@gtt.fr / +33 (0)1 30 23 48 45Investor Relations contact:information-financiere@gtt.fr / + 33 (0)1 30 23 20 871 More information about the DUNE project: https://www.dunescience.org/2 A cryostat is a device by which temperature can be maintained at a very low level.

As the EV market grows rapidly  convenient access to charging has become a priority. In Europe  IHS Markit forecasts that the cumulative deployment of EV charging stations will increase at 24% CAGR during the 2020-30 periodi.The ""Mobilize Powerbox®ii from Software République is an innovative technology demonstrator addressing several key objectives in Europe to:Facilitate access to recharging for all users of EVs.Contribute to the intelligent management of electricity networks.Provide a solution to the cybersecurity risks in the integration of EV charging networks.Strengthen the industrial and technological sovereignty of this new market segment.The charging station  with a power range of 7 to 22 kW  integrates the expertise of:Orange in 4G telecommunications and related services.Renault Group in the architecture of Electric Vehicle charging systems.STMicroelectronics in semiconductors  with its microprocessor (1) and communication coprocessor (2) ensuring an interoperable solution capable of providing intelligent charging services  especially bidirectional V2G (vehicle-to-grid) charging.Thales cybersecurity and data protection - thanks to Thales' secure access and credential management system  which is fully compliant with interoperability standards.The project members also teamed with other technology partners for their expertise  including IoTecha Corp  for the electronic design of the charging station  and LACROIX for its manufacture at Symbiose  the company’s new electronics assembly factory of the future in France. In collaboration with Mobilize — the Renault Group brand dedicated to new mobility — the products of the “Mobilize Powerbox®” range will be marketed in 2023. The bidirectional version will allow the storage capacity of a vehicle's Li-ion battery to be used as an energy source. Without impacting the autonomy required for mobility and with complete simplicity  the system will make it possible to control the flow of energy  to improve the rate of use of renewable energy and to support the electricity network by re-injecting energy into it when needed: a scalable  adaptive charging station that can transform a vehicle into a model power plant. Fifty thousand systems of this type (vehicle and charging station) combined produce the equivalent of a power plant and can thus supplement fossil fuel production. Thus  each owner of the ""Mobilize Powerbox®"" V2G charging station connected to an EV becomes an actor of the ecological transition.With the “Mobilize Powerbox®”  Software République wishes to democratize bidirectional charging functionality and contribute to intelligent energy management. The charging station will be on display at the Mobilize booth (Hall 6) on the media day  October 17  and will be presented by the Software République team at 11 a.m.Technical information(1) ST’s microprocessor (an STM32MP1) is an open platform for the development of industry applications that are increasingly demanding in terms of performance and security.

The operator of the Irish stock market hopes to be in a better position when markets reopen  having established a Irish market advisory committee earlier this year. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillPorsche  the 91-year-old German sports car maker  seems to have found the fast lane after pressing ahead last week with continental European’s largest initial public offering (IPO) since the turn of the millennium.The flotation of the company behind the iconic 911 car and Cayenne SUV defied ongoing turmoil on equity markets  as investors fret about inflation  rising interest rates and mounting risks of a global recession.And while Porsche shares would fall below their €82.50 IPO price on Monday  their third day of trading  they were changing hands for as much as €93.70 on Thursday in Frankfurt.Oliver Blume  the chief executive Porsche and its parent  Volkswagen (VW)  told German business newspaper Handelsblatt this week that he has now directed VW’s other brands – including Audi  Skoda  Seat  Bentley and Lamborghini – to prepare for IPOs as training exercises  saying there is “a lot of potential” in its marques.READ MOREThe well-received Porsche deal is unlikely to result in further unit listings in the near future – or kickstart the wider IPOs market  which has fallen off a cliff this year  according to analysts.However  Euronext Dublin  operator of the Irish stock market  which largely missed out on a stream of flotations globally in the bull run in the past decade that culminated in record $601.2 billion (€609.6 billion) of money raised on IPOs last year  is hoping to be in a better position when markets do reopen  having quietly established an Irish market advisory committee earlier this year to “develop initiatives that would have a meaningful impact on enhancing the attractiveness and accessibility of Irish public markets to Irish companies”.“The idea behind this group is to bring together different parts of the ecosystem ” said Daryl Byrne  chief executive of Euronext Dublin. “We need to make sure that we have the right environment to incentivise companies to access public capital markets and raise the funds that they need to grow their business.”The committee comprises executives from Euronext Dublin  Davy  Goodbody Stockbrokers  law firm A&L Goodbody  Enterprise Ireland and US-based Susquehanna. Euronext Dublin aims to approach the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise  Trade and Employment early next year with a “tangible” list of requests  based on the committee’s work. “This is not a talking shop ” he insists.But with Irish stock market exits outpacing new entrants in the past five years  and Euronext Dublin’s IPOready training programme having put 44 companies through their paces since 2015 but only yielding one flotation to date  is a reboot even possible?Post-crash flotationsIPO activity in Dublin was mainly saved in the past decade by the post-crash flotations of four real-estate investment trusts (of which only residential landlord Ires Reit remains listed)  two housebuilders and the return of AIB to the bourse’s main market in 2017.While 2018 looked at one stage like it was going to be a bumper year for flotations  it turned out be a damp squib.A planned IPO of industrial property group Core Industrial Reit was abandoned at the 11th hour in March 2018  while the mooted flotations of Paddy McKillen jnr’s pub  restaurant and hotels group  Press Up; property and hospitality player Tetrarch; a homebuilder called DRes; and a retail Reit promoted by US investment firm Oaktree and Dublin-based Sigma Retail Partners were all dropped by the close of the year.The excuse for most was a bout of market volatility that set in during the second half of 2018. None of the deals have returned to the table.One of the two companies that managed to list in Dublin in early 2018  commercial property trust Yew Grove Reit  ended up being sold last year  having struggled to secure investor interest to raise money on the public market to grow its portfolio.Only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past four years: Uniphar  the healthcare group that raised €150 million in an IPO in July 2019; Corre Energy  a developer of underground storage solutions for renewable energy that floated 13 months ago; and medtech firm HealthBeacon  which last December became the first IPOready alumnus to take the plunge.Iseq exits over the same period include office owners Green Reit and Hibernia Reit  recruitment group CPL Resources  fuel forecourt retailer Applegreen and Yew Grove. Mostly were acquired by private equity money.Aryzta  the Swiss-Irish bakery group  last year scrapped an Irish listing that dated back to 1988  after the group’s centre of gravity moved to Zurich following a boardroom coup. Meanwhile  Tullow Oil will leave the Dublin market this weekend after 33 years to cut costs and red tape as it remains listed in London and Ghana  home of its flagship oilfields.It follows a slew of Irish companies ditching their Dublin listings a decade ago for the bright lights of London  including conglomerate DCC  sandwich maker Greencore  and Woodie’s and Chadwicks owner Grafton Group.Meanwhile  many would-be IPO prospects have succumbed in the past decade to the attractions of venture capital  private equity money and trade sales in the past decade  in an era – until recently – of ultra-low interest rates.Existential questionsFor some  the diminution of the Irish stock market – which had been used by the likes of CRH  Ryanair and Kerry to grow into international leaders in their respective sectors – raises existential questions.“If we believe in the independent Irish Republic and want to allow indigenous companies to grow and expand from Irish bases  we need to give them access to a market for risk capital to achieve that ” said Joe Gill  director of origination and corporate broking at Goodbody Stockbrokers.Byrne  a member of the managing board of the Euronext group  which also owns the Amsterdam  Brussels  Paris  Lisbon  Oslo and Milan stock exchanges  can only look on in envy at what’s been happening in recent years in Norway  a country of a similar population to the Republic.Of the 212 IPOs that took place across Euronext’s markets last year  68 took place in Oslo.“Our market advisory committee is looking at smaller markets like Oslo to see what are the features there that could potentially be replicated here ” he says.Some ships have long sailed. While Byrne said that there are about 10 active brokers in Oslo bringing companies to the market  players in this space in Dublin have essentially been whittled down  following a wave of consolidation in the past few decades  to two: Davy and Goodbody. Still  City of London broker Numis’s post-Brexit opening of a Dublin office over the summer  to retain access to EU-based clients  is seen as a welcome development.Another big feature of the Oslo market  says Petter Hagen  head of investment banking in Norway for Nordic financial group Carnegie  is its “quite large universe of local investors” that also see Oslo as their natural target market.“While we also have a domestic institutional investor base as in other markets  a key differentiator is the interest and activity from the local family offices and ultra-high-net-worth investors ” he said. “These probably make up a relatively larger component of IPO demand compared to many other markets.”The Republic doesn’t even have a domestic institutional group these days.A coterie of Irish pensions and investment groups – such as Irish Life Investment Managers  AIB Investment Managers  Hibernian Investment Managers and Ulster Bank Investment Managers – typically acted as so-called cornerstone investors in IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s  by taking large chunks of the new shares on offer.However  a triple whammy since then of Irish pension funds being pressed by advisory firms to lower their exposure to Irish equities  foreign takeovers of the main local players  and a general shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment – where funds track stock market benchmarks – has all but killed off this old port of call.To be sure  the €14 billion-plus Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) has had some involvement in IPOs in the past six years  backing the likes of wind and solar power group Greencoat Renewables and venture capital investor Draper Esprit (since renamed Molten Ventures) as they came to market.Elsewhere  AIB has taken stakes in Greencoat  Uniphar  Yew Grove and HealthBeacon as floated.But Gill has called for the establishment of a special Irish IPO fund  backed by the State  that would buy 10-20 per cent of shares being issued by flotation-bound companies and help galvanise other investors around transactions. Such a fund could seek to avoid conflict of interest issues or the risk of overpaying by allowing major institutional investors to dictate IPO valuations  he said.Finlay McFadyen  head of investment banking at AIB  said that “a combination of institutional support from banks like AIB  Government agencies like Enterprise Ireland and ISIF  together with a proactive campaign by Euronext Dublin would help in developing an Irish IPO pipeline”.While Byrne is reluctant at this stage to outline the specific areas the working group is focused on  he highlights the tax system as an obvious one. Euronext Dublin’s pre-Budget 2023 submission to the Government called for tax incentives to be introduced to allow entrepreneurs to sell some of their own shares in a company as part of an IPO – or at a later date.“Entrepreneurs and founders are key decision-makers in the decision to IPO a company ” it said. “Although an IPO will support the funding needs and growth of their companies  it should also reward the entrepreneur for the risk they have taken in building the company and recognise that the majority of founders will have paid themselves below-market rates  while bootstrapping the business over many years.”The submission also called for the introduction of a tax credit scheme to reduce the costs of accessing public markets for small- to medium-sized Irish businesses.Byrne described the submission as Euronext “dipping our toes in the water” on the taxation supports front. “I think there’s a lot more work to be done there on what taxation policy supports would be impactful ” he said.To get Ministers on board  Euronext needs to show them why they should care. It’s been eight years since the last economic impact assessment was done on the contribution of Dublin-listed companies to the wider economy.That report  written by consultancy firm Indecon  concluded that such companies directly employed more than 49 000 people in the Republic and supported a further 48 000 as of 2012. It estimated that the gross value-added contribution of these companies to the economy amounted at the time to €9.5 billion. It put the overall economic impact of the Irish securities industry – spanning stockbrokers to the professional services industry that has built up around the exchange’s international debt and funds listings businesses – at €325 million.Some observers say  however  that making pitches to Government on tax reliefs is tone-deaf – even if commercially justifiable – at a time when households are dealing with a cost-of-living crisis and the populist Sinn Féin is rising high in opinion polls.But other IPO market followers see reason for hope.“One of the challenges the market has had in recent times has been the significant availability of debt funding  private equity and venture capital money in the Irish market looking for deals. But that could be changing ” said Damian Roddy  the new head of Davy’s capital markets division. “With bond yields rising  the cost of capital for these types of investors is rising  which could see more companies opting to raise money in the public equity markets.”Meanwhile  the chief executive for 18 months of Enterprise Ireland  Leo Clancy  has set his sights on encouraging indigenous Irish exporters that the State body backs to pursue IPOs.In an interview with the Sunday Times last week  Clancy said: “Every founder I meet now  I have a very direct conversation with. What’s your ambition? How far will you take this company? Will you go to IPO? Will you stay Irish until you become a global leader?”Still  the parochial nature of the Irish market remains a drawback for many.“One particular issue for companies in the Irish market is the fact that the limited number of PLCs we have here means that even small companies get much more media attention and scrutiny than similar-sized companies in the UK ” said Roddy.What CEO enjoys seeing their picture attached to an executive-pay list?,negative,0.02,0.12,0.87,mixed,0.07,0.17,0.75,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'bull market', 'IPOs', '91-year-old German sports car maker', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'largest initial public offering', 'German business newspaper Handelsblatt', 'four real-estate investment trusts', 'residential landlord Ires Reit', 'Dublin-based Sigma Retail Partners', 'office owners Green Reit', 'Irish market advisory committee', 'Irish stock market exits', 'Euronext Dublin chief executive', 'Core Industrial Reit', 'Paddy McKillen jnr', 'underground storage solutions', 'first IPOready alumnus', 'fuel forecourt retailer', 'US investment firm', 'rising interest rates', 'A&L Goodbody', 'IPOready training programme', 'commercial property trust', 'past four years', 'chief executive Porsche', 'Irish public markets', 'public capital markets', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'Swiss-Irish bakery group', 'past five years', 'wider IPOs market', 'industrial property group', 'private equity money', 'retail Reit', 'iconic 911 car', 'Iseq exits', 'Hibernia Reit', 'Irish listing', 'main market', 'market volatility', 'Irish companies', 'Dublin market', 'equity markets', 'training exercises', 'past decade', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'investor interest', 'law firm', 'medtech firm', 'Daryl Byrne', 'fast lane', 'continental European', 'Cayenne SUV', 'ongoing turmoil', 'mounting risks', 'global recession', 'Porsche shares', 'third day', 'Oliver Blume', 'other brands', 'Porsche deal', 'unit listings', 'near future', 'bull run', 'meaningful impact', 'different parts', 'right environment', 'Enterprise Ireland', 'US-based Susquehanna', 'tangible” list', 'talking shop', 'new entrants', 'two housebuilders', 'one stage', 'damp squib', '11th hour', 'hotels group', 'hospitality player', 'second half', 'healthcare group', 'Corre Energy', 'renewable energy', 'same period', 'recruitment group', 'CPL Resources', 'boardroom coup', 'Tullow Oil', 'red tape', 'flagship oilfields', 'Dublin listings', 'two companies', 'three companies', 'one flotation', 'bumper year', '€82.50 IPO price', 'Post-crash flotations', 'IPO activity', '33 years', '44 companies', 'operator', 'position', 'Photograph', 'turn', 'millennium', 'company', 'investors', 'inflation', 'Monday', 'trading', 'hands', 'Thursday', 'Frankfurt', 'parent', 'Volkswagen', 'VW', 'Audi', 'Skoda', 'Seat', 'Bentley', 'Lamborghini', 'potential', 'marques', 'cliff', 'analysts', 'stream', 'record', 'initiatives', 'attractiveness', 'accessibility', 'idea', 'ecosystem', 'funds', 'executives', 'Davy', 'Department', 'Finance', 'Trade', 'Employment', 'requests', 'work', 'paces', 'date', 'reboot', 'AIB', 'bourse', 'March', 'restaurant', 'Tetrarch', 'homebuilder', 'Oaktree', 'close', 'excuse', 'bout', 'None', 'deals', 'table', 'portfolio', 'Uniphar', 'July', 'developer', 'HealthBeacon', 'plunge', 'Applegreen', 'Aryzta', 'centre', 'gravity', 'Zurich', 'costs', 'London', 'Ghana', 'slew']",2022-10-07,2022-10-07,irishtimes.com

However  the constraints in the electronic component supply chain led to system assembly delays and prevented further deliveries over the period.RevenuesIn this context  revenues for the first half of 2022 came to €9.2m  stable compared with the first half of 2021. Systems revenues increased by +5% to €2.9m  while revenues for services and accessories are down -3% to €6.3m.EarningsFirst-half earnings cannot be extrapolated over the full year due to the lower seasonality of revenues in the first half of the year.The first-half gross margin came to €2.8m  representing 30.9% of revenues  up from the first half of 2021 considering the change in the product mix.Operating expenditure increased (+€0.5m) due to sustained R&D investments (€1.8m; +14%) and the increase in sales and marketing costs in a context of rising order intake (+15%)  while administrative costs are stable overall.Income from ordinary operations totaled €(2.1)m  down €0.2m from the first half of 2021.Net income came to €(1.6)m  compared with €(1.8)m for the first half of 2021. It includes €0.6m of financial income and expenses  linked primarily to the evolution of the euro / US dollar parity.Cash flow and balance sheetThe cash position at end-June 2022 was positive at €7.7m  up €1.8m from December 31  2021.Shareholders’ equity at June 30  2022 totaled €17.0m  compared with €19.8m at December 31  2021. This change is mainly linked to first-half earnings and the distribution of amounts drawn against the issue premium to shareholders for the 2021 financial year.Order book at June 30  2022During the first half of 2022  new order intake improved significantly. The company recorded four production systems orders and five research systems orders  while maintaining its growth in services and accessories.This recovery further strengthened the order book at June 30  2022  which totaled €30.6m  up +76% compared with June 30  2021. System orders (€23.0m; +119%) include 11 machines and orders for services and accessories (€7.6m) are up +10%.This order book does not include the orders announced in July and August 2022 for two Compact 21 research systems  one MBE6000 production system and one MBE49 production system  as well as the option to buy announced on June 8 covering four MBE6000 production machines for which the firm orders will be confirmed when the export license is obtained in 2023.OutlookIn a still buoyant market context  with strong demand for the company's systems  RIBER is expected to continue taking orders by the end of the 2022 financial year.Faced with supply chain constraints  the company has diversified its sourcing capacity with its supplier partners to reduce the shortage of electronic boxes  which are crucial components for the company’s MBE machines to operate. Supply chain delays will likely cause system deliveries to be postponed to 2023.The significant increase in energy costs will have a very limited impact on the company's activity due to the low energy consumption in the company's production processes.Over the longer term  RIBER is moving forward with a project for profitable growth based on its technological and industrial know-how  as well as its capacity for innovation. Driven by new information technologies  the company is rolling out a strategy focused on further strengthening its leading position for MBE  achieving regular growth in its service activities  and maintaining a robust level of R&D investment to expand its portfolio of technologies and applications.Next date: 2022 third-quarter revenues on October 31  2022  after close of tradingThe condensed consolidated half-year accounts have not been subject to an audit or a limited review by the statutory auditors. They were approved by the Executive and Supervisory Boards on October 6  2022.

Ltd. (“Pregene”).On 5 October 2020  Bone Therapeutics Pregene and Link Health Pharma Co.  Ltd (“Link Health”) signed an exclusive license agreement for the manufacturing  clinical development and commercialization of Bone Therapeutics’ allogeneic  off-the-shelf  bone cell therapy platform ALLOB in China (including Hong Kong and Macau)  Taiwan  Singapore  South Korea  and Thailand (the ""Agreement"").Under the Agreement  Bone Therapeutics was eligible to receive up to €55 million in development  regulatory and commercial milestone payments including €10 million in upfront and milestone payments anticipated in the first 24 months. Bone Therapeutics was also entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties on annual net sales of ALLOB. Bone Therapeutics retained development and commercialization rights to ALLOB in all other geographies outside of those covered by this Agreement.In November 2021  Bone Therapeutics signed a non-binding term sheet for the global rights for ALLOB  with its Chinese partners. The unilateral termination notified by Pregene will terminate the discussions with them and require further analysis from both Bone Therapeutics and Link Health.

Bone Therapeutics and Link Health are in active discussions to precise the terms and scope of their collaboration.Bone Therapeutics regaining all development manufacture and commercialization rights of ALLOB from Pregene will also entitle Bone Therapeutics to negotiate rights for ALLOB with  LinkHealth  and other partners.Pregene's termination is  according to Pregene written communication  ""necessitated by [alleged] regulatory reasons that due to the [purported] introduction of new laws and regulations  projects involving foreign human cell and related clinical trials will be  prohibited [in the future] in mainland China"". Bone Therapeutics has not yet been in a position to confirm the veracity of this statement. Pregene shall transfer data to Bone Therapeutics and not participate in any future development or commercialization activities for the product.""Regain ownership of our product worldwide will provide us with the ability to capitalize on a broad range of strategic opportunities  including the re-licensing of ALLOB to a trusted partner that is committed to its development and commercialization""  said Jean Stéphenne  Chairman of Bone Therapeutics.About Bone TherapeuticsBone Therapeutics is a leading biotech company focused on the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and other diseases.

Ltd. (“ Pregene ”).On 5 October 2020  Bone Therapeutics Pregene and Link Health Pharma Co.  Ltd (“ Link Health ”) signed an exclusive license agreement for the manufacturing  clinical development and commercialization of Bone Therapeutics' allogeneic  off-the-shelf  bone cell therapy platform ALLOB in China (including Hong Kong and Macau)  Taiwan  Singapore  South Korea  and Thailand (the ' Agreement ').Under the Agreement  Bone Therapeutics was eligible to receive up to €55 million in development  regulatory and commercial milestone payments including €10 million in upfront and milestone payments anticipated in the first 24 months.
