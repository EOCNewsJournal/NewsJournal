Euronext Dublin aims to approach the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise  Trade and Employment early next year with a “tangible” list of requests  based on the committee’s work. “This is not a talking shop ” he insists.But with Irish stock market exits outpacing new entrants in the past five years  and Euronext Dublin’s IPOready training programme having put 44 companies through their paces since 2015 but only yielding one flotation to date  is a reboot even possible?Post-crash flotationsIPO activity in Dublin was mainly saved in the past decade by the post-crash flotations of four real-estate investment trusts (of which only residential landlord Ires Reit remains listed)  two housebuilders and the return of AIB to the bourse’s main market in 2017.While 2018 looked at one stage like it was going to be a bumper year for flotations  it turned out be a damp squib.A planned IPO of industrial property group Core Industrial Reit was abandoned at the 11th hour in March 2018  while the mooted flotations of Paddy McKillen jnr’s pub  restaurant and hotels group  Press Up; property and hospitality player Tetrarch; a homebuilder called DRes; and a retail Reit promoted by US investment firm Oaktree and Dublin-based Sigma Retail Partners were all dropped by the close of the year.The excuse for most was a bout of market volatility that set in during the second half of 2018. None of the deals have returned to the table.One of the two companies that managed to list in Dublin in early 2018  commercial property trust Yew Grove Reit  ended up being sold last year  having struggled to secure investor interest to raise money on the public market to grow its portfolio.Only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past four years: Uniphar  the healthcare group that raised €150 million in an IPO in July 2019; Corre Energy  a developer of underground storage solutions for renewable energy that floated 13 months ago; and medtech firm HealthBeacon  which last December became the first IPOready alumnus to take the plunge.Iseq exits over the same period include office owners Green Reit and Hibernia Reit  recruitment group CPL Resources  fuel forecourt retailer Applegreen and Yew Grove. Mostly were acquired by private equity money.Aryzta  the Swiss-Irish bakery group  last year scrapped an Irish listing that dated back to 1988  after the group’s centre of gravity moved to Zurich following a boardroom coup. Meanwhile  Tullow Oil will leave the Dublin market this weekend after 33 years to cut costs and red tape as it remains listed in London and Ghana  home of its flagship oilfields.It follows a slew of Irish companies ditching their Dublin listings a decade ago for the bright lights of London  including conglomerate DCC  sandwich maker Greencore  and Woodie’s and Chadwicks owner Grafton Group.Meanwhile  many would-be IPO prospects have succumbed in the past decade to the attractions of venture capital  private equity money and trade sales in the past decade  in an era – until recently – of ultra-low interest rates.Existential questionsFor some  the diminution of the Irish stock market – which had been used by the likes of CRH  Ryanair and Kerry to grow into international leaders in their respective sectors – raises existential questions.“If we believe in the independent Irish Republic and want to allow indigenous companies to grow and expand from Irish bases  we need to give them access to a market for risk capital to achieve that ” said Joe Gill  director of origination and corporate broking at Goodbody Stockbrokers.Byrne  a member of the managing board of the Euronext group  which also owns the Amsterdam  Brussels  Paris  Lisbon  Oslo and Milan stock exchanges  can only look on in envy at what’s been happening in recent years in Norway  a country of a similar population to the Republic.Of the 212 IPOs that took place across Euronext’s markets last year  68 took place in Oslo.“Our market advisory committee is looking at smaller markets like Oslo to see what are the features there that could potentially be replicated here ” he says.Some ships have long sailed. While Byrne said that there are about 10 active brokers in Oslo bringing companies to the market  players in this space in Dublin have essentially been whittled down  following a wave of consolidation in the past few decades  to two: Davy and Goodbody. Still  City of London broker Numis’s post-Brexit opening of a Dublin office over the summer  to retain access to EU-based clients  is seen as a welcome development.Another big feature of the Oslo market  says Petter Hagen  head of investment banking in Norway for Nordic financial group Carnegie  is its “quite large universe of local investors” that also see Oslo as their natural target market.“While we also have a domestic institutional investor base as in other markets  a key differentiator is the interest and activity from the local family offices and ultra-high-net-worth investors ” he said. “These probably make up a relatively larger component of IPO demand compared to many other markets.”The Republic doesn’t even have a domestic institutional group these days.A coterie of Irish pensions and investment groups – such as Irish Life Investment Managers  AIB Investment Managers  Hibernian Investment Managers and Ulster Bank Investment Managers – typically acted as so-called cornerstone investors in IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s  by taking large chunks of the new shares on offer.However  a triple whammy since then of Irish pension funds being pressed by advisory firms to lower their exposure to Irish equities  foreign takeovers of the main local players  and a general shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment – where funds track stock market benchmarks – has all but killed off this old port of call.To be sure  the €14 billion-plus Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) has had some involvement in IPOs in the past six years  backing the likes of wind and solar power group Greencoat Renewables and venture capital investor Draper Esprit (since renamed Molten Ventures) as they came to market.Elsewhere  AIB has taken stakes in Greencoat  Uniphar  Yew Grove and HealthBeacon as floated.But Gill has called for the establishment of a special Irish IPO fund  backed by the State  that would buy 10-20 per cent of shares being issued by flotation-bound companies and help galvanise other investors around transactions. Such a fund could seek to avoid conflict of interest issues or the risk of overpaying by allowing major institutional investors to dictate IPO valuations  he said.Finlay McFadyen  head of investment banking at AIB  said that “a combination of institutional support from banks like AIB  Government agencies like Enterprise Ireland and ISIF  together with a proactive campaign by Euronext Dublin would help in developing an Irish IPO pipeline”.While Byrne is reluctant at this stage to outline the specific areas the working group is focused on  he highlights the tax system as an obvious one. Euronext Dublin’s pre-Budget 2023 submission to the Government called for tax incentives to be introduced to allow entrepreneurs to sell some of their own shares in a company as part of an IPO – or at a later date.“Entrepreneurs and founders are key decision-makers in the decision to IPO a company ” it said. “Although an IPO will support the funding needs and growth of their companies  it should also reward the entrepreneur for the risk they have taken in building the company and recognise that the majority of founders will have paid themselves below-market rates  while bootstrapping the business over many years.”The submission also called for the introduction of a tax credit scheme to reduce the costs of accessing public markets for small- to medium-sized Irish businesses.Byrne described the submission as Euronext “dipping our toes in the water” on the taxation supports front. “I think there’s a lot more work to be done there on what taxation policy supports would be impactful ” he said.To get Ministers on board  Euronext needs to show them why they should care. It’s been eight years since the last economic impact assessment was done on the contribution of Dublin-listed companies to the wider economy.That report  written by consultancy firm Indecon  concluded that such companies directly employed more than 49 000 people in the Republic and supported a further 48 000 as of 2012. It estimated that the gross value-added contribution of these companies to the economy amounted at the time to €9.5 billion. It put the overall economic impact of the Irish securities industry – spanning stockbrokers to the professional services industry that has built up around the exchange’s international debt and funds listings businesses – at €325 million.Some observers say  however  that making pitches to Government on tax reliefs is tone-deaf – even if commercially justifiable – at a time when households are dealing with a cost-of-living crisis and the populist Sinn Féin is rising high in opinion polls.But other IPO market followers see reason for hope.“One of the challenges the market has had in recent times has been the significant availability of debt funding  private equity and venture capital money in the Irish market looking for deals. But that could be changing ” said Damian Roddy  the new head of Davy’s capital markets division. “With bond yields rising  the cost of capital for these types of investors is rising  which could see more companies opting to raise money in the public equity markets.”Meanwhile  the chief executive for 18 months of Enterprise Ireland  Leo Clancy  has set his sights on encouraging indigenous Irish exporters that the State body backs to pursue IPOs.In an interview with the Sunday Times last week  Clancy said: “Every founder I meet now  I have a very direct conversation with. What’s your ambition? How far will you take this company? Will you go to IPO? Will you stay Irish until you become a global leader?”Still  the parochial nature of the Irish market remains a drawback for many.“One particular issue for companies in the Irish market is the fact that the limited number of PLCs we have here means that even small companies get much more media attention and scrutiny than similar-sized companies in the UK ” said Roddy.What CEO enjoys seeing their picture attached to an executive-pay list?,negative,0.02,0.12,0.87,mixed,0.07,0.17,0.75,True,English,"['Irish stock market', 'bull market', 'IPOs', '91-year-old German sports car maker', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'largest initial public offering', 'German business newspaper Handelsblatt', 'four real-estate investment trusts', 'residential landlord Ires Reit', 'Dublin-based Sigma Retail Partners', 'office owners Green Reit', 'Irish market advisory committee', 'Irish stock market exits', 'Euronext Dublin chief executive', 'Core Industrial Reit', 'Paddy McKillen jnr', 'underground storage solutions', 'first IPOready alumnus', 'fuel forecourt retailer', 'US investment firm', 'rising interest rates', 'A&L Goodbody', 'IPOready training programme', 'commercial property trust', 'past four years', 'chief executive Porsche', 'Irish public markets', 'public capital markets', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'Swiss-Irish bakery group', 'past five years', 'wider IPOs market', 'industrial property group', 'private equity money', 'retail Reit', 'iconic 911 car', 'Iseq exits', 'Hibernia Reit', 'Irish listing', 'main market', 'market volatility', 'Irish companies', 'Dublin market', 'equity markets', 'training exercises', 'past decade', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'investor interest', 'law firm', 'medtech firm', 'Daryl Byrne', 'fast lane', 'continental European', 'Cayenne SUV', 'ongoing turmoil', 'mounting risks', 'global recession', 'Porsche shares', 'third day', 'Oliver Blume', 'other brands', 'Porsche deal', 'unit listings', 'near future', 'bull run', 'meaningful impact', 'different parts', 'right environment', 'Enterprise Ireland', 'US-based Susquehanna', 'tangible” list', 'talking shop', 'new entrants', 'two housebuilders', 'one stage', 'damp squib', '11th hour', 'hotels group', 'hospitality player', 'second half', 'healthcare group', 'Corre Energy', 'renewable energy', 'same period', 'recruitment group', 'CPL Resources', 'boardroom coup', 'Tullow Oil', 'red tape', 'flagship oilfields', 'Dublin listings', 'two companies', 'three companies', 'one flotation', 'bumper year', '€82.50 IPO price', 'Post-crash flotations', 'IPO activity', '33 years', '44 companies', 'operator', 'position', 'Photograph', 'turn', 'millennium', 'company', 'investors', 'inflation', 'Monday', 'trading', 'hands', 'Thursday', 'Frankfurt', 'parent', 'Volkswagen', 'VW', 'Audi', 'Skoda', 'Seat', 'Bentley', 'Lamborghini', 'potential', 'marques', 'cliff', 'analysts', 'stream', 'record', 'initiatives', 'attractiveness', 'accessibility', 'idea', 'ecosystem', 'funds', 'executives', 'Davy', 'Department', 'Finance', 'Trade', 'Employment', 'requests', 'work', 'paces', 'date', 'reboot', 'AIB', 'bourse', 'March', 'restaurant', 'Tetrarch', 'homebuilder', 'Oaktree', 'close', 'excuse', 'bout', 'None', 'deals', 'table', 'portfolio', 'Uniphar', 'July', 'developer', 'HealthBeacon', 'plunge', 'Applegreen', 'Aryzta', 'centre', 'gravity', 'Zurich', 'costs', 'London', 'Ghana', 'slew']",2022-10-07,2022-10-08,irishtimes.com

However  the constraints in the electronic component supply chain led to system assembly delays and prevented further deliveries over the period.RevenuesIn this context  revenues for the first half of 2022 came to €9.2m  stable compared with the first half of 2021. Systems revenues increased by +5% to €2.9m  while revenues for services and accessories are down -3% to €6.3m.EarningsFirst-half earnings cannot be extrapolated over the full year due to the lower seasonality of revenues in the first half of the year.The first-half gross margin came to €2.8m  representing 30.9% of revenues  up from the first half of 2021 considering the change in the product mix.Operating expenditure increased (+€0.5m) due to sustained R&D investments (€1.8m; +14%) and the increase in sales and marketing costs in a context of rising order intake (+15%)  while administrative costs are stable overall.Income from ordinary operations totaled €(2.1)m  down €0.2m from the first half of 2021.Net income came to €(1.6)m  compared with €(1.8)m for the first half of 2021. It includes €0.6m of financial income and expenses  linked primarily to the evolution of the euro / US dollar parity.Cash flow and balance sheetThe cash position at end-June 2022 was positive at €7.7m  up €1.8m from December 31  2021.Shareholders’ equity at June 30  2022 totaled €17.0m  compared with €19.8m at December 31  2021. This change is mainly linked to first-half earnings and the distribution of amounts drawn against the issue premium to shareholders for the 2021 financial year.Order book at June 30  2022During the first half of 2022  new order intake improved significantly. The company recorded four production systems orders and five research systems orders  while maintaining its growth in services and accessories.This recovery further strengthened the order book at June 30  2022  which totaled €30.6m  up +76% compared with June 30  2021. System orders (€23.0m; +119%) include 11 machines and orders for services and accessories (€7.6m) are up +10%.This order book does not include the orders announced in July and August 2022 for two Compact 21 research systems  one MBE6000 production system and one MBE49 production system  as well as the option to buy announced on June 8 covering four MBE6000 production machines for which the firm orders will be confirmed when the export license is obtained in 2023.OutlookIn a still buoyant market context  with strong demand for the company's systems  RIBER is expected to continue taking orders by the end of the 2022 financial year.Faced with supply chain constraints  the company has diversified its sourcing capacity with its supplier partners to reduce the shortage of electronic boxes  which are crucial components for the company’s MBE machines to operate. Supply chain delays will likely cause system deliveries to be postponed to 2023.The significant increase in energy costs will have a very limited impact on the company's activity due to the low energy consumption in the company's production processes.Over the longer term  RIBER is moving forward with a project for profitable growth based on its technological and industrial know-how  as well as its capacity for innovation. Driven by new information technologies  the company is rolling out a strategy focused on further strengthening its leading position for MBE  achieving regular growth in its service activities  and maintaining a robust level of R&D investment to expand its portfolio of technologies and applications.Next date: 2022 third-quarter revenues on October 31  2022  after close of tradingThe condensed consolidated half-year accounts have not been subject to an audit or a limited review by the statutory auditors. They were approved by the Executive and Supervisory Boards on October 6  2022.

Ltd. (“Pregene”).On 5 October 2020  Bone Therapeutics Pregene and Link Health Pharma Co.  Ltd (“Link Health”) signed an exclusive license agreement for the manufacturing  clinical development and commercialization of Bone Therapeutics’ allogeneic  off-the-shelf  bone cell therapy platform ALLOB in China (including Hong Kong and Macau)  Taiwan  Singapore  South Korea  and Thailand (the ""Agreement"").Under the Agreement  Bone Therapeutics was eligible to receive up to €55 million in development  regulatory and commercial milestone payments including €10 million in upfront and milestone payments anticipated in the first 24 months. Bone Therapeutics was also entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties on annual net sales of ALLOB. Bone Therapeutics retained development and commercialization rights to ALLOB in all other geographies outside of those covered by this Agreement.In November 2021  Bone Therapeutics signed a non-binding term sheet for the global rights for ALLOB  with its Chinese partners. The unilateral termination notified by Pregene will terminate the discussions with them and require further analysis from both Bone Therapeutics and Link Health. In the meantime  Bone Therapeutics will regain all development manufacture and commercialization rights of ALLOB worldwide.Link Health  which was granted rights in Hong Kong  Macau  Taiwan  Singapore  South Korea  and Thailand  has expressed continued interest in ALLOB and is willing to pursue the collaboration with Bone Therapeutics. Bone Therapeutics and Link Health are in active discussions to precise the terms and scope of their collaboration.Bone Therapeutics regaining all development manufacture and commercialization rights of ALLOB from Pregene will also entitle Bone Therapeutics to negotiate rights for ALLOB with  LinkHealth  and other partners.Pregene's termination is  according to Pregene written communication  ""necessitated by [alleged] regulatory reasons that due to the [purported] introduction of new laws and regulations  projects involving foreign human cell and related clinical trials will be  prohibited [in the future] in mainland China"". Bone Therapeutics has not yet been in a position to confirm the veracity of this statement. Pregene shall transfer data to Bone Therapeutics and not participate in any future development or commercialization activities for the product.""Regain ownership of our product worldwide will provide us with the ability to capitalize on a broad range of strategic opportunities  including the re-licensing of ALLOB to a trusted partner that is committed to its development and commercialization""  said Jean Stéphenne  Chairman of Bone Therapeutics.About Bone TherapeuticsBone Therapeutics is a leading biotech company focused on the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and other diseases.
