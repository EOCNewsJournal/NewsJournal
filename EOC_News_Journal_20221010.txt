D7 is fully integrated within Clearstream‚Äôs global infrastructure and works as a connector between established networks and digital capabilities.Digital instruments are smart objects that represent electronic securities. They contain all the relevant information needed throughout the lifecycle of a security  such as reference  listing and legal data  corporate actions and reporting information. They are technology-  asset-class- and location-agnostic  and enable same-day issuance  automated straight-through processing and asset servicing of securities across established and new financial networks and infrastructures. In this way  the digital instrument serves as a facilitator to streamline operational efforts  minimise reconciliation needs and reduce overall risk.Like this  Clearstream as part of Deutsche B√∂rse Group will provide a fully digital alternative to conventional physical issuance for approx. 80 percent of German securities. The scope of this new D7 offering includes warrants and certificates with further asset classes and jurisdictions planned in the future  in compliance with respective regulatory frameworks.Jens Hachmeister  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  says: ‚ÄúIn line with our core mission to run innovative and future-proof infrastructures for our customers and the entire industry  we have now created the smart digital security.

Aug 23  2018. REUTERS/Peter NichollsSummarySummary Companies First exchange to set listing rules related to offsetsAims to help funds  operating companies raise capitalLondon seeks to be a leader in green financeLONDON  Oct 10 (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange has become the first major bourse to set listing rules for companies that finance carbon reduction projects  as part of efforts to grow the market and make it more transparent  its chief executive told Reuters.Demand for carbon offsets  generated through projects such as tree planting or renewable energy  is expected to soar as companies seek to meet net-zero emissions goals.As a focus for policymakers  it is likely to be debated at climate talks in Egypt in November  yet the global market for voluntary carbon credits  as opposed to binding commitments to cut emissions by companies and countries  remains largely unregulated.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterWhile rival exchanges such as Deutsche Boerse's (DB1Gn.DE) EEX have launched financial products such as futures contracts based on carbon credits  the LSE's rules aim to encourage investment funds and operating companies to raise billions of pounds through LSE listings to fund climate-friendly projects.Released on Monday after a public consultation  the LSE's final admission and disclosure rules on voluntary carbon offsets dovetail with Britain's push to make London a centre for green finance against stiff competition from elsewhere.Under the new rules  a fund or company would have to issue a prospectus vetted by the Financial Conduct Authority that gives details of the carbon emission-cutting project it wants to finance.This  the LSE says  will ensure standards as climate-related disclosures and market abuse rules would have to be complied with.""What this brings is proper transparency  proper due diligence and proper disclosure  so corporates and other investors truly know what they‚Äôre buying. That's something that the voluntary carbon markets haven't had before "" LSE Chief Executive Julia Hoggett said.One investment fund backing the voluntary carbon market is expected to list this year  followed by others in 2023  Hoggett said. Companies operating carbon reduction projects would be added later.Worth around $2 billion in 2021  according to Ecosystem Marketplace  the annual global market for voluntary carbon credits could hit $50 billion by 2030  consultants at McKinsey have estimated.Once an offset project generates carbon credits  equivalent to tonnes of carbon dioxide reduced or removed from the atmosphere  shareholders could receive a dividend in the form of carbon credits  or the fund could sell them and use the cash to pay a dividend.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Huw Jones  Susanna Twidale and Simon Jessop  editing by Barbara LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.23,0.16,0.61,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange', 'carbon cutters', 'listing', 'rules', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'LSE Chief Executive Julia Hoggett', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'Summary Companies First exchange', 'first major bourse', 'FREE unlimited access', 'voluntary carbon markets', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'Reuters.com Register', 'proper due diligence', 'carbon emission-cutting project', 'voluntary carbon credits', 'net-zero emissions goals', 'annual global market', 'carbon reduction projects', 'voluntary carbon offsets', 'market abuse rules', 'One investment fund', 'carbon dioxide', 'financial products', 'offset project', 'proper transparency', 'proper disclosure', 'climate-friendly projects', 'Peter Nicholls', 'listing rules', 'green finance', 'tree planting', 'renewable energy', 'climate talks', 'binding commitments', 'rival exchanges', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'DB1Gn.DE', 'futures contracts', 'investment funds', 'LSE listings', 'public consultation', 'final admission', 'disclosure rules', 'stiff competition', 'new rules', 'climate-related disclosures', 'other investors', 'Ecosystem Marketplace', 'Huw Jones', 'Susanna Twidale', 'Simon Jessop', 'Barbara Lewis', 'operating companies', 'Signage', 'entrance', 'Britain', 'Aug', 'Aims', 'capital', 'leader', 'part', 'efforts', 'Demand', 'focus', 'policymakers', 'Egypt', 'November', 'countries', 'EEX', 'billions', 'pounds', 'Monday', 'push', 'centre', 'company', 'prospectus', 'details', 'standards', 'corporates', 'something', 'others', 'consultants', 'McKinsey', 'tonnes', 'atmosphere', 'shareholders', 'dividend', 'form', 'cash', 'Reporting']",2022-10-10,2022-10-10,reuters.com

11263,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/10/10/the-photographers-gallery-in-london-appoints-a-new-director,The Photographers' Gallery in London appoints Shoair Mavlian as new director,A former intern will replace Brett Rogers as the new figurehead of the photography space  but will face immediate pressures concerning income  footfall and sponsorship,Shoair Mavlian has been appointed as the new director of The Photographers‚Äô Gallery (TPG) in London  14 years after she worked as an intern at the Soho-based photography institution.Currently the director of the Brighton-based charitable organisation Photoworks and a former photography curator at Tate Modern  Mavlian will replace Brett Rogers  who led TPG for 16 years. She will begin her new role in January 2023.Mavlian takes on the directorship of TPG shortly after its 50th anniversary and ten years after its move to a five-floor former warehouse in London‚Äôs Soho. Founded in 1971 by Sue Davies  TPG was the UK‚Äôs first public gallery devoted to photography. It remains the medium's foremost UK centre.In 2012  during Rogers' tenure  TPG relocated to its current venue on Ramillies Street  just off Oxford Street. In June 2022  just after announcing she was to step down from the role  Rogers successfully oversaw the launch of the open-air Soho Photography Quarter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an interesting moment to build on this  and to think about that gallery space and the transition from indoor to outdoor ‚Äù Mavlian said.Rogers was known as an influential and committed champion of contemporary photography who steadfastly supported an artist‚Äôs vision  however obscure it might be. TPG was the first UK gallery to exhibit key names in international photography such as Rinko Kawauchi  Gordon Parks  Rineke Dijkstra and Sebasti√£o Salgado. This summer  Rogers inaugurated the Soho Photography Quarter with work by the contemporary indigenous Australian artist Christian Thompson. TPG hosted the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize  regarded as one of the most significant awards in global photography  in 2005.Soho Photography Quarter featuring the exhibition 'Christian Thompson: Being Human Human Being‚Äô ¬© Luke Hayes  Courtesy of The Photographers‚Äô GalleryMavlian now hopes to continue that tradition. ‚ÄúI grew up around photography ‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMy uncle was a press photographer and he taught me how to print in the darkroom when I was a child.‚ÄùBut Mavlian will also need to ensure TPG‚Äôs financial stability  with the director‚Äôs job specification including the need to ‚Äúensure the long-term sustainability of the gallery‚Äù. TPG is a registered charity and is supported by Arts Council England  but it is also required to find additional funding. It is supported by the Deutsche B√∂rse Foundation  who are affiliated to the Frankfurt-based bank; and the Wolfson Foundation  an organisation created by Great Universal Stores  a FTSE 100 retail and trading conglomerate. Covid severely affected footfall and in the financial year 2019-20  according to the Register of Charities  TPG and its subsidiary The Photographers Gallery (Enterprises) Limited made a loss of just over ¬£200 000.By the year end March 2021  TGP was back in the black‚Äîbut the UK economy faces other pressures  from energy costs to rising inflation to an uncertain workforce. ‚ÄúEverywhere I‚Äôve worked in the UK  fundraising and income generation have been part of the role ‚Äù Mavlian says.Mavlian‚Äôs professional career began when she started working at the Tate in September 2008. By January 2011 she had been appointed assistant curator of photography and international art. Working with Simon Baker  Tate‚Äôs first curator of photography  Mavlian helped build the Tate‚Äôs permanent photography collection from a standing start of less than 1 000 photographs. Mavlian also curated and co-curated exhibitions such as Conflict  Time  Photography (2014) and The Radical Eye: Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John Collection (2016). During her time at Tate  she also completed a masters degree in History of Art  Art History  Criticism and Conservation at Birkbeck College  University of London  and curated exhibitions at NEON festival in Athens  Greece; GetxoPhoto Festival in Bilbao  Spain; and Les Rencontres d‚ÄôArles in Arles  France.Portrait of Shoair Mavlian ¬© Shoair MavlianMavlian took over as the director of Photoworks in 2018. Photoworks  an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation  became more outward-reaching under Mavlian‚Äôs stewardship  developing mass participation initiatives through partnerships with affiliated organisations like the Jerwood Charitable Foundation  Historic England  English Heritage and Council for British Archaeology. Mavlian oversaw an ongoing project with Historic England  for example  tasked at curating a contemporary portrait of England‚Äôs high streets  taken by non-professional photographers who are invested in their local area. With the Jerwood Charitable Foundation  Mavlian helped to found The Jerwood/Photoworks Awards  a significant development bursary for British photographic artists in the first ten years of their career. The most recent commissions were awarded to Joanne Coates  a photographer based on the North York moors who is building a body of work addressing the erasure of contemporary working-class histories and culture in the countryside  and Heather Agyepong  who is developing a photographic series exploring the psychiatrist Carl Jung‚Äôs theories of repression.Mavlian has also continued to work internationally  curating the Curiosa section of emerging international artists for Paris Photo in 2021 and curating exhibitions such as the Photoworks x Maison Europ√©enne de la Photographie exhibition Zone Grise by Ursula Schulz-Dornburg in 2019 and the Photoworks X Tartmus Estonia exhibition by Diana Tamane in 2022.Mavlian spent time in Australia as a child. Her father is Armenian  and she says this heritage informs her desire to look beyond photography‚Äôs established canon  geographical and otherwise. ‚ÄúWhen I started at Photoworks  we really made a commitment to giving space to underrepresented artists ‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThat's something I will continue to champion at TPG.‚ÄùShe‚Äôs also keen to bring that inclusivity to photography‚Äôs audience. TPG appointed the first curator of the digital and networked image in a UK photography gallery in 2011 and digital exploration remains key. ‚ÄúGalleries have to consider how they reach a digital audience ‚Äù Mavlian says. ‚ÄúHow can they engage with people who perhaps aren't going to come through the door? Thinking about how to make photography accessible is definitely part of the conversation.‚Äù,neutral,0.03,0.95,0.02,mixed,0.31,0.22,0.48,True,English,"[""The Photographers' Gallery"", 'Shoair Mavlian', 'new director', 'London', 'Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation', 'Deutsche B√∂rse Foundation', 'Sir Elton John Collection', 'contemporary indigenous Australian artist', 'Brighton-based charitable organisation Photoworks', 'open-air Soho Photography Quarter', 'Jerwood Charitable Foundation', 'five-floor former warehouse', 'Sebasti√£o Salgado', 'Great Universal Stores', 'The Radical Eye', 'mass participation initiatives', 'North York moors', 'permanent photography collection', 'contemporary working-class histories', 'The Jerwood/Photoworks Awards', 'significant development bursary', 'Soho-based photography institution', 'The Photographers‚Äô Gallery', 'first public gallery', 'The Photographers Gallery', 'foremost UK centre', 'British photographic artists', 'first ten years', 'former photography curator', 'first UK gallery', 'Wolfson Foundation', 'contemporary photography', 'first curator', 'Shoair Mavlian Mavlian', 'significant awards', 'Historic England', 'non-professional photographers', 'gallery space', 'British Archaeology', 'photographic series', 'international photography', 'global photography', 'Modernist Photography', 'assistant curator', 'contemporary portrait', '50th anniversary', 'Sue Davies', 'current venue', 'Ramillies Street', 'Oxford Street', 'interesting moment', 'committed champion', 'key names', 'Rinko Kawauchi', 'Gordon Parks', 'Rineke Dijkstra', 'Christian Thompson', 'Luke Hayes', 'financial stability', 'job specification', 'long-term sustainability', 'registered charity', 'additional funding', 'Frankfurt-based bank', 'FTSE 100 retail', 'trading conglomerate', 'financial year', 'Enterprises) Limited', 'year end', 'UK economy', 'other pressures', 'energy costs', 'rising inflation', 'uncertain workforce', 'income generation', 'Simon Baker', 'standing start', 'masters degree', 'Birkbeck College', 'NEON festival', 'GetxoPhoto Festival', 'Les Rencontres', 'affiliated organisations', 'English Heritage', 'ongoing project', 'high streets', 'local area', 'recent commissions', 'Joanne Coates', 'Heather Agyepong', 'Carl Jung', 'international art', 'press photographer', 'professional career', 'new role', 'new director', 'Tate Modern', 'Brett Rogers', 'Art History', '16 years', 'TPG', 'London', 'January', 'directorship', 'move', 'medium', 'tenure', 'June', 'launch', 'transition', 'indoor', 'influential', 'vision', 'exhibition', 'Courtesy', 'tradition', 'uncle', 'darkroom', 'child', 'need', 'Covid', 'footfall', 'Charities', 'subsidiary', 'loss', 'TGP', 'black', 'fundraising', 'September', 'less', '1,000 photographs', 'Conflict', 'Time', 'Criticism', 'Conservation', 'University', 'Athens', 'Greece', 'Bilbao', 'Spain', 'Arles', 'France', 'stewardship', 'partnerships', 'example', 'body', 'erasure', 'culture', 'countryside', 'psychiatrist', 'theories']",2022-10-10,2022-10-10,theartnewspaper.com

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.Story continuesThis breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is approved in adults.The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20324. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 120 countries. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 120 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20226 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15538. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Valneva in July 20199  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

They‚Äôve spent years eyeing the world of crypto with envy  as digital assets thrived in a highly volatile market  while traditional money remained dull.Currencies are now at the forefront of the action. Rapidly climbing interest-rate risks around the world and increased geopolitical tensions are fueling a 30% surge in trading and historic moves  reviving an industry that spent the past decade struggling with stagnant volumes.‚ÄúFX as an asset class is really back this year ‚Äù said Russell LaScala  the global head of FX at Deutsche Bank AG  the world‚Äôs largest currency player by market share. ‚ÄúI think last year a lot of macro hedge funds were trading different assets  including crypto.‚ÄùThe notoriously wild swings in crypto markets have subsided this year  with the Bitcoin Volatility Index shedding more than 50% since a peak in May. By contrast  both Deutsche Bank‚Äôs and JPMorgan Chase & Co.‚Äôs gauges of currency volatility are at the highest in a decade apart from a spike when the pandemic struck.And the moves have been shocking: in Japan  authorities sold dollars to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998  while the euro sank below parity with the dollar to a 20-year low. In London  the world‚Äôs top currency trading hub  the pound slid to an all-time low.‚ÄúVolatility is a bit like a London bus: there are either none to be found for love or money  or three arrive at the same time ‚Äù said Kit Juckes  global head of currency strategy at Societe Generale SA.Story continuesFX Traders Relish Volatile Markets After Years in the DoldrumsThe action has drawn in speculative players such as macro hedge funds and grabbed the attention of real-money investors  whose portfolio valuations are now subject to sudden swings. The war in Ukraine and aggressive Fed rate hikes heightened the moves  drawing money to the dollar as a haven and influencing other markets from Bitcoin to stocks.‚ÄúFX has become a much bigger focus  even for investors who are not typically focused on FX for two main reasons: the dollar has been the one remaining effective hedge across markets and the dollar‚Äôs appreciation has been very tradable for speculative investors ‚Äù said Ebrahim Rahbari  the global head of foreign-exchange analysis and content at Citigroup Inc.At TradeTechFX  the Amsterdam conference  executives packed sessions with titles such as ‚ÄúHow can you ready your FX desk for heightened volatility ‚Äù before taking to the floor at afterparties fueled by expresso martinis.Crypto players  following debates on whether progress in building an institutional ecosystem has been ‚Äúhindered by the ‚Äòwinter ‚Äô‚Äù looked grim  muttering in corners. Bitcoin has been stagnant at around $20 000 for months in a collapse from last year‚Äôs peak near $70 000.Crypto Lending Now Pays Less Than Safest US Government Debt‚ÄúCrypto seemed to be having all the fun until the central banks started breaking things ‚Äù said Tanvir Sandhu  chief global derivatives strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. ‚ÄúIt took inflation to blast the secular decline in currency volatility as central banks unleashed years of suppression. Volatility creates opportunity and it‚Äôs a trader‚Äôs best friend.‚ÄùIn fact  cryptocurrencies command only a fraction of volumes of foreign exchange markets  for all the attention they generate. Trades of fiat currencies clock in at around $6.6 trillion each day  according to the Bank for International Settlements. That compares with just under $1 trillion for Bitcoin and other tokens  according to data website CoinMarketcap.It‚Äôs likely that markets are now migrating to a higher range for interest rates and bond yields and that will be accompanied by higher currency volatility on average  Societe Generale‚Äôs Juckes said.This is boon to the firms that dominate the space. Trading activity on major exchanges has soared compared with last year  while profits at the largest currency trading banks stand at multi-year highs.EBS Market  a platform owned by CME Group Inc.  posted a 30% increase in spot trading in September compared with a year ago  with futures trading at a record high. Spot volumes hit $76 billion  the highest since the pandemic struck in March 2020. Other large platforms have also enjoyed a boost  with Euronext FX seeing a 20% increase in August  according to website LiquidityFinder.Good BusinessIt‚Äôs not all been plain sailing. At times liquidity has still been challenging  said Citigroup‚Äôs Rahbari.‚ÄúThere have been occasions when large asset price movements were in fact observed with relatively little flow  similar to patterns in other markets this year ‚Äù he said.Overall though  the jump in volatility has benefited Deutsche Bank  UBS Group AG and JPMorgan  the top three banks by market share.

The Company will also have a display in the exhibit area at booth #46 for the duration of the Congress  from October 11 through 14  2022.On October 27  2022 at 10:30am ICT  Valneva will present ‚ÄúProgress of Clinical Development of a Live-Attenuated Single Shot Chikungunya Vaccine Candidate‚Äù as part of the Vaccines for Tropical Diseases symposium at the 20th International Congress for Tropical Medicine and Malaria (ICTMM2020) in Bangkok.Valneva will also present on the Phase 3 clinical development of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) 2022 Annual Meeting  taking place October 30 through November 3  2022 in Seattle. The Company will present an abstract on November 1  2022 at 10:15am PST during an in-person scientific session.At the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) European Congress taking place November 6 through 9  2022 in Vienna and online  two posters will be presented: ‚ÄúBurden of Illness and Paucity of Treatment of the Mosquito-Borne Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV)‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Economic Burden of the Globally Spreading Chikungunya Virus: A Systematic and Targeted Review.‚ÄùFinally  the Company will present at the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting (JITMM) 2022 in Bangkok from December 7 through 9  2022.Presentations will be made by Valneva‚Äôs senior scientific leadership  including Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva; Katrin Dubischar  VP Program Director ‚Äì Chikungunya Vaccine; and Susanne Eder-Lingelbach  VP Clinical Development  among others.Valneva initiated rolling submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for licensure of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate in individuals aged 18 years and above in August 2022.This BLA submission follows final pivotal Phase 3 data reported in March 20221 and final lot-to-lot consistency results reported in May 20222. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is approved in adults.The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20324. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 120 countries. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 120 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20226 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15538. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Valneva in July 20199  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Media & Investor ContactsLa√´titia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to regulatory approval of VLA1553  timing and plans for clinical programs and product candidates and revenue forecasts.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners ‚Äì Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.01,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['Extraordinary General Meeting', 'ad hoc representative', 'DEINOVE', 'October', 'Appointment', 'Ma√Ætre Vincent AUSSEL', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'Extraordinary General Meeting', 'ad hoc representative', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'urgent, global challenge', 'investor relations team', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'English French', 'antibiotic resistance', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', '48 rue Cambon', 'convening notice', 'BALO No.', 'legal newspaper', 'M√©tropolitain', 'Commercial Court', 'voting rights', 'two-thirds votes', 'one-third votes', 'qualified majority', 'additional question', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'Delphine LENS', 'The Company', 'defaulting shareholders', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', '75001 Paris', 'DEINOVE', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'October', 'CEST', 'premises', 'Fieldfisher', 'September', 'Appointment', 'request', 'President', 'Montpellier', 'order', 'mandataire', 'behalf', 'quorum', 'shares', 'compliance', 'interest', 'favor', 'participation', 'terms', 'documents', 'AGM', 'website', 'room', 'documentation', 'center', 'general-shareholders', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', 'ISIN', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Investors', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '2']",2022-10-10,2022-10-10,globenewswire.com

Oct. 10  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iovance...,"Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc.First Genetically Modified (TALEN¬Æ-edited) Iovance TIL Therapy with Inactivated PD-1 ExpressionSAN CARLOS  Calif.  Oct. 10  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (NASDAQ: IOVA)  a late-stage biotechnology company developing novel T cell-based cancer immunotherapies  announced that the first patient was dosed  and completed the safety observation period  in the IOV-GM1-201 trial of Iovance‚Äôs genetically modified  PD-1 inactivated TIL therapy  IOV-4001. IOV-GM1-201 is a Phase 1/2  first-in-human study investigating the safety and efficacy of IOV-4001 in patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced melanoma.Friedrich Graf Finckenstein  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Iovance  stated  ‚ÄúDosing the first patient with IOV-4001 is an important first step in providing proof-of-concept for delivering genetically modified TIL therapy to solid tumor patients with significant unmet needs and few treatment options. We look forward to dosing the next patient. This trial may also support our broader platform of genetically modified Iovance TIL therapies to potentially address difficult-to-treat solid tumor cancers.‚ÄùTo inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein  IOV-4001 utilizes the gene-editing TALEN¬Æ technology licensed from Cellectis (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop potentially life-saving cell and gene therapies. This single genetic modification in IOV-4001 may enhance the antitumor activity of the TIL mechanism to directly target and kill tumor cells.Jason Chesney  M.D.  Ph.D.  Director and Endowed Professor  UofL Health ‚Äì Brown Cancer Center  University of Louisville  and an IOV-GM1-201 principal investigator  stated  ‚ÄúI am excited about the potential for gene-editing to open new doors for TIL therapy in patients with solid tumor cancers that do not respond well to current treatment options. As the first multicenter clinical trial to investigate a genetically modified TIL therapy  the IOV-GM1-201 trial may pave the way for a promising new treatment approach to cancer.‚ÄùStory continuesPD-1 is a checkpoint protein found on T cells that normally acts as an ‚Äúoff switch‚Äù to help to prevent T cells from attacking other cells in the body. It works by binding to PD-L1  a protein found on both normal and cancerous cells  thereby shutting down an attack by a T cell. As a TIL therapy that is genetically modified to remove this important barrier for T cells to attack cancer  IOV-4001 has the potential to become an optimized  next generation TIL therapy for several solid tumor cancers. A poster on preclinical data was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2022 Annual Meeting.IOV-GM1-201 is actively enrolling adult participants with advanced NSCLC or unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The test  developed by Ophiomics  is a prognostic diagnostic test that supports the decision of liver transplantation in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ‚ÄúWe are very excited to initiate commercialization of HepatoPredict in Europe. Thanks to our well-established European base of customer-labs  together with Ophiomics  we will now also be able to support liver cancer patients who may benefit from having a liver transplant.‚ÄùJos√© Pereira Leal  Chief Executive Officer of Ophiomics  added: ‚ÄúAccurately identifying which HCC patients will benefit the most from a liver transplant enables better organ allocation and waiting lists management. Launching HepatoPredict through Biocartis‚Äô network of European customers is a great next step in our collaboration to enable patients and healthcare providers to make the best treatment decisions.‚ÄùOn 8 February 2022  Biocartis and Ophiomics (a Lisbon  Portugal based biotech company developing a precision medicine portfolio focused on liver cancer) announced their partnership agreement. Under the terms of this agreement  Biocartis leads the commercialization of the manual HepatoPredict kit in Europe. Depending on the successful commercial uptake of the kit  Ophiomics and Biocartis aim to initiate the development of a fully automated version of the test on Biocartis‚Äô decentralized Idylla‚Ñ¢ platform.Story continuesPrimary liver cancer is the sixth most common and third most lethal cancer in the world  with than 900 000 new cases per year and resulting in more than 800 000 deaths per year2. HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer that frequently occurs in people with chronic liver diseases  such as cirrhosis3. Liver transplantation is the best curative treatment for HCC patients. The current criteria used to identify patients for transplantation are either too strict (by rejecting patients that could benefit from the transplant) or overestimate the benefit from a liver transplantation (by selecting patients that will relapse afterwards).HepatoPredict is a gene expression signature test that combines clinical parameters with molecular markers to assess the tumor biology  aiming to predict which patients will benefit most from a liver transplant and identifying those for which a transplant brings no benefit. HepatoPredict has been validated retrospectively with encouraging results  increasing the number of patients that can benefit from curative-intent transplantation by 31%4. The first clinical validation of HepatoPredict was published on 29 August 2022 in ‚ÄòAnnals of Surgery‚Äô in a collaborative retrospective study5 with Curry Cabral Hospital (Lisbon  Portugal). The study showed that HepatoPredict outperforms conventional selection criteria6  as such providing superior information to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from a liver transplant.More information on the test can be found on the Biocartis website here.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

More information: www.ophiomics.com.About HepatoPredictHepatoPredict is a prognostic tool supporting the decision of liver transplantation in HCC. A molecular signature is integrated with clinical parameters into a predictive algorithm that estimates the risk of HCC recurrence after a liver transplant. It is based on a gene expression signature  measured by a real-time PCR assay  of four target genes and three housekeeping genes  and clinical parameters combined into a computational algorithm  that can predict the good outcome of the intervention with a successful-curative rate up to 94%. The test is performed on HCC biopsies and is intended to be exclusively used on RNA samples extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC tissue and should be only used with the provided reagents and software.

The test  developed by Ophiomics  is a prognostic diagnostic test that supports the decision of liver transplantation in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ‚ÄúWe are very excited to initiate commercialization of HepatoPredict in Europe. Thanks to our well-established European base of customer-labs  together with Ophiomics  we will now also be able to support liver cancer patients who may benefit from having a liver transplant.‚ÄùJos√© Pereira Leal  Chief Executive Officer of Ophiomics  added: ‚ÄúAccurately identifying which HCC patients will benefit the most from a liver transplant enables better organ allocation and waiting lists management. Launching HepatoPredict through Biocartis‚Äô network of European customers is a great next step in our collaboration to enable patients and healthcare providers to make the best treatment decisions.‚ÄùOn 8 February 2022  Biocartis and Ophiomics (a Lisbon  Portugal based biotech company developing a precision medicine portfolio focused on liver cancer) announced their partnership agreement. Under the terms of this agreement  Biocartis leads the commercialization of the manual HepatoPredict kit in Europe. Depending on the successful commercial uptake of the kit  Ophiomics and Biocartis aim to initiate the development of a fully automated version of the test on Biocartis‚Äô decentralized Idylla‚Ñ¢ platform.Primary liver cancer is the sixth most common and third most lethal cancer in the world  with than 900 000 new cases per year and resulting in more than 800 000 deaths per year2. HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer that frequently occurs in people with chronic liver diseases  such as cirrhosis3. Liver transplantation is the best curative treatment for HCC patients. The current criteria used to identify patients for transplantation are either too strict (by rejecting patients that could benefit from the transplant) or overestimate the benefit from a liver transplantation (by selecting patients that will relapse afterwards).HepatoPredict is a gene expression signature test that combines clinical parameters with molecular markers to assess the tumor biology  aiming to predict which patients will benefit most from a liver transplant and identifying those for which a transplant brings no benefit. HepatoPredict has been validated retrospectively with encouraging results  increasing the number of patients that can benefit from curative-intent transplantation by 31%4. The first clinical validation of HepatoPredict was published on 29 August 2022 in ‚ÄòAnnals of Surgery‚Äô in a collaborative retrospective study5 with Curry Cabral Hospital (Lisbon  Portugal). The study showed that HepatoPredict outperforms conventional selection criteria6  as such providing superior information to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from a liver transplant.More information on the test can be found on the Biocartis website here.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

More information: www.ophiomics.com.About HepatoPredictHepatoPredict is a prognostic tool supporting the decision of liver transplantation in HCC. A molecular signature is integrated with clinical parameters into a predictive algorithm that estimates the risk of HCC recurrence after a liver transplant. It is based on a gene expression signature  measured by a real-time PCR assay  of four target genes and three housekeeping genes  and clinical parameters combined into a computational algorithm  that can predict the good outcome of the intervention with a successful-curative rate up to 94%. The test is performed on HCC biopsies and is intended to be exclusively used on RNA samples extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC tissue and should be only used with the provided reagents and software.

IOV-GM1-201 is a Phase 1/2  first-in-human study investigating the safety and efficacy of IOV-4001 in patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced melanoma.Friedrich Graf Finckenstein  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Iovance  stated  ‚ÄúDosing the first patient with IOV-4001 is an important first step in providing proof-of-concept for delivering genetically modified TIL therapy to solid tumor patients with significant unmet needs and few treatment options. We look forward to dosing the next patient. This trial may also support our broader platform of genetically modified Iovance TIL therapies to potentially address difficult-to-treat solid tumor cancers.‚ÄùTo inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein  IOV-4001 utilizes the gene-editing TALEN¬Æ technology licensed from Cellectis (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop potentially life-saving cell and gene therapies. This single genetic modification in IOV-4001 may enhance the antitumor activity of the TIL mechanism to directly target and kill tumor cells.Jason Chesney  M.D.  Ph.D.  Director and Endowed Professor  UofL Health ‚Äì Brown Cancer Center  University of Louisville  and an IOV-GM1-201 principal investigator  stated  ‚ÄúI am excited about the potential for gene-editing to open new doors for TIL therapy in patients with solid tumor cancers that do not respond well to current treatment options. As the first multicenter clinical trial to investigate a genetically modified TIL therapy  the IOV-GM1-201 trial may pave the way for a promising new treatment approach to cancer.‚ÄùPD-1 is a checkpoint protein found on T cells that normally acts as an ‚Äúoff switch‚Äù to help to prevent T cells from attacking other cells in the body. It works by binding to PD-L1  a protein found on both normal and cancerous cells  thereby shutting down an attack by a T cell. As a TIL therapy that is genetically modified to remove this important barrier for T cells to attack cancer  IOV-4001 has the potential to become an optimized  next generation TIL therapy for several solid tumor cancers. A poster on preclinical data was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2022 Annual Meeting.IOV-GM1-201 is actively enrolling adult participants with advanced NSCLC or unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
