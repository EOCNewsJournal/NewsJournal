By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.Story continuesThis breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is approved in adults.The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20324. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 120 countries. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 120 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20226 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15538.

They‚Äôve spent years eyeing the world of crypto with envy  as digital assets thrived in a highly volatile market  while traditional money remained dull.Currencies are now at the forefront of the action. Rapidly climbing interest-rate risks around the world and increased geopolitical tensions are fueling a 30% surge in trading and historic moves  reviving an industry that spent the past decade struggling with stagnant volumes.‚ÄúFX as an asset class is really back this year ‚Äù said Russell LaScala  the global head of FX at Deutsche Bank AG  the world‚Äôs largest currency player by market share. ‚ÄúI think last year a lot of macro hedge funds were trading different assets  including crypto.‚ÄùThe notoriously wild swings in crypto markets have subsided this year  with the Bitcoin Volatility Index shedding more than 50% since a peak in May. By contrast  both Deutsche Bank‚Äôs and JPMorgan Chase & Co.‚Äôs gauges of currency volatility are at the highest in a decade apart from a spike when the pandemic struck.And the moves have been shocking: in Japan  authorities sold dollars to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998  while the euro sank below parity with the dollar to a 20-year low. In London  the world‚Äôs top currency trading hub  the pound slid to an all-time low.‚ÄúVolatility is a bit like a London bus: there are either none to be found for love or money  or three arrive at the same time ‚Äù said Kit Juckes  global head of currency strategy at Societe Generale SA.Story continuesFX Traders Relish Volatile Markets After Years in the DoldrumsThe action has drawn in speculative players such as macro hedge funds and grabbed the attention of real-money investors  whose portfolio valuations are now subject to sudden swings. The war in Ukraine and aggressive Fed rate hikes heightened the moves  drawing money to the dollar as a haven and influencing other markets from Bitcoin to stocks.‚ÄúFX has become a much bigger focus  even for investors who are not typically focused on FX for two main reasons: the dollar has been the one remaining effective hedge across markets and the dollar‚Äôs appreciation has been very tradable for speculative investors ‚Äù said Ebrahim Rahbari  the global head of foreign-exchange analysis and content at Citigroup Inc.At TradeTechFX  the Amsterdam conference  executives packed sessions with titles such as ‚ÄúHow can you ready your FX desk for heightened volatility ‚Äù before taking to the floor at afterparties fueled by expresso martinis.Crypto players  following debates on whether progress in building an institutional ecosystem has been ‚Äúhindered by the ‚Äòwinter ‚Äô‚Äù looked grim  muttering in corners. Bitcoin has been stagnant at around $20 000 for months in a collapse from last year‚Äôs peak near $70 000.Crypto Lending Now Pays Less Than Safest US Government Debt‚ÄúCrypto seemed to be having all the fun until the central banks started breaking things ‚Äù said Tanvir Sandhu  chief global derivatives strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. ‚ÄúIt took inflation to blast the secular decline in currency volatility as central banks unleashed years of suppression. Volatility creates opportunity and it‚Äôs a trader‚Äôs best friend.‚ÄùIn fact  cryptocurrencies command only a fraction of volumes of foreign exchange markets  for all the attention they generate. Trades of fiat currencies clock in at around $6.6 trillion each day  according to the Bank for International Settlements. That compares with just under $1 trillion for Bitcoin and other tokens  according to data website CoinMarketcap.It‚Äôs likely that markets are now migrating to a higher range for interest rates and bond yields and that will be accompanied by higher currency volatility on average  Societe Generale‚Äôs Juckes said.This is boon to the firms that dominate the space. Trading activity on major exchanges has soared compared with last year  while profits at the largest currency trading banks stand at multi-year highs.EBS Market  a platform owned by CME Group Inc.  posted a 30% increase in spot trading in September compared with a year ago  with futures trading at a record high. Spot volumes hit $76 billion  the highest since the pandemic struck in March 2020. Other large platforms have also enjoyed a boost  with Euronext FX seeing a 20% increase in August  according to website LiquidityFinder.Good BusinessIt‚Äôs not all been plain sailing. At times liquidity has still been challenging  said Citigroup‚Äôs Rahbari.‚ÄúThere have been occasions when large asset price movements were in fact observed with relatively little flow  similar to patterns in other markets this year ‚Äù he said.Overall though  the jump in volatility has benefited Deutsche Bank  UBS Group AG and JPMorgan  the top three banks by market share.

The Company will also have a display in the exhibit area at booth #46 for the duration of the Congress  from October 11 through 14  2022.On October 27  2022 at 10:30am ICT  Valneva will present ‚ÄúProgress of Clinical Development of a Live-Attenuated Single Shot Chikungunya Vaccine Candidate‚Äù as part of the Vaccines for Tropical Diseases symposium at the 20th International Congress for Tropical Medicine and Malaria (ICTMM2020) in Bangkok.Valneva will also present on the Phase 3 clinical development of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) 2022 Annual Meeting  taking place October 30 through November 3  2022 in Seattle. The Company will present an abstract on November 1  2022 at 10:15am PST during an in-person scientific session.At the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) European Congress taking place November 6 through 9  2022 in Vienna and online  two posters will be presented: ‚ÄúBurden of Illness and Paucity of Treatment of the Mosquito-Borne Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV)‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Economic Burden of the Globally Spreading Chikungunya Virus: A Systematic and Targeted Review.‚ÄùFinally  the Company will present at the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting (JITMM) 2022 in Bangkok from December 7 through 9  2022.Presentations will be made by Valneva‚Äôs senior scientific leadership  including Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva; Katrin Dubischar  VP Program Director ‚Äì Chikungunya Vaccine; and Susanne Eder-Lingelbach  VP Clinical Development  among others.Valneva initiated rolling submission with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for licensure of its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate in individuals aged 18 years and above in August 2022.This BLA submission follows final pivotal Phase 3 data reported in March 20221 and final lot-to-lot consistency results reported in May 20222. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is approved in adults.The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20324. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 120 countries. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 120 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20226 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20227.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15538. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Valneva in July 20199  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Media & Investor ContactsLa√´titia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to regulatory approval of VLA1553  timing and plans for clinical programs and product candidates and revenue forecasts.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners ‚Äì Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,negative,0.01,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['Extraordinary General Meeting', 'ad hoc representative', 'DEINOVE', 'October', 'Appointment', 'Ma√Ætre Vincent AUSSEL', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'Extraordinary General Meeting', 'ad hoc representative', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'urgent, global challenge', 'investor relations team', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'English French', 'antibiotic resistance', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', '48 rue Cambon', 'convening notice', 'BALO No.', 'legal newspaper', 'M√©tropolitain', 'Commercial Court', 'voting rights', 'two-thirds votes', 'one-third votes', 'qualified majority', 'additional question', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'Delphine LENS', 'The Company', 'defaulting shareholders', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', '75001 Paris', 'DEINOVE', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'October', 'CEST', 'premises', 'Fieldfisher', 'September', 'Appointment', 'request', 'President', 'Montpellier', 'order', 'mandataire', 'behalf', 'quorum', 'shares', 'compliance', 'interest', 'favor', 'participation', 'terms', 'documents', 'AGM', 'website', 'room', 'documentation', 'center', 'general-shareholders', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', 'ISIN', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Investors', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '2']",2022-10-10,2022-10-11,globenewswire.com

Oct. 10  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iovance...,"Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc.First Genetically Modified (TALEN¬Æ-edited) Iovance TIL Therapy with Inactivated PD-1 ExpressionSAN CARLOS  Calif.  Oct. 10  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (NASDAQ: IOVA)  a late-stage biotechnology company developing novel T cell-based cancer immunotherapies  announced that the first patient was dosed  and completed the safety observation period  in the IOV-GM1-201 trial of Iovance‚Äôs genetically modified  PD-1 inactivated TIL therapy  IOV-4001. IOV-GM1-201 is a Phase 1/2  first-in-human study investigating the safety and efficacy of IOV-4001 in patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced melanoma.Friedrich Graf Finckenstein  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Iovance  stated  ‚ÄúDosing the first patient with IOV-4001 is an important first step in providing proof-of-concept for delivering genetically modified TIL therapy to solid tumor patients with significant unmet needs and few treatment options. We look forward to dosing the next patient. This trial may also support our broader platform of genetically modified Iovance TIL therapies to potentially address difficult-to-treat solid tumor cancers.‚ÄùTo inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein  IOV-4001 utilizes the gene-editing TALEN¬Æ technology licensed from Cellectis (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop potentially life-saving cell and gene therapies. This single genetic modification in IOV-4001 may enhance the antitumor activity of the TIL mechanism to directly target and kill tumor cells.Jason Chesney  M.D.  Ph.D.  Director and Endowed Professor  UofL Health ‚Äì Brown Cancer Center  University of Louisville  and an IOV-GM1-201 principal investigator  stated  ‚ÄúI am excited about the potential for gene-editing to open new doors for TIL therapy in patients with solid tumor cancers that do not respond well to current treatment options. As the first multicenter clinical trial to investigate a genetically modified TIL therapy  the IOV-GM1-201 trial may pave the way for a promising new treatment approach to cancer.‚ÄùStory continuesPD-1 is a checkpoint protein found on T cells that normally acts as an ‚Äúoff switch‚Äù to help to prevent T cells from attacking other cells in the body. It works by binding to PD-L1  a protein found on both normal and cancerous cells  thereby shutting down an attack by a T cell. As a TIL therapy that is genetically modified to remove this important barrier for T cells to attack cancer  IOV-4001 has the potential to become an optimized  next generation TIL therapy for several solid tumor cancers. A poster on preclinical data was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2022 Annual Meeting.IOV-GM1-201 is actively enrolling adult participants with advanced NSCLC or unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The test  developed by Ophiomics  is a prognostic diagnostic test that supports the decision of liver transplantation in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ‚ÄúWe are very excited to initiate commercialization of HepatoPredict in Europe. Thanks to our well-established European base of customer-labs  together with Ophiomics  we will now also be able to support liver cancer patients who may benefit from having a liver transplant.‚ÄùJos√© Pereira Leal  Chief Executive Officer of Ophiomics  added: ‚ÄúAccurately identifying which HCC patients will benefit the most from a liver transplant enables better organ allocation and waiting lists management. Launching HepatoPredict through Biocartis‚Äô network of European customers is a great next step in our collaboration to enable patients and healthcare providers to make the best treatment decisions.‚ÄùOn 8 February 2022  Biocartis and Ophiomics (a Lisbon  Portugal based biotech company developing a precision medicine portfolio focused on liver cancer) announced their partnership agreement. Under the terms of this agreement  Biocartis leads the commercialization of the manual HepatoPredict kit in Europe. Depending on the successful commercial uptake of the kit  Ophiomics and Biocartis aim to initiate the development of a fully automated version of the test on Biocartis‚Äô decentralized Idylla‚Ñ¢ platform.Story continuesPrimary liver cancer is the sixth most common and third most lethal cancer in the world  with than 900 000 new cases per year and resulting in more than 800 000 deaths per year2. HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer that frequently occurs in people with chronic liver diseases  such as cirrhosis3. Liver transplantation is the best curative treatment for HCC patients. The current criteria used to identify patients for transplantation are either too strict (by rejecting patients that could benefit from the transplant) or overestimate the benefit from a liver transplantation (by selecting patients that will relapse afterwards).HepatoPredict is a gene expression signature test that combines clinical parameters with molecular markers to assess the tumor biology  aiming to predict which patients will benefit most from a liver transplant and identifying those for which a transplant brings no benefit. HepatoPredict has been validated retrospectively with encouraging results  increasing the number of patients that can benefit from curative-intent transplantation by 31%4. The first clinical validation of HepatoPredict was published on 29 August 2022 in ‚ÄòAnnals of Surgery‚Äô in a collaborative retrospective study5 with Curry Cabral Hospital (Lisbon  Portugal). The study showed that HepatoPredict outperforms conventional selection criteria6  as such providing superior information to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from a liver transplant.More information on the test can be found on the Biocartis website here.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

More information: www.ophiomics.com.About HepatoPredictHepatoPredict is a prognostic tool supporting the decision of liver transplantation in HCC. A molecular signature is integrated with clinical parameters into a predictive algorithm that estimates the risk of HCC recurrence after a liver transplant. It is based on a gene expression signature  measured by a real-time PCR assay  of four target genes and three housekeeping genes  and clinical parameters combined into a computational algorithm  that can predict the good outcome of the intervention with a successful-curative rate up to 94%. The test is performed on HCC biopsies and is intended to be exclusively used on RNA samples extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC tissue and should be only used with the provided reagents and software.

The test  developed by Ophiomics  is a prognostic diagnostic test that supports the decision of liver transplantation in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ‚ÄúWe are very excited to initiate commercialization of HepatoPredict in Europe. Thanks to our well-established European base of customer-labs  together with Ophiomics  we will now also be able to support liver cancer patients who may benefit from having a liver transplant.‚ÄùJos√© Pereira Leal  Chief Executive Officer of Ophiomics  added: ‚ÄúAccurately identifying which HCC patients will benefit the most from a liver transplant enables better organ allocation and waiting lists management. Launching HepatoPredict through Biocartis‚Äô network of European customers is a great next step in our collaboration to enable patients and healthcare providers to make the best treatment decisions.‚ÄùOn 8 February 2022  Biocartis and Ophiomics (a Lisbon  Portugal based biotech company developing a precision medicine portfolio focused on liver cancer) announced their partnership agreement. Under the terms of this agreement  Biocartis leads the commercialization of the manual HepatoPredict kit in Europe. Depending on the successful commercial uptake of the kit  Ophiomics and Biocartis aim to initiate the development of a fully automated version of the test on Biocartis‚Äô decentralized Idylla‚Ñ¢ platform.Primary liver cancer is the sixth most common and third most lethal cancer in the world  with than 900 000 new cases per year and resulting in more than 800 000 deaths per year2. HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer that frequently occurs in people with chronic liver diseases  such as cirrhosis3. Liver transplantation is the best curative treatment for HCC patients. The current criteria used to identify patients for transplantation are either too strict (by rejecting patients that could benefit from the transplant) or overestimate the benefit from a liver transplantation (by selecting patients that will relapse afterwards).HepatoPredict is a gene expression signature test that combines clinical parameters with molecular markers to assess the tumor biology  aiming to predict which patients will benefit most from a liver transplant and identifying those for which a transplant brings no benefit. HepatoPredict has been validated retrospectively with encouraging results  increasing the number of patients that can benefit from curative-intent transplantation by 31%4. The first clinical validation of HepatoPredict was published on 29 August 2022 in ‚ÄòAnnals of Surgery‚Äô in a collaborative retrospective study5 with Curry Cabral Hospital (Lisbon  Portugal). The study showed that HepatoPredict outperforms conventional selection criteria6  as such providing superior information to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from a liver transplant.More information on the test can be found on the Biocartis website here.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

More information: www.ophiomics.com.About HepatoPredictHepatoPredict is a prognostic tool supporting the decision of liver transplantation in HCC. A molecular signature is integrated with clinical parameters into a predictive algorithm that estimates the risk of HCC recurrence after a liver transplant. It is based on a gene expression signature  measured by a real-time PCR assay  of four target genes and three housekeeping genes  and clinical parameters combined into a computational algorithm  that can predict the good outcome of the intervention with a successful-curative rate up to 94%. The test is performed on HCC biopsies and is intended to be exclusively used on RNA samples extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC tissue and should be only used with the provided reagents and software.

IOV-GM1-201 is a Phase 1/2  first-in-human study investigating the safety and efficacy of IOV-4001 in patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced melanoma.Friedrich Graf Finckenstein  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Iovance  stated  ‚ÄúDosing the first patient with IOV-4001 is an important first step in providing proof-of-concept for delivering genetically modified TIL therapy to solid tumor patients with significant unmet needs and few treatment options. We look forward to dosing the next patient. This trial may also support our broader platform of genetically modified Iovance TIL therapies to potentially address difficult-to-treat solid tumor cancers.‚ÄùTo inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein  IOV-4001 utilizes the gene-editing TALEN¬Æ technology licensed from Cellectis (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop potentially life-saving cell and gene therapies. This single genetic modification in IOV-4001 may enhance the antitumor activity of the TIL mechanism to directly target and kill tumor cells.Jason Chesney  M.D.  Ph.D.  Director and Endowed Professor  UofL Health ‚Äì Brown Cancer Center  University of Louisville  and an IOV-GM1-201 principal investigator  stated  ‚ÄúI am excited about the potential for gene-editing to open new doors for TIL therapy in patients with solid tumor cancers that do not respond well to current treatment options. As the first multicenter clinical trial to investigate a genetically modified TIL therapy  the IOV-GM1-201 trial may pave the way for a promising new treatment approach to cancer.‚ÄùPD-1 is a checkpoint protein found on T cells that normally acts as an ‚Äúoff switch‚Äù to help to prevent T cells from attacking other cells in the body. It works by binding to PD-L1  a protein found on both normal and cancerous cells  thereby shutting down an attack by a T cell. As a TIL therapy that is genetically modified to remove this important barrier for T cells to attack cancer  IOV-4001 has the potential to become an optimized  next generation TIL therapy for several solid tumor cancers. A poster on preclinical data was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2022 Annual Meeting.IOV-GM1-201 is actively enrolling adult participants with advanced NSCLC or unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

11328,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/challenger-limited-asx-cgf-largely-215836961.html,Challenger Limited (ASX:CGF) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 53% of the company,Every investor in Challenger Limited ( ASX:CGF ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group...,Every investor in Challenger Limited (ASX:CGF) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 53% ownership. Put another way  the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal  institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight  especially with individual investors. Hence  having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below  we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Challenger.See our latest analysis for ChallengerWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Challenger?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Challenger already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes  just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Challenger's earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock  the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Challenger. Apollo Global Management  Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 19% of shares outstanding. With 15% and 7.9% of the shares outstanding respectively  MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings  Inc.  Asset Management Arm and Euroclear PLC  Asset Management Arm are the second and third largest shareholders.Our research also brought to light the fact that roughly 52% of the company is controlled by the top 5 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company  it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock  so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of ChallengerWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective  almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However  high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Challenger Limited. It's a big company  so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$1.7m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership  but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.General Public OwnershipWith a 28% ownership  the general public  mostly comprising of individual investors  have some degree of sway over Challenger. This size of ownership  while considerable  may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Equity OwnershipWith a stake of 19%  private equity firms could influence the Challenger board. Some investors might be encouraged by this  since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively  those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Challenger better  we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks  for instance. Every company has them  and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Challenger you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

11331,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/swift-releases-plan-for-digital-currency/6779314.html,SWIFT Releases Plan for Digital Currency,SWIFT  a financial messaging service  has laid out plans for a worldwide central bank digital currency (CBDC) network. The trial looked at how CBDCs could be used to control money flow around the world.,Financial messaging system SWIFT has released plans for a worldwide central bank digital currency (CBDC) network.The plan is the result of eight months of tests using different technologies and currencies.SWIFT‚Äôs tests looked at how CBDCs could be used internationally and changed into traditional money if needed. For the last month  the trial has involved France and Germany‚Äôs central banks and international banks like HSBC  Standard Chartered and UBS.Around 90 percent of the world‚Äôs central banks are now using  testing  or studying CBDCs. Reuters reports that they are struggling with its technological complexities.Nick Kerigan is SWIFT‚Äôs head of innovation. He described SWIFT‚Äôs plan as a bicycle wheel in which 14 central and business banks are connected to a central point  its main hub. The tests will be followed by additional testing over the next year.The idea is that once the plan is in place  banks may need only one main international connection rather than thousands of connections with each partnerKerigan said  ‚ÄúWe believe that the number of connections needed is much fewer.‚Äù He said this would likely mean that there will be fewer breaks in the chain and that it will likely be more efficient.However  CBDCs have also raised concerns about privacy and central control of private financial dealings.SWIFT‚Äôs trial also tested a group of different CBDC technologies known as Distributed Ledger Technologies. But  the use of many different technologies presents a barrier to quickly putting the plan into effect around the world.A separated trial was carried out with financial companies Citi  Clearstream and Northern Trust. It involved ‚Äútokenization.‚Äù ‚ÄúTokenization‚Äù is a measure used to secure sensitive information. The test aimed to use digital ‚Äútokens‚Äù to trade property like stocks and bonds.Some countries such as the Bahamas and Nigeria say they already have CBDCs. China has been developing a digital currency called the e-yuan. And Reuters says the Bank for International Settlements has also been running cross-border trails.SWIFT says it is in a good position because it has an existing network used in over 200 countries and connects more than 11 500 banks and funds.SWIFT is a member-owned cooperative group based in Belgium. It gained attention after it cut most of Russia‚Äôs banks from its network to punish Russia for invading Ukraine.Kerigan said a new CBDC system could also bar countries from taking part in it. But he did not know whether it would stop countries from joining one.He said most central banks want to provide CBDC for the people  the businesses  and the organizations in their areas.He added  ‚ÄúSo a solution that's fast and efficient and that gains access to as many other countries as possible would seem to be an attractive one.‚ÄùI‚Äôm Gregory Stachel.Marc Jones reported this story for Reuters.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation...","Application is based on randomized  controlled and long-term extension data for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiencyThis submission follows the grant of accelerated assessment allowing an expedited review for leniolisib from a standard 210 days to 150 daysLEIDEN  Netherlands  Oct. 11  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.Pharming Group N.V. logoOn August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""Story continuesThe MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

With the impact of epidemic waves diminishing  COVID activities are declining as expected. The Group's good control of its working capital requirement enabled it to post a positive cash position of ‚Ç¨111.2 million at June 30  and to accelerate the implementation of its strategy as well as its share buyback program. Were thus acquired : Bmd Belgium (June) and  post-closing (October)  the Dutch company GenDX  a structuring transaction that brings many synergies.in ‚Ç¨m 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 Change IVD product sales 83.6 95.6 -12.6% Other revenues 0.7 0.3 +133% Total revenues 84.3 95.9 -12.1% Cost of goods sold -43.4 -41.4 +4.8% Gross margin 40.9 54.6 -25.1% R&D expenses -1.4 -1.2 +16.7% Marketing and sales expenses -8.9 -7.6 +17.1% G&A expenses -6.3 -4.7 +34.0% Operating income 22.0 40.0 -45.0% EBITDA 26.0 42.5 -38.8% Financial result 0.4 -0.3 - Extraordinary result -0.1 0.2 - Goodwill amortization -1.4 -1.4 - Taxes -3.1 -5.4 -42.6% Net income 19.2 33.1 -42.0% Net income excluding goodwill amortization & Deferred Tax Assets 20.6 34.5 -40.3% 30 June 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Cash (including marketable securities) 111.2 102.4 Financial debt * 8.8 10.7 Shareholders equity 168.6 160.6* excluding financial lease (‚Ç¨4.4m at 30/06/22 vs ‚Ç¨5.0m at 31/12/21)Good overall business strengthStory continuesWith a growth of +5.1% in its turnover excluding COVID to ‚Ç¨43.0M in the 1st half of 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨40.9M in the 1st half of 2021  and COVID sales at ‚Ç¨40.6M compared to ‚Ç¨54.8M (-26%)  Eurobio Scientific recorded revenue of ‚Ç¨83.6m in the 1st half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨95.6m in the 1st half of 2021. This activity reflects:- The significant and continued growth of traditional activities  excluding COVID  despite the termination of less profitable partnerships as a result of increased selectivity in terms of distribution;- Continued substantial COVID revenue despite a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes  partially offset by the extension of the product portfolio with specific tests for the characterization of SARS-Cov-2 virus variants.Results impacted by the anticipated drop in COVID salesIn the 1st half of 2022  the gross margin stood at ‚Ç¨40.9 million  compared to ‚Ç¨54.6 million in the 1st half of 2021. This decline is linked to the drop in revenue from COVID activities and to provisions made on the inventory of COVID products as part of the pandemic slowdown. Restated for these provisions  the gross margin would amount to ‚Ç¨46.1 million  i.e. a rate of 55.1% compared to 57.1% in H1 2021.R&D expenses and marketing and sales expenses are increasing slightly faster than sales  in order to support future growth. The faster rise in general and administrative expenses includes expenses related to corporate finance transactions during the half-year: two acquisitions and a strategic and capitalistic partnership. Operating income is therefore down at ‚Ç¨22.0m (‚Ç¨40.0m in H1 2021)  and EBITDA at ‚Ç¨26.0m (‚Ç¨42.5m in H1 2021).The financial result is positive (+0.4 vs -0.3 in H1 2021) due to foreign exchange gains  in particular linked to the valuation of assets in dollars.Corporate tax amounted to ‚Ç¨3.1m  compared to ‚Ç¨5.4m in H1 2021.After taking into account ‚Ç¨1.4 million in goodwill amortization  net income for the first half of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨19.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨33.1 million in H1 2021.Strong operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5m (‚Ç¨29.9m in H1 2021)Even though it is lower compared to last year  Eurobio Scientific continues to generate significant operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5 million (-14.7% compared to H1 2021)  mainly thanks to a better control of its WCR and to the decrease in operating receivables.This good performance enabled the Company to accelerate its share buyback program for which it allocated ‚Ç¨10.6 million during the half-year.The total amount of cash thus amounted to ‚Ç¨111.2 million as of June 30  2022 and shareholders equity rose to ‚Ç¨168.6 million. Financial debt decreased again  to ‚Ç¨8.8m compared to ‚Ç¨10.7m at 12/31/21.Perspectives: decisive and strategic developmentsThe historical activities of Eurobio Scientific should grow steadily  with stronger margins linked to the increasing share of proprietary products and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio. In addition  as the slowdown in the COVID diagnostics market continues  but in a non-linear fashion  the Group remains attentive and cautious in order to continue to serve the needs of its customers while cushioning the decline in this business segment.Backed by significant cash and its leadership position  the Group has made two acquisitions in recent months to accelerate the deployment of its strategic axis:increasing the share of proprietary products continued international expansion  andopening of new market segments.The takeover of bmd Belgique in June strengthens the Group's sales and marketing presence in the Benelux zone.The acquisition of GenDX  which closing was just completed on October 3  takes on a particular dimension. It is strategic and transformative as it brings value in each of the Group's three strategic areas:GenDx has a range of highly innovative and 100% proprietary products;it is also present directly in the Netherlands  Germany and North America as well as  via its distributors  in the rest of Europe and Asia;finally  GenDx's technological advance in the digitization of diagnostics  through the algorithms and software developed by its bioinformatics specialists  will enable the Group to address new market segments well beyond transplantation on which GenDx was positioned until now.Next financial meetings2022 sales : January 23  2023  after market closes2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesDisclaimerThis press release contains elements that are not historical facts including  without limitation  certain statements about future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

It was important to assess the retinal changes with PRIMA implants since the success of retinal stimulation with micro-electrodes largely depends on the distance between the stimulation electrode (in the implant) and the target cells.The Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images of three patients with subretinal implantations enrolled in the French feasibility study were analyzed to [1] measure the retinal thickness  [2] measure the distance between the array and the inner nuclear layer (INL  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) and [3] evaluate any potential macular changes from the surgical trauma.Story continuesThe analysis found that the surgical delivery of the photovoltaic subretinal implant led to a stable retinal thickness over 36 months with no adverse structural or functional events after causing minor retinal thickness changes that settle after three months.""We are very pleased to announce the publication of these peer-reviewed data in the well-respected Journal of Neural Engineering showing that the surgical implantation of the Prima System in patients suffering from dry AMD leads to a stable retinal thickness three months after implantation "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""The PRIMA implant's small size and wireless design enable minimally invasive surgery. Previously  the data from the French feasibility study already demonstrated that the Prima System is well tolerated. The data in this paper now further demonstrate the stability and minimal impact of the implant once in position. We are confidently looking forward to the read-out from our pivotal PRIMAvera study on the Prima System due at the end of next year and our planned submission for market approval in Europe shortly afterward.""Key take-awaysThe key take-aways from the data published in the Journal of Neural Engineering are:No significant changes in the distance between the surface of the implant and the INL (the Inner Nuclear Layer  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) were detectedTotal retinal thickness above the implant decreased by a mean of 39 ¬µm during 3-months post-implantation  but no significant changes were observed after that  up to 36 months of the follow-upThe observations support the hypothesis that the retina on the different areas on the implant are equally supplied with nutrition and oxygenPixium Vision's pivotal PRIMAvera study  which aims to demonstrate the safety and benefits of the Prima System  is ongoing in Europe  with a read-out expected towards the end of 2023 and regulatory submission for market approval due soon after. In the US  a feasibility study is also ongoing.The full peer-reviewed Journal of Neural Engineering paper is available online here.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

With our 4R mindset  we are now scaling up with an intense rigor  building our capabilities  teams and facilities  while creating a smart  integrated ecosystem to better manage material scarcity and our drive to carbon net zero.‚ÄùThe main objectives of the Circular Economy Business Unit are extending the life of vehicles and parts  ensuring that they last for as long as possible  and returning material and end-of-life vehicles to the manufacturing loop for new vehicles and products. This methodology compliments the principles of ‚ÄòDesign for the Circular Economy ‚Äô which are core to the new Citro√´n ‚Äòoli‚Äô [all-√´]  a conceptual multi-activity family vehicle that uses lightweight and recycled materials  sustainable production processes  affordability  durability for an extended service life and responsible end-of-life recyclability.Video: Stellantis Circular Economy - Overview by Alison JonesCircular Economy‚Äôs 4R Strategy:Stellantis has developed a comprehensive  360-degree business based on the 4R strategy: reman  repair  reuse  and recycle. It‚Äôs an integrated ecosystem that is vital to preserving and protecting the planet‚Äôs resources.Reman ‚Äì Used  worn or defective parts are thoroughly dismantled  cleaned and remanufactured to OEM specifications. Nearly 12 000 parts covering 40 product lines  including electric vehicle batteries  are available.‚Äì Used  worn or defective parts are thoroughly dismantled  cleaned and remanufactured to OEM specifications.

In 21 locations around the world  e-repair centers work on electric vehicle batteries. Reuse ‚Äì Approximately 4.5 million multi-brand parts in inventory still in good condition  are recovered from end-of-life vehicles and sold in 155 countries through the B-Parts e-commerce platform.Recycle ‚Äì Production scraps and end-of-life vehicles are fed back into the manufacturing process. In just six months  the business unit has collected 1 million recycled parts.Hubs Complemented by Local LoopsStellantis‚Äô Circular Economy Business Unit plan calls for aggressive scaling up in volumes and expansion to new countries  while ensuring constant innovation and re-skilling for new techs.In September  Stellantis announced that its leading Circular Economy Hub will launch in 2023 at its Mirafiori Complex in Italy. The dedicated operation will enable the expansion of Stellantis‚Äô current activities and support its ‚Äòcradle-to-cradle‚Äô business model in Europe. The Hub will host vehicle reconditioning  vehicle dismantling  and parts remanufacturing activities  with the scope set to expand further globally. The business unit‚Äôs ambition is also complementary to the 2016 acquisition of Aramis  a European leader in the online multi-brand purchase and sale of used cars  that will (by year-end) have seven in-house refurbishing centers  strategically placed over Western and Central Europe.In addition to circular economy hubs  the business unit will use ‚Äòlocal loops ‚Äô to keep products and materials within countries  speeding deliveries for customers. In Brazil  key parts  i.e.  starter motors and alternators from Stellantis brand vehicles  are remanufactured  distributed and sold across 1 000 local dealerships ‚àí supporting the Circular Economy philosophy and the drive to carbon net zero.This builds on the skills the Company currently have and is another important step in the implementation of the strategic plan for Stellantis‚Äô Circular Economy Business Unit as it pushes to quadruple extended life revenues for parts and services and increase recycling revenues by 10 times by 2030 as compared to 2021.Introducing SUSTAINeraWith the expansion of circular economy activities  the business unit is also launching its new SUSTAINera label for parts and accessories  indicating a savings of up to 80% materials and 50% energy as compared to their equivalent new parts.

By correcting a faulty mutation or inserting a corrected gene at the HSPC level  we aim to provide a lifelong supply of healthy cells in a single intervention ‚Äù said Philippe Duchateau  Ph.D.  Chief Scientific Officer at Cellectis. ‚ÄúThese new milestones bring us one step closer to our goal: providing a cure to patients that have failed to respond to standard therapy.‚ÄùPresentation detailsPre-clinical data presentation on a non-viral DNA delivery associated with TALEN¬Æ gene editing that leads to highly efficient correction of sickle cell mutation in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cellsSickle cell disease stems from a single point mutation in the HBB gene which results in sickle hemoglobin.Cellectis leveraged its TALEN¬Æ technology to develop a gene editing process that leads to highly efficient HBB gene correction via homology directed repair  while mitigating potential risks associated to HBB gene knock-out.Overall  these results show that non-viral DNA delivery associated with TALEN¬Æ gene editing reduces the toxicity usually observed with viral DNA delivery and allows high levels of HBB gene correction in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.The oral presentation titled ‚ÄúNon-viral DNA delivery associated to TALEN¬Æ gene editing leads to highly efficient correction of sickle cell mutation in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells‚Äù  will be made on Thursday  October 13th  8:30AM-10:45AM BST by Arianna Moiani  Ph.D.  Senior Scientist & Team Leader Innovation Gene Therapy. The presentation can be found on the Cellectis website on the day of the presentation.Presentation detailsPre-clinical data presentation on TALEN¬Æ-mediated engineering of HSPC that enables systemic delivery of IDUAMucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) is caused by deficiencies in the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene and it is associated with severe morbidity representing a significant unmet medical need.Cellectis established a TALEN¬Æ-based ex vivo gene editing protocol to insert an IDUA-expression cassette into a specific locus of HSPC.Editing rates in vivo were 6-9% sixteen weeks after injection  depending on the tissue analyzed (blood  spleen  bone marrow). Lastly  8.3% of human cells were edited in the brain compartment.Cellectis established a safe TALEN¬Æ-based gene editing protocol procuring IDUA-edited HSPCs able to engraft  differentiate into multiple lineages and reach multiple tissues  including the brain.The poster presentation titled ‚ÄúTALEN¬Æ-mediated engineering of HSPC enables systemic delivery of IDUA‚Äù  will be made on Thursday  October 13th  5:30PM - 7:15PM BST by Eduardo Seclen  Ph.D.  Senior Scientist & Team Leader  Gene Editing  and can be found on Cellectis website.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Prior to its launch in 2025  Orient Express reveals its never-before-seen d√©cors revealed in Paris in an immersive exhibition.S√©bastien Bazin  Chairman & CEO  Accor: ""We are proud  today  to reveal the first images of the future Orient Express train.

Maxime d'Angeac's design awakens the myth with the revelation of its luxury  modernity  and French elegance.

With this project  he writes the new destiny of a myth. An idea born of a dream  he explains: ""this is the reinterpretation of a legendary train  conceived as a new embassy of French luxury  sublimated by the know-how and talents of the best French craftsmen"".Orient Express unveils for the first time the decor of the future Bar-Car  a sumptuous showcase inviting passengers under large domes of light inspired by the Second Empire style.

Another for the staff.Spectacular and unexpected  the Dining-Car revisits the codes of the Orient Express. Maxime d'Angeac reinterprets the ""rail"" motif created by Suzanne Lalique-Haviland in the 1930s  which has been reworked on the partitions using the stoneboard technique. Under a mirrored ceiling  crossed by a series of arches  tables and wraparound armchairs line up  lit by lampshades revisiting the original models.The Suites invite you into absolute comfort and a functional spirit. Everywhere  the corners are rounded  the partitions are covered with precious wood and leather  the headboards embroidered with wood  mother of pearl and bronze. In a niche  the famous Lalique ""Blackbirds & Grapes"" panels  originating from the historic train  are displayed. At the time of the ""Great Transformation""  the large sofas are revealed in the comfort of a large bed.

This initiative is aimed at providing accommodation and safety within Accor hotels for women and children who are victims of abuse. Financed by Accor  this platform helps ensure that emergency accommodation is provided quicker and more securely. It addresses an essential need of the Fondation des Femmes and the non-profit organizations it supports  including the F√©d√©ration Nationale Solidarit√© Femmes (French National Federation for Women‚Äôs Solidarity). 4 in 10 female victims of abuse who request accommodation sadly have to be turned away  due to emergency schemes being at full capacity. [1] In addition  such schemes are not always best suited to accommodating women and children who have suffered so much.Via this platform  Accor is committing to providing female victims of abuse with a hotel room. The quality of the accommodation offered  even for a brief period  is a key factor in the pathway out of violence and towards rebuilding their lives. Since March 2022  148 women and children have already benefited from this ground-breaking program  which is being rolled out throughout France. This project is also being financed by the Fondation BNP Paribas and Alternative Patrimoine.‚ÄúEmergency Shelter‚Äù extends the emergency scheme introduced by Accor during the Covid-19 pandemic  which provided access to overnight stays at a cost price. During the lockdown periods  domestic abuse and violence increased significantly and the shortage of emergency accommodation intensified*.This initiative is in line with Accor‚Äôs commitment to help protect female victims of abuse  and the huge need for accommodation which requires widespread action.According to Anne-C√©cile Mailfert  President of the Fondation des Femmes  ‚ÄúEnsuring that women who leave an abusive situation are immediately offered secure and decent accommodation is key to helping them look towards a brighter long-term future. This project helps to step up our collective response against the scourge of violence against women.‚ÄùS√©bastien Bazin  Chairman and CEO of Accor  said  ‚ÄúFor many years Accor has been committed to combatting discrimination and violence against women  and the launch of this platform is a source of great pride for us. Welcoming and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do. Working alongside the Fondation des Femmes to roll out this scheme  offering shelter to women and children who have suffered violence  and enabling them to rebuild their lives with dignity was a natural development for us.‚ÄùBrune Poirson  Chief Sustainability Officer Accor  added  ‚ÄúWe are pleased with the launch of the ‚ÄúEmergency Shelter‚Äù dedicated platform. For women and children who have suffered domestic violence  having access to accommodation is a major step in guaranteeing their safety. This platform will therefore mean our hotels can offer emergency accommodation quicker and more securely  to ensure that no one is left alone without support.‚Äù*To handle emergency needs and situations quickly  Accor introduced CEDA ‚Äì Coronavirus Emergency Desk Accor ‚Äì which aimed to centralize all requirements and provide accommodation solutions throughout France to homeless people  victims of abuse and healthcare personnel in action during the pandemic. In 2021  with Accor‚Äôs support  more than 700 female victims and their children benefitted from 13 867 emergency overnight stays.[1] Report - ‚ÄúIs there money for providing accommodation to female victims of violence?‚Äù  November 2021  Fondation des Femmes and F√©d√©ration Nationale Solidarit√© Femmes.About La Fondation des FemmesLa Fondation des Femmes  under the aegis of the Fondation de France  is the leading foundation in France for women‚Äôs rights and freedom and combatting violence against women.

This is a new step in our Climate Plan launched at the beginning of 2020: to develop an industrializable  carbon-neutral product for heating and lighting. In addition  the cost of the equipment Auton0m is more than offset by the lower energy bill. This gain on the bill will become increasingly important in a context of rising energy prices.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.On August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

October 11  2022. Late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) will be presented today at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022. The data will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.Mirna Chehade  M.DMount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine  Mount Sinai‚ÄúEosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child‚Äôs fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development. These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage - caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation - and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.‚ÄùDupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Story continuesSafety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Sanofi and Regeneron used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension period to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as a more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

With the impact of epidemic waves diminishing  COVID activities are declining as expected. The Group's good control of its working capital requirement enabled it to post a positive cash position of ‚Ç¨111.2 million at June 30  and to accelerate the implementation of its strategy as well as its share buyback program. Were thus acquired : Bmd Belgium (June) and  post-closing (October)  the Dutch company GenDX  a structuring transaction that brings many synergies.in ‚Ç¨m 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 Change IVD product sales 83.6 95.6 -12.6% Other revenues 0.7 0.3 +133% Total revenues 84.3 95.9 -12.1% Cost of goods sold -43.4 -41.4 +4.8% Gross margin 40.9 54.6 -25.1% R&D expenses -1.4 -1.2 +16.7% Marketing and sales expenses -8.9 -7.6 +17.1% G&A expenses -6.3 -4.7 +34.0% Operating income 22.0 40.0 -45.0% EBITDA 26.0 42.5 -38.8% Financial result 0.4 -0.3 - Extraordinary result -0.1 0.2 - Goodwill amortization -1.4 -1.4 - Taxes -3.1 -5.4 -42.6% Net income 19.2 33.1 -42.0% Net income excluding goodwill amortization & Deferred Tax Assets 20.6 34.5 -40.3% 30 June 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Cash (including marketable securities) 111.2 102.4 Financial debt * 8.8 10.7 Shareholders equity 168.6 160.6* excluding financial lease (‚Ç¨4.4m at 30/06/22 vs ‚Ç¨5.0m at 31/12/21)Good overall business strengthWith a growth of +5.1% in its turnover excluding COVID to ‚Ç¨43.0M in the 1st half of 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨40.9M in the 1st half of 2021  and COVID sales at ‚Ç¨40.6M compared to ‚Ç¨54.8M (-26%)  Eurobio Scientific recorded revenue of ‚Ç¨83.6m in the 1st half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨95.6m in the 1st half of 2021. This activity reflects:- The significant and continued growth of traditional activities  excluding COVID  despite the termination of less profitable partnerships as a result of increased selectivity in terms of distribution;- Continued substantial COVID revenue despite a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes  partially offset by the extension of the product portfolio with specific tests for the characterization of SARS-Cov-2 virus variants.Results impacted by the anticipated drop in COVID salesIn the 1st half of 2022  the gross margin stood at ‚Ç¨40.9 million  compared to ‚Ç¨54.6 million in the 1st half of 2021. This decline is linked to the drop in revenue from COVID activities and to provisions made on the inventory of COVID products as part of the pandemic slowdown. Restated for these provisions  the gross margin would amount to ‚Ç¨46.1 million  i.e. a rate of 55.1% compared to 57.1% in H1 2021.R&D expenses and marketing and sales expenses are increasing slightly faster than sales  in order to support future growth. The faster rise in general and administrative expenses includes expenses related to corporate finance transactions during the half-year: two acquisitions and a strategic and capitalistic partnership. Operating income is therefore down at ‚Ç¨22.0m (‚Ç¨40.0m in H1 2021)  and EBITDA at ‚Ç¨26.0m (‚Ç¨42.5m in H1 2021).The financial result is positive (+0.4 vs -0.3 in H1 2021) due to foreign exchange gains  in particular linked to the valuation of assets in dollars.Corporate tax amounted to ‚Ç¨3.1m  compared to ‚Ç¨5.4m in H1 2021.After taking into account ‚Ç¨1.4 million in goodwill amortization  net income for the first half of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨19.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨33.1 million in H1 2021.Strong operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5m (‚Ç¨29.9m in H1 2021)Even though it is lower compared to last year  Eurobio Scientific continues to generate significant operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5 million (-14.7% compared to H1 2021)  mainly thanks to a better control of its WCR and to the decrease in operating receivables.This good performance enabled the Company to accelerate its share buyback program for which it allocated ‚Ç¨10.6 million during the half-year.The total amount of cash thus amounted to ‚Ç¨111.2 million as of June 30  2022 and shareholders equity rose to ‚Ç¨168.6 million. Financial debt decreased again  to ‚Ç¨8.8m compared to ‚Ç¨10.7m at 12/31/21.Perspectives: decisive and strategic developmentsThe historical activities of Eurobio Scientific should grow steadily  with stronger margins linked to the increasing share of proprietary products and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio. In addition  as the slowdown in the COVID diagnostics market continues  but in a non-linear fashion  the Group remains attentive and cautious in order to continue to serve the needs of its customers while cushioning the decline in this business segment.Backed by significant cash and its leadership position  the Group has made two acquisitions in recent months to accelerate the deployment of its strategic axis:increasing the share of proprietary products continued international expansion  andopening of new market segments.The takeover of bmd Belgique in June strengthens the Group's sales and marketing presence in the Benelux zone.The acquisition of GenDX  which closing was just completed on October 3  takes on a particular dimension. It is strategic and transformative as it brings value in each of the Group's three strategic areas:GenDx has a range of highly innovative and 100% proprietary products;it is also present directly in the Netherlands  Germany and North America as well as  via its distributors  in the rest of Europe and Asia;finally  GenDx's technological advance in the digitization of diagnostics  through the algorithms and software developed by its bioinformatics specialists  will enable the Group to address new market segments well beyond transplantation on which GenDx was positioned until now.Next financial meetings2022 sales : January 23  2023  after market closes2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesDisclaimerThis press release contains elements that are not historical facts including  without limitation  certain statements about future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

""These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage ‚Äì caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation ‚Äì and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.""As presented at UEG Week 2022  Dupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of patients on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Story continuesSafety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with one or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

It was important to assess the retinal changes with PRIMA implants since the success of retinal stimulation with micro-electrodes largely depends on the distance between the stimulation electrode (in the implant) and the target cells.The Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images of three patients with subretinal implantations enrolled in the French feasibility study were analyzed to [1] measure the retinal thickness  [2] measure the distance between the array and the inner nuclear layer (INL  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) and [3] evaluate any potential macular changes from the surgical trauma.The analysis found that the surgical delivery of the photovoltaic subretinal implant led to a stable retinal thickness over 36 months with no adverse structural or functional events after causing minor retinal thickness changes that settle after three months.""We are very pleased to announce the publication of these peer-reviewed data in the well-respected Journal of Neural Engineering showing that the surgical implantation of the Prima System in patients suffering from dry AMD leads to a stable retinal thickness three months after implantation "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""The PRIMA implant's small size and wireless design enable minimally invasive surgery. Previously  the data from the French feasibility study already demonstrated that the Prima System is well tolerated. The data in this paper now further demonstrate the stability and minimal impact of the implant once in position. We are confidently looking forward to the read-out from our pivotal PRIMAvera study on the Prima System due at the end of next year and our planned submission for market approval in Europe shortly afterward.""Key take-awaysThe key take-aways from the data published in the Journal of Neural Engineering are:No significant changes in the distance between the surface of the implant and the INL (the Inner Nuclear Layer  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) were detectedTotal retinal thickness above the implant decreased by a mean of 39 ¬µm during 3-months post-implantation  but no significant changes were observed after that  up to 36 months of the follow-upThe observations support the hypothesis that the retina on the different areas on the implant are equally supplied with nutrition and oxygenPixium Vision's pivotal PRIMAvera study  which aims to demonstrate the safety and benefits of the Prima System  is ongoing in Europe  with a read-out expected towards the end of 2023 and regulatory submission for market approval due soon after. In the US  a feasibility study is also ongoing.The full peer-reviewed Journal of Neural Engineering paper is available online here.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

The agency has also changed the outlook for Coface to positive from stable.In its press release  Moody‚Äôs highlights that this rating reflect ‚ÄúCoface strong capitalisation  good profitability and limited exposure to Russia. Coface has consistently maintained a group‚Äôs solvency ratio above 190% since 2020 and the ratio has a low sensitivity to financial and macroeconomic shocks. This low sensitivity was reinforced by recent improvements in the group‚Äôs asset quality.‚ÄùIn addition  Coface‚Äôs profitability has been very strong in the last five years  with an average combined ratio of 75% between 2017 and 2021.Moody‚Äôs also believes that  since 2016  ‚Äúthe group has improved its risk monitoring processes and it has been more proactive to adjust its risk portfolio‚Äù. Moody‚Äôs expects ‚Äúthese improvements to translate into less ample shocks on the group‚Äôs combined ratio going forward  even if earnings volatility will remain a feature of the credit insurance industry.‚ÄùLast  in its outlook  the rating agency underscores that this ‚Äúchange in outlook to positive from stable reflects the increasing diversification of the group and the enhanced monitoring and improved management of credit risk exposures which Moody‚Äôs expects to result in lower volatility in profits and make the insurer better placed to weather an economic downturn.‚ÄùPhalla Gervais  Chief Finance & Risk Officer  commented:‚ÄúWe welcome this change of outlook  which rewards Coface teams‚Äô work and recognizes the high level of service offered to our clients.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.On August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Recycle ‚Äì Production scraps and end-of-life vehicles are fed back into the manufacturing process. In just six months  the business unit has collected 1 million recycled parts.Hubs Complemented by Local LoopsStellantis‚Äô Circular Economy Business Unit plan calls for aggressive scaling up in volumes and expansion to new countries  while ensuring constant innovation and re-skilling for new techs.In September  Stellantis announced that its leading Circular Economy Hub will launch in 2023 at its Mirafiori Complex in Italy. The dedicated operation will enable the expansion of Stellantis‚Äô current activities and support its ‚Äòcradle-to-cradle‚Äô business model in Europe. The Hub will host vehicle reconditioning  vehicle dismantling  and parts remanufacturing activities  with the scope set to expand further globally. The business unit‚Äôs ambition is also complementary to the 2016 acquisition of Aramis  a European leader in the online multi-brand purchase and sale of used cars  that will (by year-end) have seven in-house refurbishing centers  strategically placed overWestern and Central Europe.In addition to circular economy hubs  the business unit will use ‚Äòlocal loops ‚Äô to keep products and materials within countries  speeding deliveries for customers. In Brazil  key parts  i.e.  starter motors and alternators from Stellantis brand vehicles  are remanufactured  distributed and sold across 1 000 local dealerships ‚àí supporting the Circular Economy philosophy and the drive to carbon net zero.This builds on the skills the Company currently have and is another important step in the implementation of the strategic plan for Stellantis‚Äô Circular Economy Business Unit as it pushes to quadruple extended life revenues for parts and services and increase recycling revenues by 10 times by 2030 as compared to 2021.Introducing SUSTAINeraWith the expansion of circular economy activities  the business unit is also launching its new SUSTAINera label for parts and accessories  indicating a savings of up to 80% materials and 50% energy as compared to their equivalent new parts. The values are determined by conducting a life-cycle analysis of the corresponding best-seller in each product family in accordance with a methodology approved by Sphera  an independent company.‚ÄúThe SUSTAINera label represents our promise to provide customers sustainable  transparent and affordable products and services to our customers for all brands of vehicles  without compromising quality  while preserving the environment through decreased waste and less use of our planet‚Äôs resources ‚Äù said Alison Jones.Chosen from among hundreds of Stellantis employees‚Äô proposals  the SUSTAINera label also embodies the Company‚Äôs core value of making a better future through a responsible business entering a new era of sustainability.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

October 11  2022. Late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) will be presented today at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022. The data will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.Mirna Chehade  M.DMount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine  Mount Sinai‚ÄúEosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child‚Äôs fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development. These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage - caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation - and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.‚ÄùDupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Sanofi and Regeneron used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension period to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as a more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The data will be shared at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022 and submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next year. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.""Eosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child's fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development "" said Mirna Chehade  M.D.  Mount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York and principal investigator of the trial. ""These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage ‚Äì caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation ‚Äì and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.""As presented at UEG Week 2022  Dupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of patients on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with one or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K?) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.On August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase ? Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3K? (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3K? pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3K? and PI3K?  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K? and PI3K? are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K? in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K? is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The data will be shared at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022 and submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next year. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.""Eosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child's fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development "" said Mirna Chehade  M.D.  Mount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York and principal investigator of the trial. ""These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage ‚Äì caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation ‚Äì and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.""As presented at UEG Week 2022  Dupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of patients on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with one or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(REUTERS) The atmosphere at a conference of currency market professionals was markedly different from the previous few years: there was a buzz.,The atmosphere at a conference was markedly different from the previous few years: there was a buzz.The atmosphere at a conference of currency market professionals was markedly different from the previous few years: there was a buzz.Senior executives from banks and brokers were feeling optimistic about the prospects of foreign-exchange trading at the recent gathering in Amsterdam. They've spent years eyeing the world of crypto with envy  as digital assets thrived in a highly volatile market  while traditional money remained dull.Currencies are now at the forefront of the action. Rapidly climbing interest-rate risks around the world and increased geopolitical tensions are fueling a 30% surge in trading and historic moves  reviving an industry that spent the past decade struggling with stagnant volumes.‚ÄúFX as an asset class is really back this year ‚Äù said Russell LaScala  the global head of FX at Deutsche Bank AG  the world's largest currency player by market share. ‚ÄúI think last year a lot of macro hedge funds were trading different assets  including crypto.‚ÄùThe notoriously wild swings in crypto markets have subsided this year  with the Bitcoin Volatility Index shedding more than 50% since a peak in May. By contrast  both Deutsche Bank's and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s gauges of currency volatility are at the highest in a decade apart from a spike when the pandemic struck.And the moves have been shocking: in Japan  authorities sold dollars to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998  while the euro sank below parity with the dollar to a 20-year low. In London  the world's top currency trading hub  the pound slid to an all-time low.‚ÄúVolatility is a bit like a London bus: there are either none to be found for love or money  or three arrive at the same time ‚Äù said Kit Juckes  global head of currency strategy at Societe Generale SA.FX Traders Relish Volatile Markets After Years in the DoldrumsThe action has drawn in speculative players such as macro hedge funds and grabbed the attention of real-money investors  whose portfolio valuations are now subject to sudden swings. The war in Ukraine and aggressive Fed rate hikes heightened the moves  drawing money to the dollar as a haven and influencing other markets from Bitcoin to stocks.‚ÄúFX has become a much bigger focus  even for investors who are not typically focused on FX for two main reasons: the dollar has been the one remaining effective hedge across markets and the dollar's appreciation has been very tradable for speculative investors ‚Äù said Ebrahim Rahbari  the global head of foreign-exchange analysis and content at Citigroup Inc.At TradeTechFX  the Amsterdam conference  executives packed sessions with titles such as ‚ÄúHow can you ready your FX desk for heightened volatility ‚Äù before taking to the floor at afterparties fueled by expresso martinis.Crypto players  following debates on whether progress in building an institutional ecosystem has been ‚Äúhindered by the ‚Äòwinter '‚Äù looked grim  muttering in corners. Bitcoin has been stagnant at around $20 000 for months in a collapse from last year's peak near $70 000.Crypto Lending Now Pays Less Than Safest US Government Debt‚ÄúCrypto seemed to be having all the fun until the central banks started breaking things ‚Äù said Tanvir Sandhu  chief global derivatives strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. ‚ÄúIt took inflation to blast the secular decline in currency volatility as central banks unleashed years of suppression. Volatility creates opportunity and it's a trader's best friend.‚ÄùIn fact  cryptocurrencies command only a fraction of volumes of foreign exchange markets  for all the attention they generate. Trades of fiat currencies clock in at around $6.6 trillion each day  according to the Bank for International Settlements. That compares with just under $1 trillion for Bitcoin and other tokens  according to data website CoinMarketcap.It's likely that markets are now migrating to a higher range for interest rates and bond yields and that will be accompanied by higher currency volatility on average  Societe Generale's Juckes said.This is boon to the firms that dominate the space. Trading activity on major exchanges has soared compared with last year  while profits at the largest currency trading banks stand at multi-year highs.EBS Market  a platform owned by CME Group Inc.  posted a 30% increase in spot trading in September compared with a year ago  with futures trading at a record high. Spot volumes hit $76 billion  the highest since the pandemic struck in March 2020. Other large platforms have also enjoyed a boost  with Euronext FX seeing a 20% increase in August  according to website LiquidityFinder.Good BusinessIt's not all been plain sailing. At times liquidity has still been challenging  said Citigroup's Rahbari.‚ÄúThere have been occasions when large asset price movements were in fact observed with relatively little flow  similar to patterns in other markets this year ‚Äù he said.Overall though  the jump in volatility has benefited Deutsche Bank  UBS Group AG and JPMorgan  the top three banks by market share. They control 30% of the market  according to an annual survey of currency trading banks by Euromoney.JPMorgan clocked up a 15% increase in its fixed-income markets business in the second quarter. UBS highlighted foreign exchange as a driver of revenues that climbed 19% at its global markets division. Meanwhile  fixed income and currencies at Deutsche Bank grew 32%  the best second quarter in a decade.‚ÄúI've been doing this for a long time and when you get markets that are volatile  but not disorderly  client activity increases and that's usually good for the business ‚Äù LaScala said.,negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,mixed,0.15,0.12,0.73,True,English,"['Market Trading Chaos', 'Currencies', 'Crypto', 'Forefront', 'aggressive Fed rate hikes', 'Safest US Government Debt', 'one remaining effective hedge', 'chief global derivatives strategist', 'large asset price movements', 'top currency trading hub', 'largest currency trading banks', 'largest currency player', 'macro hedge funds', 'two main reasons', 'UBS Group AG', 'top three banks', 'Other large platforms', 'CME Group Inc.', 'currency market professionals', 'Societe Generale SA', 'foreign exchange markets', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'higher currency volatility', 'Bitcoin Volatility Index', 'asset class', 'currency strategy', 'global head', 'higher range', 'foreign-exchange trading', 'Trading activity', 'spot trading', 'futures trading', 'central banks', 'volatile market', 'market share', 'other tokens', 'EBS Market', 'other markets', 'recent gathering', 'digital assets', 'interest-rate risks', 'geopolitical tensions', 'Russell LaScala', 'different assets', 'wild swings', 'first time', 'same time', 'speculative players', 'portfolio valuations', 'sudden swings', 'bigger focus', 'foreign-exchange analysis', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'expresso martinis', 'institutional ecosystem', 'last year', 'Tanvir Sandhu', 'Bloomberg Intelligence', 'secular decline', 'International Settlements', 'interest rates', 'bond yields', 'major exchanges', 'multi-year highs', 'record high', 'Good Business', 'little flow', 'heightened volatility', 'stagnant volumes', 'real-money investors', 'speculative investors', 'Spot volumes', 'Senior executives', 'past decade', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'London bus', 'Kit Juckes', 'Ebrahim Rahbari', 'Crypto players', 'Crypto Lending', 'fiat currencies', 'data website', 'FX Traders', 'FX desk', 'Euronext FX', 'crypto markets', 'traditional money', 'historic moves', 'Amsterdam conference', 'atmosphere', 'previous', 'years', 'buzz', 'brokers', 'prospects', 'world', 'envy', 'forefront', 'action', '30% surge', 'industry', 'lot', 'peak', 'May', 'contrast', 'Co.', 'gauges', 'spike', 'pandemic', 'Japan', 'authorities', 'dollars', 'yen', 'parity', '20-year', 'pound', 'none', 'love', 'Doldrums', 'attention', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'haven', 'stocks', 'appreciation', 'content', 'TradeTechFX', 'sessions', 'titles', 'floor', 'afterparties', 'debates', 'progress', 'winter', 'corners', 'months', 'collapse', 'things', 'inflation', 'suppression', 'opportunity', 'best', 'fact', 'cryptocurrencies', 'Trades', 'CoinMarketcap', 'average', 'boon', 'firms', 'space', 'profits', '30% increase', 'September', 'March', 'boost', '20% increase', 'August', 'LiquidityFinder', 'times', 'occasions', 'patterns', 'jump']",2022-10-11,2022-10-11,tech.hindustantimes.com

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.On August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.
