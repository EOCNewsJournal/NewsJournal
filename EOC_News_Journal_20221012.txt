(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.Pharming Group N.V. logoOn August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""Story continuesThe MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

With the impact of epidemic waves diminishing  COVID activities are declining as expected. The Group's good control of its working capital requirement enabled it to post a positive cash position of ‚Ç¨111.2 million at June 30  and to accelerate the implementation of its strategy as well as its share buyback program. Were thus acquired : Bmd Belgium (June) and  post-closing (October)  the Dutch company GenDX  a structuring transaction that brings many synergies.in ‚Ç¨m 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 Change IVD product sales 83.6 95.6 -12.6% Other revenues 0.7 0.3 +133% Total revenues 84.3 95.9 -12.1% Cost of goods sold -43.4 -41.4 +4.8% Gross margin 40.9 54.6 -25.1% R&D expenses -1.4 -1.2 +16.7% Marketing and sales expenses -8.9 -7.6 +17.1% G&A expenses -6.3 -4.7 +34.0% Operating income 22.0 40.0 -45.0% EBITDA 26.0 42.5 -38.8% Financial result 0.4 -0.3 - Extraordinary result -0.1 0.2 - Goodwill amortization -1.4 -1.4 - Taxes -3.1 -5.4 -42.6% Net income 19.2 33.1 -42.0% Net income excluding goodwill amortization & Deferred Tax Assets 20.6 34.5 -40.3% 30 June 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Cash (including marketable securities) 111.2 102.4 Financial debt * 8.8 10.7 Shareholders equity 168.6 160.6* excluding financial lease (‚Ç¨4.4m at 30/06/22 vs ‚Ç¨5.0m at 31/12/21)Good overall business strengthStory continuesWith a growth of +5.1% in its turnover excluding COVID to ‚Ç¨43.0M in the 1st half of 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨40.9M in the 1st half of 2021  and COVID sales at ‚Ç¨40.6M compared to ‚Ç¨54.8M (-26%)  Eurobio Scientific recorded revenue of ‚Ç¨83.6m in the 1st half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨95.6m in the 1st half of 2021. This activity reflects:- The significant and continued growth of traditional activities  excluding COVID  despite the termination of less profitable partnerships as a result of increased selectivity in terms of distribution;- Continued substantial COVID revenue despite a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes  partially offset by the extension of the product portfolio with specific tests for the characterization of SARS-Cov-2 virus variants.Results impacted by the anticipated drop in COVID salesIn the 1st half of 2022  the gross margin stood at ‚Ç¨40.9 million  compared to ‚Ç¨54.6 million in the 1st half of 2021. This decline is linked to the drop in revenue from COVID activities and to provisions made on the inventory of COVID products as part of the pandemic slowdown. Restated for these provisions  the gross margin would amount to ‚Ç¨46.1 million  i.e. a rate of 55.1% compared to 57.1% in H1 2021.R&D expenses and marketing and sales expenses are increasing slightly faster than sales  in order to support future growth. The faster rise in general and administrative expenses includes expenses related to corporate finance transactions during the half-year: two acquisitions and a strategic and capitalistic partnership. Operating income is therefore down at ‚Ç¨22.0m (‚Ç¨40.0m in H1 2021)  and EBITDA at ‚Ç¨26.0m (‚Ç¨42.5m in H1 2021).The financial result is positive (+0.4 vs -0.3 in H1 2021) due to foreign exchange gains  in particular linked to the valuation of assets in dollars.Corporate tax amounted to ‚Ç¨3.1m  compared to ‚Ç¨5.4m in H1 2021.After taking into account ‚Ç¨1.4 million in goodwill amortization  net income for the first half of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨19.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨33.1 million in H1 2021.Strong operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5m (‚Ç¨29.9m in H1 2021)Even though it is lower compared to last year  Eurobio Scientific continues to generate significant operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5 million (-14.7% compared to H1 2021)  mainly thanks to a better control of its WCR and to the decrease in operating receivables.This good performance enabled the Company to accelerate its share buyback program for which it allocated ‚Ç¨10.6 million during the half-year.The total amount of cash thus amounted to ‚Ç¨111.2 million as of June 30  2022 and shareholders equity rose to ‚Ç¨168.6 million. Financial debt decreased again  to ‚Ç¨8.8m compared to ‚Ç¨10.7m at 12/31/21.Perspectives: decisive and strategic developmentsThe historical activities of Eurobio Scientific should grow steadily  with stronger margins linked to the increasing share of proprietary products and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio. In addition  as the slowdown in the COVID diagnostics market continues  but in a non-linear fashion  the Group remains attentive and cautious in order to continue to serve the needs of its customers while cushioning the decline in this business segment.Backed by significant cash and its leadership position  the Group has made two acquisitions in recent months to accelerate the deployment of its strategic axis:increasing the share of proprietary products continued international expansion  andopening of new market segments.The takeover of bmd Belgique in June strengthens the Group's sales and marketing presence in the Benelux zone.The acquisition of GenDX  which closing was just completed on October 3  takes on a particular dimension. It is strategic and transformative as it brings value in each of the Group's three strategic areas:GenDx has a range of highly innovative and 100% proprietary products;it is also present directly in the Netherlands  Germany and North America as well as  via its distributors  in the rest of Europe and Asia;finally  GenDx's technological advance in the digitization of diagnostics  through the algorithms and software developed by its bioinformatics specialists  will enable the Group to address new market segments well beyond transplantation on which GenDx was positioned until now.Next financial meetings2022 sales : January 23  2023  after market closes2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesDisclaimerThis press release contains elements that are not historical facts including  without limitation  certain statements about future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

It was important to assess the retinal changes with PRIMA implants since the success of retinal stimulation with micro-electrodes largely depends on the distance between the stimulation electrode (in the implant) and the target cells.The Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images of three patients with subretinal implantations enrolled in the French feasibility study were analyzed to [1] measure the retinal thickness  [2] measure the distance between the array and the inner nuclear layer (INL  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) and [3] evaluate any potential macular changes from the surgical trauma.Story continuesThe analysis found that the surgical delivery of the photovoltaic subretinal implant led to a stable retinal thickness over 36 months with no adverse structural or functional events after causing minor retinal thickness changes that settle after three months.""We are very pleased to announce the publication of these peer-reviewed data in the well-respected Journal of Neural Engineering showing that the surgical implantation of the Prima System in patients suffering from dry AMD leads to a stable retinal thickness three months after implantation "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""The PRIMA implant's small size and wireless design enable minimally invasive surgery. Previously  the data from the French feasibility study already demonstrated that the Prima System is well tolerated. The data in this paper now further demonstrate the stability and minimal impact of the implant once in position. We are confidently looking forward to the read-out from our pivotal PRIMAvera study on the Prima System due at the end of next year and our planned submission for market approval in Europe shortly afterward.""Key take-awaysThe key take-aways from the data published in the Journal of Neural Engineering are:No significant changes in the distance between the surface of the implant and the INL (the Inner Nuclear Layer  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) were detectedTotal retinal thickness above the implant decreased by a mean of 39 ¬µm during 3-months post-implantation  but no significant changes were observed after that  up to 36 months of the follow-upThe observations support the hypothesis that the retina on the different areas on the implant are equally supplied with nutrition and oxygenPixium Vision's pivotal PRIMAvera study  which aims to demonstrate the safety and benefits of the Prima System  is ongoing in Europe  with a read-out expected towards the end of 2023 and regulatory submission for market approval due soon after. In the US  a feasibility study is also ongoing.The full peer-reviewed Journal of Neural Engineering paper is available online here.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

The dedicated operation will enable the expansion of Stellantis‚Äô current activities and support its ‚Äòcradle-to-cradle‚Äô business model in Europe. The Hub will host vehicle reconditioning  vehicle dismantling  and parts remanufacturing activities  with the scope set to expand further globally. The business unit‚Äôs ambition is also complementary to the 2016 acquisition of Aramis  a European leader in the online multi-brand purchase and sale of used cars  that will (by year-end) have seven in-house refurbishing centers  strategically placed over Western and Central Europe.In addition to circular economy hubs  the business unit will use ‚Äòlocal loops ‚Äô to keep products and materials within countries  speeding deliveries for customers. In Brazil  key parts  i.e.  starter motors and alternators from Stellantis brand vehicles  are remanufactured  distributed and sold across 1 000 local dealerships ‚àí supporting the Circular Economy philosophy and the drive to carbon net zero.This builds on the skills the Company currently have and is another important step in the implementation of the strategic plan for Stellantis‚Äô Circular Economy Business Unit as it pushes to quadruple extended life revenues for parts and services and increase recycling revenues by 10 times by 2030 as compared to 2021.Introducing SUSTAINeraWith the expansion of circular economy activities  the business unit is also launching its new SUSTAINera label for parts and accessories  indicating a savings of up to 80% materials and 50% energy as compared to their equivalent new parts. The values are determined by conducting a life-cycle analysis of the corresponding best-seller in each product family in accordance with a methodology approved by Sphera  an independent company.‚ÄúThe SUSTAINera label represents our promise to provide customers sustainable  transparent and affordable products and services to our customers for all brands of vehicles  without compromising quality  while preserving the environment through decreased waste and less use of our planet‚Äôs resources ‚Äù said Alison Jones.Chosen from among hundreds of Stellantis employees‚Äô proposals  the SUSTAINera label also embodies the Company‚Äôs core value of making a better future through a responsible business entering a new era of sustainability.Go to Circular Economy Event pageAbout StellantisStellantis N.V.

By correcting a faulty mutation or inserting a corrected gene at the HSPC level  we aim to provide a lifelong supply of healthy cells in a single intervention ‚Äù said Philippe Duchateau  Ph.D.  Chief Scientific Officer at Cellectis. ‚ÄúThese new milestones bring us one step closer to our goal: providing a cure to patients that have failed to respond to standard therapy.‚ÄùPresentation detailsPre-clinical data presentation on a non-viral DNA delivery associated with TALEN¬Æ gene editing that leads to highly efficient correction of sickle cell mutation in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cellsSickle cell disease stems from a single point mutation in the HBB gene which results in sickle hemoglobin.Cellectis leveraged its TALEN¬Æ technology to develop a gene editing process that leads to highly efficient HBB gene correction via homology directed repair  while mitigating potential risks associated to HBB gene knock-out.Overall  these results show that non-viral DNA delivery associated with TALEN¬Æ gene editing reduces the toxicity usually observed with viral DNA delivery and allows high levels of HBB gene correction in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.The oral presentation titled ‚ÄúNon-viral DNA delivery associated to TALEN¬Æ gene editing leads to highly efficient correction of sickle cell mutation in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells‚Äù  will be made on Thursday  October 13th  8:30AM-10:45AM BST by Arianna Moiani  Ph.D.  Senior Scientist & Team Leader Innovation Gene Therapy. The presentation can be found on the Cellectis website on the day of the presentation.Presentation detailsPre-clinical data presentation on TALEN¬Æ-mediated engineering of HSPC that enables systemic delivery of IDUAMucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I) is caused by deficiencies in the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene and it is associated with severe morbidity representing a significant unmet medical need.Cellectis established a TALEN¬Æ-based ex vivo gene editing protocol to insert an IDUA-expression cassette into a specific locus of HSPC.Editing rates in vivo were 6-9% sixteen weeks after injection  depending on the tissue analyzed (blood  spleen  bone marrow). Lastly  8.3% of human cells were edited in the brain compartment.Cellectis established a safe TALEN¬Æ-based gene editing protocol procuring IDUA-edited HSPCs able to engraft  differentiate into multiple lineages and reach multiple tissues  including the brain.The poster presentation titled ‚ÄúTALEN¬Æ-mediated engineering of HSPC enables systemic delivery of IDUA‚Äù  will be made on Thursday  October 13th  5:30PM - 7:15PM BST by Eduardo Seclen  Ph.D.  Senior Scientist & Team Leader  Gene Editing  and can be found on Cellectis website.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Another for the staff.Spectacular and unexpected  the Dining-Car revisits the codes of the Orient Express. Maxime d'Angeac reinterprets the ""rail"" motif created by Suzanne Lalique-Haviland in the 1930s  which has been reworked on the partitions using the stoneboard technique. Under a mirrored ceiling  crossed by a series of arches  tables and wraparound armchairs line up  lit by lampshades revisiting the original models.The Suites invite you into absolute comfort and a functional spirit. Everywhere  the corners are rounded  the partitions are covered with precious wood and leather  the headboards embroidered with wood  mother of pearl and bronze.

This initiative is aimed at providing accommodation and safety within Accor hotels for women and children who are victims of abuse. Financed by Accor  this platform helps ensure that emergency accommodation is provided quicker and more securely. It addresses an essential need of the Fondation des Femmes and the non-profit organizations it supports  including the F√©d√©ration Nationale Solidarit√© Femmes (French National Federation for Women‚Äôs Solidarity). 4 in 10 female victims of abuse who request accommodation sadly have to be turned away  due to emergency schemes being at full capacity. [1] In addition  such schemes are not always best suited to accommodating women and children who have suffered so much.Via this platform  Accor is committing to providing female victims of abuse with a hotel room. The quality of the accommodation offered  even for a brief period  is a key factor in the pathway out of violence and towards rebuilding their lives. Since March 2022  148 women and children have already benefited from this ground-breaking program  which is being rolled out throughout France. This project is also being financed by the Fondation BNP Paribas and Alternative Patrimoine.‚ÄúEmergency Shelter‚Äù extends the emergency scheme introduced by Accor during the Covid-19 pandemic  which provided access to overnight stays at a cost price. During the lockdown periods  domestic abuse and violence increased significantly and the shortage of emergency accommodation intensified*.This initiative is in line with Accor‚Äôs commitment to help protect female victims of abuse  and the huge need for accommodation which requires widespread action.According to Anne-C√©cile Mailfert  President of the Fondation des Femmes  ‚ÄúEnsuring that women who leave an abusive situation are immediately offered secure and decent accommodation is key to helping them look towards a brighter long-term future. This project helps to step up our collective response against the scourge of violence against women.‚ÄùS√©bastien Bazin  Chairman and CEO of Accor  said  ‚ÄúFor many years Accor has been committed to combatting discrimination and violence against women  and the launch of this platform is a source of great pride for us. Welcoming and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do. Working alongside the Fondation des Femmes to roll out this scheme  offering shelter to women and children who have suffered violence  and enabling them to rebuild their lives with dignity was a natural development for us.‚ÄùBrune Poirson  Chief Sustainability Officer Accor  added  ‚ÄúWe are pleased with the launch of the ‚ÄúEmergency Shelter‚Äù dedicated platform. For women and children who have suffered domestic violence  having access to accommodation is a major step in guaranteeing their safety. This platform will therefore mean our hotels can offer emergency accommodation quicker and more securely  to ensure that no one is left alone without support.‚Äù*To handle emergency needs and situations quickly  Accor introduced CEDA ‚Äì Coronavirus Emergency Desk Accor ‚Äì which aimed to centralize all requirements and provide accommodation solutions throughout France to homeless people  victims of abuse and healthcare personnel in action during the pandemic. In 2021  with Accor‚Äôs support  more than 700 female victims and their children benefitted from 13 867 emergency overnight stays.[1] Report - ‚ÄúIs there money for providing accommodation to female victims of violence?‚Äù  November 2021  Fondation des Femmes and F√©d√©ration Nationale Solidarit√© Femmes.About La Fondation des FemmesLa Fondation des Femmes  under the aegis of the Fondation de France  is the leading foundation in France for women‚Äôs rights and freedom and combatting violence against women.

This is a new step in our Climate Plan launched at the beginning of 2020: to develop an industrializable  carbon-neutral product for heating and lighting.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.On August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

October 11  2022. Late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) will be presented today at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022. The data will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.Mirna Chehade  M.DMount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine  Mount Sinai‚ÄúEosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child‚Äôs fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development. These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage - caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation - and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.‚ÄùDupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Story continuesSafety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Sanofi and Regeneron used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension period to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as a more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

With the impact of epidemic waves diminishing  COVID activities are declining as expected. The Group's good control of its working capital requirement enabled it to post a positive cash position of ‚Ç¨111.2 million at June 30  and to accelerate the implementation of its strategy as well as its share buyback program. Were thus acquired : Bmd Belgium (June) and  post-closing (October)  the Dutch company GenDX  a structuring transaction that brings many synergies.in ‚Ç¨m 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 Change IVD product sales 83.6 95.6 -12.6% Other revenues 0.7 0.3 +133% Total revenues 84.3 95.9 -12.1% Cost of goods sold -43.4 -41.4 +4.8% Gross margin 40.9 54.6 -25.1% R&D expenses -1.4 -1.2 +16.7% Marketing and sales expenses -8.9 -7.6 +17.1% G&A expenses -6.3 -4.7 +34.0% Operating income 22.0 40.0 -45.0% EBITDA 26.0 42.5 -38.8% Financial result 0.4 -0.3 - Extraordinary result -0.1 0.2 - Goodwill amortization -1.4 -1.4 - Taxes -3.1 -5.4 -42.6% Net income 19.2 33.1 -42.0% Net income excluding goodwill amortization & Deferred Tax Assets 20.6 34.5 -40.3% 30 June 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Cash (including marketable securities) 111.2 102.4 Financial debt * 8.8 10.7 Shareholders equity 168.6 160.6* excluding financial lease (‚Ç¨4.4m at 30/06/22 vs ‚Ç¨5.0m at 31/12/21)Good overall business strengthWith a growth of +5.1% in its turnover excluding COVID to ‚Ç¨43.0M in the 1st half of 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨40.9M in the 1st half of 2021  and COVID sales at ‚Ç¨40.6M compared to ‚Ç¨54.8M (-26%)  Eurobio Scientific recorded revenue of ‚Ç¨83.6m in the 1st half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨95.6m in the 1st half of 2021. This activity reflects:- The significant and continued growth of traditional activities  excluding COVID  despite the termination of less profitable partnerships as a result of increased selectivity in terms of distribution;- Continued substantial COVID revenue despite a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes  partially offset by the extension of the product portfolio with specific tests for the characterization of SARS-Cov-2 virus variants.Results impacted by the anticipated drop in COVID salesIn the 1st half of 2022  the gross margin stood at ‚Ç¨40.9 million  compared to ‚Ç¨54.6 million in the 1st half of 2021. This decline is linked to the drop in revenue from COVID activities and to provisions made on the inventory of COVID products as part of the pandemic slowdown. Restated for these provisions  the gross margin would amount to ‚Ç¨46.1 million  i.e. a rate of 55.1% compared to 57.1% in H1 2021.R&D expenses and marketing and sales expenses are increasing slightly faster than sales  in order to support future growth. The faster rise in general and administrative expenses includes expenses related to corporate finance transactions during the half-year: two acquisitions and a strategic and capitalistic partnership. Operating income is therefore down at ‚Ç¨22.0m (‚Ç¨40.0m in H1 2021)  and EBITDA at ‚Ç¨26.0m (‚Ç¨42.5m in H1 2021).The financial result is positive (+0.4 vs -0.3 in H1 2021) due to foreign exchange gains  in particular linked to the valuation of assets in dollars.Corporate tax amounted to ‚Ç¨3.1m  compared to ‚Ç¨5.4m in H1 2021.After taking into account ‚Ç¨1.4 million in goodwill amortization  net income for the first half of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨19.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨33.1 million in H1 2021.Strong operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5m (‚Ç¨29.9m in H1 2021)Even though it is lower compared to last year  Eurobio Scientific continues to generate significant operating cash flow at ‚Ç¨25.5 million (-14.7% compared to H1 2021)  mainly thanks to a better control of its WCR and to the decrease in operating receivables.This good performance enabled the Company to accelerate its share buyback program for which it allocated ‚Ç¨10.6 million during the half-year.The total amount of cash thus amounted to ‚Ç¨111.2 million as of June 30  2022 and shareholders equity rose to ‚Ç¨168.6 million. Financial debt decreased again  to ‚Ç¨8.8m compared to ‚Ç¨10.7m at 12/31/21.Perspectives: decisive and strategic developmentsThe historical activities of Eurobio Scientific should grow steadily  with stronger margins linked to the increasing share of proprietary products and the reallocation of the distribution portfolio. In addition  as the slowdown in the COVID diagnostics market continues  but in a non-linear fashion  the Group remains attentive and cautious in order to continue to serve the needs of its customers while cushioning the decline in this business segment.Backed by significant cash and its leadership position  the Group has made two acquisitions in recent months to accelerate the deployment of its strategic axis:increasing the share of proprietary products continued international expansion  andopening of new market segments.The takeover of bmd Belgique in June strengthens the Group's sales and marketing presence in the Benelux zone.The acquisition of GenDX  which closing was just completed on October 3  takes on a particular dimension. It is strategic and transformative as it brings value in each of the Group's three strategic areas:GenDx has a range of highly innovative and 100% proprietary products;it is also present directly in the Netherlands  Germany and North America as well as  via its distributors  in the rest of Europe and Asia;finally  GenDx's technological advance in the digitization of diagnostics  through the algorithms and software developed by its bioinformatics specialists  will enable the Group to address new market segments well beyond transplantation on which GenDx was positioned until now.Next financial meetings2022 sales : January 23  2023  after market closes2022 results: April 5  2023  before market opensAnnual shareholders‚Äô meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amHalf-year 2023 sales : July 24  2023  after market closesDisclaimerThis press release contains elements that are not historical facts including  without limitation  certain statements about future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The data will be shared at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022 and submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next year. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.""Eosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child's fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development "" said Mirna Chehade  M.D.  Mount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York and principal investigator of the trial. ""These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage ‚Äì caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation ‚Äì and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.""As presented at UEG Week 2022  Dupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of patients on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Story continuesSafety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with one or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

It was important to assess the retinal changes with PRIMA implants since the success of retinal stimulation with micro-electrodes largely depends on the distance between the stimulation electrode (in the implant) and the target cells.The Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images of three patients with subretinal implantations enrolled in the French feasibility study were analyzed to [1] measure the retinal thickness  [2] measure the distance between the array and the inner nuclear layer (INL  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) and [3] evaluate any potential macular changes from the surgical trauma.The analysis found that the surgical delivery of the photovoltaic subretinal implant led to a stable retinal thickness over 36 months with no adverse structural or functional events after causing minor retinal thickness changes that settle after three months.""We are very pleased to announce the publication of these peer-reviewed data in the well-respected Journal of Neural Engineering showing that the surgical implantation of the Prima System in patients suffering from dry AMD leads to a stable retinal thickness three months after implantation "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""The PRIMA implant's small size and wireless design enable minimally invasive surgery. Previously  the data from the French feasibility study already demonstrated that the Prima System is well tolerated. The data in this paper now further demonstrate the stability and minimal impact of the implant once in position. We are confidently looking forward to the read-out from our pivotal PRIMAvera study on the Prima System due at the end of next year and our planned submission for market approval in Europe shortly afterward.""Key take-awaysThe key take-aways from the data published in the Journal of Neural Engineering are:No significant changes in the distance between the surface of the implant and the INL (the Inner Nuclear Layer  the layer of the retina made up of a number of closely packed cells  including bipolar cells) were detectedTotal retinal thickness above the implant decreased by a mean of 39 ¬µm during 3-months post-implantation  but no significant changes were observed after that  up to 36 months of the follow-upThe observations support the hypothesis that the retina on the different areas on the implant are equally supplied with nutrition and oxygenPixium Vision's pivotal PRIMAvera study  which aims to demonstrate the safety and benefits of the Prima System  is ongoing in Europe  with a read-out expected towards the end of 2023 and regulatory submission for market approval due soon after. In the US  a feasibility study is also ongoing.The full peer-reviewed Journal of Neural Engineering paper is available online here.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

The agency has also changed the outlook for Coface to positive from stable.In its press release  Moody‚Äôs highlights that this rating reflect ‚ÄúCoface strong capitalisation  good profitability and limited exposure to Russia. Coface has consistently maintained a group‚Äôs solvency ratio above 190% since 2020 and the ratio has a low sensitivity to financial and macroeconomic shocks. This low sensitivity was reinforced by recent improvements in the group‚Äôs asset quality.‚ÄùIn addition  Coface‚Äôs profitability has been very strong in the last five years  with an average combined ratio of 75% between 2017 and 2021.Moody‚Äôs also believes that  since 2016  ‚Äúthe group has improved its risk monitoring processes and it has been more proactive to adjust its risk portfolio‚Äù. Moody‚Äôs expects ‚Äúthese improvements to translate into less ample shocks on the group‚Äôs combined ratio going forward  even if earnings volatility will remain a feature of the credit insurance industry.‚ÄùLast  in its outlook  the rating agency underscores that this ‚Äúchange in outlook to positive from stable reflects the increasing diversification of the group and the enhanced monitoring and improved management of credit risk exposures which Moody‚Äôs expects to result in lower volatility in profits and make the insurer better placed to weather an economic downturn.‚ÄùPhalla Gervais  Chief Finance & Risk Officer  commented:‚ÄúWe welcome this change of outlook  which rewards Coface teams‚Äô work and recognizes the high level of service offered to our clients.

With our 4R mindset  we are now scaling up with an intense rigor  building our capabilities  teams and facilities  while creating a smart  integrated ecosystem to better manage material scarcity and our drive to carbon net zero.‚ÄùThe main objectives of the Circular Economy Business Unit are extending the life of vehicles and parts  ensuring that they last for as long as possible  and returning material and end-of-life vehicles to the manufacturing loop for new vehicles and products. This methodology compliments the principles of ‚ÄòDesign for the Circular Economy ‚Äô which are core to the new Citro√´n ‚Äòoli‚Äô [all-√´]  a conceptual multi-activity family vehicle that uses lightweight and recycled materials  sustainable production processes  affordability  durability for an extended service life and responsible end-of-life recyclability.Video: Stellantis Circular Economy - Overview by Alison JonesCircular Economy‚Äôs 4R Strategy:Stellantis has developed a comprehensive  360-degree business based on the 4R strategy: reman  repair  reuse  and recycle.

Recycle ‚Äì Production scraps and end-of-life vehicles are fed back into the manufacturing process. In just six months  the business unit has collected 1 million recycled parts.Hubs Complemented by Local LoopsStellantis‚Äô Circular Economy Business Unit plan calls for aggressive scaling up in volumes and expansion to new countries  while ensuring constant innovation and re-skilling for new techs.In September  Stellantis announced that its leading Circular Economy Hub will launch in 2023 at its Mirafiori Complex in Italy. The dedicated operation will enable the expansion of Stellantis‚Äô current activities and support its ‚Äòcradle-to-cradle‚Äô business model in Europe. The Hub will host vehicle reconditioning  vehicle dismantling  and parts remanufacturing activities  with the scope set to expand further globally. The business unit‚Äôs ambition is also complementary to the 2016 acquisition of Aramis  a European leader in the online multi-brand purchase and sale of used cars  that will (by year-end) have seven in-house refurbishing centers  strategically placed overWestern and Central Europe.In addition to circular economy hubs  the business unit will use ‚Äòlocal loops ‚Äô to keep products and materials within countries  speeding deliveries for customers. In Brazil  key parts  i.e.  starter motors and alternators from Stellantis brand vehicles  are remanufactured  distributed and sold across 1 000 local dealerships ‚àí supporting the Circular Economy philosophy and the drive to carbon net zero.This builds on the skills the Company currently have and is another important step in the implementation of the strategic plan for Stellantis‚Äô Circular Economy Business Unit as it pushes to quadruple extended life revenues for parts and services and increase recycling revenues by 10 times by 2030 as compared to 2021.Introducing SUSTAINeraWith the expansion of circular economy activities  the business unit is also launching its new SUSTAINera label for parts and accessories  indicating a savings of up to 80% materials and 50% energy as compared to their equivalent new parts. The values are determined by conducting a life-cycle analysis of the corresponding best-seller in each product family in accordance with a methodology approved by Sphera  an independent company.‚ÄúThe SUSTAINera label represents our promise to provide customers sustainable  transparent and affordable products and services to our customers for all brands of vehicles  without compromising quality  while preserving the environment through decreased waste and less use of our planet‚Äôs resources ‚Äù said Alison Jones.Chosen from among hundreds of Stellantis employees‚Äô proposals  the SUSTAINera label also embodies the Company‚Äôs core value of making a better future through a responsible business entering a new era of sustainability.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) will be presented today at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022. The data will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.Mirna Chehade  M.DMount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine  Mount Sinai‚ÄúEosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child‚Äôs fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development. These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage - caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation - and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.‚ÄùDupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Sanofi and Regeneron used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension period to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as a more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K?) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.On August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase ? Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3K? (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3K? pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3K? and PI3K?  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K? and PI3K? are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K? in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K? is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented late-breaking positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The data will be shared at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2022 and submitted to regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next year. In May 2022  Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the FDA to treat EoE in people aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg.""Eosinophilic esophagitis impacts a child's fundamental ability to eat  which is especially critical in early childhood when healthy weight gain is vital to long-term health and development "" said Mirna Chehade  M.D.  Mount Sinai Center for Eosinophilic Disorders  Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York and principal investigator of the trial. ""These Phase 3 data support the potential of dupilumab to reduce esophageal damage ‚Äì caused in part by underlying type 2 inflammation ‚Äì and showed histological disease remission and signs of weight gain impacting the growth percentile for those children on higher dose Dupixent.""As presented at UEG Week 2022  Dupixent led to significant improvements in the primary efficacy measure for higher (n=37) and lower (n=31) dose groups at 16 weeks in the randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Among children treated with Dupixent  68% of patients on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission  compared to 3% for placebo (both p<0.0001). Children on the higher dose regimen also experienced significant improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of their esophagus  with a reduction of 3.5 points compared to an increase of 0.3 points for placebo (p<0.0001). Symptomatically  higher dose Dupixent led to a numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced disease symptoms from baseline as reported by their caregivers compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. Additionally  a prespecified exploratory analysis was presented which found higher dose Dupixent led to a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline  compared to 0.29 for placebo.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% (higher dose n=27/37  lower dose n=26/30) for Dupixent and 91% (n=31/34) for placebo. AEs most commonly observed with Dupixent (‚â•5%) compared to placebo included COVID-19 (higher dose n=5/37  lower dose n=9/30  placebo n=0/34; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (higher dose n=3/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=2/34)  headache (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=4/30  placebo n=1/34)  viral gastroenteritis (higher dose n=4/37  lower dose n=0/30  placebo n=1/34)  diarrhea (higher dose n=2/37  lower dose n=2/30  placebo n=1/34) and nausea (higher dose n=1/37  lower dose n=3/30  placebo n=0/34). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% (higher dose n=0/37  lower dose n=0/30) for Dupixent and 6% (n=2/34) for placebo.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic EsophagitisEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease.In children  common symptoms of EoE include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth  weight gain and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  are the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease in children. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain.Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to their current treatment regimen and potentially require advanced therapy.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological  endoscopic and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ‚â•5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission  which was defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ‚â§6 eosinophils (eos)/high power field (hpf). Secondary endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with one or more EoE signs [e.g.  stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves. An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period  followed by a 108-week open-label extension to evaluate long-term outcomes. These results  as well as more detailed lower dose results  will be presented or published in the future.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  EoE and prurigo nodularis (PN).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or PN in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The primary endpoint of the study measured the relative change in the percentage of liver fat content based on magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). The study also assessed the effects of PXL065 on liver histology and other metabolic and non-metabolic biomarkers.117 subjects were randomized to one of 4 daily (QD) treatment arms (7.5 mg  15 mg  22.5 mg  placebo). Analysis of histologic changes was based on paired liver biopsies in PXL065 vs. placebo-treated NASH patients before and after the 36-week treatment period.Top line results included:The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved: PXL065-treated patients achieved statistically significant improvements in the relative decrease in liver fat content at 36-weeks for all doses.Fibrosis improvement by > 1 stage without worsening of NASH  an endpoint recognized by FDA for approval  occurred in 31-50% patients in the PXL065 study arms vs. 17% with placebo. Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  39% of patients had fibrosis improvement by ‚â•1 stage without worsening NASH (%) vs. 17% with placebo.1 stage without worsening of NASH  an endpoint recognized by FDA for approval  occurred in 31-50% patients in the PXL065 study arms vs. 17% with placebo. Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  39% of patients had fibrosis improvement by ‚â•1 stage without worsening NASH (%) vs. 17% with placebo. PXL065 was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in body weight and no increased lower extremity edema vs. placebo.About PXL065PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone. Although pioglitazone is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH  it is the most extensively studied drug for NASH; in multiple prior trials  improvements in liver histology  including reductions in fibrosis  were demonstrated1 2. Pioglitazone is the only drug recommended for biopsy-proven NASH patients by the Practice Guidelines published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)3. Pioglitazone‚Äôs off-label use for NASH  however  has been limited due to the PPARŒ≥-related side effects  which include weight gain  bone fractures and fluid retention.Pioglitazone is a 1:1 mixture of two mirror-image compounds (R- and S-stereoisomers) that interconvert in vivo. Using deuterium  Poxel stabilized each stereoisomer and characterized their different pharmacological properties. In in vitro studies  PXL065 has been shown to target non-genomic pathways including mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4). In preclinical animal models  PXL065 exhibits the NASH efficacy associated with pioglitazone with no significant weight gain or fluid retention  side effects which are associated with the S-stereoisomer4. NASH Phase 2 (DESTINY 1 trial) results available to-date show statistically significant effects of PXL065 on liver fat content  biomarkers related to liver fibrogenesis-fibrosis risk  as well as positive effects on fibrosis and other key parameters based on histology analysis. Relative to published data for pioglitazone  reduced potential for weight gain and edema was also evident. Based upon preclinical  Phase 1 and Phase 2 results  Poxel believes that PXL065 may have a better therapeutic profile than pioglitazone for NASH and may also have suitable properties for further development in other indications including adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).1 Cusi  et al.

Hepatol Comm 2021; 5:1412-1425.About NASHNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disease with no clear disease origin that is quickly becoming a worldwide epidemic. It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver causing inflammation and fibrosis. The disease can be silent for a long period of time  but once it accelerates  severe damage and liver cirrhosis can occur  which can significantly impact liver function or can even result in liver failure or liver cancer. Typical risk factors for NASH include obesity  elevated levels of blood lipids (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes. Currently no curative or specific therapies are available.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). In rare diseases  development of PXL770  a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  is focused on the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

Excluding the 7/8¬∞ West impact  revenues were down at a low-single digit pace.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were down by 3.4%  partially explained by one-off effects due to the phasing of contracts.Looking ahead  the impact of the Nilesat headwind will wash out from mid-October 2022; however  revenues will be impacted by the anticipated non-renewal of a capacity contract with Digit√ºrk from mid-November leading to an overall mid-single-digit decline for this application for the Full Year.Data & Professional Video (14% of revenues)First Quarter Data & Professional Video revenues stood at ‚Ç¨41 million  down by 2.4% year-on-year.Professional Video  which now represents less than a third of revenues for this application  faced a mid-single-digit decline  while Fixed Data revenues were in slight decline  with improved volume trends now offsetting most of the negative impact of competitive pressure.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were down by 2.4%  reflecting in particular the seasonality of ‚ÄòOccasional Use‚Äô.On the commercial front  the EUTELSAT KONNECT satellite was selected by Liquid Intelligent Technologies to provide connectivity services to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) customers across Uganda  South Sudan  and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Over the Full Year  the Data & Professional Video revenue trend is expected broadly in line with the mid-single digit decline reported in FY 2021-22.Government Services (12% of revenues)First Quarter Government Services revenues stood at ‚Ç¨35 million  down 17.7% year-on-year. This reflected mostly the negative carry-forward effect of US Government renewals  only partially offset by the contribution of EUTELSAT QUANTUM  where most of the incremental capacity has been booked in the Mobile Connectivity vertical.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were down by 8.2%  due to the transfer of capacity sold on EUTELSAT QUANTUM from the Government vertical to the Mobile Connectivity vertical in our reporting.The latest renewal campaign with the US Government (Fall 2022) resulted in an estimated renewal rate of around 65%.Over the Full Year  the revenue trend for Government Services will reflect the carry-forward effect of Fall renewals as well as the re-allocation of EUTELSAT QUANTUM revenues to other verticals. It will also depend on the outcome of the Spring 2023 renewal campaign with the US Government.Fixed Broadband (6% of revenues)First Quarter Fixed Broadband revenues stood at ‚Ç¨19 million  up 21.1% year-on-year. This reflects the carry-forward effect of the November 2021 wholesale agreement with Hispasat  the contribution of the multi-beam agreement signed last year on EUTELSAT 65 West A with several Mexican service providers  as well as  to a lesser extent  continued progress at our African operations.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were down by 15.7%  reflecting in particular a ‚Ç¨2.5 million positive one-off booked in the Fourth Quarter of last year.Over the Full Year  Fixed Broadband will keep growing  albeit at a slower pace compared to the massive double-digit growth recorded in FY 2021-22 (+36.0%)  as the comparison basis will gradually reflect the above-mentioned agreements with Hispasat and Mexican service providers. Growth is expected to re-accelerate in FY 2023-24 on the back of the entry into service of KONNECT VHTS.Mobile Connectivity (9 % of revenues)First Quarter Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at ‚Ç¨26 million  up 31.4 % year-on-year. This reflected  continued progress in Maritime driven by the agreement with Telenor in the cruise segment as well as the contribution of EUTELSAT QUANTUM with two beams commercialized for incremental capacity in this vertical.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were up by 8.7%.Over the Full Year  Mobile Connectivity will record double-digit growth albeit at a slower pace compared to the First Quarter as the comparison basis will gradually reflect some of the above-mentioned incremental contracts.Other Revenues‚ÄòOther Revenues‚Äô amounted to (‚Ç¨3) million in the First Quarter versus ‚Ç¨3 million a year earlier and (‚Ç¨2) million in the Fourth Quarter of FY 2021-22. They included a negative impact from hedging operations of (‚Ç¨5) million in the First Quarter (compared to no substantial impact in the First Quarter last year and a negative impact of (‚Ç¨7) million in the Fourth Quarter last year).OPERATIONAL AND UTILIZED TRANSPONDERSThe number of operational transponders at 30 September 2022 stood at 1 359 units  down 17 units year-on-year  the latter reflecting principally the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A. The number of utilized transponders stood at 990 units  up 6 units year-on-year  reflecting principally the ramp-up of the maritime connectivity vertical  partially offset by the renewal campaigns with the US Government as well as the partial renewal with Nilesat.As a result  the fill rate stood at 72.9% compared with 71.5% a year ago and 73.2% at end-June 2022.30 Sep 2021 30 Jun 2022 30 Sep 2022 Operational transponders5 1 376 1 361 1 359 Utilized transponders6 984 996 990 Fill rate 71.5% 73.2% 72.9% Note: Based on 36 MHz-equivalent transponders excluding high throughput capacityBACKLOGThe backlog stood at ‚Ç¨3.9 billion at 30 September 2022  versus ‚Ç¨4.2 billion at end-September 2021 and ‚Ç¨4.0 billion at end-June 2022. The backlog was equivalent to 3.4 times FY 2021-22 revenues  with Broadcast representing 61%.30 Sep 2021 30 Jun 2022 30 Sep 2022 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.2 4.0 3.9 In years of annual revenues 3.4 3.5 3.4 Share of Broadcast 64% 62% 61% Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement.OUTLOOK AND FINANCIAL TARGETSThe First Quarter performance was in line with our expectations enabling us to confirm our FY 2022-23 objective of revenues of the five Operating Verticals of between ‚Ç¨1 150-1 180 million7.All other objectives are also confirmed as follows:Thanks to new capacity including notably the firm precommitments secured on EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS and EUTELSAT 10B  revenues are expected to grow from FY 2023-24.Cash Capex 8 will not exceed ‚Ç¨400 million per annum for each of the next two fiscal years (FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).will not exceed ‚Ç¨400 million per annum for each of the next two fiscal years (FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).

Here are 3 stocks for protection,Energy inflation remains a serious concern. Protect your portfolio.,‚ÄòThe world should be worried‚Äô: Saudi Aramco ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest oil producer ‚Äî just issued a dire warning over 'extremely low' capacity. Here are 3 stocks for protectionThe global oil market remains tight according to Saudi Aramco  the largest oil producer in the world. And that does not bode well for a world that still relies heavily on fossil fuels.‚ÄúToday there is spare capacity that is extremely low ‚Äù Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser says at a conference in London. ‚ÄúIf China opens up  [the] economy starts improving or the aviation industry starts asking for more jet fuel  you will erode this spare capacity.‚ÄùNasser warns that oil prices could quickly spike ‚Äî again.‚ÄúWhen you erode that spare capacity the world should be worried. There will be no space for any hiccup ‚Äî any interruption  any unforeseen events anywhere around the world.‚ÄùIf you share Nasser‚Äôs view  here are three oil stocks to bet on. Wall Street also sees upside in this trio.Don‚Äôt missShell (SHEL)Headquartered in London  Shell is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas last year.It‚Äôs a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.The company‚Äôs NYSE-listed shares are up 13.6% year to date.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees an opportunity in the oil and gas supermajor. Last month  the analyst reiterated an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Shell while raising his price target from $75 to $80.Considering that Shell trades at around $50.50 per share today  Todd‚Äôs new price target implies a potential upside of 58%.Chevron (CVX)Chevron is another oil and gas supermajor that‚Äôs benefiting from the commodity boom.For Q2  the company reported earnings of $11.6 billion  which more than tripled the $3.1 billion in the same period last year. Sales and other operating revenues totaled $65 billion for the quarter  up 81% year over year.Story continuesStay on top of the markets: Don‚Äôt miss the latest news and a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Sign up now for the MoneyWise Investing newsletter for free.In January  Chevron‚Äôs board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.42 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.6%.The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 32% in 2022.Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott has an ‚Äòequal weight‚Äô rating on Chevron (not the most bullish rating) but raised the price target from $187 to $193 last month. That implies a potential upside of 23% from the current levels.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Commanding a market cap of over $400 billion  Exxon Mobil is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the three in 2022 ‚Äî Exxon shares are up 55% year to date.It‚Äôs not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow in this commodity price environment. In the first six months of 2022  Exxon earned $23.3 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $7.4 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow totaled $27.7 billion for the first half  compared to $13.8 billion in the same period last year.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors. Exxon pays quarterly dividends of 88 cents per share  translating to an annual yield of 3.6%.Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read has an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Exxon and a price target of $109 ‚Äî around 10% above where the stock sits today.What to read next‚ÄòThis truck can‚Äôt do normal truck things‚Äô: YouTube star says towing with Ford‚Äôs new electric pickup is a ‚Äòtotal disaster‚Äô in viral video ‚Äî but Wall Street still likes these 3 EV stocks'Remarkable reversal': President Biden just (quietly) scaled back student loan forgiveness ‚Äî and the change could impact up to 1.5M borrowers.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents 12 years or older.On August 1  2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  the EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the EEA is anticipated in H1 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""This MAA submission  under an accelerated regulatory pathway  is an important step towards approval of our second product in the EEA and highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advancing leniolisib as a treatment for patients with APDS. There is a significant unmet need for therapies to improve outcomes for these patients  which  if left untreated  can result in permanent lung damage and lymphoma. Leniolisib has the potential to be the first approved treatment for this rare and orphan-designated disease  and we look forward to continuing our work with key stakeholders to bring this new product to patients.""The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency in the target population. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution.Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L'Or√©al co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestl√© Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/enTwitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.This press release does not constitute and cannot be regarded as constituting an offer to the public  an offer to sell or a subscription offer or as a solicitation to solicit a buy or sell order in any country.Translation for information purposes only.
