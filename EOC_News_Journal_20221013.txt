The primary endpoint of the study measured the relative change in the percentage of liver fat content based on magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). The study also assessed the effects of PXL065 on liver histology and other metabolic and non-metabolic biomarkers.117 subjects were randomized to one of 4 daily (QD) treatment arms (7.5 mg  15 mg  22.5 mg  placebo). Analysis of histologic changes was based on paired liver biopsies in PXL065 vs. placebo-treated NASH patients before and after the 36-week treatment period.Top line results included:The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved: PXL065-treated patients achieved statistically significant improvements in the relative decrease in liver fat content at 36-weeks for all doses.Fibrosis improvement by > 1 stage without worsening of NASH  an endpoint recognized by FDA for approval  occurred in 31-50% patients in the PXL065 study arms vs. 17% with placebo. Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  39% of patients had fibrosis improvement by ≥1 stage without worsening NASH (%) vs. 17% with placebo.1 stage without worsening of NASH  an endpoint recognized by FDA for approval  occurred in 31-50% patients in the PXL065 study arms vs. 17% with placebo. Across all PXL065 treatment arms (pooled data)  39% of patients had fibrosis improvement by ≥1 stage without worsening NASH (%) vs. 17% with placebo. PXL065 was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in body weight and no increased lower extremity edema vs. placebo.About PXL065PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone. Although pioglitazone is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH  it is the most extensively studied drug for NASH; in multiple prior trials  improvements in liver histology  including reductions in fibrosis  were demonstrated1 2. Pioglitazone is the only drug recommended for biopsy-proven NASH patients by the Practice Guidelines published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)3. Pioglitazone’s off-label use for NASH  however  has been limited due to the PPARγ-related side effects  which include weight gain  bone fractures and fluid retention.Pioglitazone is a 1:1 mixture of two mirror-image compounds (R- and S-stereoisomers) that interconvert in vivo. Using deuterium  Poxel stabilized each stereoisomer and characterized their different pharmacological properties. In in vitro studies  PXL065 has been shown to target non-genomic pathways including mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4). In preclinical animal models  PXL065 exhibits the NASH efficacy associated with pioglitazone with no significant weight gain or fluid retention  side effects which are associated with the S-stereoisomer4. NASH Phase 2 (DESTINY 1 trial) results available to-date show statistically significant effects of PXL065 on liver fat content  biomarkers related to liver fibrogenesis-fibrosis risk  as well as positive effects on fibrosis and other key parameters based on histology analysis. Relative to published data for pioglitazone  reduced potential for weight gain and edema was also evident. Based upon preclinical  Phase 1 and Phase 2 results  Poxel believes that PXL065 may have a better therapeutic profile than pioglitazone for NASH and may also have suitable properties for further development in other indications including adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).1 Cusi  et al.

Hepatol Comm 2021; 5:1412-1425.About NASHNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disease with no clear disease origin that is quickly becoming a worldwide epidemic. It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver causing inflammation and fibrosis. The disease can be silent for a long period of time  but once it accelerates  severe damage and liver cirrhosis can occur  which can significantly impact liver function or can even result in liver failure or liver cancer. Typical risk factors for NASH include obesity  elevated levels of blood lipids (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes. Currently no curative or specific therapies are available.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). In rare diseases  development of PXL770  a first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  is focused on the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

Despite limited available capacity at this stage  we continue to record a strong double-digit growth in Fixed Broadband and Mobile Connectivity highlighting the massive long-term potential for both applications  while our mature broadcast activities declined in line with expectations.We made further strong progress in the implementation of our Telecom Pivot with the completion of the implementation of our new organization  aligned along two business lines – Broadcast and Connectivity  and new leadership in place for each business unit. The creation of two business units will enhance customer-centricity  boost efficiency and foster growth.Finally  the successful launch of the KONNECT VHTS satellite in September is a crucial milestone for our Connectivity-driven return to growth  bringing unprecedented levels of capacity to the European markets  some of it already pre-sold.”HIGHLIGHTSOperating Vertical revenues of €291m  down -4.3% like-for-like on a year-on-year basis  in line with the mid-point of our full-year objective.Continued robust double-digit growth in Fixed Broadband (+21.1%) and Mobile Connectivity (+31.4%) highlighting the long-term potential of both applications.Successful launch of EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS on 7 th September. Bringing 500 Gbps of incremental capacity over Europe. Major firm precommitments from Orange  Telecom Italia Mobile and Thales Alenia Space  totalling c. €450m in backlog. Largest driver of our Connectivity-driven future return to growth.on 7 September.Progress in the implementation of the new organization along two business lines  Video and Connectivity  as part of the ‘Comete’ project. New organization partially in place since 1 st September. Reorganization to enhance customer-centricity  gain efficiency and accompany return to growth. Laurence Delpy and Cyril Dujardin respectively appointed as General Manager of the Video Business Unit and as General Manager of the Connectivity Business Unit.along two business lines  Video and Connectivity  as part of the ‘Comete’ project.All financial objectives for current and next fiscal year confirmed.FIRST QUARTER REVENUES4Total revenues for the First Quarter stood at €287 million  stable on a reported basis  and down by 4.5% like-for-like.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (ie  excluding ‘Other Revenues’) stood at €291 million. They were down by 4.3% on a like-for-like basis excluding a positive currency effect of c.+6 points. There were no perimeter effects this quarter.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues of the five Operating Verticals were down by 3.8% like-for-like.Unless otherwise stated  all variations indicated hereunder are expressed on a like-for-like basis  ie  at constant currency and perimeter.Broadcast (59% of revenues)First Quarter Broadcast revenues amounted to €170 million  down 7.4% year-on-year. They reflected mostly the carry-forward effect of the partial renewal of capacity with Nilesat at 7/8° West in October 2021. Excluding the 7/8° West impact  revenues were down at a low-single digit pace.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were down by 3.4%  partially explained by one-off effects due to the phasing of contracts.Looking ahead  the impact of the Nilesat headwind will wash out from mid-October 2022; however  revenues will be impacted by the anticipated non-renewal of a capacity contract with Digitürk from mid-November leading to an overall mid-single-digit decline for this application for the Full Year.Data & Professional Video (14% of revenues)First Quarter Data & Professional Video revenues stood at €41 million  down by 2.4% year-on-year.Professional Video  which now represents less than a third of revenues for this application  faced a mid-single-digit decline  while Fixed Data revenues were in slight decline  with improved volume trends now offsetting most of the negative impact of competitive pressure.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were down by 2.4%  reflecting in particular the seasonality of ‘Occasional Use’.On the commercial front  the EUTELSAT KONNECT satellite was selected by Liquid Intelligent Technologies to provide connectivity services to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) customers across Uganda  South Sudan  and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Over the Full Year  the Data & Professional Video revenue trend is expected broadly in line with the mid-single digit decline reported in FY 2021-22.Government Services (12% of revenues)First Quarter Government Services revenues stood at €35 million  down 17.7% year-on-year. This reflected mostly the negative carry-forward effect of US Government renewals  only partially offset by the contribution of EUTELSAT QUANTUM  where most of the incremental capacity has been booked in the Mobile Connectivity vertical.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were down by 8.2%  due to the transfer of capacity sold on EUTELSAT QUANTUM from the Government vertical to the Mobile Connectivity vertical in our reporting.The latest renewal campaign with the US Government (Fall 2022) resulted in an estimated renewal rate of around 65%.Over the Full Year  the revenue trend for Government Services will reflect the carry-forward effect of Fall renewals as well as the re-allocation of EUTELSAT QUANTUM revenues to other verticals. It will also depend on the outcome of the Spring 2023 renewal campaign with the US Government.Fixed Broadband (6% of revenues)First Quarter Fixed Broadband revenues stood at €19 million  up 21.1% year-on-year. This reflects the carry-forward effect of the November 2021 wholesale agreement with Hispasat  the contribution of the multi-beam agreement signed last year on EUTELSAT 65 West A with several Mexican service providers  as well as  to a lesser extent  continued progress at our African operations.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were down by 15.7%  reflecting in particular a €2.5 million positive one-off booked in the Fourth Quarter of last year.Over the Full Year  Fixed Broadband will keep growing  albeit at a slower pace compared to the massive double-digit growth recorded in FY 2021-22 (+36.0%)  as the comparison basis will gradually reflect the above-mentioned agreements with Hispasat and Mexican service providers. Growth is expected to re-accelerate in FY 2023-24 on the back of the entry into service of KONNECT VHTS.Mobile Connectivity (9 % of revenues)First Quarter Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at €26 million  up 31.4 % year-on-year. This reflected  continued progress in Maritime driven by the agreement with Telenor in the cruise segment as well as the contribution of EUTELSAT QUANTUM with two beams commercialized for incremental capacity in this vertical.On a quarter-on-quarter basis  revenues were up by 8.7%.Over the Full Year  Mobile Connectivity will record double-digit growth albeit at a slower pace compared to the First Quarter as the comparison basis will gradually reflect some of the above-mentioned incremental contracts.Other Revenues‘Other Revenues’ amounted to (€3) million in the First Quarter versus €3 million a year earlier and (€2) million in the Fourth Quarter of FY 2021-22. They included a negative impact from hedging operations of (€5) million in the First Quarter (compared to no substantial impact in the First Quarter last year and a negative impact of (€7) million in the Fourth Quarter last year).OPERATIONAL AND UTILIZED TRANSPONDERSThe number of operational transponders at 30 September 2022 stood at 1 359 units  down 17 units year-on-year  the latter reflecting principally the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A. The number of utilized transponders stood at 990 units  up 6 units year-on-year  reflecting principally the ramp-up of the maritime connectivity vertical  partially offset by the renewal campaigns with the US Government as well as the partial renewal with Nilesat.As a result  the fill rate stood at 72.9% compared with 71.5% a year ago and 73.2% at end-June 2022.30 Sep 2021 30 Jun 2022 30 Sep 2022 Operational transponders5 1 376 1 361 1 359 Utilized transponders6 984 996 990 Fill rate 71.5% 73.2% 72.9% Note: Based on 36 MHz-equivalent transponders excluding high throughput capacityBACKLOGThe backlog stood at €3.9 billion at 30 September 2022  versus €4.2 billion at end-September 2021 and €4.0 billion at end-June 2022. The backlog was equivalent to 3.4 times FY 2021-22 revenues  with Broadcast representing 61%.30 Sep 2021 30 Jun 2022 30 Sep 2022 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.2 4.0 3.9 In years of annual revenues 3.4 3.5 3.4 Share of Broadcast 64% 62% 61% Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement.OUTLOOK AND FINANCIAL TARGETSThe First Quarter performance was in line with our expectations enabling us to confirm our FY 2022-23 objective of revenues of the five Operating Verticals of between €1 150-1 180 million7.All other objectives are also confirmed as follows:Thanks to new capacity including notably the firm precommitments secured on EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS and EUTELSAT 10B  revenues are expected to grow from FY 2023-24.Cash Capex 8 will not exceed €400 million per annum for each of the next two fiscal years (FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).will not exceed €400 million per annum for each of the next two fiscal years (FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24). The Group will continue to leverage all measures to maximise cash generation with an objective of Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow expected at an average of €420 million per year at a €/$ rate of 1.00 for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. Adjusted DFCF objectives exclude future payments related to the exclusive commercial partnership with OneWeb signed in July.We remain committed to a sound financial structure and continue to target a medium-term net debt / EBITDA ratio of around 3x.A €0.93 per share dividend will be proposed to the upcoming AGM with a scrip option. Beyond that  the dividend will be suspended in the context of the proposed merger with Oneweb.This outlook is based on the nominal deployment plan outlined below. It assumes no material deterioration of revenues generated from Russian customers. It is a standalone outlook and does not take account of the proposed merger with OneWeb.FLEET DEPLOYMENTNominal deployment programmeThere are slight changes to the nominal deployment plan since the last quarterly update in July 2022 with the entry into service of EUTELSAT HOTBIRDS 13G and 13F now expected in Q2/Q3 versus H1 previously.Satellite Orbital position Estimated entry into service (calendar year) Main applications Main geographic coverage Physical Transponders/ Spot beams Of which expansion EUTELSAT 10B 10° East Q3 2023 Mobile Connectivity EMEA Atlantic & Indian Ocean 12 Ku 10 C >100 Ku spot beams -48 Ku c. 35 Gbps EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13G 13° East Q2/Q3 2023 Broadcast Europe MENA 80 Ku1 EGNOS payload EGNOS payload EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F 13° East Q2/Q3 2023 Broadcast Europe MENA 80 Ku1 None EUTELSAT 36D 36° East H2 2024 Broadcast Government Africa  Russia  Europe 70 Ku UHF payload UHF payload 1 Nominal capacity corresponding to the specifications of the satellites.

It is expected to enter into service in the second half of calendar 2023.DIVIDENDOn 25 July 2022 the Board of Directors agreed to recommend to the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on November 10  a dividend of €0.93 per share for FY 2021-22  unchanged versus the previous year. An option for shareholders to receive the entire dividend  either in cash or in new shares of the Company will be proposed. Subject to the approval of the Annual meeting of shareholders  the price of the new shares issued as payment of the dividend will amount to 90% of the average opening share price during the 20 trading sessions preceding the General Shareholders’ Meeting  less the net amount of the dividend and rounded up to the nearest euro cent.RECENT EVENTSSandrine Téran  Eutelsat’s Chief Financial Officer  to step downThe Chief Financial Officer of Eutelsat Communications  Sandrine Téran  has announced her decision to step down by the end of November.

Here are 3 stocks for protection,Energy inflation remains a serious concern. Protect your portfolio.,‘The world should be worried’: Saudi Aramco — the world’s largest oil producer — just issued a dire warning over 'extremely low' capacity. Here are 3 stocks for protectionThe global oil market remains tight according to Saudi Aramco  the largest oil producer in the world. And that does not bode well for a world that still relies heavily on fossil fuels.“Today there is spare capacity that is extremely low ” Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser says at a conference in London. “If China opens up  [the] economy starts improving or the aviation industry starts asking for more jet fuel  you will erode this spare capacity.”Nasser warns that oil prices could quickly spike — again.“When you erode that spare capacity the world should be worried. There will be no space for any hiccup — any interruption  any unforeseen events anywhere around the world.”If you share Nasser’s view  here are three oil stocks to bet on. Wall Street also sees upside in this trio.Don’t missShell (SHEL)Headquartered in London  Shell is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas last year.It’s a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.The company’s NYSE-listed shares are up 13.6% year to date.Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees an opportunity in the oil and gas supermajor. Last month  the analyst reiterated an ‘overweight’ rating on Shell while raising his price target from $75 to $80.Considering that Shell trades at around $50.50 per share today  Todd’s new price target implies a potential upside of 58%.Chevron (CVX)Chevron is another oil and gas supermajor that’s benefiting from the commodity boom.For Q2  the company reported earnings of $11.6 billion  which more than tripled the $3.1 billion in the same period last year. Sales and other operating revenues totaled $65 billion for the quarter  up 81% year over year.Story continuesStay on top of the markets: Don’t miss the latest news and a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Sign up now for the MoneyWise Investing newsletter for free.In January  Chevron’s board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.42 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.6%.The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 32% in 2022.Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott has an ‘equal weight’ rating on Chevron (not the most bullish rating) but raised the price target from $187 to $193 last month. That implies a potential upside of 23% from the current levels.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Commanding a market cap of over $400 billion  Exxon Mobil is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the three in 2022 — Exxon shares are up 55% year to date.It’s not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow in this commodity price environment. In the first six months of 2022  Exxon earned $23.3 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $7.4 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow totaled $27.7 billion for the first half  compared to $13.8 billion in the same period last year.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors.

If a player wins on the physical card  they can decide to cash their winning ticket at retail or wager a portion or all their winnings in a digital game. The iDecide digital game is accessed by scanning the QR code with a mobile device. To increase winnings  the player must successfully advance through the digital game. Advancement is randomly determined by the decisions the player makes during the digital game.Xavier Etienne  Executive Vice President Technology and International for FDJ  said  ""iDecide easily connects lottery players from an instant scratch card game sold at retail to the digital channel. These unique products were strategically developed to connect physical and digital game play with a focus on providing a unique digital entertainment experience for players while preserving FDJ's strong retailer network. There has never been anything like iDecide  it is truly a product of the future for the global lottery industry.""iDecide games are secure and maintain the integrity and pre-defined prize structure of the physical game. Digital player registration is not required. All prize winnings from both the physical and digital games are redeemed at a lottery retailer. If the player wishes to end play with the physical game  any winnings may be redeemed instantly. If the player decides to move to the digital game  the winning will be automatically updated with the outcome of the digital game.Jeff Martineck  Senior VP of Global Lottery Product Innovation for Scientific Games  said  ""Games featuring iDecide modernize the lottery experience for the consumer. These unique games put the power of choice into the consumer's hands  moving them seamlessly from retail to digital as they decide how deeply they want to play and win.

11462,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4546240-polymetal-is-trying-but-success-seems-difficult,Polymetal (AUCOY) Stock Is Trying But Success Seems Difficult,Polymetal looks much too cheap to me in the long term but the medium term that it might recover in seems to be stretching out. Click here to read more on AUCOY.,"chonticha watDifferent quotesWhen discussing Polymetal (LON: POLY) (OTCPK:AUCOY) (OTCPK:POYYF)  it's necessary to have a quick diversion into which quotations and listings are still valid. Polymetal's own ADR program  AUCOY  is suspended. The broker-driven US quote  POYYF  is suspended. This was explained here. There's the AIX quote (Almaty in Kazakhstan) which trades as with London but has very little liquidity. There's the MOEX  that is Moscow  quote which is wildly different. That Moscow quote is of no great use to any of us out here as it's not possible for us to really trade it. As a non-Russian citizen we can't sell there - the obvious trade  given prices  is to buy London  sell Moscow - and while the shares are all fungible in normal times they're not now. Euroclear doesn't speak to NSD  the Russian registrar.So  leaving aside that Russian quote that we can't access we're really left with London  POLY. Well  OK. But this will become important later here. That the quotes are not one market is at the heart of current problems. Well  at the heart of attempted solutions to problems.Polymetal share price (London Stock Exchange)Clearly  I was a little early in saying that the fall was much too large back in February. It's fallen again since then. And then roughly  and around and about  flatlined. On the basis that everyone knows this is risky  for who knows how a war will turn out? On the other hand  Polymetal is a very nice little collection of gold mines and processing plants  free of the usual problems that accompany oligarch-owned companies over there. We've not had worries over material or money being tunneled out and so on unlike some other quoted companies that I'll not name here.We also all know that the business is split - there's a Russian business and a Kazakh one. Given current difficulties perhaps a split of them into two different ones might work as a solution.Operating resultsWe've had a set of operating results and they were not  on the face of it  good. However  the problems were more about timing than underlying. For example  this line stands out: "" Gold equivalent (""GE"") production was 697 Koz  a 7% decrease year-on-year. Gold sales decreased by 23% year-on-year to 456 Koz "" It's difficult to sell Russian bullion at present (neither London nor Chicago will accept it as good delivery) so efforts are being made to market in East Asia and so on.It's also true that a high ruble  combined with ruble inflation  has pushed up costs. Then there's the necessity of using local - and thereby almost by definition less efficient - contractors and so on.And yet  still really a very nice collection of gold mines. The problem is really related to the structure of the company.Yes  the half-year shows a loss but that's largely because of non-cash write-downs ("" As a result of lower EBITDA and non-cash impairment charges (the post-tax amount of US$ 564 million)  the Group recorded a net loss for the period of US$ 321 million in 1H 2022  compared to a US$ 419 million profit in 1H 2021. ""). There's still a great little business in there. Actual gold mining is profitable.So  what's the real problem?The real problem is that there's a gold mining business in Russia. Polymetal is roughly - roughly - 40% Kazakh  60% Russian. The shareholder base is roughly 80% outside Russia. We can imagine all sorts of things  the most obvious of which is to split the company. At current valuations  it's near certain that the stand-alone Kazakh business would be worth more than all of Polymetal at present (although that would depend on who had to carry the extant debt load after the split).That background problem is that Petropavlovsk wasn't directly sanctioned at all. Yet it still went bust. We're simply not sure what is going to happen to gold mines in Russia.So  what can be doneThe next big valuation point for POLY is going to be when they announce - if they can - that they've managed to thread through all of the varied restrictions and come up with a solution. The aim will be to have a split company  one owning the Russian assets (which are nicely valued on MOEX  at about 1.7x the London valuation) and another the Kazakh assets. Those Kazakh assets  as above  might well be valued at more than the current valuation of all of them - free of political problems as it would be.There are problems. They're all detailed ones and whether there's a path through them  that's the question.For example  it's not possible to pay a dividend because Euroclear doesn't speak to NSD. Therefore that 20% or so of the shareholder base that is in Russia can't be paid out. One possible answer there is that the stock be replaced with certificated shares. That is  not reliant upon NSD. That's actively being tried and we'll see how that goes at some point.As the board says  it's not possible to really take any major corporate actions while such a large portion of the shareholder base (they say 22%) can't take part.So  umm  what?That's the thing. POLY can't in fact sell the Russian gold mines and bank the cash. Any company based in an ""unfriendly"" jurisdiction cannot sell a Russian gold business - that's a new Russian law. Jersey is defined as unfriendly. They're looking into relocating the jurisdiction of incorporation to try and get around that.Unless and until some very substantial portion of that 22% Russian-owned holding picks up their certified shares  thus getting around NSD  then even a corporate restructure  let alone a dividend  isn't possible.By the way  that not selling mines issue also means that a split of the company can't take place  not without a specific permission from the government in Moscow.It's not obvious that there is a solutionThe Polymetal price has been chugging along a bit below or a bit above £2 since the varied war-related problems became apparent. The actual performance of the business itself makes that a seemingly very low price. If it were all over next week then we'd expect to see a very strong recovery.POLY isn't - by their own statement - going to pay a dividend or even make major corporate changes until they can sort out that communication with Russian shareholders by getting around the NSD.Even if they can do that it's not obvious that there's a path to the most obvious action which would unlock value - splitting the company into Russian and Kazakh portions.The only other value-generative action would seem to be the end of the war and associated conditions. Which is a pretty poor bet to be making with a stock market investment. Given the human ability to keep such things going far longer than is sensible - if they ever are sensible in the first place.I tend to see - now - there being only two things that might juice the Polymetal price. One is finding some cute way through this maze that actually works. That allows the corporate split. The other is an end to the whole situation that makes one even desirable.Why I'm wrongObviously  I don't think I am wrong. But it is possible that they'll be able to solve this conundrum. If they do then I would expect a considerable jump in the joint valuation of the two to be separated companies. So  that's really a restatement of the above rather than a method by which I'm wrong. The difference is that I tend to doubt that they are going to find a manner of dealing with this - my experience of Russian bureaucracy is that if they do find a way then someone will tell them that's not allowed all over again (and yes  my experience is extensive  even if a little bit old).My viewI had thought that this was all going to be over by now  one way or the other. That proved wrong  obviously. My expectation now is that the Polymetal share price will bumble along roughly where it is until there's a clear decision. Either on a corporate split  or the end of hostilities and economic sanctions. I think one of the two will happen eventually but eventually is a long time.The investor viewPolymetal has now become  to my mind  this speculation on those two points. Either or both will produce a significant revaluation of Polymetal shares. So  the question for any position in POLY becomes when we think either of those will happen. I think it will be true that it's over at some point but the timing  well  months or years?",negative,0.01,0.01,0.98,mixed,0.11,0.14,0.75,True,English,"['AUCOY) Stock', 'Polymetal', 'Success', 'next big valuation point', 'US$ 419 million profit', 'extant debt load', 'major corporate actions', 'two different ones', 'One possible answer', 'Actual gold mining', 'broker-driven US quote', 'cash impairment charges', 'gold mining business', 'nice little collection', 'great little business', 'Polymetal share price', 'stand-alone Kazakh business', 'Russian gold mines', 'London Stock Exchange', 'nice collection', 'little liquidity', 'current valuation', 'Russian business', 'great use', 'one market', 'Gold equivalent', 'Gold sales', 'London valuation', 'Russian citizen', 'Russian registrar', 'Russian quote', 'Russian bullion', 'Russian assets', 'chonticha wat', 'Different quotes', 'quick diversion', 'ADR program', 'AIX quote', 'obvious trade', 'normal times', 'processing plants', 'current difficulties', 'Operating results', 'GE"") production', 'good delivery', 'East Asia', 'high ruble', 'ruble inflation', 'cash write-downs', 'lower EBITDA', 'post-tax amount', 'shareholder base', 'varied restrictions', 'large portion', 'Kazakh assets', 'real problem', 'background problem', 'current problems', 'other hand', 'usual problems', 'oligarch-owned companies', 'net loss', 'political problems', 'certificated shares', 'Moscow quote', 'OTCPK:POYYF', 'split company', '40% Kazakh', 'AUCOY', 'quotations', 'listings', 'Almaty', 'Kazakhstan', 'MOEX', 'prices', 'Euroclear', 'NSD', 'heart', 'solutions', 'fall', 'February', 'basis', 'everyone', 'war', 'worries', 'material', 'money', 'face', 'timing', 'example', 'line', '697 Koz', '7% decrease', 'year', '456 Koz', 'present', 'Chicago', 'efforts', 'costs', 'necessity', 'local', 'definition', 'contractors', 'structure', 'Group', 'period', '1H', 'sorts', 'things', 'Petropavlovsk', 'aim', 'path', 'question', 'dividend', 'board', 'part', 'fact']",2022-10-12,2022-10-13,seekingalpha.com

The Shanghai-based firm also warned it may face a similar outcome on offshore debt  after blaming a long Chinese public holiday for delaying payments.The default is particularly worrying because CIFI was considered a barometer for the broader success of a new rescue effort by Beijing to use state guarantees to help a select group of developers access domestic funding. The builder’s payment struggles also serve as a reminder of the uphill battle that Chinese leaders face to revitalize a key economic engine  as they gear up for a major Communist Party congress starting in three days.“It’s just another surprise for investors  who are becoming increasingly skeptical about any private developer ” said Charles Macgregor  head of Asia at Lucror Analytics. “It’s really too late for authorities to support the sector now ” he added  saying confidence among homebuyers and creditors appears “terminally eroded.”Since a default in December by China Evergrande Group  the nation’s property industry has seen a record wave of bond failures fueled by private developers with limited access to a banking sector dominated by state lenders.CIFI’s latest payment setback has extended a selloff in the shares of Chinese developers  with a Bloomberg Intelligence gauge falling as much as 2.6% Thursday and poised for its sixth-straight daily loss. China high-yield dollar notes  dominated by developers  also weakened  according to traders  pushing a Bloomberg index back toward August’s record low.Story continuesWhile the builder’s Hong Kong-listed shares plunged 12%  those of Country Garden Holdings Co.  China’s top developer by contracted sales  also slumped 11% in a sign of contagion to even bigger rivals. Country Garden’s 6.5% dollar bond due 2024 was down 3.5 cents at 26.7 cents as of 5:56 p.m. in Hong Kong  according to Bloomberg-compiled prices  on pace for an all-time low.The Shanghai-based builder of residential projects and shopping malls failed to deliver interest payment on a 6.95% Hong Kong dollar convertible note originally due Oct. 8  the bond’s trustee said in a notice dated Tuesday to Euroclear  one of the world’s top clearing houses. China Construction Bank (Asia) Corp.  the trustee  said the payment miss constitutes an event of default.CIFI didn’t respond to Bloomberg News’ request seeking comment. In a Thursday filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange  the company said it has experienced a delay in remittance of cash offshore to meet scheduled interest and amortization payments due to the recent long public holiday in China.The developer added that it has been proactively engaging with creditors to address the issue in a bid to reach consensual solutions  adding that its commercial operations remain normal. However  CIFI also warned that if it doesn’t meet its offshore debt obligations in a timely manner or is unable to implement appropriate consensual solutions with creditors  “events of default may occur.”Separately  two holders of the Shanghai-based developer’s 4.375% dollar note due 2027 said earlier they have yet to receive coupon payment originally due Wednesday for the note. The investors asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.“CIFI’s default on the convertible bond may make investors nervous and spread the concern on other quality private developers that have issued state-backed guarantee bonds ” said Willer Chen  an analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd.CIFI’s convertible bond in question had HK$88 million ($11.2 million) of interest due Oct. 8  while coupon on the firm’s dollar note due 2027 totals $9.14 million  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Chinese builder has a 30-day grace period to make the interest payment for the dollar note before an event of default can be declared  according to the note’s offering circular.In yet another sign of depressed housing demand  some local governments in China are buying homes in bulk from developers or encouraging state-owned entities to do so in their latest efforts to prop up the real-estate market  the Securities Times reported Thursday.Meanwhile  the International Monetary Fund this week painted a bleak picture of how China’s housing slump may morph into a banking crisis. In its global financial-stability report  the IMF’s analysis showed that 45% of developers might not be able to cover their debt obligations with earnings  and 20% of them could become insolvent if their inventory value is marked to current property prices.In one scenario  15% of small banks may go under  according to the IMF.©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.03,0.34,0.63,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.82,True,English,"['Evergrande Snares State-Aided CIFI', 'China Debt Crisis', 'Hong Kong dollar convertible bond', '6.95% Hong Kong dollar convertible note', 'major Communist Party congress', 'recent long public holiday', 'Hong Kong stock exchange', 'long Chinese public holiday', 'Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd', 'Country Garden Holdings Co.', 'China high-yield dollar notes', 'deepening property debt crisis', 'CIFI Holdings Group Co.', 'other quality private developers', 'new rescue effort', 'key economic engine', 'sixth-straight daily loss', 'state-backed guarantee bonds', '30-day grace period', 'International Monetary Fund', 'global financial-stability report', 'Hong Kong-listed shares', 'top clearing houses', 'current property prices', 'Bloomberg Intelligence gauge', 'Bloomberg News’ request', 'appropriate consensual solutions', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'China Evergrande Group', 'China Construction Bank', 'offshore debt obligations', 'The Shanghai-based firm', 'latest payment setback', 'The Shanghai-based builder', '6.5% dollar bond', '4.375% dollar note', 'select group', 'property industry', 'banking crisis', 'Chinese leaders', 'Bloomberg-compiled prices', 'latest efforts', 'Shanghai-based developer', 'Asia) Corp.', 'top developer', 'bond defaulters', 'bond failures', 'Chinese builder', 'Chinese developers', 'payment struggles', 'payment miss', 'state backing', 'expanding list', 'similar outcome', 'broader success', 'state guarantees', 'uphill battle', 'three days', 'Charles Macgregor', 'Lucror Analytics', 'limited access', 'state lenders', 'Bloomberg index', 'bigger rivals', 'residential projects', 'shopping malls', 'Thursday filing', 'commercial operations', 'timely manner', 'two holders', 'Willer Chen', 'offering circular', 'housing demand', 'local governments', 'state-owned entities', 'real-estate market', 'Securities Times', 'bleak picture', 'housing slump', 'inventory value', 'one scenario', 'small banks', 'interest payment', 'scheduled interest', 'domestic funding', 'record wave', 'banking sector', 'amortization payments', 'coupon payment', 'scrutiny', 'Beijing', 'reminder', 'surprise', 'investors', 'head', 'authorities', 'confidence', 'homebuyers', 'creditors', 'December', 'selloff', 'traders', 'August', 'Story', 'sales', 'sign', 'contagion', '26.7 cents', 'pace', 'trustee', 'notice', 'Euroclear', 'world', 'event', 'comment', 'company', 'delay', 'remittance', 'cash', 'issue', 'bid', 'matter', 'concern', 'analyst', 'question', 'data', 'homes', 'bulk', 'IMF', 'analysis', 'earnings', '5:56']",2022-10-13,2022-10-13,finance.yahoo.com

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover - London vs. Hong Kong 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongFine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales.

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Fine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales.

Why? Because banks need to determine their Green Asset Ratio to publish to the European regulator. The due diligence is burdensome  estimated at a €2.5 billion compliance costs over the next 5 years.”A pillar of this process involves capturing the “right kind of data” to ensure that the reports Greenomy generates for banks are robust and avoid greenwashing via manipulated or inaccurate data.“We don't want proxy data. Lots of data is being computed in the industry  approximated by the sources and that don’t come directly from corporates.“Yet  the regulation mandates authenticated data at the source  so  we go to the source and collect the data directly from corporates. Our audit portal allows the auditors of that corporate to verify that the data is plausible and correct. Once this is completed  the EU Taxonomy alignment report of that corporate is ready and can be disseminated to the regulator  banks or investors.”The fintech offers 4 cloud-based  interconnected portals which are customised to the reporting requirements of banks  corporates  investment managers  and soon insurance providers.Euroclear invested in Greenomy in January this year (for an undisclosed amount)  bringing the fintech’s reporting services to its network.Vandenreydt noted that Greenomy is particularly happy to be welcomed to the Euroclear family as this “market play” feeds into the fintech’s ambitions to mutualise the data it is capturing.He added that the more banks using the platform  the sooner and easier companies will be able to mutualise efforts and fulfil their regulatory obligations. Banks will also have the benefit of leveraging this corporate data for their own internal risk management  credit rating and other activities.Greenomy currently has 12 banks connected to the infrastructure  and is in the process of selecting partner banks  credit institutions or CSDs across Europe that will allow its members to onboard and assess hundreds or thousands of corporates quickly - rather than becoming bogged down in a process of assessing one corporate at a time.“Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future. Financial service providers have a huge job to play in financing that transition. Banks need to come in and help corporates measure their sustainability  financing them and being their partner in the green transition. I think it’s a huge opportunity for the banks to profile themselves as assisting the transition to a real economy.”Later in the afternoon  Greenomy’s CEO Alexander Stevens pitched on the SWIFT Innotribe stage  taking first place in the category of sustainability. “It is a great honour to get the validation of our sustainability mission by major market infrastructures. We look forward to collaborating with SWIFT and its community.”,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.44,0.18,0.38,True,English,"['Swift Innotribe', 'sustainability winner', 'Sibos', 'Spotlight', 'Greenomy', 'EU Taxonomy alignment report', 'corporates’ sustainable finance reporting', 'chief strategy officer', '€2.5 billion compliance costs', '4 cloud-based, interconnected portals', 'internal risk management', 'CEO Alexander Stevens', 'Sibos Discover stage', 'Green Asset Ratio', 'Financial service providers', 'major market infrastructures', 'SWIFT Innotribe stage', 'sustainable future', 'main stage', 'reporting requirements', 'reporting services', 'insurance providers', 'market play', 'hot minute', 'onerous obligation', 'European firms', 'ESG performance', 'loan book', 'due diligence', 'next 5 years', 'right kind', 'audit portal', 'investment managers', 'undisclosed amount', 'easier companies', 'regulatory obligations', 'credit rating', 'other activities', 'credit institutions', 'huge job', 'huge opportunity', 'real economy', 'first place', 'great honour', 'green transition', 'European regulator', 'Euroclear family', 'one corporate', '2,500 data points', 'ESG data', 'inaccurate data', 'proxy data', 'Fabian Vandenreydt', 'ESG-focused fintech', 'corporate data', 'sustainability mission', 'partner banks', '12 banks', 'Finextra', 'pitch', 'Greenomy', 'plan', 'line', 'SFDR', 'CSRD/NFRD', 'tens', 'thousands', 'capturing', 'generation', 'submission', 'regulators', '3,000 counterparties', '3,000 corporations', 'pillar', 'process', 'reports', 'greenwashing', 'manipulated', 'Lots', 'industry', 'sources', 'regulation', 'auditors', 'investors', 'January', 'network', 'ambitions', 'platform', 'sooner', 'efforts', 'benefit', 'CSDs', 'members', 'hundreds', 'time', 'financing', 'afternoon', 'category', 'validation', 'community']",2022-10-13,2022-10-13,finextra.com

Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

""Nobody understands what is happening and what will happen next.""JPMorgan & Chase  Citigroup  Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon act as depositary banks for most Russian depositary receipt programs  according to Clearstream. Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange.In statements to clients  some banks cited difficulties verifying there are enough shares to execute cancellations of depositary receipts.For example  BNY Mellon cited such a difficulty with Global Depositary Receipts in Russian gas company Novatek.""BNY Mellon has closed its books for cancellations with respect to the Novatek DR program until a complete reconciliation of its books "" BNY told clients in a Sept. 2 statement. On Sept. 27  BNY started accepting cancellations again  but said it could close it again at any moment due to reconciliation issues. The bank declined further comment.Citi  after closing books ""to ensure a complete and accurate reconciliation""  reopened them last week. But the bank said in a statement to clients dated Oct. 5 seen by Reuters it may face reconciliation issues due to cancellations taking place directly in Russia.Story continuesSome large international funds have spent months devising ways to maximize potential returns for clients with stranded exposures.BlackRock has been working to convert its depositary receipts  parking the underlying securities in a structure with a view to returning sales proceeds or income when sanctions permit and when market conditions allow some recovery in their value  a source close to the matter told Reuters. Reuters has been unable to verify whether BlackRock encountered any reconciliation problems.One of the biggest U.S. pension funds separately told Reuters it did not see a clear solution for the securities as different rules in the United States and in Russia bar a divestment. The fund declined to be named because its investment strategies are private.LOOMING DEADLINEMoscow has imposed a Nov. 10 deadline for so-called forced conversion of shares.In April  Moscow originally demanded a raft of Russian firms axe their depositary receipts programs. Initially  some companies ordered global banks and brokerages to cancel the depositary receipts  but in July Russia allowed investors to convert depository receipts into common shares directly in a process known as ""forced conversion"" that bypassed global banks.In practical terms  this means some investors may end up taking possession of the underlying shares without formally cancelling the depositary receipts linked to those shares. While depositary receipts are under custody of global banks  the shares they represent are parked in Russia.This has created headaches for the banks who effectively acted as guardians of the programs. They were struggling to match or ""reconcile"" the depository receipts on their books with the underlying shares now in Russian banks.To avoid such issues  global banks decided to stop accepting cancellation requests. For awhile  this left investors only with the option of cancelling the depositary receipts directly in Russia  advisors said.""Banks may end up having more people requesting a redemption than shares they have to deliver. This would create a legal liability "" said Marc Zboch  an investment professional who launched the website ""Russia Deadline"" to help investors convert their receipts for a fee.Foreign investors who want to convert their depositary receipts into local shares using the forced conversion must also jump through some hoops  supplying documents supporting their ownership which must be translated into Russian and notarized. Investors must present these in person in Russia either themselves or using a legal representative  according to advisors.Investors are meanwhile discussing ways online to meet the Russian requirements and how to pay fees to Russian banks. Some investors are active in online discussion groups like the RU GDR/ADR Community on the Discord platform as they try to navigate the situation. They also complain their global brokers have not cooperated processing their requests or providing the required documents.""Investors are sandwiched between a rock and a hard place "" said Marinichev.(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York and Sinead Cruise in London; editing by Megan Davies and David Gregorio)",neutral,0.03,0.56,0.41,mixed,0.06,0.16,0.77,True,English,"['stock conversion baffles', 'Analysis-Russian law', 'global banks', 'clients', 'biggest U.S. pension funds', 'most Russian depositary receipt programs', 'large international funds', 'heating power plan', 'online discussion groups', 'RU GDR/ADR Community', 'local stock exchange', 'Novatek DR program', 'Russian gas company', 'depositary receipts programs', 'Many international investors', 'new Russian law', 'Global Depositary Receipts', 'NEW YORK/LONDON', 'foreign company', 'Russian firms', 'Russian assets', 'Russian requirements', 'depository receipts', 'local shares', 'FILE PHOTO', 'Carolina Mandl', 'Sinead Cruise', 'Russian companies', 'client communications', 'Grigory Marinichev', 'law firm', 'Morgan Lewis', 'depositary banks', 'accurate reconciliation', 'potential returns', 'sales proceeds', 'market conditions', 'reconciliation problems', 'clear solution', 'different rules', 'United States', 'investment strategies', 'LOOMING DEADLINE', 'Nov. 10 deadline', 'practical terms', 'cancellation requests', 'legal liability', 'Marc Zboch', 'investment professional', 'legal representative', 'Discord platform', 'Russian banks', 'global banks', 'BNY Mellon', 'complete chaos', 'complete reconciliation', 'reconciliation issues', 'forced conversion', 'foreign banks', 'ordinary shares', 'enough shares', 'common shares', 'underlying shares', 'Global investors', 'underlying securities', 'Foreign investors', 'Deutsche Bank', 'central Moscow', 'Russia Deadline', 'Sept. 2 statement', '300 investors', 'Steam', 'chimneys', 'skyline', 'Reuters', 'confusion', 'efforts', 'compliance', 'advisors', 'Citigroup', 'processes', 'drive', 'intent', 'influence', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'partner', 'brokerages', 'Nobody', 'JPMorgan', 'Chase', 'Clearstream', 'certificates', 'statements', 'clients', 'difficulties', 'cancellations', 'example', 'difficulty', 'books', 'respect', 'moment', 'comment', 'place', 'Story', 'months', 'ways', 'exposures', 'BlackRock', 'structure', 'view', 'income', 'sanctions', 'recovery', 'value', 'source', 'matter', 'divestment', 'April', 'raft', 'July', 'possession', 'custody', 'headaches', 'guardians', 'awhile', 'option', 'people', 'redemption', 'website', 'fee', 'hoops', 'documents', 'ownership', 'person', 'situation']",2022-10-13,2022-10-13,currently.att.yahoo.com

Eutelsat and key OneWeb shareholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 20…,"Eutelsat strategy update on the proposed combination with OneWebby Staff WritersLondon  UK (SPX) Oct 13  2022Eutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL) has hosted a Strategic Update on the proposed combination with OneWeb  announced in July 2022.Eutelsat and key OneWeb shareholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2022  with a view to combining Eutelsat and OneWeb in an all-share transaction  whereby Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders will each hold 50% of the Eutelsat shares2. The proposed combination represents a transformational transaction aimed at creating a global leader particularly well positioned to capture the fast-growing Satellite Connectivity market by offering the first global combined GEO/LEO infrastructure.The combination represents the logical next step in Eutelsat and OneWeb's growing cooperation since Eutelsat's initial investment in OneWeb in April 2021  which paved the way for major commercial distribution partnerships and multiple joint technical initiatives  including common workstreams to shape the next generation systems for hybrid GEO/LEO infrastructure. Following completion of the combination  Eutelsat and OneWeb will begin working together on the design of OneWeb's future Gen 2 constellation.In this context  both Eutelsat and OneWeb are convinced that the time is right to take their partnership to the next level via the proposed combination  which will:+ accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb's fleet as it enters the final stages of its global deployment;+ jointly address customer needs  initially through bundled services for some customers  from day one  while working together on the optimal combined solutions to address and expand future use-cases;+ capture opex savings upstream and maximise operating efficiencies at an early stage  and;+ maximise capex savings through the early  joint design of OneWeb Gen 2 as part of a combined GEO/LEO infrastructure  delivering significant savings compared to any potential LEO new entrant.Eva Berneke  CEO of Eutelsat  and Neil Masterson  CEO of OneWeb  said: ""The proposed combination between Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a decisive leap forward for Satellite Connectivity. Eutelsat's initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by a strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity.This belief has intensified as Eutelsat and OneWeb's relationship has deepened  and we are confident that moving to the next level  with a full combination  will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  underpinned by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic. This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb's commercial deployment  and Eutelsat's pivot to Connectivity"".Addressing a significant c. $16bn market opportunityThe Satellite Connectivity market is poised for a period of significant growth  with barriers to adoption relating to bandwidth  latency  pricing  and terminals all reducing  thereby driving market expansion at an unprecedented rate. Between now and 2030 the Satellite Connectivity market is expected to more than triple in value from $4.3bn to c.$16bn.The contribution from NGSO3 is expected to grow c.2.5x faster than the overall market to represent almost 50% of the market by 2030  mostly captured by LEO constellations. Demand growth will be spread across four key verticals: Fixed Data  Government Services  Mobility and Consumer Broadband  all of which can be most optimally addressed by a GEO/LEO combination.Moreover  growth is expected to remain robust beyond 2030  driven by the continuing expansion of existing applications  and technology-driven new use cases.In this context  the global LEO constellation of OneWeb represents a uniquely compelling asset in optimising Eutelsat's competitive position to address this significant market opportunity.OneWeb: A unique NGSO assetOneWeb is currently one of the only two global LEO broadband constellations in service  with secured priority spectrum rights  and already reaping the benefits of its early-mover advantage. Its Gen 1 fleet has already been fully funded and successfully began its entry into service.With almost two-thirds of its launches completed  OneWeb's Gen 1 constellation is already generating revenues above the 50-degrees North latitude and requires only a further two launches to extend its coverage to 25-degrees North  well on track for full global entry into service expected by end-2023. The constellation is delivering a high-quality customer experience  with average global one-way latency of 70ms  download speeds of up to 195Mbps  user terminals adapted for each market and a suite of fully managed connectivity services.OneWeb already has over $600m4 in total contracted revenues  and a risk-weighted pipeline of up to $1.9bn spread across its four key verticals of Enterprise  Government  Aviation and Maritime  underpinned by distribution partnerships with major players in each segment and over 150 customer trials underway. On a standalone basis  OneWeb's revenues are expected to reach euro 50m in FY 2023  euro 150 - 250m in FY 2024  euro 300 - 500m in FY 2025  and to exceed euro 600m in FY 20275.GEO/LEO combination paving the way for significant cost advantage and new revenue opportunitiesAs a combined entity  OneWeb and Eutelsat will work together on the conception of OneWeb's Gen 2 constellation  due to enter service by early 2028. As a follow-on constellation to Gen 1  Gen 2 will benefit from the re-use of existing ground infrastructure  the know-how developed with Gen 1  and already secured priority filings  while also being designed as part of a broader GEO/LEO structure rather than a standalone entity. The cost of Gen 2 will therefore be considerably lower than that of building a constellation from scratch.The combination of OneWeb's LEO constellation with Eutelsat's GEO fleet will create a leading infrastructure which will provide best-in-class solutions across a wide range of applications  while gradually paving the way for new revenue opportunities. Eutelsat and OneWeb have a clear roadmap for the integration of their respective in-orbit and on-ground assets  culminating in a fully integrated GEO/LEO network with the entry into service of OneWeb's Gen 2 by early 2028.Implemented in several stages  it will start by building on the distribution agreements already in place to accelerate up-selling and cross-selling opportunities and offer GEO/LEO packages through a one-stop-shop addressing a range of customer requirements. It will then gradually converge towards a full mutualization of networks enabling an integrated offer with automated routing and a single terminal  for a completely seamless  high-performance experience for customers in the key verticals of Mobility  Government  Enterprise and Consumer Broadband.Related LinksEutelsat CommunicationsThe latest information about the Commercial Satellite IndustryThanks for being there;We need your help.

Alternus is also now entering the burgeoning US solar market.European solar PV capacity is set to grow ~40% over the next three years. The European Commission is assessing whether the European Union could achieve a higher target of a 45% share of renewable energy by 2030  instead of its proposed 40%  to accelerate its shift from Russian fossil fuels following the invasion of Ukraine.“Alternus has reached an inflection point in our growth  with a significant increase in contracted pipeline and operating assets over the past year ” said Vincent Browne. “We are grateful to have support from investors in Europe and the United States who are committed to the clean energy transition. We expect that this proposed transaction will leave Alternus well-positioned and well-capitalized to continue developing and/or acquiring  installing and operating renewable energy assets across Europe and also now in the United States.”Aaron Ratner  CEO of Clean Earth  added  “Alternus has built a strong foundation for rapid growth of its renewable power portfolio  and with their continued expansion we anticipate that Alternus will continue to generate consistent  long-term returns for shareholders. Our business combination  Nasdaq listing and the anticipated access to new equity and potentially lower cost debt capital is expected to fuel this expansion and accelerate the company’s conversion of development and contracted projects into cash flowing operating assets.”Nicholas Parker  Executive Chairman of Clean Earth  commented  “The passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act will be a game-changer for the growth of solar power and other renewable energy technologies. Likewise in Europe  solar PV capacity is set to grow ~40% over the next three years. We believe Alternus is well positioned to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation energy transition.”AdvisorsJonesTrading Institutional Services acted as financial advisor to Clean Earth and supported Clean Earth in this Business Combination.

This insight will help bring diversity into the beginning of the feasibility process  all while accelerating trials.Historically  clinical trials have been shown to recruit disproportionately white participants  which raises concerns about the generalizability of trial results to underrepresented patients. New Medidata research* shows that in the past decade 70% of sites did not enroll a single Black participant in Alzheimer’s and lung cancer trials  two diseases that disproportionately affect Black Americans.“ Powering greater diversity is critical for our industry and a priority for Medidata. With this new offering  it is now possible to identify high-performing sites known to recruit diverse patients. This supports more representative outcomes  and promotes much needed equity within clinical research ” said Fareed Melhem  senior vice president  Medidata AI. “ By providing our standardized and analysis-ready demographic and operational data in a study’s planning stages  sponsors and CROs can optimize planning and diversity performance from the start.”Medidata’s Intelligent Trials brings together cross-industry real-time performance metrics  predictive models  and forecasting capabilities to provide a competitive edge in trial planning and execution. With the addition of the Diversity Module  sponsors and CROs can set goals by benchmarking diversity at the study level in the same indication. The new offering will also identify sites that are more successful at recruiting and enrolling diverse individuals based on industry data.Medidata’s research on clinical trial site diversity  based on a sample from more than 28 000 clinical trials across indications and more than 8.5 million patients  is available in the 2022 ASCO Quality Care Symposium abstract titled "" How granularity of data matters in understanding and accelerating racial diversity in U.S. clinical trials "" and in a newly released white paper  “The State of Black Participation in Clinical Trials.” The white paper is the first of a series  with future reports to focus on additional measures of diversity beyond race  such as sex  age  and ethnicity.Medidata’s new Intelligent Trials offering supports the FDA draft guidance to industry  which makes a strong call to action for the enrollment of more participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations in the U.S. into clinical trials. Legislation like the Diverse and Equitable Participation in Clinical Trials (DEPICT) Act  which would mandate the inclusion of diverse populations  also shows the importance for the industry to address this critical issue.*The sample included closed-enrollment  interventional  Phase I-III trials from 2010 to 2021 where race data was collected – encompassing 972 773 patients and 4 003 global trials.Medidata is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Systèmes  which with its 3DEXPERIENCE platform is positioned to lead the digital transformation of life sciences in the age of personalized medicine with the first end-to-end scientific and business platform  from research to commercialization.About MedidataMedidata is leading the digital transformation of life sciences  creating hope for millions of patients.

Overall  three-quarters of Americans report using nutritional or dietary supplements. The vast majority of supplement users continue to be regular users.“This year’s data shows a remarkable picture of continuity and paints the landscape of a vibrant  mainstream industry ” said Brian Wommack  CRN’s senior vice president of communications. “While overall usage is down slightly from its pandemic peak  reported usage of immunity-boosting supplements—including vitamin D  vitamin C  and zinc—is steady from last year.”COVID-19 is no longer top of mind in many consumers’ minds. About half of supplement users (49%) report changing their supplement use since the pandemic began  stable compared to 2021. Looking specifically at whether they have added new supplements or increased their dose  two-thirds of supplement users report doing so  slightly less than last year.Changes in supplement usage have happened across age groups and genders  but declines are more marked among those with lower incomes and among white and Hispanic Americans. Supplement usage remains higher among women  older adults  and those that are more educated and/or have a higher household income.New this year is an increase in specialty supplement usage. More than half of consumers (52%) who take supplements report taking a specialty supplement  the most reported of which are omega-3s  probiotics  melatonin  and fiber.Still the king among supplement users  70% report taking a multivitamin in the past 12 months. Sports and nutrition supplements have seen a significant increase in use since last year  up five points to 39%.Trust in the dietary supplement also remains high. More than three-quarters of Americans (77%) find the industry trustworthy. That number is even higher among supplement users  at 84%.When asked their top motivator for taking dietary supplements  Americans’ top responses are “maintaining my health” and “live healthier/adopt healthier habits.” “This answer is not surprising ” said Wommack. “Data consistently shows supplement users are much more likely to report engaging in healthy behaviors like exercising  eating a balanced diet  visiting their doctor regularly  and regularly getting a good night’s sleep.”Conducted annually since 2000  the CRN Consumer Survey on Dietary Supplements serves as the leading resource for statistics on usage of dietary supplements. The survey was conducted online between August 9-12  2022  among 3 133 U.S. adults age 18+  including 2 342 adults who report consuming dietary supplements seasonally  occasionally  or regularly.For the second year in a row  this year’s survey includes oversamples of Black  Hispanic  and Asian/Pacific Islander respondents to ensure significant sample sizes of supplement users of color to provide deep insights into the groups’ motivations  attitudes  and purchasing habits. The complete set of consumer survey data is available for purchase by both CRN members and nonmembers.About the Council for Responsible NutritionThe Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN)  founded in 1973  is a Washington  D.C.-based trade association representing more than 200 dietary supplement and functional food manufacturers  ingredient suppliers  and companies providing services to those manufacturers and suppliers. In addition to complying with a host of federal and state regulations governing dietary supplements and food in the areas of manufacturing  marketing  quality control and safety  our manufacturer and supplier members also agree to adhere to additional voluntary guidelines as well as to CRN’s Code of Ethics.

The report reveals that positive female representation can be beneficial to brands and highlights creative techniques companies can utilize in their advertising development process to create greater success and stronger relationships with consumers.For the whitepaper  SeeHer and Ipsos sought to better understand the impact of creative and thematic elements used in ads depicting women. Utilizing the Gender Equality Measure® (GEM®) developed by SeeHer  the first data-driven methodology to identify gender bias in media  the two organizations explored how key predictive variables identified by GEM scores drive a variety of marketing measures and business growth. They also used performance metrics  such as brand choice intent and long-term brand relationship  to evaluate the benefits of positive female representation on brands. Connecting the GEM creative drivers’ framework to choice intent and brand relationship metrics allowed Ipsos and SeeHer to build a predictive  data-driven model that can be leveraged to consistently link the accurate portrayal of women and girls to advertising that improves brand preference.Key findings from the whitepaper include:Positive female representation: Elevated portrayals of women are significantly more likely to drive positive business results. Ads that featured females in a positive light performed in the top third of the GEM database  while brands saw the likelihood of short-term sales +24% higher and the likelihood of stronger long-term brand relationships +28% higher.Realistic portrayals of women: Advertising is getting better at showcasing more realistic and nuanced portrayals of women. Females depicted as professionals typically outperformed and received high GEM scores; however  brands still found success when featuring women in traditional roles  including as mothers and wives  when these stories and characters appeared authentic and multi-dimensional.Women pursuing their passions: Women shown as having more agency over their lives drove higher GEM scores  as did ads that depicted women achieving their goals or pursuing their personal passions. These ads provided viewers with positive role models as well as increased favorable perceptions of brands.Lindsay Franke  Head of Creative Excellence  US  Ipsos  said  “Get rid of the notion that you have to choose between doing good and doing well. Ipsos has demonstrated that the positive portrayal of women and girls  as measured by GEM  is significantly predictive of in-market success of advertising. Getting creative right ahead of airing can pay huge dividends.”Latha Sarathy  Chief Research Officer  Association of National Advertisers and EVP  Insights & Measurement  SeeHer added  “This study quantifies the ‘why’ behind GEM  provides a data-driven blueprint for optimizing creative and showcases why GEM testing is so crucial. By uncovering how thematic elements used in ads drive a variety of marketing and business goals  we are helping companies better connect with consumers while more accurately portraying women and girls in media.”“SeeHer developed GEM six years ago to support our mission to eliminate gender bias advertising and media. We are delighted to bring this new dimension of GEM to the market and are especially proud to partner with Ipsos on Strive for More. This powerful whitepaper proves that positively portraying females is not only the right thing to do  but is also good for business ” concluded Jeannine Shao Collins  President  SeeHer  Association of National Advertisers.Ipsos became the first research member of the SeeHer movement  whose members include leading media  marketing  and entertainment companies. To date  Ipsos has collected GEM data on roughly 2 200 ads across the globe.Strive for More can be accessed here.About SeeHerSeeHer is the leading global movement of media  marketing and entertainment leaders committed to the accurate depiction of women and girls in advertising and media. Launched in 2016 by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) in partnership with The Female Quotient (The FQ)  SeeHer is changing how females are portrayed in media. To help members benchmark success  SeeHer spearheaded the development of the Gender Equality Measure® (GEM®)  the first research methodology that quantifies gender bias in ads and programming. GEM® proves that content accurately portraying females dramatically increases both purchase intent and brand reputation. The GEM® methodology quickly became the industry standard  winning the prestigious ESOMAR Research Effectiveness Award in 2017 and leading to its global rollout in 2018. Since 2019  the movement has expanded its verticals to include sports (SeeHer In Sports) and music (SeeHer Hear Her).To learn more  visit SeeHer.com and follow SeeHer on Instagram  Facebook  LinkedIn  TikTok and Twitter.About IpsosIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operating in 90 markets and employing over 18 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

Shipments increased 48%  following the return of our largest transshipment vessel from scheduled maintenance  and we expect Q4 to be our best quarter of the year for both shipments and production.Pricing for our products increased again in Q3 and our order book for Q4 is largely committed. However  pigment demand weakened through the quarter  affected by Chinese and European market conditions. We expect demand for titanium feedstocks to moderate in 2023  but we believe the fundamentals of our product markets remain robust.Unfortunately  we had a Lost Time Injury (LTI) in late September. Prior to this we had almost 12 million LTI-free hours worked at the Moma Mine  which is a testament to the commitment of the team on site to achieving an industry-leading safety performance.”Q3 2022 overviewLost Time Injury Frequency rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: 0.08)  with one Lost Time Injury (“LTI”) recorded during the quarterHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes and a 2% increase in ore gradesIlmenite production of 304 700 tonnes  a 3% decrease compared to the record production in Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes)  but up 25% on Q2 2022 (242 900 tonnes)Primary zircon production of 17 300 tonnes  a 10% increase compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveriesProduction of all finished products is anticipated to be at or around the bottom of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance ranges. Total cash operating cost guidance is expected to be at the top of the guidance range principally due to inflationary pressuresTotal shipments of finished products of 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity as a result of the Bronagh J transshipment vessel being in dry dock until late August and poor weather conditionsHigher ilmenite prices achieved in Q3 2022 and contracts in place for the majority of Q4 sales  despite weaker demand for titanium pigment from China and EuropeDemand for Kenmare’s zircon products remained strong in Q3 and this is continuing in Q4  supported by supply constraints  although the global zircon market is showing signs of weakness  particularly in ChinaStory continuesOperations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2022 were as follows:Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2022 Q2 2022 tonnes tonnes % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 424 000 10 084 000 3% 10 070 000 4% Grade1 4.95% 4.83% 2% 4.23% 17% Production HMC production 443 900 413 400 7% 353 600 26% HMC processed 440 500 426 800 3% 367 300 20% Ilmenite 304 700 314 400 -3% 242 900 25% Primary zircon 17 300 15 700 10% 13 600 27% Rutile 2 600 2 700 -4% 2 100 24% Concentrates2 13 000 11 900 9% 9 800 33% Shipments 285 600 322 600 -11% 192 800 48%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling LTIFR for the 12 months to 30 September 2022 was 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked (30 September 2021: 0.08)  with one LTI recorded in Q3 2022. The previous LTI was on 6 January 2021 and as such  Kenmare had achieved over 11.8 million LTI-free hours worked to late September.HMC production was 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due primarily to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes to 10.4 million tonnes (Q3 2021: 10.1 million tonnes)  driven by a strong performance at Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) B. Mitigation measures to reduce the impact of high slimes also benefitted production in Q3. HMC production increased by 26% compared to Q2 2022 (353 600 tonnes).Ore grades increased by 2% in Q3 2022 to 4.95% compared to Q3 2021 (4.83%) and by 17% compared to Q2 2022 (4.23%)  supported by improved performance from WCP B in the Pilivili ore zone.Ilmenite production in Q3 2022 was 304 700 tonnes  returning to an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum. It decreased by 3% compared to Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes) but represented a 25% improvement on Q2 2022. There was some magnetic intermediate stock build-up during Q3  reflecting the difference between HMC processed and ilmenite produced.Primary zircon production was 17 300 tonnes in Q3 2022  up 10% compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveries. However  rutile production was 2 600 tonnes  down 4% on Q3 2021 (2 700 tonnes) due to lower recoveries and stock build-up. Concentrates production was 13 000 tonnes  up 9% on Q3 2021 (11 900 tonnes)  driven by robust mineral sands concentrate production.As a result of the stronger production in Q3 2022  following weaker than anticipated production in H1  Kenmare expects production of finished products to be at or around the bottom of its 2022 guidance ranges. Operating costs are expected to be at the top of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance range  principally due to inflationary pressures  and unit costs will be a function of the lower production volumes and higher operating costs.As previously announced  one of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Bronagh J  left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work  reducing significantly Kenmare’s shipping capacity in Q2 and Q3 2022. The Bronagh J returned to site on 25 August and shipping volumes increased significantly in September. Typically  Q4 is the strongest quarter of the year for shipments due to seasonally favourable weather conditions; and  with both vessels now in operation  finished product inventories are expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.Total shipments in Q3 2022 were 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity and poor weather conditions. Shipments comprised 246 900 tonnes of ilmenite  18 400 tonnes of primary zircon  5 300 tonnes of rutile and 14 900 tonnes of concentrates. Shipments also increased by 48% compared to Q2 2022.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2022 was 12 700 tonnes  compared to 9 200 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2022 was 267 000 tonnes  compared to 214 900 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022  reflecting the lower shipping capacity and the poor weather conditions limiting loading.Capital projects updateWork is continuing on the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for the Nataka ore zone  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. The PFS is expected to be completed in late 2022 and a market update will be provided in Q1 2023. The Environmental Impact Assessment is progressing well  with the first round of public consultation completed.As part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. Some elements of the PFS are significantly advanced; so work towards the Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) has commenced in those areas  including on the desliming circuit. Results for this part of the DFS are expected in Q1 2023 and  on an accelerated timeline  the installation of the desliming circuit at WCP A could occur in 2024.Market updateKenmare achieved a stronger sales performance in Q3 2022  supported by increased shipment volumes and higher prices for its ilmenite and zircon products. Q3 represented the eighth consecutive quarter of ilmenite price increases. Kenmare also shipped more higher value products in the third quarter than in Q1 and Q2 2022.Despite Kenmare’s stronger sales performance  global demand for titanium pigment was lower in Q3 resulting in a moderation in pigment production. The Chinese pigment market was the first to soften  as COVID-19 lockdowns and a slower property market dampened demand  and this trend continued throughout Q3. European demand for pigment also decreased during the quarter  driven by a lower outlook for economic growth and high energy costs. Notwithstanding this  Kenmare continued to see resilient demand from its existing customers  benefitting from strong demand from the ilmenite beneficiation market. Growing titanium metal production in China also continues to support import demand for titanium feedstocks.The supply of titanium feedstocks has continued to increase  primarily from Chinese producers in Mozambique and producers in the USA. However  a weaker iron ore market in China has resulted in lower production of ilmenite as a by-product from producers in China  which is helping to balance the market.A weaker pigment market is likely to impact demand for ilmenite in Q4. However  Kenmare has contracts in place for the majority of its expected sales in the quarter  with pricing continuing to be strong as high-quality ilmenite remains in short supply.Although demand for Kenmare’s zircon products remains robust  the zircon market has been exhibiting similar dynamics to the pigment market. Demand in China is weak and European ceramics producers have been impacted by higher energy costs. Prices in the spot market in China moved significantly above prices in the rest of the world but have declined in recent weeks  and this will result in lower prices for Kenmare’s concentrates products sold to China. However  zircon supply remains constrained and prices outside of China are stable  which benefits Kenmare as the majority of its primary zircon is sold in Europe.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

This growth was driven in particular by the dynamic momentum of the animation and expansion of all product offerings;The activity of the Local Authorities division in the Q4 was down compared with financial year 2020/2021  mainly because deliveries were brought forward to the Q3. For the year overall  performance was consistent with the previous financial year.Given the current inflationary and uncertain context  the Group will devote its best efforts to mitigating any impacts  all while remaining focused on the implementation of its development strategy. This strategy will notably involve expanding its offering of responsible products and services  its storage capacities  as well as strengthening its hybrid business model  combining digital  personalized omnichannel customer approach and operational agility that is necessary in the current context.*********************About the Manutan GroupA family-run business created in 1966  Manutan is one of Europe’s leading B2B e-commerce companies specialized in the distribution of equipment and supplies  thanks to a model that allies the strengths of digital to a human ambition.Its vast range of carefully selected products and services enables its customers – be they in the private sector  the public sector  or the trade – to operate efficiently and sustainably on a daily basis  along with the implementation of a purchasing optimization strategy.With 27 subsidiaries established in 17 countries in Europe  the Group has more than 2 200 employees and a turnover of 820 million euros in 2020/2021.

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover - London vs. Hong Kong 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongFine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYThis month  the structured debt market has been significantly impacted by the “liquidity” crunch resultating in the Volta net asset value (“NAV”) declining by -7.2%  totally reversing the +7.2% NAV uplift seen in July/August.Examining the underlying sub asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +1.3% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -5.6% for CLO equity tranches; -8.7% for CLO debt; and -0.2% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.3% of NAV).It is our view that the downdraft in pricing in the second half of September is the direct result of many investors having to face huge margin calls from currency hedging and/or from synthetic duration management (LDI: Liability Driven Investing) and becoming forced sellers in order to generat cash  in a context of new record high currency and interest rates volatility.Volta avoided needing to raise cash through selling assets at distressed prices as it accumulated sufficient cash in August.In the CLO markets  we saw a spike in BWIC lists (Bids Wanted In Competition) sometimes with very a very short time response window (less than a few hours); the usual practice  in normal market conditions  is to ask for bids for the next day.As a consequence  CLO debt prices in particular have been temporarily depressed even though there was still almost no trade regarding CLO equity tranches as the vast majority of the BWIC was for AAA or AA tranches of CLO debts with a high focus on European CLO debt.Looking at fundamentals  as expected  in September there have been more downgrades of loans than upgrades but the overall quantum is still relatively low. There has been no significant increase in the proportion of CCC loans in CLOs and the CLO loan default rate remains very low (0.4% in Europe and 0.9% in the US for the last 12 months).For the next month the focus will be on earnings publication for Q3 2022 but the overall outlook is not expected to change: we continue to expect for next year an increase in loan market default rates but not to a level that is would cause diversion of cash flows for CLO Equity positions in 2023. Volta is expected to receive in October all its cash flows from its CLO Equity position. We expect to continue to generate a high level of coupons we are looking to seize investment opportunities from the current liquidity crisis.Last week we opened a European CLO Warehouse. No loans have yet been purchased but we expect to purchase some loans in the coming weeks/months at significant discount in order to form  later on  a very profitable CLO Equity position from this warehouse.In September  Volta received the equivalent of €0.8m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended September 2022  Volta received €24m interest and coupons representing a 22.4% annualized cash flow to NAV.As at the end of September 2022  Volta’s NAV was €212.3m or €5.80 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 7.2% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.0% as at 31 August 2022  5.7% was at 31 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Shipments increased 48%  following the return of our largest transshipment vessel from scheduled maintenance  and we expect Q4 to be our best quarter of the year for both shipments and production.Pricing for our products increased again in Q3 and our order book for Q4 is largely committed. However  pigment demand weakened through the quarter  affected by Chinese and European market conditions. We expect demand for titanium feedstocks to moderate in 2023  but we believe the fundamentals of our product markets remain robust.Unfortunately  we had a Lost Time Injury (LTI) in late September. Prior to this we had almost 12 million LTI-free hours worked at the Moma Mine  which is a testament to the commitment of the team on site to achieving an industry-leading safety performance.”Q3 2022 overviewLost Time Injury Frequency rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: 0.08)  with one Lost Time Injury (“LTI”) recorded during the quarterHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes and a 2% increase in ore gradesIlmenite production of 304 700 tonnes  a 3% decrease compared to the record production in Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes)  but up 25% on Q2 2022 (242 900 tonnes)Primary zircon production of 17 300 tonnes  a 10% increase compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveriesProduction of all finished products is anticipated to be at or around the bottom of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance ranges. Total cash operating cost guidance is expected to be at the top of the guidance range principally due to inflationary pressuresTotal shipments of finished products of 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity as a result of the Bronagh J transshipment vessel being in dry dock until late August and poor weather conditionsHigher ilmenite prices achieved in Q3 2022 and contracts in place for the majority of Q4 sales  despite weaker demand for titanium pigment from China and EuropeDemand for Kenmare’s zircon products remained strong in Q3 and this is continuing in Q4  supported by supply constraints  although the global zircon market is showing signs of weakness  particularly in ChinaOperations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2022 were as follows:Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2022 Q2 2022 tonnes tonnes % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 424 000 10 084 000 3% 10 070 000 4% Grade1 4.95% 4.83% 2% 4.23% 17% Production HMC production 443 900 413 400 7% 353 600 26% HMC processed 440 500 426 800 3% 367 300 20% Ilmenite 304 700 314 400 -3% 242 900 25% Primary zircon 17 300 15 700 10% 13 600 27% Rutile 2 600 2 700 -4% 2 100 24% Concentrates2 13 000 11 900 9% 9 800 33% Shipments 285 600 322 600 -11% 192 800 48%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling LTIFR for the 12 months to 30 September 2022 was 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked (30 September 2021: 0.08)  with one LTI recorded in Q3 2022. The previous LTI was on 6 January 2021 and as such  Kenmare had achieved over 11.8 million LTI-free hours worked to late September.HMC production was 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due primarily to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes to 10.4 million tonnes (Q3 2021: 10.1 million tonnes)  driven by a strong performance at Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) B. Mitigation measures to reduce the impact of high slimes also benefitted production in Q3. HMC production increased by 26% compared to Q2 2022 (353 600 tonnes).Ore grades increased by 2% in Q3 2022 to 4.95% compared to Q3 2021 (4.83%) and by 17% compared to Q2 2022 (4.23%)  supported by improved performance from WCP B in the Pilivili ore zone.Ilmenite production in Q3 2022 was 304 700 tonnes  returning to an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum. It decreased by 3% compared to Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes) but represented a 25% improvement on Q2 2022. There was some magnetic intermediate stock build-up during Q3  reflecting the difference between HMC processed and ilmenite produced.Primary zircon production was 17 300 tonnes in Q3 2022  up 10% compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveries. However  rutile production was 2 600 tonnes  down 4% on Q3 2021 (2 700 tonnes) due to lower recoveries and stock build-up. Concentrates production was 13 000 tonnes  up 9% on Q3 2021 (11 900 tonnes)  driven by robust mineral sands concentrate production.As a result of the stronger production in Q3 2022  following weaker than anticipated production in H1  Kenmare expects production of finished products to be at or around the bottom of its 2022 guidance ranges. Operating costs are expected to be at the top of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance range  principally due to inflationary pressures  and unit costs will be a function of the lower production volumes and higher operating costs.As previously announced  one of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Bronagh J  left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work  reducing significantly Kenmare’s shipping capacity in Q2 and Q3 2022. The Bronagh J returned to site on 25 August and shipping volumes increased significantly in September. Typically  Q4 is the strongest quarter of the year for shipments due to seasonally favourable weather conditions; and  with both vessels now in operation  finished product inventories are expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.Total shipments in Q3 2022 were 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity and poor weather conditions. Shipments comprised 246 900 tonnes of ilmenite  18 400 tonnes of primary zircon  5 300 tonnes of rutile and 14 900 tonnes of concentrates. Shipments also increased by 48% compared to Q2 2022.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2022 was 12 700 tonnes  compared to 9 200 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2022 was 267 000 tonnes  compared to 214 900 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022  reflecting the lower shipping capacity and the poor weather conditions limiting loading.Capital projects updateWork is continuing on the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for the Nataka ore zone  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. The PFS is expected to be completed in late 2022 and a market update will be provided in Q1 2023. The Environmental Impact Assessment is progressing well  with the first round of public consultation completed.As part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. Some elements of the PFS are significantly advanced; so work towards the Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) has commenced in those areas  including on the desliming circuit. Results for this part of the DFS are expected in Q1 2023 and  on an accelerated timeline  the installation of the desliming circuit at WCP A could occur in 2024.Market updateKenmare achieved a stronger sales performance in Q3 2022  supported by increased shipment volumes and higher prices for its ilmenite and zircon products. Q3 represented the eighth consecutive quarter of ilmenite price increases. Kenmare also shipped more higher value products in the third quarter than in Q1 and Q2 2022.Despite Kenmare’s stronger sales performance  global demand for titanium pigment was lower in Q3 resulting in a moderation in pigment production. The Chinese pigment market was the first to soften  as COVID-19 lockdowns and a slower property market dampened demand  and this trend continued throughout Q3. European demand for pigment also decreased during the quarter  driven by a lower outlook for economic growth and high energy costs. Notwithstanding this  Kenmare continued to see resilient demand from its existing customers  benefitting from strong demand from the ilmenite beneficiation market. Growing titanium metal production in China also continues to support import demand for titanium feedstocks.The supply of titanium feedstocks has continued to increase  primarily from Chinese producers in Mozambique and producers in the USA. However  a weaker iron ore market in China has resulted in lower production of ilmenite as a by-product from producers in China  which is helping to balance the market.A weaker pigment market is likely to impact demand for ilmenite in Q4. However  Kenmare has contracts in place for the majority of its expected sales in the quarter  with pricing continuing to be strong as high-quality ilmenite remains in short supply.Although demand for Kenmare’s zircon products remains robust  the zircon market has been exhibiting similar dynamics to the pigment market. Demand in China is weak and European ceramics producers have been impacted by higher energy costs. Prices in the spot market in China moved significantly above prices in the rest of the world but have declined in recent weeks  and this will result in lower prices for Kenmare’s concentrates products sold to China. However  zircon supply remains constrained and prices outside of China are stable  which benefits Kenmare as the majority of its primary zircon is sold in Europe.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Fine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

In Sweden  we have continued to shoulder significant responsibility both in the care of COVID patients and in limiting the effects of the pandemic on individuals and society. For example  approximately 600 000 doses of COVID vaccine were administered to patients  in our Swedish facilities in particular to our nursing home residents. In addition  we continued to manage almost 20% of all COVID-related hospital care in the Stockholm area.Growth was strong in the 3 Nordic countries  particularly in Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) hospitalisations  up 14% on the previous year  excluding Germany. Consultations in primary care centres in Sweden  including teleconsultations  were up 16%. In France  full MSO inpatient hospital admissions fell by 4.1%  while day patient admissions rose by 3%. The same trend affects our Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR) activity with a 1.1% drop in inpatients and a 27.6% increase in day patients.Total investments for the period amounted to €217 million compared with €220 million last year. More than 40% of investments correspond to growth and digital investments. These investments are necessary to uphold our operational and medical excellence. The number of primary care centres has increased by 28% from 130 to 167 in 2022. We have opened our first 5 primary care centres in France and invested in 2 new surgical robots. We have also established capital and operational partnerships with the Resilience and NewCard start-ups. In January 2022  we launched Ramsay Services  a digital platform.Reported annual turnover is €4 301 million  up 6.9%. Adjusted for changes in the scope of consolidation and at constant exchange rates  turnover for the year ending June 30th 2022 is up with very solid organic turnover growth of 6.0%.Reported EBITDA increased by 2.3% to €658.4 million (prior year €643.8 million) with a margin of 15.3% (prior year 16.0%). EBITDA development was positively impacted by activity in Nordic countries  which compensated for increases in inflation and personnel costs. The revenue guarantee system put in place by the French government generated €99 million in income for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with an income of €103 million for the year ending June 30th 2021.Reported EBITDA increased by 2.3% to €658.4 million (prior year €643.8 million) with a margin of 15.3% (prior year 16.0%). EBITDA development was positively impacted by activity in Nordic countries  which compensated for increases in inflation and personnel costs. The revenue guarantee system put in place by the French government generated €99 million in income for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with an income of €103 million for the year ending June 30th 2021. The group share of net profit is €118.4 million  benefiting from the increase in activity and improved results  representing 2.8% of turnover.Net financial debt at the end of June 30th 2022 amounts to €3 710 million  including €2 118 million of IFRS 16 liabilities.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“In 2022  for the first time  Ramsay Santé exceeded the threshold of 10 million patients treated in Europe in its various activities  within and outside its facilities  as well as in digital. During the year  the Group mobilised more than ever for the care of Covid patients  and reinforced its ability to treat all patients for all pathologies. In France  our commitment is reflected in the fact that 10% of patients admitted are beneficiaries of Universal Medical Coverage (CMU). The Group has also taken an innovative approach to human resources in France with the signing of an ambitious agreement on quality of life in the workplace. Financial results remain solid  with growth of 6.9% and a slightly lower EBITDA margin (15.3% under IFRS16 in 2022 vs. 16.0% in 2021). These results are due to sustained organic growth as well as acquisitions in Sweden  Norway and Denmark. This demonstrates the relevance of our strategy of consolidating our position as an integrated European health care operator and orchestrating coordinated care pathways  allowing us to guarantee quality and accessibility for all.”The Board of Directors approved the consolidated accounts as of the end of June 2022 at its meeting held on 13th October 2022. The audit procedures on the consolidated accounts have been carried out. The auditors’ certification report will be issued after finalization of the verification of the management report and the procedures required for the purposes of filing the universal registration document.The consolidated financial statements and reports will be available to the public when the company's universal registration document is published at the end of October 2022.Summary of resultsIn € million From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 From 1 July 2020 to30 June 2021 Variation Turnover 4 301.0 4 022.6 +6.9% EBITDA 658.4 643.8 +2.3% As a % of turnover +15.3% +16.0% -0.8 point Underlying Operating Profit 281.1 272.0 +3.3% As a % of turnover +6.5% +6.8% -0.3 point Operating Profit 291.3 250.6 +16.2% As a % of turnover +6.8% +6.2% +0.4 point Group share of Net Profit 118.4 65.0 Earnings per share (in €) 1.07 0.59Net Financial Debt (in € million) From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 From 1 July 2020 to30 June 2021 Non-current financial liabilities 1 763.6 1 673.6 Non-current lease liability 1 922.3 1 940.2 Current lease liability 196.0 198.9 Current financial liabilities 35.4 38.1 (Cash) (132.5) (608.4) Other financial assets & liabilities (74.9) (11.9) Net financial debt 3 709.9 3 230.5Cash Flow Statement (in € million) From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 From 1 July 2020 to30 June 2021 Gross operating surplus 658.4 643.8 Cash flow from operations before cost of net financial debt and tax 642.1 624.6 Net cash flow from operating activities 262.5 652.3 Net flow from investments (471.1) (181.4) Net flow related to financing (264.2) (390.6) Change in net cash position (472.8) 80.3 Opening cash balance 608.4 538.3 Closing cash balance 132.5 608.4Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 From 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 Variation Île-de-France 1 057.9 1 000.8 +5.7% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 579.6 561.7 +3.2% Hauts de France 393.4 380.6 +3.4% Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur 169.1 161.4 +4.8% Bourgogne Franche Comté 133.7 134.3 -0.4% Other regions 669.8 655.3 +2.2% Nordic countries 1 297.4 1 155.4 +12.3% Reported Turnover 4 301.0 4 022.6 +6.9%Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in reported turnover from the financial year ended 30 June 2021 to the the financial year ended 30 June 202 2.Reported Turnover30 June 2021 Changes in foreign exchange Acquisitions and disposals- Organic growth Reported turnover30 June 2022 Variation In € million 4 022.6 (12.9) +53.7 +237.6 4 301.0 +278.4 -0.3% +1.3% +5.9% +6.9%Significant events of the financial year:Health crisis due to the COVID PandemicThe financial year ending June 30th 2022 was impacted by the ongoing health crisis due to the COVID pandemic in all countries where the Group operates.FranceIn France  private hospitals have maintained their action plans to combat the COVID epidemic and their level of investment in conjunction with and in support of public hospitals  in accordance with the national health plan.Ramsay Santé upheld its commitment to treating COVID patients with more than 10 000 COVID patients treated in France  including 4 500 in critical care. Like other hospital operators  Ramsay Santé has continued to be supported by measures implemented by the government. The main measures during the period concern:The revenue guaranteeGrants compensating for additional costs related to COVIDThe revenue guarantee covered the entire financial year for Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) and Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR). It was only in place for the first half of the year (July-December 2021) for Mental Health activities  given the reform of the financing of Mental Health activities (MH) towards an allocation model in force since January 1st 2022.The amount of the funding guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending June 30th 2022 amounts to €99 million (€103 million for the previous year) and is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.In addition to the revenue guarantee  the government also adjusted the levels of grants usually paid to health care institutions in order to compensate for the additional costs related to the COVID crisis that would not otherwise be covered. These subsidies are reported in the income statement under “Other operating income” for €89.8 million (€72.3 million for the previous financial year). Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  a significant portion of the subsidies reported during the period corresponds to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of the same period last year. Of the total amount of funding recognised in the period  €27.5 million (€14.5 million in the previous year) corresponds to amounts received for the funding of additional costs incurred in the previous year.Outside FranceThe Group's facilities in Scandinavia played an active role in the care of COVID patients as well as in screening and vaccinating the population  backing up public institutions and in close collaboration with the supervisory authorities. Nevertheless  activity was impacted by the health crisis during the period  in particular for inpatient care in Sweden but also in Denmark and Norway where the authorities suspended admissions at the height of the spread of the virus from December 2021 to February 2022. Despite these periods of disruption  the overall activity level and profits were strong as activity was boosted during the periods when normal activity resumed.In Sweden  Sankt Göran Hospital and the Group-operated geriatric hospitals in Stockholm played a key role in managing the outbreak with over 100 beds dedicated to COVID patients. Sankt Göran  together with the Stockholm geriatric hospitals  treated almost 20% of all COVID patients in the Stockholm area throughout the pandemic. The Group contributed significantly to the screening and vaccination effort in Sweden and to screening in Norway.Whilst no support measures were implemented in Norway and Denmark  our facilities in Sweden received grants to cover additional operating costs. In total  the amount of aid received by our institutions in Sweden was €32.2 million in the period  compared to €61.5 million in the previous period.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé finalised the acquisition of 10 entities in Scandinavia during the year. These acquisitions are complementary to the current business and expand the scope of the Group's services as well as its geographic footprint. In total  these acquisitions represented a net investment of €288.6 million.Furthermore  Ramsay Santé completed the acquisition of GHP Specialty Care AB (“GHP”) in May 2022  for an enterprise value of €238 million. In the 12 months ending December 2021  GHP's turnover amounted to €137 million. GHP employs 765 FTEs. This acquisition contributed €29 million in turnover and €1.9 million in EBITDA to Ramsay Santé's accounts in the year ended 30 June 2022.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and turnover:In the financial year ending June 30th 2022  Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated turnover of €4 301.0 million  compared with €4 022.6 million for the period from July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  an increase of 6.9%. Please note that the financing guarantee scheme in the Group's accounts has no impact on reported turnover as it is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the Group’s turnover increased by 6.0% with one additional working day.Changes in the scope of consolidation are due to divestment of the German business and two clinics in France in the previous financial year  combined with acquisitions in the Nordic region over the last 12 months.For the financial year ending June 30th 2022  the overall activity of Ramsay Santé’s French entities continued to be impacted by the consequences of the COVID pandemic. The main effects were related to the cancellation of certain scheduled medical and surgical activities during the peaks of the pandemic but also from limiting the number of patients per room. In total  the number of patient admissions increased by 3.2% compared with last year. This increase is mainly related to comparatively lower volumes in 2020-2021  as the negative impact of the COVID pandemic on patients' willingness to access care recedes in our follow-up care  rehabilitation and mental health activities.The variation by business line breaks down as follows:+0.3% in medicine  surgery and obstetrics+23.8% in follow-up care and rehabilitation+11 4% in mental healthAs part of its public service missions  the Group recorded a 16.2% increase in the number of emergency room visits during the past year  with approximately 755 000 visits to our facilities in France.Organic turnover growth in Nordic countries for the year ending June 30th 2022 was +7.4% compared with last year. Organic turnover growth was boosted by both investments and new contracts  additional services related to COVID screening and vaccination  and continued positive turnover growth in the underlying business. Scandinavian business also benefited from the latest acquisitions  which contributed €66 million of additional turnover during the financial year  net of the impact of disposals (German business sold at the end of 2020).Resul ts :EBITDA reached €658.4 million for the financial year ending June 30th 2022  up 2.3% on a reported basis. The Group's EBITDA at 30 June 2022 includes 99.1 million related to the revenue guarantee system described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for COVID surcharges for France and Sweden. EBITDA was also positively impacted by the organic growth of the business  particularly in the Nordic region.The EBITDA margin as a percentage of turnover was 15.3%  compared with 16.0% for the same period last year on a reported basis.Underlying operating profit amounted to €281.1 million between July 1st 2021 and June 30th 2022 (or 6.5% of turnover)  up 3.3% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €10.2 million for the period ending June 30th 2022  consisting mainly of gains on the disposal of vacant real estate assets  divestments of tangible and intangible assets  and release of provisions related to the disposal of Capio's business in Germany. From July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  other non-current income and expenses represented a net expense of €21.4 million.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €123.5 million for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with €123.2 million the previous year. This includes interest on Senior debt and  in accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €72.3 million related to lease debt (€71.1 million the previous year).The Group’s share of net income for the period from July 1st 2021 to June 30th 2022 amounted to €118.4 million  or 2.8% of turnover  compared with €65.0 million for the period from July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021.Financing :Net financial debt on June 30th 2022 was €3 709.9 million compared with €3 230.5 million on June 30th 2021. Net debt includes €1 763.6 million in non-current borrowings and €35.4 million in current borrowings  offset by €132 5 million in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to operating leases contributed €2 118.3 million to net financial debt at June 30th  of which €1 922.3 million was non-current lease debt and €196.0 million was current lease debt.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a Euro Private Placement bond issue for a total financing amount of €100 million on two tranches maturing in 2027 and 2028.During the second half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé has drawn €100 million from its revolving credit facility which was then fully repaid before 30 June 2022. The Group complies with all commitments relating to the financing documentation in place. The application of IFRS 16 has no effect on the methods used to calculate the financial aggregates referred to in these debt agreements.Subsequent events :Extension of the 2022 revenue guarantee – 24 A ugust 2022 decreeThe French government has issued a decree on 24 August 2022 modifying the 10 May 2022 decree related to the revenue guarantee in favour of healthcare facilities in order to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic for 2022. The 24 August 2022 decree extends the 2022 revenue guarantee to 31 December 2022: terms of the initial decree 10 May 2022 are modified to cover a 12-months period ending 31 December 2022  the mechanism of the scheme being otherwise maintained.Additional €150 million funding within the Fiducie SûretéRamsay Santé has concluded an additional €150 million loan agreement within its Fiducie Sûreté (created in 2018) becoming one of the largest Fiducies-Sûreté (€318 million in cumulative outstanding loans) in the French market and the first one indexed to ESG criteria.Immobilière de Santé  the main holding company for the equity and/or real estate assets of Ramsay Santé  leader in private hospitalization and primary care in Europe  has entered into an additional loan agreement (Tranche 3) for a principal amount of €150 million.

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover - London vs. Hong Kong 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongFine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The roll-out of acceptance of UPI-powered Apps and RuPay Cards across Europe is important to us  as we expect increased mobility of Indians across the continent in the coming years.“We believe this partnership will empower Indian consumers to continue using their preferred payment modes as they travel across Europe.”UPI and RuPay paymentsUnder the partnership  Worldline’s QR code-based mechanism will allow merchants’ POS systems in Europe to accept UPI payments from Indians using their mobile phones. Later  Indians will also be able to use RuPay debit and credit cards for their payments in Europe.Marc-Henri Desportes  Deputy CEO of Worldline  said of the initiative: “Our analyses of international customers’ payment behaviour have indicated a push away from international card schemes in recent times  and a preference for any mobile payment method with which they are acquainted. Our partnership with NPCI International seeks to mitigate the risk of excluding or limiting Indian customers from safely using electronic payments in the EU.”This latest tie-up is a further extension of NIPL’s efforts to take UPI into international markets. In September last year  NIPL signed an agreement with Singapore’s Liquid Group to enable UPI QR-based payments in 10 countries.In July this year  Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnav said that India is in talks with 30 countries regarding UPI and three countries—France  UAE  and Singapore—have already signed a Memorandum of Understanding.The collaboration between NIPL and Worldline will see the latter become the first EU acquirer to offer Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay  two products of the National Payments Company of India (NPCI)  to European merchants whilst providing an opportunity for them to build on their Indian customer base.Currently  customers from India pay through international card networks. However  the hugely popular United Payments Interface allows multiple bank accounts to be accessed through one single mobile application. This  in turn  will enhance the customer experience whilst opening up new business prospects for merchants.Facilitated via Worldline QR  the company’s universal product for the acceptance of all QR-based payments  the first target markets for NIPL are set to include BENELUX and Switzerland  with further plans for expansion  as Worldline QR is rolled out in more European countries.Prior to the pandemic  India was one of the most important tourist markets for Europe  with an estimated 1 crore Indians travelling to the region each year.

It will sell 374 new shares for every three existing shares.The Italian government  the bank's controlling shareholder with a 64.23% stake  will be contributing up to EUR1.61 billion.
