The Shanghai-based firm also warned it may face a similar outcome on offshore debt  after blaming a long Chinese public holiday for delaying payments.The default is particularly worrying because CIFI was considered a barometer for the broader success of a new rescue effort by Beijing to use state guarantees to help a select group of developers access domestic funding. The builder’s payment struggles also serve as a reminder of the uphill battle that Chinese leaders face to revitalize a key economic engine  as they gear up for a major Communist Party congress starting in three days.“It’s just another surprise for investors  who are becoming increasingly skeptical about any private developer ” said Charles Macgregor  head of Asia at Lucror Analytics. “It’s really too late for authorities to support the sector now ” he added  saying confidence among homebuyers and creditors appears “terminally eroded.”Since a default in December by China Evergrande Group  the nation’s property industry has seen a record wave of bond failures fueled by private developers with limited access to a banking sector dominated by state lenders.CIFI’s latest payment setback has extended a selloff in the shares of Chinese developers  with a Bloomberg Intelligence gauge falling as much as 2.6% Thursday and poised for its sixth-straight daily loss. China high-yield dollar notes  dominated by developers  also weakened  according to traders  pushing a Bloomberg index back toward August’s record low.Story continuesWhile the builder’s Hong Kong-listed shares plunged 12%  those of Country Garden Holdings Co.  China’s top developer by contracted sales  also slumped 11% in a sign of contagion to even bigger rivals. Country Garden’s 6.5% dollar bond due 2024 was down 3.5 cents at 26.7 cents as of 5:56 p.m. in Hong Kong  according to Bloomberg-compiled prices  on pace for an all-time low.The Shanghai-based builder of residential projects and shopping malls failed to deliver interest payment on a 6.95% Hong Kong dollar convertible note originally due Oct. 8  the bond’s trustee said in a notice dated Tuesday to Euroclear  one of the world’s top clearing houses. China Construction Bank (Asia) Corp.  the trustee  said the payment miss constitutes an event of default.CIFI didn’t respond to Bloomberg News’ request seeking comment. In a Thursday filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange  the company said it has experienced a delay in remittance of cash offshore to meet scheduled interest and amortization payments due to the recent long public holiday in China.The developer added that it has been proactively engaging with creditors to address the issue in a bid to reach consensual solutions  adding that its commercial operations remain normal. However  CIFI also warned that if it doesn’t meet its offshore debt obligations in a timely manner or is unable to implement appropriate consensual solutions with creditors  “events of default may occur.”Separately  two holders of the Shanghai-based developer’s 4.375% dollar note due 2027 said earlier they have yet to receive coupon payment originally due Wednesday for the note. The investors asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.“CIFI’s default on the convertible bond may make investors nervous and spread the concern on other quality private developers that have issued state-backed guarantee bonds ” said Willer Chen  an analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd.CIFI’s convertible bond in question had HK$88 million ($11.2 million) of interest due Oct. 8  while coupon on the firm’s dollar note due 2027 totals $9.14 million  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Chinese builder has a 30-day grace period to make the interest payment for the dollar note before an event of default can be declared  according to the note’s offering circular.In yet another sign of depressed housing demand  some local governments in China are buying homes in bulk from developers or encouraging state-owned entities to do so in their latest efforts to prop up the real-estate market  the Securities Times reported Thursday.Meanwhile  the International Monetary Fund this week painted a bleak picture of how China’s housing slump may morph into a banking crisis. In its global financial-stability report  the IMF’s analysis showed that 45% of developers might not be able to cover their debt obligations with earnings  and 20% of them could become insolvent if their inventory value is marked to current property prices.In one scenario  15% of small banks may go under  according to the IMF.©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.01,0.82,0.17,mixed,0.03,0.08,0.89,True,English,"['Evergrande Snares State-Aided CIFI', 'China Debt Crisis', 'Hong Kong dollar convertible bond', '6.95% Hong Kong dollar convertible note', 'major Communist Party congress', 'recent long public holiday', 'Hong Kong stock exchange', 'long Chinese public holiday', 'Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd', 'Country Garden Holdings Co.', 'China high-yield dollar notes', 'deepening property debt crisis', 'CIFI Holdings Group Co.', 'other quality private developers', 'new rescue effort', 'key economic engine', 'sixth-straight daily loss', 'state-backed guarantee bonds', '30-day grace period', 'International Monetary Fund', 'global financial-stability report', 'Hong Kong-listed shares', 'top clearing houses', 'current property prices', 'Bloomberg Intelligence gauge', 'Bloomberg News’ request', 'appropriate consensual solutions', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'China Evergrande Group', 'China Construction Bank', 'offshore debt obligations', 'The Shanghai-based firm', 'latest payment setback', 'The Shanghai-based builder', '6.5% dollar bond', '4.375% dollar note', 'select group', 'property industry', 'banking crisis', 'Chinese leaders', 'Bloomberg-compiled prices', 'latest efforts', 'Shanghai-based developer', 'Asia) Corp.', 'top developer', 'bond defaulters', 'bond failures', 'Chinese builder', 'Chinese developers', 'payment struggles', 'payment miss', 'state backing', 'expanding list', 'similar outcome', 'broader success', 'state guarantees', 'uphill battle', 'three days', 'Charles Macgregor', 'Lucror Analytics', 'limited access', 'state lenders', 'Bloomberg index', 'bigger rivals', 'residential projects', 'shopping malls', 'Thursday filing', 'commercial operations', 'timely manner', 'two holders', 'Willer Chen', 'offering circular', 'housing demand', 'local governments', 'state-owned entities', 'real-estate market', 'Securities Times', 'housing slump', 'inventory value', 'one scenario', 'small banks', 'interest payment', 'scheduled interest', 'domestic funding', 'record wave', 'banking sector', 'amortization payments', 'coupon payment', 'scrutiny', 'Beijing', 'reminder', 'surprise', 'investors', 'head', 'authorities', 'confidence', 'homebuyers', 'creditors', 'December', 'selloff', 'traders', 'August', 'Story', 'sales', 'sign', 'contagion', '26.7 cents', 'pace', 'trustee', 'notice', 'Euroclear', 'world', 'event', 'comment', 'company', 'delay', 'remittance', 'cash', 'issue', 'bid', 'matter', 'concern', 'analyst', 'question', 'data', 'homes', 'bulk', 'picture', 'IMF', 'analysis', 'earnings', '5:56']",2022-10-13,2022-10-14,finance.yahoo.com

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover - London vs. Hong Kong 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongFine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Why? Because banks need to determine their Green Asset Ratio to publish to the European regulator. The due diligence is burdensome  estimated at a €2.5 billion compliance costs over the next 5 years.”A pillar of this process involves capturing the “right kind of data” to ensure that the reports Greenomy generates for banks are robust and avoid greenwashing via manipulated or inaccurate data.“We don't want proxy data. Lots of data is being computed in the industry  approximated by the sources and that don’t come directly from corporates.“Yet  the regulation mandates authenticated data at the source  so  we go to the source and collect the data directly from corporates. Our audit portal allows the auditors of that corporate to verify that the data is plausible and correct. Once this is completed  the EU Taxonomy alignment report of that corporate is ready and can be disseminated to the regulator  banks or investors.”The fintech offers 4 cloud-based  interconnected portals which are customised to the reporting requirements of banks  corporates  investment managers  and soon insurance providers.Euroclear invested in Greenomy in January this year (for an undisclosed amount)  bringing the fintech’s reporting services to its network.Vandenreydt noted that Greenomy is particularly happy to be welcomed to the Euroclear family as this “market play” feeds into the fintech’s ambitions to mutualise the data it is capturing.He added that the more banks using the platform  the sooner and easier companies will be able to mutualise efforts and fulfil their regulatory obligations. Banks will also have the benefit of leveraging this corporate data for their own internal risk management  credit rating and other activities.Greenomy currently has 12 banks connected to the infrastructure  and is in the process of selecting partner banks  credit institutions or CSDs across Europe that will allow its members to onboard and assess hundreds or thousands of corporates quickly - rather than becoming bogged down in a process of assessing one corporate at a time.“Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future. Financial service providers have a huge job to play in financing that transition. Banks need to come in and help corporates measure their sustainability  financing them and being their partner in the green transition. I think it’s a huge opportunity for the banks to profile themselves as assisting the transition to a real economy.”Later in the afternoon  Greenomy’s CEO Alexander Stevens pitched on the SWIFT Innotribe stage  taking first place in the category of sustainability. “It is a great honour to get the validation of our sustainability mission by major market infrastructures. We look forward to collaborating with SWIFT and its community.”,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.0,mixed,0.59,0.08,0.33,True,English,"['Swift Innotribe', 'sustainability winner', 'Sibos', 'Spotlight', 'Greenomy', 'EU Taxonomy alignment report', 'corporates’ sustainable finance reporting', 'chief strategy officer', '€2.5 billion compliance costs', '4 cloud-based, interconnected portals', 'internal risk management', 'CEO Alexander Stevens', 'Sibos Discover stage', 'Green Asset Ratio', 'Financial service providers', 'major market infrastructures', 'SWIFT Innotribe stage', 'sustainable future', 'main stage', 'reporting requirements', 'reporting services', 'insurance providers', 'market play', 'hot minute', 'onerous obligation', 'European firms', 'ESG performance', 'loan book', 'due diligence', 'next 5 years', 'right kind', 'audit portal', 'investment managers', 'undisclosed amount', 'easier companies', 'regulatory obligations', 'credit rating', 'other activities', 'credit institutions', 'huge job', 'huge opportunity', 'real economy', 'first place', 'great honour', 'green transition', 'European regulator', 'Euroclear family', 'one corporate', '2,500 data points', 'ESG data', 'inaccurate data', 'proxy data', 'Fabian Vandenreydt', 'ESG-focused fintech', 'corporate data', 'sustainability mission', 'partner banks', '12 banks', 'Finextra', 'pitch', 'Greenomy', 'plan', 'line', 'SFDR', 'CSRD/NFRD', 'tens', 'thousands', 'capturing', 'generation', 'submission', 'regulators', '3,000 counterparties', '3,000 corporations', 'pillar', 'process', 'reports', 'greenwashing', 'Lots', 'industry', 'sources', 'regulation', 'auditors', 'investors', 'January', 'network', 'ambitions', 'platform', 'efforts', 'benefit', 'CSDs', 'members', 'hundreds', 'time', 'financing', 'afternoon', 'category', 'validation', 'community']",2022-10-13,2022-10-14,finextra.com

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover - London vs. Hong Kong 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongFine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales.

Eutelsat and key OneWeb shareholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 20…,"Eutelsat strategy update on the proposed combination with OneWebby Staff WritersLondon  UK (SPX) Oct 13  2022Eutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL) has hosted a Strategic Update on the proposed combination with OneWeb  announced in July 2022.Eutelsat and key OneWeb shareholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2022  with a view to combining Eutelsat and OneWeb in an all-share transaction  whereby Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders will each hold 50% of the Eutelsat shares2. The proposed combination represents a transformational transaction aimed at creating a global leader particularly well positioned to capture the fast-growing Satellite Connectivity market by offering the first global combined GEO/LEO infrastructure.The combination represents the logical next step in Eutelsat and OneWeb's growing cooperation since Eutelsat's initial investment in OneWeb in April 2021  which paved the way for major commercial distribution partnerships and multiple joint technical initiatives  including common workstreams to shape the next generation systems for hybrid GEO/LEO infrastructure. Following completion of the combination  Eutelsat and OneWeb will begin working together on the design of OneWeb's future Gen 2 constellation.In this context  both Eutelsat and OneWeb are convinced that the time is right to take their partnership to the next level via the proposed combination  which will:+ accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb's fleet as it enters the final stages of its global deployment;+ jointly address customer needs  initially through bundled services for some customers  from day one  while working together on the optimal combined solutions to address and expand future use-cases;+ capture opex savings upstream and maximise operating efficiencies at an early stage  and;+ maximise capex savings through the early  joint design of OneWeb Gen 2 as part of a combined GEO/LEO infrastructure  delivering significant savings compared to any potential LEO new entrant.Eva Berneke  CEO of Eutelsat  and Neil Masterson  CEO of OneWeb  said: ""The proposed combination between Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a decisive leap forward for Satellite Connectivity. Eutelsat's initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by a strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity.This belief has intensified as Eutelsat and OneWeb's relationship has deepened  and we are confident that moving to the next level  with a full combination  will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  underpinned by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic. This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb's commercial deployment  and Eutelsat's pivot to Connectivity"".Addressing a significant c. $16bn market opportunityThe Satellite Connectivity market is poised for a period of significant growth  with barriers to adoption relating to bandwidth  latency  pricing  and terminals all reducing  thereby driving market expansion at an unprecedented rate. Between now and 2030 the Satellite Connectivity market is expected to more than triple in value from $4.3bn to c.$16bn.The contribution from NGSO3 is expected to grow c.2.5x faster than the overall market to represent almost 50% of the market by 2030  mostly captured by LEO constellations. Demand growth will be spread across four key verticals: Fixed Data  Government Services  Mobility and Consumer Broadband  all of which can be most optimally addressed by a GEO/LEO combination.Moreover  growth is expected to remain robust beyond 2030  driven by the continuing expansion of existing applications  and technology-driven new use cases.In this context  the global LEO constellation of OneWeb represents a uniquely compelling asset in optimising Eutelsat's competitive position to address this significant market opportunity.OneWeb: A unique NGSO assetOneWeb is currently one of the only two global LEO broadband constellations in service  with secured priority spectrum rights  and already reaping the benefits of its early-mover advantage. Its Gen 1 fleet has already been fully funded and successfully began its entry into service.With almost two-thirds of its launches completed  OneWeb's Gen 1 constellation is already generating revenues above the 50-degrees North latitude and requires only a further two launches to extend its coverage to 25-degrees North  well on track for full global entry into service expected by end-2023. The constellation is delivering a high-quality customer experience  with average global one-way latency of 70ms  download speeds of up to 195Mbps  user terminals adapted for each market and a suite of fully managed connectivity services.OneWeb already has over $600m4 in total contracted revenues  and a risk-weighted pipeline of up to $1.9bn spread across its four key verticals of Enterprise  Government  Aviation and Maritime  underpinned by distribution partnerships with major players in each segment and over 150 customer trials underway. On a standalone basis  OneWeb's revenues are expected to reach euro 50m in FY 2023  euro 150 - 250m in FY 2024  euro 300 - 500m in FY 2025  and to exceed euro 600m in FY 20275.GEO/LEO combination paving the way for significant cost advantage and new revenue opportunitiesAs a combined entity  OneWeb and Eutelsat will work together on the conception of OneWeb's Gen 2 constellation  due to enter service by early 2028. As a follow-on constellation to Gen 1  Gen 2 will benefit from the re-use of existing ground infrastructure  the know-how developed with Gen 1  and already secured priority filings  while also being designed as part of a broader GEO/LEO structure rather than a standalone entity. The cost of Gen 2 will therefore be considerably lower than that of building a constellation from scratch.The combination of OneWeb's LEO constellation with Eutelsat's GEO fleet will create a leading infrastructure which will provide best-in-class solutions across a wide range of applications  while gradually paving the way for new revenue opportunities. Eutelsat and OneWeb have a clear roadmap for the integration of their respective in-orbit and on-ground assets  culminating in a fully integrated GEO/LEO network with the entry into service of OneWeb's Gen 2 by early 2028.Implemented in several stages  it will start by building on the distribution agreements already in place to accelerate up-selling and cross-selling opportunities and offer GEO/LEO packages through a one-stop-shop addressing a range of customer requirements. It will then gradually converge towards a full mutualization of networks enabling an integrated offer with automated routing and a single terminal  for a completely seamless  high-performance experience for customers in the key verticals of Mobility  Government  Enterprise and Consumer Broadband.Related LinksEutelsat CommunicationsThe latest information about the Commercial Satellite IndustryThanks for being there;We need your help.

The new Intelligent Trials Diversity Module will help sponsors and clinical research organizations (CROs) benchmark the diversity of their trials and identify sites that are more successful at enrolling diverse patients. This insight will help bring diversity into the beginning of the feasibility process  all while accelerating trials.Historically  clinical trials have been shown to recruit disproportionately white participants  which raises concerns about the generalizability of trial results to underrepresented patients. New Medidata research* shows that in the past decade 70% of sites did not enroll a single Black participant in Alzheimer’s and lung cancer trials  two diseases that disproportionately affect Black Americans.“ Powering greater diversity is critical for our industry and a priority for Medidata. With this new offering  it is now possible to identify high-performing sites known to recruit diverse patients. This supports more representative outcomes  and promotes much needed equity within clinical research ” said Fareed Melhem  senior vice president  Medidata AI. “ By providing our standardized and analysis-ready demographic and operational data in a study’s planning stages  sponsors and CROs can optimize planning and diversity performance from the start.”Medidata’s Intelligent Trials brings together cross-industry real-time performance metrics  predictive models  and forecasting capabilities to provide a competitive edge in trial planning and execution. With the addition of the Diversity Module  sponsors and CROs can set goals by benchmarking diversity at the study level in the same indication. The new offering will also identify sites that are more successful at recruiting and enrolling diverse individuals based on industry data.Medidata’s research on clinical trial site diversity  based on a sample from more than 28 000 clinical trials across indications and more than 8.5 million patients  is available in the 2022 ASCO Quality Care Symposium abstract titled "" How granularity of data matters in understanding and accelerating racial diversity in U.S. clinical trials "" and in a newly released white paper  “The State of Black Participation in Clinical Trials.” The white paper is the first of a series  with future reports to focus on additional measures of diversity beyond race  such as sex  age  and ethnicity.Medidata’s new Intelligent Trials offering supports the FDA draft guidance to industry  which makes a strong call to action for the enrollment of more participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations in the U.S. into clinical trials. Legislation like the Diverse and Equitable Participation in Clinical Trials (DEPICT) Act  which would mandate the inclusion of diverse populations  also shows the importance for the industry to address this critical issue.*The sample included closed-enrollment  interventional  Phase I-III trials from 2010 to 2021 where race data was collected – encompassing 972 773 patients and 4 003 global trials.Medidata is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Systèmes  which with its 3DEXPERIENCE platform is positioned to lead the digital transformation of life sciences in the age of personalized medicine with the first end-to-end scientific and business platform  from research to commercialization.About MedidataMedidata is leading the digital transformation of life sciences  creating hope for millions of patients.

Overall  three-quarters of Americans report using nutritional or dietary supplements. The vast majority of supplement users continue to be regular users.“This year’s data shows a remarkable picture of continuity and paints the landscape of a vibrant  mainstream industry ” said Brian Wommack  CRN’s senior vice president of communications. “While overall usage is down slightly from its pandemic peak  reported usage of immunity-boosting supplements—including vitamin D  vitamin C  and zinc—is steady from last year.”COVID-19 is no longer top of mind in many consumers’ minds. About half of supplement users (49%) report changing their supplement use since the pandemic began  stable compared to 2021. Looking specifically at whether they have added new supplements or increased their dose  two-thirds of supplement users report doing so  slightly less than last year.Changes in supplement usage have happened across age groups and genders  but declines are more marked among those with lower incomes and among white and Hispanic Americans. Supplement usage remains higher among women  older adults  and those that are more educated and/or have a higher household income.New this year is an increase in specialty supplement usage. More than half of consumers (52%) who take supplements report taking a specialty supplement  the most reported of which are omega-3s  probiotics  melatonin  and fiber.Still the king among supplement users  70% report taking a multivitamin in the past 12 months. Sports and nutrition supplements have seen a significant increase in use since last year  up five points to 39%.Trust in the dietary supplement also remains high. More than three-quarters of Americans (77%) find the industry trustworthy. That number is even higher among supplement users  at 84%.When asked their top motivator for taking dietary supplements  Americans’ top responses are “maintaining my health” and “live healthier/adopt healthier habits.” “This answer is not surprising ” said Wommack. “Data consistently shows supplement users are much more likely to report engaging in healthy behaviors like exercising  eating a balanced diet  visiting their doctor regularly  and regularly getting a good night’s sleep.”Conducted annually since 2000  the CRN Consumer Survey on Dietary Supplements serves as the leading resource for statistics on usage of dietary supplements. The survey was conducted online between August 9-12  2022  among 3 133 U.S. adults age 18+  including 2 342 adults who report consuming dietary supplements seasonally  occasionally  or regularly.For the second year in a row  this year’s survey includes oversamples of Black  Hispanic  and Asian/Pacific Islander respondents to ensure significant sample sizes of supplement users of color to provide deep insights into the groups’ motivations  attitudes  and purchasing habits. The complete set of consumer survey data is available for purchase by both CRN members and nonmembers.About the Council for Responsible NutritionThe Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN)  founded in 1973  is a Washington  D.C.-based trade association representing more than 200 dietary supplement and functional food manufacturers  ingredient suppliers  and companies providing services to those manufacturers and suppliers. In addition to complying with a host of federal and state regulations governing dietary supplements and food in the areas of manufacturing  marketing  quality control and safety  our manufacturer and supplier members also agree to adhere to additional voluntary guidelines as well as to CRN’s Code of Ethics.

The report reveals that positive female representation can be beneficial to brands and highlights creative techniques companies can utilize in their advertising development process to create greater success and stronger relationships with consumers.For the whitepaper  SeeHer and Ipsos sought to better understand the impact of creative and thematic elements used in ads depicting women. Utilizing the Gender Equality Measure® (GEM®) developed by SeeHer  the first data-driven methodology to identify gender bias in media  the two organizations explored how key predictive variables identified by GEM scores drive a variety of marketing measures and business growth. They also used performance metrics  such as brand choice intent and long-term brand relationship  to evaluate the benefits of positive female representation on brands. Connecting the GEM creative drivers’ framework to choice intent and brand relationship metrics allowed Ipsos and SeeHer to build a predictive  data-driven model that can be leveraged to consistently link the accurate portrayal of women and girls to advertising that improves brand preference.Key findings from the whitepaper include:Positive female representation: Elevated portrayals of women are significantly more likely to drive positive business results. Ads that featured females in a positive light performed in the top third of the GEM database  while brands saw the likelihood of short-term sales +24% higher and the likelihood of stronger long-term brand relationships +28% higher.Realistic portrayals of women: Advertising is getting better at showcasing more realistic and nuanced portrayals of women. Females depicted as professionals typically outperformed and received high GEM scores; however  brands still found success when featuring women in traditional roles  including as mothers and wives  when these stories and characters appeared authentic and multi-dimensional.Women pursuing their passions: Women shown as having more agency over their lives drove higher GEM scores  as did ads that depicted women achieving their goals or pursuing their personal passions. These ads provided viewers with positive role models as well as increased favorable perceptions of brands.Lindsay Franke  Head of Creative Excellence  US  Ipsos  said  “Get rid of the notion that you have to choose between doing good and doing well. Ipsos has demonstrated that the positive portrayal of women and girls  as measured by GEM  is significantly predictive of in-market success of advertising. Getting creative right ahead of airing can pay huge dividends.”Latha Sarathy  Chief Research Officer  Association of National Advertisers and EVP  Insights & Measurement  SeeHer added  “This study quantifies the ‘why’ behind GEM  provides a data-driven blueprint for optimizing creative and showcases why GEM testing is so crucial. By uncovering how thematic elements used in ads drive a variety of marketing and business goals  we are helping companies better connect with consumers while more accurately portraying women and girls in media.”“SeeHer developed GEM six years ago to support our mission to eliminate gender bias advertising and media. We are delighted to bring this new dimension of GEM to the market and are especially proud to partner with Ipsos on Strive for More. This powerful whitepaper proves that positively portraying females is not only the right thing to do  but is also good for business ” concluded Jeannine Shao Collins  President  SeeHer  Association of National Advertisers.Ipsos became the first research member of the SeeHer movement  whose members include leading media  marketing  and entertainment companies. To date  Ipsos has collected GEM data on roughly 2 200 ads across the globe.Strive for More can be accessed here.About SeeHerSeeHer is the leading global movement of media  marketing and entertainment leaders committed to the accurate depiction of women and girls in advertising and media.

Shipments increased 48%  following the return of our largest transshipment vessel from scheduled maintenance  and we expect Q4 to be our best quarter of the year for both shipments and production.Pricing for our products increased again in Q3 and our order book for Q4 is largely committed. However  pigment demand weakened through the quarter  affected by Chinese and European market conditions. We expect demand for titanium feedstocks to moderate in 2023  but we believe the fundamentals of our product markets remain robust.Unfortunately  we had a Lost Time Injury (LTI) in late September. Prior to this we had almost 12 million LTI-free hours worked at the Moma Mine  which is a testament to the commitment of the team on site to achieving an industry-leading safety performance.”Q3 2022 overviewLost Time Injury Frequency rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: 0.08)  with one Lost Time Injury (“LTI”) recorded during the quarterHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes and a 2% increase in ore gradesIlmenite production of 304 700 tonnes  a 3% decrease compared to the record production in Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes)  but up 25% on Q2 2022 (242 900 tonnes)Primary zircon production of 17 300 tonnes  a 10% increase compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveriesProduction of all finished products is anticipated to be at or around the bottom of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance ranges. Total cash operating cost guidance is expected to be at the top of the guidance range principally due to inflationary pressuresTotal shipments of finished products of 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity as a result of the Bronagh J transshipment vessel being in dry dock until late August and poor weather conditionsHigher ilmenite prices achieved in Q3 2022 and contracts in place for the majority of Q4 sales  despite weaker demand for titanium pigment from China and EuropeDemand for Kenmare’s zircon products remained strong in Q3 and this is continuing in Q4  supported by supply constraints  although the global zircon market is showing signs of weakness  particularly in ChinaStory continuesOperations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2022 were as follows:Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2022 Q2 2022 tonnes tonnes % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 424 000 10 084 000 3% 10 070 000 4% Grade1 4.95% 4.83% 2% 4.23% 17% Production HMC production 443 900 413 400 7% 353 600 26% HMC processed 440 500 426 800 3% 367 300 20% Ilmenite 304 700 314 400 -3% 242 900 25% Primary zircon 17 300 15 700 10% 13 600 27% Rutile 2 600 2 700 -4% 2 100 24% Concentrates2 13 000 11 900 9% 9 800 33% Shipments 285 600 322 600 -11% 192 800 48%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling LTIFR for the 12 months to 30 September 2022 was 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked (30 September 2021: 0.08)  with one LTI recorded in Q3 2022. The previous LTI was on 6 January 2021 and as such  Kenmare had achieved over 11.8 million LTI-free hours worked to late September.HMC production was 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due primarily to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes to 10.4 million tonnes (Q3 2021: 10.1 million tonnes)  driven by a strong performance at Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) B. Mitigation measures to reduce the impact of high slimes also benefitted production in Q3. HMC production increased by 26% compared to Q2 2022 (353 600 tonnes).Ore grades increased by 2% in Q3 2022 to 4.95% compared to Q3 2021 (4.83%) and by 17% compared to Q2 2022 (4.23%)  supported by improved performance from WCP B in the Pilivili ore zone.Ilmenite production in Q3 2022 was 304 700 tonnes  returning to an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum. It decreased by 3% compared to Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes) but represented a 25% improvement on Q2 2022. There was some magnetic intermediate stock build-up during Q3  reflecting the difference between HMC processed and ilmenite produced.Primary zircon production was 17 300 tonnes in Q3 2022  up 10% compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveries. However  rutile production was 2 600 tonnes  down 4% on Q3 2021 (2 700 tonnes) due to lower recoveries and stock build-up. Concentrates production was 13 000 tonnes  up 9% on Q3 2021 (11 900 tonnes)  driven by robust mineral sands concentrate production.As a result of the stronger production in Q3 2022  following weaker than anticipated production in H1  Kenmare expects production of finished products to be at or around the bottom of its 2022 guidance ranges. Operating costs are expected to be at the top of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance range  principally due to inflationary pressures  and unit costs will be a function of the lower production volumes and higher operating costs.As previously announced  one of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Bronagh J  left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work  reducing significantly Kenmare’s shipping capacity in Q2 and Q3 2022. The Bronagh J returned to site on 25 August and shipping volumes increased significantly in September. Typically  Q4 is the strongest quarter of the year for shipments due to seasonally favourable weather conditions; and  with both vessels now in operation  finished product inventories are expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.Total shipments in Q3 2022 were 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity and poor weather conditions. Shipments comprised 246 900 tonnes of ilmenite  18 400 tonnes of primary zircon  5 300 tonnes of rutile and 14 900 tonnes of concentrates. Shipments also increased by 48% compared to Q2 2022.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2022 was 12 700 tonnes  compared to 9 200 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2022 was 267 000 tonnes  compared to 214 900 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022  reflecting the lower shipping capacity and the poor weather conditions limiting loading.Capital projects updateWork is continuing on the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for the Nataka ore zone  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. The PFS is expected to be completed in late 2022 and a market update will be provided in Q1 2023. The Environmental Impact Assessment is progressing well  with the first round of public consultation completed.As part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. Some elements of the PFS are significantly advanced; so work towards the Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) has commenced in those areas  including on the desliming circuit. Results for this part of the DFS are expected in Q1 2023 and  on an accelerated timeline  the installation of the desliming circuit at WCP A could occur in 2024.Market updateKenmare achieved a stronger sales performance in Q3 2022  supported by increased shipment volumes and higher prices for its ilmenite and zircon products. Q3 represented the eighth consecutive quarter of ilmenite price increases. Kenmare also shipped more higher value products in the third quarter than in Q1 and Q2 2022.Despite Kenmare’s stronger sales performance  global demand for titanium pigment was lower in Q3 resulting in a moderation in pigment production. The Chinese pigment market was the first to soften  as COVID-19 lockdowns and a slower property market dampened demand  and this trend continued throughout Q3. European demand for pigment also decreased during the quarter  driven by a lower outlook for economic growth and high energy costs. Notwithstanding this  Kenmare continued to see resilient demand from its existing customers  benefitting from strong demand from the ilmenite beneficiation market. Growing titanium metal production in China also continues to support import demand for titanium feedstocks.The supply of titanium feedstocks has continued to increase  primarily from Chinese producers in Mozambique and producers in the USA. However  a weaker iron ore market in China has resulted in lower production of ilmenite as a by-product from producers in China  which is helping to balance the market.A weaker pigment market is likely to impact demand for ilmenite in Q4. However  Kenmare has contracts in place for the majority of its expected sales in the quarter  with pricing continuing to be strong as high-quality ilmenite remains in short supply.Although demand for Kenmare’s zircon products remains robust  the zircon market has been exhibiting similar dynamics to the pigment market. Demand in China is weak and European ceramics producers have been impacted by higher energy costs. Prices in the spot market in China moved significantly above prices in the rest of the world but have declined in recent weeks  and this will result in lower prices for Kenmare’s concentrates products sold to China. However  zircon supply remains constrained and prices outside of China are stable  which benefits Kenmare as the majority of its primary zircon is sold in Europe.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

This growth was driven in particular by the dynamic momentum of the animation and expansion of all product offerings;The activity of the Local Authorities division in the Q4 was down compared with financial year 2020/2021  mainly because deliveries were brought forward to the Q3. For the year overall  performance was consistent with the previous financial year.Given the current inflationary and uncertain context  the Group will devote its best efforts to mitigating any impacts  all while remaining focused on the implementation of its development strategy. This strategy will notably involve expanding its offering of responsible products and services  its storage capacities  as well as strengthening its hybrid business model  combining digital  personalized omnichannel customer approach and operational agility that is necessary in the current context.*********************About the Manutan GroupA family-run business created in 1966  Manutan is one of Europe’s leading B2B e-commerce companies specialized in the distribution of equipment and supplies  thanks to a model that allies the strengths of digital to a human ambition.Its vast range of carefully selected products and services enables its customers – be they in the private sector  the public sector  or the trade – to operate efficiently and sustainably on a daily basis  along with the implementation of a purchasing optimization strategy.With 27 subsidiaries established in 17 countries in Europe  the Group has more than 2 200 employees and a turnover of 820 million euros in 2020/2021.

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover - London vs. Hong Kong 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongFine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYThis month  the structured debt market has been significantly impacted by the “liquidity” crunch resultating in the Volta net asset value (“NAV”) declining by -7.2%  totally reversing the +7.2% NAV uplift seen in July/August.Examining the underlying sub asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +1.3% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -5.6% for CLO equity tranches; -8.7% for CLO debt; and -0.2% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.3% of NAV).It is our view that the downdraft in pricing in the second half of September is the direct result of many investors having to face huge margin calls from currency hedging and/or from synthetic duration management (LDI: Liability Driven Investing) and becoming forced sellers in order to generat cash  in a context of new record high currency and interest rates volatility.Volta avoided needing to raise cash through selling assets at distressed prices as it accumulated sufficient cash in August.In the CLO markets  we saw a spike in BWIC lists (Bids Wanted In Competition) sometimes with very a very short time response window (less than a few hours); the usual practice  in normal market conditions  is to ask for bids for the next day.As a consequence  CLO debt prices in particular have been temporarily depressed even though there was still almost no trade regarding CLO equity tranches as the vast majority of the BWIC was for AAA or AA tranches of CLO debts with a high focus on European CLO debt.Looking at fundamentals  as expected  in September there have been more downgrades of loans than upgrades but the overall quantum is still relatively low. There has been no significant increase in the proportion of CCC loans in CLOs and the CLO loan default rate remains very low (0.4% in Europe and 0.9% in the US for the last 12 months).For the next month the focus will be on earnings publication for Q3 2022 but the overall outlook is not expected to change: we continue to expect for next year an increase in loan market default rates but not to a level that is would cause diversion of cash flows for CLO Equity positions in 2023. Volta is expected to receive in October all its cash flows from its CLO Equity position. We expect to continue to generate a high level of coupons we are looking to seize investment opportunities from the current liquidity crisis.Last week we opened a European CLO Warehouse. No loans have yet been purchased but we expect to purchase some loans in the coming weeks/months at significant discount in order to form  later on  a very profitable CLO Equity position from this warehouse.In September  Volta received the equivalent of €0.8m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended September 2022  Volta received €24m interest and coupons representing a 22.4% annualized cash flow to NAV.As at the end of September 2022  Volta’s NAV was €212.3m or €5.80 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 7.2% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.0% as at 31 August 2022  5.7% was at 31 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Shipments increased 48%  following the return of our largest transshipment vessel from scheduled maintenance  and we expect Q4 to be our best quarter of the year for both shipments and production.Pricing for our products increased again in Q3 and our order book for Q4 is largely committed. However  pigment demand weakened through the quarter  affected by Chinese and European market conditions. We expect demand for titanium feedstocks to moderate in 2023  but we believe the fundamentals of our product markets remain robust.Unfortunately  we had a Lost Time Injury (LTI) in late September. Prior to this we had almost 12 million LTI-free hours worked at the Moma Mine  which is a testament to the commitment of the team on site to achieving an industry-leading safety performance.”Q3 2022 overviewLost Time Injury Frequency rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 September 2022 (30 September 2021: 0.08)  with one Lost Time Injury (“LTI”) recorded during the quarterHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes and a 2% increase in ore gradesIlmenite production of 304 700 tonnes  a 3% decrease compared to the record production in Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes)  but up 25% on Q2 2022 (242 900 tonnes)Primary zircon production of 17 300 tonnes  a 10% increase compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveriesProduction of all finished products is anticipated to be at or around the bottom of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance ranges. Total cash operating cost guidance is expected to be at the top of the guidance range principally due to inflationary pressuresTotal shipments of finished products of 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity as a result of the Bronagh J transshipment vessel being in dry dock until late August and poor weather conditionsHigher ilmenite prices achieved in Q3 2022 and contracts in place for the majority of Q4 sales  despite weaker demand for titanium pigment from China and EuropeDemand for Kenmare’s zircon products remained strong in Q3 and this is continuing in Q4  supported by supply constraints  although the global zircon market is showing signs of weakness  particularly in ChinaOperations updateOperational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2022 were as follows:Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2022 Q2 2022 tonnes tonnes % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 424 000 10 084 000 3% 10 070 000 4% Grade1 4.95% 4.83% 2% 4.23% 17% Production HMC production 443 900 413 400 7% 353 600 26% HMC processed 440 500 426 800 3% 367 300 20% Ilmenite 304 700 314 400 -3% 242 900 25% Primary zircon 17 300 15 700 10% 13 600 27% Rutile 2 600 2 700 -4% 2 100 24% Concentrates2 13 000 11 900 9% 9 800 33% Shipments 285 600 322 600 -11% 192 800 48%Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses.

The previous LTI was on 6 January 2021 and as such  Kenmare had achieved over 11.8 million LTI-free hours worked to late September.HMC production was 443 900 tonnes in Q3 2022  a 7% increase compared to Q3 2021 (413 400 tonnes)  due primarily to a 3% increase in excavated ore volumes to 10.4 million tonnes (Q3 2021: 10.1 million tonnes)  driven by a strong performance at Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) B. Mitigation measures to reduce the impact of high slimes also benefitted production in Q3. HMC production increased by 26% compared to Q2 2022 (353 600 tonnes).Ore grades increased by 2% in Q3 2022 to 4.95% compared to Q3 2021 (4.83%) and by 17% compared to Q2 2022 (4.23%)  supported by improved performance from WCP B in the Pilivili ore zone.Ilmenite production in Q3 2022 was 304 700 tonnes  returning to an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum. It decreased by 3% compared to Q3 2021 (314 400 tonnes) but represented a 25% improvement on Q2 2022. There was some magnetic intermediate stock build-up during Q3  reflecting the difference between HMC processed and ilmenite produced.Primary zircon production was 17 300 tonnes in Q3 2022  up 10% compared to Q3 2021 (15 700 tonnes)  benefitting from increased HMC processed and improved recoveries. However  rutile production was 2 600 tonnes  down 4% on Q3 2021 (2 700 tonnes) due to lower recoveries and stock build-up. Concentrates production was 13 000 tonnes  up 9% on Q3 2021 (11 900 tonnes)  driven by robust mineral sands concentrate production.As a result of the stronger production in Q3 2022  following weaker than anticipated production in H1  Kenmare expects production of finished products to be at or around the bottom of its 2022 guidance ranges. Operating costs are expected to be at the top of Kenmare’s 2022 guidance range  principally due to inflationary pressures  and unit costs will be a function of the lower production volumes and higher operating costs.As previously announced  one of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Bronagh J  left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work  reducing significantly Kenmare’s shipping capacity in Q2 and Q3 2022. The Bronagh J returned to site on 25 August and shipping volumes increased significantly in September. Typically  Q4 is the strongest quarter of the year for shipments due to seasonally favourable weather conditions; and  with both vessels now in operation  finished product inventories are expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.Total shipments in Q3 2022 were 285 600 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to Q3 2021 (322 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity and poor weather conditions. Shipments comprised 246 900 tonnes of ilmenite  18 400 tonnes of primary zircon  5 300 tonnes of rutile and 14 900 tonnes of concentrates. Shipments also increased by 48% compared to Q2 2022.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2022 was 12 700 tonnes  compared to 9 200 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2022 was 267 000 tonnes  compared to 214 900 tonnes at the end of Q2 2022  reflecting the lower shipping capacity and the poor weather conditions limiting loading.Capital projects updateWork is continuing on the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for the Nataka ore zone  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. The PFS is expected to be completed in late 2022 and a market update will be provided in Q1 2023. The Environmental Impact Assessment is progressing well  with the first round of public consultation completed.As part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. Some elements of the PFS are significantly advanced; so work towards the Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) has commenced in those areas  including on the desliming circuit. Results for this part of the DFS are expected in Q1 2023 and  on an accelerated timeline  the installation of the desliming circuit at WCP A could occur in 2024.Market updateKenmare achieved a stronger sales performance in Q3 2022  supported by increased shipment volumes and higher prices for its ilmenite and zircon products. Q3 represented the eighth consecutive quarter of ilmenite price increases. Kenmare also shipped more higher value products in the third quarter than in Q1 and Q2 2022.Despite Kenmare’s stronger sales performance  global demand for titanium pigment was lower in Q3 resulting in a moderation in pigment production. The Chinese pigment market was the first to soften  as COVID-19 lockdowns and a slower property market dampened demand  and this trend continued throughout Q3. European demand for pigment also decreased during the quarter  driven by a lower outlook for economic growth and high energy costs. Notwithstanding this  Kenmare continued to see resilient demand from its existing customers  benefitting from strong demand from the ilmenite beneficiation market. Growing titanium metal production in China also continues to support import demand for titanium feedstocks.The supply of titanium feedstocks has continued to increase  primarily from Chinese producers in Mozambique and producers in the USA. However  a weaker iron ore market in China has resulted in lower production of ilmenite as a by-product from producers in China  which is helping to balance the market.A weaker pigment market is likely to impact demand for ilmenite in Q4. However  Kenmare has contracts in place for the majority of its expected sales in the quarter  with pricing continuing to be strong as high-quality ilmenite remains in short supply.Although demand for Kenmare’s zircon products remains robust  the zircon market has been exhibiting similar dynamics to the pigment market. Demand in China is weak and European ceramics producers have been impacted by higher energy costs. Prices in the spot market in China moved significantly above prices in the rest of the world but have declined in recent weeks  and this will result in lower prices for Kenmare’s concentrates products sold to China. However  zircon supply remains constrained and prices outside of China are stable  which benefits Kenmare as the majority of its primary zircon is sold in Europe.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Fine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

In Sweden  we have continued to shoulder significant responsibility both in the care of COVID patients and in limiting the effects of the pandemic on individuals and society. For example  approximately 600 000 doses of COVID vaccine were administered to patients  in our Swedish facilities in particular to our nursing home residents. In addition  we continued to manage almost 20% of all COVID-related hospital care in the Stockholm area.Growth was strong in the 3 Nordic countries  particularly in Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) hospitalisations  up 14% on the previous year  excluding Germany. Consultations in primary care centres in Sweden  including teleconsultations  were up 16%. In France  full MSO inpatient hospital admissions fell by 4.1%  while day patient admissions rose by 3%. The same trend affects our Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR) activity with a 1.1% drop in inpatients and a 27.6% increase in day patients.Total investments for the period amounted to €217 million compared with €220 million last year. More than 40% of investments correspond to growth and digital investments. These investments are necessary to uphold our operational and medical excellence. The number of primary care centres has increased by 28% from 130 to 167 in 2022. We have opened our first 5 primary care centres in France and invested in 2 new surgical robots. We have also established capital and operational partnerships with the Resilience and NewCard start-ups. In January 2022  we launched Ramsay Services  a digital platform.Reported annual turnover is €4 301 million  up 6.9%. Adjusted for changes in the scope of consolidation and at constant exchange rates  turnover for the year ending June 30th 2022 is up with very solid organic turnover growth of 6.0%.Reported EBITDA increased by 2.3% to €658.4 million (prior year €643.8 million) with a margin of 15.3% (prior year 16.0%). EBITDA development was positively impacted by activity in Nordic countries  which compensated for increases in inflation and personnel costs. The revenue guarantee system put in place by the French government generated €99 million in income for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with an income of €103 million for the year ending June 30th 2021.Reported EBITDA increased by 2.3% to €658.4 million (prior year €643.8 million) with a margin of 15.3% (prior year 16.0%).

The revenue guarantee system put in place by the French government generated €99 million in income for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with an income of €103 million for the year ending June 30th 2021. The group share of net profit is €118.4 million  benefiting from the increase in activity and improved results  representing 2.8% of turnover.Net financial debt at the end of June 30th 2022 amounts to €3 710 million  including €2 118 million of IFRS 16 liabilities.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“In 2022  for the first time  Ramsay Santé exceeded the threshold of 10 million patients treated in Europe in its various activities  within and outside its facilities  as well as in digital. During the year  the Group mobilised more than ever for the care of Covid patients  and reinforced its ability to treat all patients for all pathologies. In France  our commitment is reflected in the fact that 10% of patients admitted are beneficiaries of Universal Medical Coverage (CMU). The Group has also taken an innovative approach to human resources in France with the signing of an ambitious agreement on quality of life in the workplace. Financial results remain solid  with growth of 6.9% and a slightly lower EBITDA margin (15.3% under IFRS16 in 2022 vs. 16.0% in 2021). These results are due to sustained organic growth as well as acquisitions in Sweden  Norway and Denmark.

Like other hospital operators  Ramsay Santé has continued to be supported by measures implemented by the government. The main measures during the period concern:The revenue guaranteeGrants compensating for additional costs related to COVIDThe revenue guarantee covered the entire financial year for Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) and Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR). It was only in place for the first half of the year (July-December 2021) for Mental Health activities  given the reform of the financing of Mental Health activities (MH) towards an allocation model in force since January 1st 2022.The amount of the funding guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending June 30th 2022 amounts to €99 million (€103 million for the previous year) and is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.In addition to the revenue guarantee  the government also adjusted the levels of grants usually paid to health care institutions in order to compensate for the additional costs related to the COVID crisis that would not otherwise be covered. These subsidies are reported in the income statement under “Other operating income” for €89.8 million (€72.3 million for the previous financial year). Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  a significant portion of the subsidies reported during the period corresponds to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of the same period last year. Of the total amount of funding recognised in the period  €27.5 million (€14.5 million in the previous year) corresponds to amounts received for the funding of additional costs incurred in the previous year.Outside FranceThe Group's facilities in Scandinavia played an active role in the care of COVID patients as well as in screening and vaccinating the population  backing up public institutions and in close collaboration with the supervisory authorities. Nevertheless  activity was impacted by the health crisis during the period  in particular for inpatient care in Sweden but also in Denmark and Norway where the authorities suspended admissions at the height of the spread of the virus from December 2021 to February 2022. Despite these periods of disruption  the overall activity level and profits were strong as activity was boosted during the periods when normal activity resumed.In Sweden  Sankt Göran Hospital and the Group-operated geriatric hospitals in Stockholm played a key role in managing the outbreak with over 100 beds dedicated to COVID patients. Sankt Göran  together with the Stockholm geriatric hospitals  treated almost 20% of all COVID patients in the Stockholm area throughout the pandemic. The Group contributed significantly to the screening and vaccination effort in Sweden and to screening in Norway.Whilst no support measures were implemented in Norway and Denmark  our facilities in Sweden received grants to cover additional operating costs. In total  the amount of aid received by our institutions in Sweden was €32.2 million in the period  compared to €61.5 million in the previous period.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé finalised the acquisition of 10 entities in Scandinavia during the year. These acquisitions are complementary to the current business and expand the scope of the Group's services as well as its geographic footprint. In total  these acquisitions represented a net investment of €288.6 million.Furthermore  Ramsay Santé completed the acquisition of GHP Specialty Care AB (“GHP”) in May 2022  for an enterprise value of €238 million. In the 12 months ending December 2021  GHP's turnover amounted to €137 million. GHP employs 765 FTEs. This acquisition contributed €29 million in turnover and €1.9 million in EBITDA to Ramsay Santé's accounts in the year ended 30 June 2022.Comments on the annual accountsActivity and turnover:In the financial year ending June 30th 2022  Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated turnover of €4 301.0 million  compared with €4 022.6 million for the period from July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  an increase of 6.9%. Please note that the financing guarantee scheme in the Group's accounts has no impact on reported turnover as it is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the Group’s turnover increased by 6.0% with one additional working day.Changes in the scope of consolidation are due to divestment of the German business and two clinics in France in the previous financial year  combined with acquisitions in the Nordic region over the last 12 months.For the financial year ending June 30th 2022  the overall activity of Ramsay Santé’s French entities continued to be impacted by the consequences of the COVID pandemic. The main effects were related to the cancellation of certain scheduled medical and surgical activities during the peaks of the pandemic but also from limiting the number of patients per room. In total  the number of patient admissions increased by 3.2% compared with last year. This increase is mainly related to comparatively lower volumes in 2020-2021  as the negative impact of the COVID pandemic on patients' willingness to access care recedes in our follow-up care  rehabilitation and mental health activities.The variation by business line breaks down as follows:+0.3% in medicine  surgery and obstetrics+23.8% in follow-up care and rehabilitation+11 4% in mental healthAs part of its public service missions  the Group recorded a 16.2% increase in the number of emergency room visits during the past year  with approximately 755 000 visits to our facilities in France.Organic turnover growth in Nordic countries for the year ending June 30th 2022 was +7.4% compared with last year. Organic turnover growth was boosted by both investments and new contracts  additional services related to COVID screening and vaccination  and continued positive turnover growth in the underlying business. Scandinavian business also benefited from the latest acquisitions  which contributed €66 million of additional turnover during the financial year  net of the impact of disposals (German business sold at the end of 2020).Resul ts :EBITDA reached €658.4 million for the financial year ending June 30th 2022  up 2.3% on a reported basis. The Group's EBITDA at 30 June 2022 includes 99.1 million related to the revenue guarantee system described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for COVID surcharges for France and Sweden. EBITDA was also positively impacted by the organic growth of the business  particularly in the Nordic region.The EBITDA margin as a percentage of turnover was 15.3%  compared with 16.0% for the same period last year on a reported basis.Underlying operating profit amounted to €281.1 million between July 1st 2021 and June 30th 2022 (or 6.5% of turnover)  up 3.3% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €10.2 million for the period ending June 30th 2022  consisting mainly of gains on the disposal of vacant real estate assets  divestments of tangible and intangible assets  and release of provisions related to the disposal of Capio's business in Germany. From July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  other non-current income and expenses represented a net expense of €21.4 million.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €123.5 million for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with €123.2 million the previous year. This includes interest on Senior debt and  in accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €72.3 million related to lease debt (€71.1 million the previous year).The Group’s share of net income for the period from July 1st 2021 to June 30th 2022 amounted to €118.4 million  or 2.8% of turnover  compared with €65.0 million for the period from July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021.Financing :Net financial debt on June 30th 2022 was €3 709.9 million compared with €3 230.5 million on June 30th 2021. Net debt includes €1 763.6 million in non-current borrowings and €35.4 million in current borrowings  offset by €132 5 million in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to operating leases contributed €2 118.3 million to net financial debt at June 30th  of which €1 922.3 million was non-current lease debt and €196.0 million was current lease debt.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a Euro Private Placement bond issue for a total financing amount of €100 million on two tranches maturing in 2027 and 2028.During the second half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé has drawn €100 million from its revolving credit facility which was then fully repaid before 30 June 2022. The Group complies with all commitments relating to the financing documentation in place. The application of IFRS 16 has no effect on the methods used to calculate the financial aggregates referred to in these debt agreements.Subsequent events :Extension of the 2022 revenue guarantee – 24 A ugust 2022 decreeThe French government has issued a decree on 24 August 2022 modifying the 10 May 2022 decree related to the revenue guarantee in favour of healthcare facilities in order to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic for 2022. The 24 August 2022 decree extends the 2022 revenue guarantee to 31 December 2022: terms of the initial decree 10 May 2022 are modified to cover a 12-months period ending 31 December 2022  the mechanism of the scheme being otherwise maintained.Additional €150 million funding within the Fiducie SûretéRamsay Santé has concluded an additional €150 million loan agreement within its Fiducie Sûreté (created in 2018) becoming one of the largest Fiducies-Sûreté (€318 million in cumulative outstanding loans) in the French market and the first one indexed to ESG criteria.Immobilière de Santé  the main holding company for the equity and/or real estate assets of Ramsay Santé  leader in private hospitalization and primary care in Europe  has entered into an additional loan agreement (Tranche 3) for a principal amount of €150 million. Arranged by Natixis (advised by CMS Francis Lefebvre Avocats)  the transaction was supported by a pool of lenders composed of various entities of Groupe BPCE  La Banque Postale and BPIFRANCE.This long-term financing  which is intended to finance the general needs of Immobilière de Santé and the Ramsay Santé group  is backed by a fiducie sûreté covering the shares of real estate subsidiaries holding the buildings of 6 private hospitals or clinics  for which Natixis is the trustee.This reloading of our real estate financing vehicle is fully in line with the sustainable development strategy of the Ramsay Santé group on three levels:To diversify and extend the average maturity of its debt at an attractive financing rate in a financial market environment that is currently particularly constrained To continue with the group's strategy of developing our real estate assets  while having a better balance sheet correlation between the asset and liability items of the Ramsay Santé group Continue the efforts of the Group's CSR strategy  which includes an ambitious environmental responsibility component.Reminder of the previous communication relating to the indicative offer received by RHC LimitedRamsay Health Care has published a new press release on 26 september 2022 informing of the end of the discussions with the consortium led by KKR.The full press release issued by Ramsay Health Care Limited can be viewed on the Ramsay Health Care Limited website (www.ramsayhealth.com).About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Alongside these fairs (open to the public …,"PARIS  Oct. 13  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- After the UK posted an overall art auction turnover up 26% for the first semester of 2022 (its best start to the year in three years)  London is hosting Frieze and Frieze Masters. Alongside these fairs (open to the public from 12 to 16 October in Regent's Park) there will of course be several prestige sales in the city. Long the capital of the world's art market  London remains the second biggest marketplace on the planet. But faced with the consequences of Brexit  the rise of Hong Kong  and the digitalization of art  London can no longer take its position for granted.Fine Art auction turnover - London vs. Hong Kong 2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongFine Art auction turnover – London vs. Hong Kong""In the 18th century  London saw the birth of the major auction houses Christie's  Sotheby's  Phillips  and Bonhams"" recalls thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""In the 20th century  New York became the nerve center of an increasingly globalized art market that become substantially more fluid with the arrival of telecommunications  and then later  the Internet. Today  you have masterpieces selling at top prices in Hong Kong  you have Paris hoping to take advantage of the fallout from Brexit  and you have a whole section of the art market heading into Web3 which will further intensify the market's decentralization"".As global competition grows and multiplies  London can count on a rock solid reputation for sales of Old Masters  Modern art  and Post-War art; but it must also assert itself as a center of exchange and innovation for Ultra-Contemporary art. Fueling and fueled by massive price hikes (and the NFT revolution)  this segment has become the primary driving force of the global art market  and Hong Kong's growth has entirely captured this phenomenon.A network of Frieze-branded fairsIn the art world  a synergy generally emerges from a mixture of styles and eras  hence  for example  the incursions of Jeff Koons  Takashi Murakami or Anish Kapoor at the Palace of Versailles. This type of mix also partly explains why galleries like to present young artists alongside the most well-known and recognized names of 20th century art  whose estates they represent. Frieze also plays this card by jointly organizing a fair dedicated to Contemporary Art and another dedicated to Old Masters  putting contemporary creation into an art-historical perspective. Some prestigious galleries  including Continua  Kamel Mennour  and Skarstedt  actually prefer to focus more on the 'past' than on the 'present'  whereas one would have expected the reverse.The Frieze Group has also recognized the advantages of geographical diversification in the premium art market  following in the footsteps of major auction houses. Launched in the early 2000s in the center of the English capital  Frieze was subsequently exported to the USA; first to New York in 2016  then to Los Angeles in 2019. This year  it has been replicated in Asia with the first edition of Frieze Seoul  and can now claim to be the most serious competitor to the MCH group. The latter organizes the prestigious Art Basel fairs in Basel  Miami  Hong Kong  and  very soon  in France  with Paris+ (from 20 to 23 October 2022) at the Grand-Palais Éphémère.London neck and neck with Hong KongIn 2021 Hong Kong ($1.7 billion) was not far behind London ($1.9 billion) in terms of Fine Art auction turnover. But if we look specifically at the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  the comparison is favorable to Hong Kong ($700 million vs. $432 million in London). Asian buyers are driving the prices of Contemporary works faster than anywhere else in the world. Indeed… with just 2 160 Contemporary lots (a third of London's 6 500)  Hong Kong's art auction market posted by far the highest average price for Contemporary artworks on the planet: $325 000 in 2021.2021 auction turnover by period of creation  London vs. Hong KongThe major auction houses appreciate the energy flowing through China's ""Special Administrative Region""  and they are increasingly preferring it to that of the English capital for some of the most emblematic signatures of the 20th and 21st centuries like Jean-Michel Basquiat  Gerhard Richter  and Adrian Ghenie. Indeed the major auction houses' strategy of alternatively offering works by the most fashionable artists in New York  London  and Hong Kong is having a defining impact on the relative successes of America  Europe  and Asia on the global art auction market.This strategy is extremely clear in the Ultra-Contemporary segment (artists under 40) where works by the market's new superstars – Matthew Wong (1984-2019)  Avery Singer (1987) Aboudia Diarrassouba (1983) Amoako Boafo (1984)  etc. – are offered in all three cities  eliciting bids that often exceed the auction houses' already audacious estimates.The United States and the UK lead the dance in the WestIn this context  Phillips is increasingly relying on this dynamic to incentivize its sales of Contemporary and Post-War art which  along with watchmaking  jewelry and design  have become its specialties. In parallel  Phillips has recently announced a partnership with Yongle to host sales in Hong Kong and Beijing  underscoring the enormous attraction of the Chinese art market. Already in 2021  Phillips partnered with Poly Auction to organize four sessions that totaled $176 million.As the art market reconfigures…For the time being  London retains an undeniable place in the triumvirate that dominates the global art market. The UK capital even seems to have found its way back to growth  although its auction turnover totals are still much lower than in 2008 or 2014. Moreover  while London outbid Hong Kong in H1 2022  that may not have been the case if China had not imposed a drastic zero-covid policy in H1. The Hong Kong market will most likely pick up again in the second half of this year.Meanwhile… just a week after Frieze London  Paris will be hosting the prestigious Paris+ by Art Basel fair. A lot of questions and expectations surround this first edition of Paris+ (which replaces the FIAC).As regards the digitalization of art and the art market  things are moving rapidly with the deployment of Christie's 3.0: nft.christies.com.London may be able to draw on its long history and strong reputation for Fine Art sales. But it cannot ignore the energy that is today emanating from the Ultra-Contemporary and art-NFT market.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image1-Auction-Turnover-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/Image2-Auction-Turnover-by-Period-London-vs-Hong-Kong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The intent of the law was to reduce the influence of foreign banks on Russian companies after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Many international investors who have tried to convert their Russian assets have been unable to do so  the advisors said.""This is complete chaos now "" said Grigory Marinichev  a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis  which is advising roughly 300 investors and brokerages. ""Nobody understands what is happening and what will happen next.""JPMorgan & Chase  Citigroup  Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon act as depositary banks for most Russian depositary receipt programs  according to Clearstream. Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange.In statements to clients  some banks cited difficulties verifying there are enough shares to execute cancellations of depositary receipts.For example  BNY Mellon cited such a difficulty with Global Depositary Receipts in Russian gas company Novatek.""BNY Mellon has closed its books for cancellations with respect to the Novatek DR program until a complete reconciliation of its books "" BNY told clients in a Sept. 2 statement. On Sept. 27  BNY started accepting cancellations again  but said it could close it again at any moment due to reconciliation issues. The bank declined further comment.Citi  after closing books ""to ensure a complete and accurate reconciliation""  reopened them last week. But the bank said in a statement to clients dated Oct. 5 seen by Reuters it may face reconciliation issues due to cancellations taking place directly in Russia.Story continuesSome large international funds have spent months devising ways to maximize potential returns for clients with stranded exposures.BlackRock has been working to convert its depositary receipts  parking the underlying securities in a structure with a view to returning sales proceeds or income when sanctions permit and when market conditions allow some recovery in their value  a source close to the matter told Reuters. Reuters has been unable to verify whether BlackRock encountered any reconciliation problems.One of the biggest U.S. pension funds separately told Reuters it did not see a clear solution for the securities as different rules in the United States and in Russia bar a divestment. The fund declined to be named because its investment strategies are private.LOOMING DEADLINEMoscow has imposed a Nov. 10 deadline for so-called forced conversion of shares.In April  Moscow originally demanded a raft of Russian firms axe their depositary receipts programs. Initially  some companies ordered global banks and brokerages to cancel the depositary receipts  but in July Russia allowed investors to convert depository receipts into common shares directly in a process known as ""forced conversion"" that bypassed global banks.In practical terms  this means some investors may end up taking possession of the underlying shares without formally cancelling the depositary receipts linked to those shares. While depositary receipts are under custody of global banks  the shares they represent are parked in Russia.This has created headaches for the banks who effectively acted as guardians of the programs. They were struggling to match or ""reconcile"" the depository receipts on their books with the underlying shares now in Russian banks.To avoid such issues  global banks decided to stop accepting cancellation requests. For awhile  this left investors only with the option of cancelling the depositary receipts directly in Russia  advisors said.""Banks may end up having more people requesting a redemption than shares they have to deliver. This would create a legal liability "" said Marc Zboch  an investment professional who launched the website ""Russia Deadline"" to help investors convert their receipts for a fee.Foreign investors who want to convert their depositary receipts into local shares using the forced conversion must also jump through some hoops  supplying documents supporting their ownership which must be translated into Russian and notarized. Investors must present these in person in Russia either themselves or using a legal representative  according to advisors.Investors are meanwhile discussing ways online to meet the Russian requirements and how to pay fees to Russian banks. Some investors are active in online discussion groups like the RU GDR/ADR Community on the Discord platform as they try to navigate the situation. They also complain their global brokers have not cooperated processing their requests or providing the required documents.""Investors are sandwiched between a rock and a hard place "" said Marinichev.(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York and Sinead Cruise in London; editing by Megan Davies and David Gregorio)",negative,0.0,0.44,0.56,mixed,0.06,0.12,0.83,True,English,"['stock conversion baffles', 'Analysis-Russian law', 'global banks', 'clients', 'biggest U.S. pension funds', 'most Russian depositary receipt programs', 'large international funds', 'heating power plan', 'online discussion groups', 'RU GDR/ADR Community', 'local stock exchange', 'Novatek DR program', 'Russian gas company', 'depositary receipts programs', 'Many international investors', 'new Russian law', 'Global Depositary Receipts', 'NEW YORK/LONDON', 'foreign company', 'Russian firms', 'Russian assets', 'Russian requirements', 'depository receipts', 'local shares', 'Carolina Mandl', 'Sinead Cruise', 'Russian companies', 'client communications', 'Grigory Marinichev', 'law firm', 'Morgan Lewis', 'depositary banks', 'accurate reconciliation', 'potential returns', 'sales proceeds', 'market conditions', 'reconciliation problems', 'clear solution', 'different rules', 'United States', 'investment strategies', 'LOOMING DEADLINE', 'Nov. 10 deadline', 'practical terms', 'cancellation requests', 'legal liability', 'Marc Zboch', 'investment professional', 'legal representative', 'Discord platform', 'Russian banks', 'global banks', 'BNY Mellon', 'complete chaos', 'complete reconciliation', 'reconciliation issues', 'forced conversion', 'foreign banks', 'ordinary shares', 'enough shares', 'common shares', 'underlying shares', 'Global investors', 'underlying securities', 'Foreign investors', 'Deutsche Bank', 'central Moscow', 'Russia Deadline', 'Sept. 2 statement', '300 investors', 'PHOTO', 'Steam', 'chimneys', 'skyline', 'Reuters', 'confusion', 'efforts', 'compliance', 'advisors', 'Citigroup', 'processes', 'drive', 'intent', 'influence', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'partner', 'brokerages', 'Nobody', 'JPMorgan', 'Chase', 'Clearstream', 'certificates', 'statements', 'clients', 'difficulties', 'cancellations', 'example', 'difficulty', 'books', 'respect', 'moment', 'comment', 'place', 'Story', 'months', 'ways', 'exposures', 'BlackRock', 'structure', 'view', 'income', 'sanctions', 'recovery', 'value', 'source', 'matter', 'divestment', 'April', 'raft', 'July', 'possession', 'custody', 'headaches', 'guardians', 'option', 'people', 'redemption', 'website', 'fee', 'hoops', 'documents', 'ownership', 'person', 'situation']",2022-10-13,2022-10-14,finance.yahoo.com

Indeed  the overall economic situation reinforces our belief that organic growth must be accompanied by external growth to return to a profitability objective. It is with this ambition that we acquired Distimp in mid-2021  enabling us to develop the French market and initiate an inflection of our product lines towards premium. The acquisition of Spine Innovations in July 2022 opens up the market segment for prosthetic surgery (spinal instruments in non-fusion) and strengthens our therapeutic offering with a strong innovation. This growth strategy and the restructuring carried out are materialising today with the significant sales growth as of September 2022 and provide us with optimal prospects to actively participate in the development of our industry.""Stéphane Le Roux  CEO of SpinewayConsolidated turnover per quarter and as of September 2022In thousands of eurosUnaudited figures 2022 2021 2022/2021 Variationin % Q1 turnover 1 342 865 + 55% Q2 turnover 1 770 1 020 + 74% Q3 turnover 2 247 1 061 + 112% 9 months turnover * 5 360 2 946 + 82% Proforma 9-months turnover 7 567** 6 553*** + 15%* Revenues at the end of September 2022 include the share of revenues linked to Spine Innovations since its acquisition on July 21  2022  i.e. €0.9 M.** For comparison  proforma 2022 revenues include Spine Innovations from January 1  2022 (acquired on July 21  2022).*** For comparison  proforma 2021 revenues include Distimp and Spine Innovations from January 1  2021 (acquired on June 25  2021 and July 21  2022).As in previous quarters  Spineway closed the third quarter of 2022 with a significant increase compared to the same period in 2021  with a turnover of €2.2 million  up 112%  driven in particular by the contributions of the Distimp range and the acquisition of Spine Innovations. This growth reinforces the Group's momentum  with a total turnover of €5.4 million for the first nine months of the year  exceeding the annual sales for fiscal year 2021.The successful integration of acquisitions has enabled Spineway to rebalance on the one hand the geographical distribution of its sales and on the other hand  thanks to territorial complementarities  to develop in mature markets with higher added value.Story continuesAlthough Latin America remains the Group's leading region  with sales up in the third quarter due to the Group's historical ranges  Europe  driven by the development of the French market and sales of prostheses in the German market  is now the second largest contributor to turnover.The other geographical areas also showed good momentum: the Middle East continued to grow and Asia returned to growth in the third quarter.With a reinforced offer and a balanced sales portfolio  Spineway will continue its development in order to position itself as a leading European player in the spine sector.Upcoming : January 20  2023 –2022 RevenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

By enhancing their collaboration  they have the ambition to efficiently address the rapidly growing CCS market and the strong need for affordable and proven solutions.In addition to its CANSOLV technology  Shell Catalysts & Technologies brings to the alliance substantial CCS experience gained from supporting Shell’s projects. Technip Energies  which also has a significant CCS track record  brings end-to-end project delivery experience in front-end-engineering design (FEED)  engineering  procurement and construction (EPC)  commissioning and start-up  and life-of-asset services. As an example of this collaboration  Technip Energies was recently awarded an EPC contract by Hafslund Oslo Celsio for a world-first CCS project at waste to energy plant located in Oslo  Norway  leveraging Shell’s CANSOLV(1) CO 2 capture system technology.Arnaud Pieton  CEO of Technip Energies  stated: “Both organizations are recognized global energy leaders  bringing complementary skills for CCS and sharing a similar  bold energy transition vision. Strengthening our collaboration will help to drive CCS affordability by developing industrial-scale solutions. This will support the growing demand for CCS across industries and geographies and will help us to make a significant contribution to a sustainable future.”Yuri Sebregts  Executive Vice President of technology of Shell  said: “Our current cooperation has already unlocked several highly significant improvements. For example  we were able to find ways to make the CANSOLV technology less energy intensive and developed opportunities to modularise and standardise solutions. Consequently  we are able to offer lower capital and operating costs to our customers.”In June 2022  Technip Energies joined Shell’s Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam (ETCA) to form a joint  co-located delivery team. This followed Shell’s move to transform the site  previously known as Shell Technology Centre Amsterdam  into an open innovation campus and to invite external parties to co-locate there and work together on solutions for cleaner energy. Over the next few years  the joint team stationed at ETCA will continue to work towards achieving strong improvements in cost reduction through joint value delivery and improvement programs.(1) CANSOLV is a Shell trademark.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management.

Indeed  the overall economic situation reinforces our belief that organic growth must be accompanied by external growth to return to a profitability objective. It is with this ambition that we acquired Distimp in mid-2021  enabling us to develop the French market and initiate an inflection of our product lines towards premium. The acquisition of Spine Innovations in July 2022 opens up the market segment for prosthetic surgery (spinal instruments in non-fusion) and strengthens our therapeutic offering with a strong innovation. This growth strategy and the restructuring carried out are materialising today with the significant sales growth as of September 2022 and provide us with optimal prospects to actively participate in the development of our industry.""Stéphane Le Roux  CEO of SpinewayConsolidated turnover per quarter and as of September 2022In thousands of eurosUnaudited figures 2022 2021 2022/2021 Variationin % Q1 turnover 1 342 865 + 55% Q2 turnover 1 770 1 020 + 74% Q3 turnover 2 247 1 061 + 112% 9 months turnover * 5 360 2 946 + 82% Proforma 9-months turnover 7 567** 6 553*** + 15%* Revenues at the end of September 2022 include the share of revenues linked to Spine Innovations since its acquisition on July 21  2022  i.e. €0.9 M.** For comparison  proforma 2022 revenues include Spine Innovations from January 1  2022 (acquired on July 21  2022).*** For comparison  proforma 2021 revenues include Distimp and Spine Innovations from January 1  2021 (acquired on June 25  2021 and July 21  2022).As in previous quarters  Spineway closed the third quarter of 2022 with a significant increase compared to the same period in 2021  with a turnover of €2.2 million  up 112%  driven in particular by the contributions of the Distimp range and the acquisition of Spine Innovations. This growth reinforces the Group's momentum  with a total turnover of €5.4 million for the first nine months of the year  exceeding the annual sales for fiscal year 2021.The successful integration of acquisitions has enabled Spineway to rebalance on the one hand the geographical distribution of its sales and on the other hand  thanks to territorial complementarities  to develop in mature markets with higher added value.Although Latin America remains the Group's leading region  with sales up in the third quarter due to the Group's historical ranges  Europe  driven by the development of the French market and sales of prostheses in the German market  is now the second largest contributor to turnover.The other geographical areas also showed good momentum: the Middle East continued to grow and Asia returned to growth in the third quarter.With a reinforced offer and a balanced sales portfolio  Spineway will continue its development in order to position itself as a leading European player in the spine sector.Upcoming : January 20  2023 –2022 RevenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

Mr Browne owns just over 4.3 million shares in Alternus  which are currently valued at about €8.9m.The company’s assets include a planned 122MW of solar energy generation in Ireland. It also owns operational and under construction solar farms in countries including Poland  Romania  Italy  the Netherlands and Germany.Founded in 2016  it has a total of 168MW of operating assets and 649MW of in-development projects. It also has 845MW of contracted acquisitions and a further 800MW of solar energy projects which it has exclusive rights to purchase.It aims to own and operate 3.5GW of solar farms by the end of 2025.Alternus will own about 64pc of Clean Earth once the deal closes  and the combined company will have roughly $220m of cash available at that time.Read MoreThe deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023  while Green Earth will change its name to Alternus Clean Energy on closing.Alternus and Clean Earth intend to arrange a committed capital-on-demand equity placement programme of up to $100m and other potential financing options before the completion of the business combination.Last year  Alternus generated revenue of €20.6m  compared with just €145 000 the year before. It made an operating profit of €4m last year.In the first six months of this year  its revenue jumped to €17m from €6m in the first half of 2021. It made a €4m operating profit in the first half of 2022.The Irish company has deployed €140m of a €200m green bond issue and is also in advanced discussions with European banks to secure up to €500m in new debt facilities to help support its roll-out of new solar parks.Alternus is preparing to enter the US solar market and said it’s also positioned to capture new market share in Europe as rising energy costs drive policy change and capital towards green energy.“Alternus has reached an inflection point in our growth  with a significant increase in contracted pipeline and operating assets over the past year ” said Mr Browne.He said the planned deal with Clean Earth will leave the Irish firm “well-positioned” to continue developing and acquiring renewable energy assets across Europe and in the United States.Clean Earth CEO Aaron Ratner said the business combination as well as the Nasdaq listing  access to new equity and potentially lower-cost debt capital should fuel the expansion of Alternus.

11574,EuroNext,Bing API,https://spaceref.com/space-commerce/eutelsat-strategy-update-on-the-proposed-combination-with-oneweb/,Eutelsat Strategy Update on the Proposed Combination with OneWeb,(Euronext Paris: ETL) today host a Strategic Update on the proposed combination with OneWeb  announced in July 2022.,Eutelsat OneWeb Eutelsat CommunicationsEutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL) today host a Strategic Update on the proposed combination with OneWeb  announced in July 2022.Eutelsat and key OneWeb shareholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2022  with a view to combining Eutelsat and OneWeb in an all-share transaction  whereby Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders will each hold 50% of the Eutelsat shares2. The proposed combination represents a transformational transaction aimed at creating a global leader particularly well positioned to capture the fast-growing Satellite Connectivity market by offering the first global combined GEO/LEO infrastructure.The combination represents the logical next step in Eutelsat and OneWeb’s growing cooperation since Eutelsat’s initial investment in OneWeb in April 2021  which paved the way for major commercial distribution partnerships and multiple joint technical initiatives  including common workstreams to shape the next generation systems for hybrid GEO/LEO infrastructure. Following completion of the combination  Eutelsat and OneWeb will begin working together on the design of OneWeb’s future Gen 2 constellation.In this context  both Eutelsat and OneWeb are convinced that the time is right to take their partnership to the next level via the proposed combination  which will:accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb’s fleet as it enters the final stages of its global deployment;jointly address customer needs  initially through bundled services for some customers  from day one  while working together on the optimal combined solutions to address and expand future use-cases;capture opex savings upstream and maximise operating efficiencies at an early stage  and;maximise capex savings through the early  joint design of OneWeb Gen 2 as part of a combined GEO/LEO infrastructure  delivering significant savings compared to any potential LEO new entrant.Eva Berneke  CEO of Eutelsat  and Neil Masterson  CEO of OneWeb  said: “The proposed combination between Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a decisive leap forward for Satellite Connectivity. Eutelsat’s initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by a strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity. This belief has intensified as Eutelsat and OneWeb’s relationship has deepened  and we are confident that moving to the next level  with a full combination  will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  underpinned by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic. This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb’s commercial deployment  and Eutelsat’s pivot to Connectivity”.Addressing a significant c. $16bn market opportunityThe Satellite Connectivity market is poised for a period of significant growth  with barriers to adoption relating to bandwidth  latency  pricing  and terminals all reducing  thereby driving market expansion at an unprecedented rate. Between now and 2030 the Satellite Connectivity market is expected to more than triple in value from $4.3bn to c.$16bn.The contribution from NGSO3 is expected to grow c.2.5x faster than the overall market to represent almost 50% of the market by 2030  mostly captured by LEO constellations. Demand growth will be spread across four key verticals: Fixed Data  Government Services  Mobility and Consumer Broadband  all of which can be most optimally addressed by a GEO/LEO combination.Moreover  growth is expected to remain robust beyond 2030  driven by the continuing expansion of existing applications  and technology-driven new use cases.In this context  the global LEO constellation of OneWeb represents a uniquely compelling asset in optimising Eutelsat’s competitive position to address this significant market opportunity.OneWeb: A unique NGSO assetOneWeb is currently one of the only two global LEO broadband constellations in service  with secured priority spectrum rights  and already reaping the benefits of its early-mover advantage. Its Gen 1 fleet has already been fully funded and successfully began its entry into service.With almost two-thirds of its launches completed  OneWeb’s Gen 1 constellation is already generating revenues above the 50-degrees North latitude and requires only a further two launches to extend its coverage to 25-degrees North  well on track for full global entry into service expected by end-2023. The constellation is delivering a high-quality customer experience  with average global one-way latency of 70ms  download speeds of up to 195Mbps  user terminals adapted for each market and a suite of fully managed connectivity services.OneWeb already has over $600m4 in total contracted revenues  and a risk-weighted pipeline of up to $1.9bn spread across its four key verticals of Enterprise  Government  Aviation and Maritime  underpinned by distribution partnerships with major players in each segment and over 150 customer trials underway. On a standalone basis  OneWeb’s revenues are expected to reach €50m in FY 2023  €150 – 250m in FY 2024  €300 – 500m in FY 2025  and to exceed €600m in FY 20275.GEO/LEO combination paving the way for significant cost advantage and new revenue opportunitiesAs a combined entity  OneWeb and Eutelsat will work together on the conception of OneWeb’s Gen 2 constellation  due to enter service by early 2028. As a follow-on constellation to Gen 1  Gen 2 will benefit from the re-use of existing ground infrastructure  the know-how developed with Gen 1  and already secured priority filings  while also being designed as part of a broader GEO/LEO structure rather than a standalone entity. The cost of Gen 2 will therefore be considerably lower than that of building a constellation from scratch.The combination of OneWeb’s LEO constellation with Eutelsat’s GEO fleet will create a leading infrastructure which will provide best-in-class solutions across a wide range of applications  while gradually paving the way for new revenue opportunities. Eutelsat and OneWeb have a clear roadmap for the integration of their respective in-orbit and on-ground assets  culminating in a fully integrated GEO/LEO network with the entry into service of OneWeb’s Gen 2 by early 2028.Implemented in several stages  it will start by building on the distribution agreements already in place to accelerate up-selling and cross-selling opportunities and offer GEO/LEO packages through a one-stop-shop addressing a range of customer requirements. It will then gradually converge towards a full mutualization of networks enabling an integrated offer with automated routing and a single terminal  for a completely seamless  high-performance experience for customers in the key verticals of Mobility  Government  Enterprise and Consumer Broadband.A combination delivering significant synergiesThe proposed combination of Eutelsat and OneWeb will generate substantial value  tapping into significant revenue  cost  and capex synergies:Average annual revenue synergies of c. €150m by year 4  thanks to the acceleration of OneWeb’s commercial ramp-up  the speeding-up of time-to-market for OneWeb products with combined GEO/LEO bundle offers and a one-stop-shop experience for customers  and the development of new integrated offers  with single hybrid terminals  a flexible service catalogue and a seamless unified customer experience  unique in the industry.Annual run-rate pre-tax cost synergies over €80m by year 5  thanks to Opex optimization coming mostly from avoidance of cost ramp up and cost duplication between the two entities. Synergies will include personnel as well as non-personnel costs  although no layoffs are required to achieve the target.Average annual capex synergies of c.€80m from year 1  through:The rightsizing of OneWeb’s Gen 2 constellation by leveraging the hybrid GEO/LEO satellite infrastructure compared to a standalone plan  with a hybrid infrastructure requiring fewer and/or smaller satellites.The rationalization of Eutelsat’s long-term GEO fleet by focusing on Video hotspots and ad-hoc complements to LEO capacity with the traffic from legacy GEO connectivity assets migrated to LEO.On-ground rationalization  with the mutualization of ground infrastructure (operation centers  teleports  baseband  fibers)  the convergence of IT systems  and synergies on infrastructure development costs.Scale impact  with greater purchasing efficiency linked to larger procurement volumes of both satellite manufacturing and launch services.These sources of incremental value creation represent a balanced split between revenues  costs  and capex. Taken together they equate to a net present value of over €1.5bn after tax net of implementation costs.Paving the way for double digit  profitable growthThe proposed transaction provides a platform for both entities to create value while transforming their respective growth profiles and cash generation potential.The combined entity is expected to have revenues of circa c. €1.2bn for FY 2023. From this base  revenues are expected to grow at a double-digit revenue CAGR over the medium to long-term  reaching €1.35-1.45bn in FY 2024  €1.55-1.75bn in FY 2025  and c. €2.0bn in FY 2027. EBITDA for the combined entity is expected to grow at a double digit CAGR over the same period  outpacing revenues growth  rising from c. €700m in FY 20236 to a range of €750m to €850m in FY 2024  €900m to €1.1bn in FY 2025  and c. €1.4bn in FY 2027.Disciplined financial policy focused on growth and deleveragingIncluding synergies  the capex of the combined group (after synergies) is estimated at €725m to €875m per annum on average  over the period FY 2024 to FY 2030  with a front-end loaded profile. Beyond 2030  Capex is expected to decrease significantly  as the upgrade  replacement and maintenance of the fleet will be gradual rather than generational.Eutelsat’s strong cash flow generation will provide both visibility and funding to develop OneWeb’s fleet at minimal risk. Combined EBITDA-Capex is expected to return in positive territory by FY 2025 or FY 2026  depending on the capex phasing of Gen 2.Eutelsat will suspend its dividend for the coming three fiscal years with cash flow focused on the deployment of the Gen 2 constellation while maintaining a strong balance sheet.Leverage  which would stand at c. 4x net debt / EBITDA pro forma end of June 20235  is expected to be reduced on the back of strong EBITDA growth  backed by a disciplined financial policy  with an objective of leverage of c. 3x in the medium term.Webcast Audio / VideoA webcast will be held on Wednesday 12th of October 2022 at 10:00am BST.Click here to access the webcast presentation.The presentation will also be available on the website of the company.About Eutelsat CommunicationsFounded in 1977  Eutelsat Communications is one of the world’s leading satellite operators.
