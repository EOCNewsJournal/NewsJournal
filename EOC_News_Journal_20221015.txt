Indeed  the overall economic situation reinforces our belief that organic growth must be accompanied by external growth to return to a profitability objective. It is with this ambition that we acquired Distimp in mid-2021  enabling us to develop the French market and initiate an inflection of our product lines towards premium. The acquisition of Spine Innovations in July 2022 opens up the market segment for prosthetic surgery (spinal instruments in non-fusion) and strengthens our therapeutic offering with a strong innovation. This growth strategy and the restructuring carried out are materialising today with the significant sales growth as of September 2022 and provide us with optimal prospects to actively participate in the development of our industry.""St√©phane Le Roux  CEO of SpinewayConsolidated turnover per quarter and as of September 2022In thousands of eurosUnaudited figures 2022 2021 2022/2021 Variationin % Q1 turnover 1 342 865 + 55% Q2 turnover 1 770 1 020 + 74% Q3 turnover 2 247 1 061 + 112% 9 months turnover * 5 360 2 946 + 82% Proforma 9-months turnover 7 567** 6 553*** + 15%* Revenues at the end of September 2022 include the share of revenues linked to Spine Innovations since its acquisition on July 21  2022  i.e. ‚Ç¨0.9 M.** For comparison  proforma 2022 revenues include Spine Innovations from January 1  2022 (acquired on July 21  2022).*** For comparison  proforma 2021 revenues include Distimp and Spine Innovations from January 1  2021 (acquired on June 25  2021 and July 21  2022).As in previous quarters  Spineway closed the third quarter of 2022 with a significant increase compared to the same period in 2021  with a turnover of ‚Ç¨2.2 million  up 112%  driven in particular by the contributions of the Distimp range and the acquisition of Spine Innovations. This growth reinforces the Group's momentum  with a total turnover of ‚Ç¨5.4 million for the first nine months of the year  exceeding the annual sales for fiscal year 2021.The successful integration of acquisitions has enabled Spineway to rebalance on the one hand the geographical distribution of its sales and on the other hand  thanks to territorial complementarities  to develop in mature markets with higher added value.Story continuesAlthough Latin America remains the Group's leading region  with sales up in the third quarter due to the Group's historical ranges  Europe  driven by the development of the French market and sales of prostheses in the German market  is now the second largest contributor to turnover.The other geographical areas also showed good momentum: the Middle East continued to grow and Asia returned to growth in the third quarter.With a reinforced offer and a balanced sales portfolio  Spineway will continue its development in order to position itself as a leading European player in the spine sector.Upcoming : January 20  2023 ‚Äì2022 RevenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

By enhancing their collaboration  they have the ambition to efficiently address the rapidly growing CCS market and the strong need for affordable and proven solutions.In addition to its CANSOLV technology  Shell Catalysts & Technologies brings to the alliance substantial CCS experience gained from supporting Shell‚Äôs projects. Technip Energies  which also has a significant CCS track record  brings end-to-end project delivery experience in front-end-engineering design (FEED)  engineering  procurement and construction (EPC)  commissioning and start-up  and life-of-asset services. As an example of this collaboration  Technip Energies was recently awarded an EPC contract by Hafslund Oslo Celsio for a world-first CCS project at waste to energy plant located in Oslo  Norway  leveraging Shell‚Äôs CANSOLV(1) CO 2 capture system technology.Arnaud Pieton  CEO of Technip Energies  stated: ‚ÄúBoth organizations are recognized global energy leaders  bringing complementary skills for CCS and sharing a similar  bold energy transition vision. Strengthening our collaboration will help to drive CCS affordability by developing industrial-scale solutions. This will support the growing demand for CCS across industries and geographies and will help us to make a significant contribution to a sustainable future.‚ÄùYuri Sebregts  Executive Vice President of technology of Shell  said: ‚ÄúOur current cooperation has already unlocked several highly significant improvements. For example  we were able to find ways to make the CANSOLV technology less energy intensive and developed opportunities to modularise and standardise solutions. Consequently  we are able to offer lower capital and operating costs to our customers.‚ÄùIn June 2022  Technip Energies joined Shell‚Äôs Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam (ETCA) to form a joint  co-located delivery team. This followed Shell‚Äôs move to transform the site  previously known as Shell Technology Centre Amsterdam  into an open innovation campus and to invite external parties to co-locate there and work together on solutions for cleaner energy. Over the next few years  the joint team stationed at ETCA will continue to work towards achieving strong improvements in cost reduction through joint value delivery and improvement programs.(1) CANSOLV is a Shell trademark.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management.

Indeed  the overall economic situation reinforces our belief that organic growth must be accompanied by external growth to return to a profitability objective. It is with this ambition that we acquired Distimp in mid-2021  enabling us to develop the French market and initiate an inflection of our product lines towards premium. The acquisition of Spine Innovations in July 2022 opens up the market segment for prosthetic surgery (spinal instruments in non-fusion) and strengthens our therapeutic offering with a strong innovation. This growth strategy and the restructuring carried out are materialising today with the significant sales growth as of September 2022 and provide us with optimal prospects to actively participate in the development of our industry.""St√©phane Le Roux  CEO of SpinewayConsolidated turnover per quarter and as of September 2022In thousands of eurosUnaudited figures 2022 2021 2022/2021 Variationin % Q1 turnover 1 342 865 + 55% Q2 turnover 1 770 1 020 + 74% Q3 turnover 2 247 1 061 + 112% 9 months turnover * 5 360 2 946 + 82% Proforma 9-months turnover 7 567** 6 553*** + 15%* Revenues at the end of September 2022 include the share of revenues linked to Spine Innovations since its acquisition on July 21  2022  i.e. ‚Ç¨0.9 M.** For comparison  proforma 2022 revenues include Spine Innovations from January 1  2022 (acquired on July 21  2022).*** For comparison  proforma 2021 revenues include Distimp and Spine Innovations from January 1  2021 (acquired on June 25  2021 and July 21  2022).As in previous quarters  Spineway closed the third quarter of 2022 with a significant increase compared to the same period in 2021  with a turnover of ‚Ç¨2.2 million  up 112%  driven in particular by the contributions of the Distimp range and the acquisition of Spine Innovations. This growth reinforces the Group's momentum  with a total turnover of ‚Ç¨5.4 million for the first nine months of the year  exceeding the annual sales for fiscal year 2021.The successful integration of acquisitions has enabled Spineway to rebalance on the one hand the geographical distribution of its sales and on the other hand  thanks to territorial complementarities  to develop in mature markets with higher added value.Although Latin America remains the Group's leading region  with sales up in the third quarter due to the Group's historical ranges  Europe  driven by the development of the French market and sales of prostheses in the German market  is now the second largest contributor to turnover.The other geographical areas also showed good momentum: the Middle East continued to grow and Asia returned to growth in the third quarter.With a reinforced offer and a balanced sales portfolio  Spineway will continue its development in order to position itself as a leading European player in the spine sector.Upcoming : January 20  2023 ‚Äì2022 RevenuesSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

Mr Browne owns just over 4.3 million shares in Alternus  which are currently valued at about ‚Ç¨8.9m.The company‚Äôs assets include a planned 122MW of solar energy generation in Ireland. It also owns operational and under construction solar farms in countries including Poland  Romania  Italy  the Netherlands and Germany.Founded in 2016  it has a total of 168MW of operating assets and 649MW of in-development projects. It also has 845MW of contracted acquisitions and a further 800MW of solar energy projects which it has exclusive rights to purchase.It aims to own and operate 3.5GW of solar farms by the end of 2025.Alternus will own about 64pc of Clean Earth once the deal closes  and the combined company will have roughly $220m of cash available at that time.Read MoreThe deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023  while Green Earth will change its name to Alternus Clean Energy on closing.Alternus and Clean Earth intend to arrange a committed capital-on-demand equity placement programme of up to $100m and other potential financing options before the completion of the business combination.Last year  Alternus generated revenue of ‚Ç¨20.6m  compared with just ‚Ç¨145 000 the year before. It made an operating profit of ‚Ç¨4m last year.In the first six months of this year  its revenue jumped to ‚Ç¨17m from ‚Ç¨6m in the first half of 2021.

11574,EuroNext,Bing API,https://spaceref.com/space-commerce/eutelsat-strategy-update-on-the-proposed-combination-with-oneweb/,Eutelsat Strategy Update on the Proposed Combination with OneWeb,(Euronext Paris: ETL) today host a Strategic Update on the proposed combination with OneWeb  announced in July 2022.,Eutelsat OneWeb Eutelsat CommunicationsEutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL) today host a Strategic Update on the proposed combination with OneWeb  announced in July 2022.Eutelsat and key OneWeb shareholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2022  with a view to combining Eutelsat and OneWeb in an all-share transaction  whereby Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders will each hold 50% of the Eutelsat shares2. The proposed combination represents a transformational transaction aimed at creating a global leader particularly well positioned to capture the fast-growing Satellite Connectivity market by offering the first global combined GEO/LEO infrastructure.The combination represents the logical next step in Eutelsat and OneWeb‚Äôs growing cooperation since Eutelsat‚Äôs initial investment in OneWeb in April 2021  which paved the way for major commercial distribution partnerships and multiple joint technical initiatives  including common workstreams to shape the next generation systems for hybrid GEO/LEO infrastructure. Following completion of the combination  Eutelsat and OneWeb will begin working together on the design of OneWeb‚Äôs future Gen 2 constellation.In this context  both Eutelsat and OneWeb are convinced that the time is right to take their partnership to the next level via the proposed combination  which will:accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb‚Äôs fleet as it enters the final stages of its global deployment;jointly address customer needs  initially through bundled services for some customers  from day one  while working together on the optimal combined solutions to address and expand future use-cases;capture opex savings upstream and maximise operating efficiencies at an early stage  and;maximise capex savings through the early  joint design of OneWeb Gen 2 as part of a combined GEO/LEO infrastructure  delivering significant savings compared to any potential LEO new entrant.Eva Berneke  CEO of Eutelsat  and Neil Masterson  CEO of OneWeb  said: ‚ÄúThe proposed combination between Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a decisive leap forward for Satellite Connectivity. Eutelsat‚Äôs initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by a strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity. This belief has intensified as Eutelsat and OneWeb‚Äôs relationship has deepened  and we are confident that moving to the next level  with a full combination  will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  underpinned by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic. This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb‚Äôs commercial deployment  and Eutelsat‚Äôs pivot to Connectivity‚Äù.Addressing a significant c. $16bn market opportunityThe Satellite Connectivity market is poised for a period of significant growth  with barriers to adoption relating to bandwidth  latency  pricing  and terminals all reducing  thereby driving market expansion at an unprecedented rate. Between now and 2030 the Satellite Connectivity market is expected to more than triple in value from $4.3bn to c.$16bn.The contribution from NGSO3 is expected to grow c.2.5x faster than the overall market to represent almost 50% of the market by 2030  mostly captured by LEO constellations. Demand growth will be spread across four key verticals: Fixed Data  Government Services  Mobility and Consumer Broadband  all of which can be most optimally addressed by a GEO/LEO combination.Moreover  growth is expected to remain robust beyond 2030  driven by the continuing expansion of existing applications  and technology-driven new use cases.In this context  the global LEO constellation of OneWeb represents a uniquely compelling asset in optimising Eutelsat‚Äôs competitive position to address this significant market opportunity.OneWeb: A unique NGSO assetOneWeb is currently one of the only two global LEO broadband constellations in service  with secured priority spectrum rights  and already reaping the benefits of its early-mover advantage. Its Gen 1 fleet has already been fully funded and successfully began its entry into service.With almost two-thirds of its launches completed  OneWeb‚Äôs Gen 1 constellation is already generating revenues above the 50-degrees North latitude and requires only a further two launches to extend its coverage to 25-degrees North  well on track for full global entry into service expected by end-2023. The constellation is delivering a high-quality customer experience  with average global one-way latency of 70ms  download speeds of up to 195Mbps  user terminals adapted for each market and a suite of fully managed connectivity services.OneWeb already has over $600m4 in total contracted revenues  and a risk-weighted pipeline of up to $1.9bn spread across its four key verticals of Enterprise  Government  Aviation and Maritime  underpinned by distribution partnerships with major players in each segment and over 150 customer trials underway. On a standalone basis  OneWeb‚Äôs revenues are expected to reach ‚Ç¨50m in FY 2023  ‚Ç¨150 ‚Äì 250m in FY 2024  ‚Ç¨300 ‚Äì 500m in FY 2025  and to exceed ‚Ç¨600m in FY 20275.GEO/LEO combination paving the way for significant cost advantage and new revenue opportunitiesAs a combined entity  OneWeb and Eutelsat will work together on the conception of OneWeb‚Äôs Gen 2 constellation  due to enter service by early 2028. As a follow-on constellation to Gen 1  Gen 2 will benefit from the re-use of existing ground infrastructure  the know-how developed with Gen 1  and already secured priority filings  while also being designed as part of a broader GEO/LEO structure rather than a standalone entity. The cost of Gen 2 will therefore be considerably lower than that of building a constellation from scratch.The combination of OneWeb‚Äôs LEO constellation with Eutelsat‚Äôs GEO fleet will create a leading infrastructure which will provide best-in-class solutions across a wide range of applications  while gradually paving the way for new revenue opportunities. Eutelsat and OneWeb have a clear roadmap for the integration of their respective in-orbit and on-ground assets  culminating in a fully integrated GEO/LEO network with the entry into service of OneWeb‚Äôs Gen 2 by early 2028.Implemented in several stages  it will start by building on the distribution agreements already in place to accelerate up-selling and cross-selling opportunities and offer GEO/LEO packages through a one-stop-shop addressing a range of customer requirements. It will then gradually converge towards a full mutualization of networks enabling an integrated offer with automated routing and a single terminal  for a completely seamless  high-performance experience for customers in the key verticals of Mobility  Government  Enterprise and Consumer Broadband.A combination delivering significant synergiesThe proposed combination of Eutelsat and OneWeb will generate substantial value  tapping into significant revenue  cost  and capex synergies:Average annual revenue synergies of c. ‚Ç¨150m by year 4  thanks to the acceleration of OneWeb‚Äôs commercial ramp-up  the speeding-up of time-to-market for OneWeb products with combined GEO/LEO bundle offers and a one-stop-shop experience for customers  and the development of new integrated offers  with single hybrid terminals  a flexible service catalogue and a seamless unified customer experience  unique in the industry.Annual run-rate pre-tax cost synergies over ‚Ç¨80m by year 5  thanks to Opex optimization coming mostly from avoidance of cost ramp up and cost duplication between the two entities. Synergies will include personnel as well as non-personnel costs  although no layoffs are required to achieve the target.Average annual capex synergies of c.‚Ç¨80m from year 1  through:The rightsizing of OneWeb‚Äôs Gen 2 constellation by leveraging the hybrid GEO/LEO satellite infrastructure compared to a standalone plan  with a hybrid infrastructure requiring fewer and/or smaller satellites.The rationalization of Eutelsat‚Äôs long-term GEO fleet by focusing on Video hotspots and ad-hoc complements to LEO capacity with the traffic from legacy GEO connectivity assets migrated to LEO.On-ground rationalization  with the mutualization of ground infrastructure (operation centers  teleports  baseband  fibers)  the convergence of IT systems  and synergies on infrastructure development costs.Scale impact  with greater purchasing efficiency linked to larger procurement volumes of both satellite manufacturing and launch services.These sources of incremental value creation represent a balanced split between revenues  costs  and capex. Taken together they equate to a net present value of over ‚Ç¨1.5bn after tax net of implementation costs.Paving the way for double digit  profitable growthThe proposed transaction provides a platform for both entities to create value while transforming their respective growth profiles and cash generation potential.The combined entity is expected to have revenues of circa c. ‚Ç¨1.2bn for FY 2023. From this base  revenues are expected to grow at a double-digit revenue CAGR over the medium to long-term  reaching ‚Ç¨1.35-1.45bn in FY 2024  ‚Ç¨1.55-1.75bn in FY 2025  and c. ‚Ç¨2.0bn in FY 2027. EBITDA for the combined entity is expected to grow at a double digit CAGR over the same period  outpacing revenues growth  rising from c. ‚Ç¨700m in FY 20236 to a range of ‚Ç¨750m to ‚Ç¨850m in FY 2024  ‚Ç¨900m to ‚Ç¨1.1bn in FY 2025  and c. ‚Ç¨1.4bn in FY 2027.Disciplined financial policy focused on growth and deleveragingIncluding synergies  the capex of the combined group (after synergies) is estimated at ‚Ç¨725m to ‚Ç¨875m per annum on average  over the period FY 2024 to FY 2030  with a front-end loaded profile. Beyond 2030  Capex is expected to decrease significantly  as the upgrade  replacement and maintenance of the fleet will be gradual rather than generational.Eutelsat‚Äôs strong cash flow generation will provide both visibility and funding to develop OneWeb‚Äôs fleet at minimal risk. Combined EBITDA-Capex is expected to return in positive territory by FY 2025 or FY 2026  depending on the capex phasing of Gen 2.Eutelsat will suspend its dividend for the coming three fiscal years with cash flow focused on the deployment of the Gen 2 constellation while maintaining a strong balance sheet.Leverage  which would stand at c. 4x net debt / EBITDA pro forma end of June 20235  is expected to be reduced on the back of strong EBITDA growth  backed by a disciplined financial policy  with an objective of leverage of c. 3x in the medium term.Webcast Audio / VideoA webcast will be held on Wednesday 12th of October 2022 at 10:00am BST.Click here to access the webcast presentation.The presentation will also be available on the website of the company.About Eutelsat CommunicationsFounded in 1977  Eutelsat Communications is one of the world‚Äôs leading satellite operators.

The Euronext 100 includes many blue chips listed on the Euronext exchange. Meanwhile in the United States  the S&P 500 index ...,"In this article  we will take a look at 15 of the most valuable French companies in the world. If you want to see some more of the most valuable French companies  go directly to 5 Most Valuable French Companies in the World.France is one of the largest countries in the European Union. With a population of over 46 million  the country has a GDP of $2.94 trillion in 2021 and one of the world's most advanced economies. In terms of its modern economy  France has world class infrastructure as well as a modern regulatory system. As a member of the European Union  France has 46 preferential trade agreements. Government spending amounted to around 57.6% of GDP over the last three years and the private sector also plays a significant role.In terms of the EU  the economy of the European Union is one of the largest in the world  with a GDP of slightly over $17 trillion in 2021. Of the nations in Europe  only Germany has a higher GDP than France at around $4.2 trillion in 2021 versus France's $2.94 trillion.In addition to France having a large GDP and expected growth in the near future  many leading French companies also trade in Europe and globally. As a result  the 15 most valuable French companies in the world are worth a lot.Given France's reputation as one of the most beautiful places in the world  many of the most valuable French companies are global luxury leaders such as Dior  Herm√®s  and LVMH. In fact  each of those three companies are worth more than $100 billion as of October 14. Several other French companies are also leading global financial companies given the size of France's economy.Like the stocks listed in many other nations  many leading French stocks have fallen substantially this year. In terms of the CAC 40 index  which is considered a benchmark of the French stock market  the leading index is down 17.07% year to date. In terms of the Europe  the Euronext 100 is down 17.18% year to date. The Euronext 100 includes many blue chips listed on the Euronext exchange.Story continuesMeanwhile in the United States  the S&P 500 index is down around 25% year to date and the NASDAQ composite is down around 35% year to date.The declines are due to the Federal Reserve having increased interest rates 5 times this year to fight inflation. With inflation still remaining a problem  many expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates even more.On September 21  the Federal Reserve issued a FOMC statement ""In support of these goals  the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3-1/4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition  the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities  as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.""If interest rates go higher  it can be harder for some businesses to make as much money due to potentially lower demand. Although France isn't the United States  many French companies do business globally and demand for many companies is affected by the U.S. Fed's interest rate increases given that the U.S. dollar is so widely used.Growth expectations are slowing in France potentially due to the interest rate hikes. On September 13  France cut its economic growth forecast for 2023 to 1% as the country faces headwinds such as volatile energy prices that could disrupt business and also strong inflation. France previously expected its GDP to grow by 1.4% in July. In terms of inflation  France expects inflation to be 5.3% for 2022 and 4.2% for 2023  up from the previous 5.1% and 3.3% respectively.Given the volatility  it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio of leading companies across many different sectors.Best Countries to Raise a DaughterPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable French Companies in the World  we took the 15 largest companies by market cap from companiesmarketcap.com's the French companies by market capitalization list.15 Most Valuable French Companies in the World15.
