I am confident as part of Alternus  Altnua has the right foundation  resources  and expertise to create an industry leading development business. We have an ambitious vision for this business with a goal of adding over 5GW‚Äôs of organically developed operational parks to the Alternus portfolio by the end of the decade ‚Äù said Bill Sadlier.As part of Alternus  Altnua can take a responsible long-term approach to developing projects  on a ‚Äòdevelop to own‚Äô basis  across a range of technologies using innovative energy solutions.

This allows us to reduce our overall capital expenditure and to optimise the long-term design and operation of the projects from inception  including the use of storage and other hybrid solutions.

Continue reading The post World‚Äôs five largest stock exchanges list over 450 new companies in 2022 despite recession fears app‚Ä¶,The global stock market has experienced plenty of turbulence in 2022  with projections the situation could worsen amid a looming recession as investors continue worrying about the central banks‚Äô ability to stabilize the economy. Despite the fears  several stock exchanges continue to record listings by different companies as the market monitors for any signs of stability.In particular  data acquired and calculated by Finbold indicates that the five leading global stock exchanges have cumulatively listed 459 companies between January 2022 and September 2022.United States-based NASDAQ  with a market capitalization of $18.59 trillion  has listed the highest number of companies at 174 representing a growth of 4.81% to 3 788. At the same time  the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  the largest stock exchange with a capitalization of $24.19 trillion  listed the second most with 144 companies to 2 578 or a growth of 5.91%.In Asia  the Shanghai Stock Exchange added the third highest number of companies at 106 representing a growth of 5.25%. The exchange has 2 123 companies with a capitalization of $6.87 trillion. Japan Exchange Group  with a capitalization of $5.29 trillion  ranks fourth  having listed 32 companies  from 3 795 to 3 827 or 0.84% growth.Elsewhere  Europe‚Äôs Euronext listed only three companies over the period. The exchange  with $5.62 trillion in market cap  has a total of 1 981 companies. As of January 2022  the five stock exchanges hosted 13 838 companies. The number of listed companies cumulatively grew 3.31% to 14 297 as of September 2022.Prevailing recession fearsThe increase in the number of publicly listed companies appears to defy the ongoing economic condition impacted by both emerging and residual factors. Notably  the global economy is facing geopolitical tensions  stock market volatility  growing concerns regarding commodities  the impact of inflation and continued interest rate hikes. These conditions have culminated in widespread fears that a recession might be imminent.Notably  a recession environment has the potential to result in depressed stock prices since consumer spending usually decreases with an increase in unemployment rates. Additionally  investors become more risk-averse with reduced interest in investing in stocks. This narrative is complemented by a recent report that indicated that the United States stock market is undergoing its third highest drawdown in history in 2022.However  the listing activities could potentially be higher since it can be assumed that most companies have likely paused their plans to go public. In this line  they are potentially re-evaluating their plans to ensure they can adapt to the new macroeconomic conditions. The listing activity might spike in 2023 once the inflationary environment eases and companies have the stability to meet their long-term growth plans through IPOs.Overall  the IPO market will potentially record a rebound once the stock market registers increased demand. However  this ability will depend on how global central banks handle the skyrocketing inflation  which remains the main barrier.Depressed SPAC activityInterestingly  the listing activities have come amid the slowing down of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)  which were used prominently as an alternative channel for private companies going public. Indeed  most companies that went public through this vessel have recorded slowed performance  a factor that has potentially deterred investors.From the data  United States-based exchanges are leading in the number of newly listed companies. Historically  listing on the U.S. stock market comes with benefits such as access to capital  improved branding and visibility  accountability  and increased liquidity while operating in a well-regulated market.At the same time  stock exchanges in the Asia Pacific region are attracting companies despite significantly reeling from the extended impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. However  several initiatives  including support from governments and central banks  are driving optimism among high-profile companies. Notably  most regional companies remain cautious due to factors like geopolitical tensions and regulatory changes.Influx of Asia companies into U.S. marketConsequently  the uncertainty in Asian markets  especially China  has forced some companies to explore the American market. Notably  the U.S. stock exchanges have an appetite for big Chinese company listings.Listing in the U.S. offers Chinese companies access to some of the leading public capital pools and a diverse group of investors. However  geopolitical tensions have paused the threat of destabilizing the relationship.Away from the prevailing market conditions  the exchanges are still attracting companies due to factors like existing incentives. Notably  some regions are known to have reduced corporation tax rates and flexible regulations.In general  the outcome of the current macroeconomic conditions will be central to influencing the listing of companies.,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,mixed,0.05,0.1,0.85,True,English,"['five largest stock exchanges list', '450 new companies', 'recession fears', 'World', '2022', 'five leading global stock exchanges', 'leading public capital pools', 'special purpose acquisition companies', 'big Chinese company listings', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'United States stock market', 'U.S. stock exchanges', 'U.S. stock market', 'five stock exchanges', 'United States-based NASDAQ', 'United States-based exchanges', 'ongoing economic condition', 'new macroeconomic conditions', 'U.S. market', 'global stock market', 'several stock exchanges', 'largest stock exchange', 'Shanghai Stock Exchange', 'stock market volatility', 'third highest drawdown', 'global central banks', 'interest rate hikes', 'corporation tax rates', 'current macroeconomic conditions', 'Japan Exchange Group', 'Asia Pacific region', 'prevailing market conditions', 'central banks‚Äô ability', 'third highest number', 'Prevailing recession fears', 'most regional companies', 'long-term growth plans', 'stock prices', 'global economy', 'unemployment rates', 'reduced interest', 'several initiatives', 'Chinese companies', 'diverse group', 'market cap', 'IPO market', 'American market', 'looming recession', 'same time', 'geopolitical tensions', 'growing concerns', 'widespread fears', 'recession environment', 'consumer spending', 'recent report', 'inflationary environment', 'main barrier', 'SPAC activity', 'slowing down', 'alternative channel', 'Covid-19 pandemic', 'regulatory changes', 'Asian markets', 'existing incentives', 'flexible regulations', 'most companies', 'different companies', 'three companies', 'listing activities', 'listing activity', 'skyrocketing inflation', 'private companies', 'extended impact', 'high-profile companies', 'Asia companies', 'residual factors', '459 companies', '144 companies', '2,123 companies', '32 companies', '1,981 companies', '13,838 companies', '0.84% growth', 'capitalization', 'plenty', 'turbulence', 'projections', 'situation', 'investors', 'signs', 'stability', 'data', 'Finbold', 'January', 'September', 'NYSE', 'Europe', 'Euronext', 'period', 'total', 'increase', 'emerging', 'commodities', 'potential', 'depressed', 'stocks', 'narrative', 'history', 'line', 'IPOs', 'rebound', 'demand', 'SPACs', 'vessel', 'performance', 'benefits', 'access', 'branding', 'visibility', 'accountability', 'liquidity', 'support', 'governments', 'optimism', 'Influx', 'uncertainty', 'China', 'appetite', 'threat', 'relationship', 'regions', 'outcome', '5.']",2022-10-17,2022-10-17,finbold.com

11662,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/leaders-in-trading-2022-meet-the-nominees-for-outstanding-exchange-group/,Leaders in Trading 2022: Meet the nominees for‚Ä¶. Outstanding Exchange Group,Learn more about the four firms shortlisted for our Editors‚Äô Choice Award for Outstanding Exchange Group this year: including Cboe Global Markets  Euronext  London Stock Exchange Group and SIX Swiss Exchange.,In the first of our introductions to the distinguished nominees for Leaders in Trading 2022  we bring you the shortlist for one of the most highly coveted awards of the industry: the category of Outstanding Exchange Group. Cboe Global Markets  Euronext  London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and SIX Swiss Exchange are all in the running  so read on for more information on their activities over the past year.Cboe Global MarketsCboe Global Markets needs no introduction. It‚Äôs a market giant covering equities  derivatives  digital assets and FX  across North America  Europe and Asia Pacific.It‚Äôs the activities of Cboe Europe that drove the nomination this year  however  and the past 12 months have been on many levels a landmark period for the exchange. In equities  it became Europe‚Äôs largest stock exchange by market share in April 2022 for the first time since January 2019  and has been the largest stock exchange by market share every month since June 2022  with an overall European equities market share of 24.9% in September 2022 ‚Äì its highest share since January 2016.The group also successfully launched Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX) in September 2021  an innovative  pan-European equity derivatives exchange. CEDX marked Cboe Europe‚Äôs first foray beyond cash equities and into derivatives and the initiative continues to build momentum  with over 13 000 contracts traded since launch and Open Interest peaking at over 1 600 in September.EuroCCP  Cboe‚Äôs wholly owned pan-European clearing house  provides clearing services for CEDX. Beyond its diversification into equity derivatives clearing  EuroCCP has also demonstrated solid performance in cash equities  where it remains the most-connected CCP in Europe  offering equities clearing services to 47 trading venues. It has seen strong gains in preferred clearing  with over 17% of total cash equity volumes on Euronext‚Äôs exchanges in Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon and Paris cleared via EuroCCP through this model as of 30 September  up from 2% at the start of the year.Cboe Europe also deserves a mention for its thought-leadership role  supporting and advocating (often vocally) within the industry on a wide range of issues. It recently collaborated with trade associations on a statement of principles for establishing an EU equity consolidated tape  for example  an issue on which its supportive position is well-known.Other key developments throughout the year include the appointment of Nick Dutton  Cboe Europe‚Äôs Chief Regulatory Officer  to the FCA‚Äôs Secondary Markets Advisory Committee and the group‚Äôs membership of the Sustainable Trading initiative in May.EuronextThe biggest pan-European exchange  connecting seven markets across the continent  Euronext had a strong year over 2021-22 with surging trading volumes and a series of successful acquisitions.The group saw its trading revenue swell to ‚Ç¨465.3 million in 2021  driven by its completed acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) in April. In its fourth quarter and full year results  the exchange operator confirmed a 27% growth of trading revenues  alongside yield management in cash trading offsetting lower volumes compared with 2020. Fixed income trading revenue also increased to ‚Ç¨65.8 million driven by a 45% growth year-on-year in its MTS cash trading activities.The strong performance has continued ‚Äì trading revenues more than doubled in the first quarter  despite the adverse geopolitical conditions  while the second quarter saw trading revenues jump a further 15% with robust performance across all asset classes.FX volumes have also been surging ‚Äì up 30% in September alone  one of the busiest months ever for the exchange  while on a quarterly scale  the average FX trading volume in Q3 2022 was comfortably above the $21.7 billion mark  up 24% from $17.5 billion a year earlier.In June this year  Euronext also entered into an agreement with Nexi for the acquisition of the former‚Äôs technology businesses  which currently powers Euronext‚Äôs fixed-income trading platform MTS and Euronext Securities Milan  in a further move to leverage its integrated value chain.London Stock Exchange GroupAt over 300 years old one of our most venerable of shortlisted candidates  LSEG has gone from strength to strength this year. The exchange group delivered a strong first half performance with continued revenue growth across businesses. Total income grew by ¬£717 million to ¬£3.7 billion  while its Data & Analytics business posted revenues up ¬£482 million to ¬£2.4 billion. Capital markets and post-trade have also been positive growth drivers for the group  with an especially strong performance in PTC derivatives on the post-trade side  as it supports clients seeking to manage risk given the ongoing uncertain rate environment.On the investment side  it‚Äôs been an exceptionally busy year for LSEG  which completed three acquisitions in 2022. Global Data Consortium Inc (GDC) globalised its digital identity and fraud prevention offering in the Customer & Third-Party Risk business; while the acquisition of MayStreet enhanced its Enterprise Data Solutions business  expanding LSEG‚Äôs capabilities across the latency spectrum through a global low latency network of over 300 cross asset  exchange and trading venue feeds. Finally  TORA came on board to provide multi-asset order and execution management capabilities  a major addition.The exchange has proven to be a valuable source of capital through the unprecedented market volatility of 2022  while the group has also been active in supporting wider regulatory reform. London Stock Exchange plc earlier this year launched of a new UK Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT)  comprising CEOs  chairs and industry leaders representing private and publicly listed companies  asset owners and managers and the advisory services that support their access to capital and investments  chaired by CEO Julia Hoggett.Finally  the Group has actively supported and invested in new technologies and FinTechs  including an investment into BondCliq to improve access to fixed income data  working with FinTech Simudyne to develop a next generation intelligence-based simulation environment for market participants  and of course the partnership between LSEG‚Äôs Turquoise and bookbuilding platform Appital.SIX Swiss ExchangeFinally  SIX Swiss Exchange is another worthy contender on the list. The group has had a busy year with numerous new products and services launched since 2021: including the introduction of block conditional orders for SwissAtMid (its non-displayed pool)  allowing participants to manage fragmentation and execute large blocks more efficiently.The group also launched SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) with a tokenised bond  the world‚Äôs first bond with a purely digital tranche ever issued in a fully regulated environment; while in July 2022 SDX launched the first ever tokenization of equity shares in a fully-regulated CSD based on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The group has been making a strong play in the digital assets space ‚Äì 2021 was a record year for products with crypto currencies as underlyings  with trading turnover CHF8.6 billion  (+673% year-on-year)  and the number of transactions growing by 634% year-on-year. It also saw 74 new ETPs listed with crypto currencies as underlying  including seven world premieres  and offers access to 16 crypto currencies ‚Äì the largest offering on any regulated exchange.We also saw the launch of Swiss EBBO (improved access to best price and depth of liquidity); the internationalisation of CONNEXOR (including roll-out in Asia-Pacific market); enhanced Quote on Demand (trading service to improve execution quality in ETFs and ETPs).The group has built out its technology further as well  with the expansion of the SIX Swiss Exchange European Microwave network operated by 12H to include low latency route linking Bergamo to Frankfurt. Integration work also started between SIX Swiss Exchange and BME technology platforms completing the first deliverable of the MDDX market data feed. The integration will add further products such as SpanishAtMid  blocks and is expected to provide an overall more complete  robust trading environment within the EU.The winner will be announced at the Leaders in Trading 2022 gala awards dinner at The Savoy Hotel on 3 November.
