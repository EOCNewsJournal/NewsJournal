Thanks to our newly enhanced portfolio  we have never been more confident to lead the growth of the spirits’ industry within the US market.”For Ron Snyder  “We are thrilled to join forces with such a savvy international powerhouse like Pernod Ricard. Our goal for Código has always been to produce and share the best possible tequila. What started as simply enjoying our tasty tequila with friends in Mexico  quickly grew into an aspiration to share Código with discerning consumers around the world.To gain the backing of Pernod Ricard is a powerful alliance  and a logical progression that will benefit consumers with an expanded reach through our collaborative growth. We look forward to working closely with Alex  Ann & the Pernod Ricard team as we build our brand globally.”Perella Weinberg Partners acted as financial advisor to Pernod Ricard and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP acted as its legal advisor.

Altnua will focus on developing utility scale projects from the ground up working with landowners and local developers as well as corporate off-takers to achieve their net zero goals.Bill Sadlier will lead the new business as Chief Executive Officer. Prior to establishing Altnua  Mr Sadlier served as the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director at BNRG where he led the business through transformative private equity deals on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Sadlier has an extensive track record in the renewable energy industry having developed  financed  and delivered over 1 GW of renewable capacity in Europe and North America since 2004 with businesses including NTR plc.“Joining Alternus at this pivotal point  when demand for clean energy is greater than ever  will allow Altnua to respond to critical decarbonisation targets and contribute to future growth for the group. I am confident as part of Alternus  Altnua has the right foundation  resources  and expertise to create an industry leading development business. We have an ambitious vision for this business with a goal of adding over 5GW’s of organically developed operational parks to the Alternus portfolio by the end of the decade ” said Bill Sadlier.As part of Alternus  Altnua can take a responsible long-term approach to developing projects  on a ‘develop to own’ basis  across a range of technologies using innovative energy solutions. A central theme of Altnua’s growth strategy will be the acquisition of development businesses to scale their portfolios. A number of executives and professionals are expected to join Altnua in the coming months as Bill Sadlier builds out the team to execute on the ambitious plan.“Establishing a specialist development business led by an experienced team is the next logical step for Alternus as we continue in our current growth path. As long-term owners of clean energy projects  we see tremendous value by stepping in earlier in the value chain. This allows us to reduce our overall capital expenditure and to optimise the long-term design and operation of the projects from inception  including the use of storage and other hybrid solutions. This will also provide an assured pipeline of future operational parks to support better planning and use of group resources.

Continue reading The post World’s five largest stock exchanges list over 450 new companies in 2022 despite recession fears app…,The global stock market has experienced plenty of turbulence in 2022  with projections the situation could worsen amid a looming recession as investors continue worrying about the central banks’ ability to stabilize the economy. Despite the fears  several stock exchanges continue to record listings by different companies as the market monitors for any signs of stability.In particular  data acquired and calculated by Finbold indicates that the five leading global stock exchanges have cumulatively listed 459 companies between January 2022 and September 2022.United States-based NASDAQ  with a market capitalization of $18.59 trillion  has listed the highest number of companies at 174 representing a growth of 4.81% to 3 788. At the same time  the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  the largest stock exchange with a capitalization of $24.19 trillion  listed the second most with 144 companies to 2 578 or a growth of 5.91%.In Asia  the Shanghai Stock Exchange added the third highest number of companies at 106 representing a growth of 5.25%. The exchange has 2 123 companies with a capitalization of $6.87 trillion. Japan Exchange Group  with a capitalization of $5.29 trillion  ranks fourth  having listed 32 companies  from 3 795 to 3 827 or 0.84% growth.Elsewhere  Europe’s Euronext listed only three companies over the period. The exchange  with $5.62 trillion in market cap  has a total of 1 981 companies. As of January 2022  the five stock exchanges hosted 13 838 companies. The number of listed companies cumulatively grew 3.31% to 14 297 as of September 2022.Prevailing recession fearsThe increase in the number of publicly listed companies appears to defy the ongoing economic condition impacted by both emerging and residual factors. Notably  the global economy is facing geopolitical tensions  stock market volatility  growing concerns regarding commodities  the impact of inflation and continued interest rate hikes. These conditions have culminated in widespread fears that a recession might be imminent.Notably  a recession environment has the potential to result in depressed stock prices since consumer spending usually decreases with an increase in unemployment rates. Additionally  investors become more risk-averse with reduced interest in investing in stocks. This narrative is complemented by a recent report that indicated that the United States stock market is undergoing its third highest drawdown in history in 2022.However  the listing activities could potentially be higher since it can be assumed that most companies have likely paused their plans to go public. In this line  they are potentially re-evaluating their plans to ensure they can adapt to the new macroeconomic conditions. The listing activity might spike in 2023 once the inflationary environment eases and companies have the stability to meet their long-term growth plans through IPOs.Overall  the IPO market will potentially record a rebound once the stock market registers increased demand. However  this ability will depend on how global central banks handle the skyrocketing inflation  which remains the main barrier.Depressed SPAC activityInterestingly  the listing activities have come amid the slowing down of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)  which were used prominently as an alternative channel for private companies going public. Indeed  most companies that went public through this vessel have recorded slowed performance  a factor that has potentially deterred investors.From the data  United States-based exchanges are leading in the number of newly listed companies. Historically  listing on the U.S. stock market comes with benefits such as access to capital  improved branding and visibility  accountability  and increased liquidity while operating in a well-regulated market.At the same time  stock exchanges in the Asia Pacific region are attracting companies despite significantly reeling from the extended impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. However  several initiatives  including support from governments and central banks  are driving optimism among high-profile companies. Notably  most regional companies remain cautious due to factors like geopolitical tensions and regulatory changes.Influx of Asia companies into U.S. marketConsequently  the uncertainty in Asian markets  especially China  has forced some companies to explore the American market. Notably  the U.S. stock exchanges have an appetite for big Chinese company listings.Listing in the U.S. offers Chinese companies access to some of the leading public capital pools and a diverse group of investors. However  geopolitical tensions have paused the threat of destabilizing the relationship.Away from the prevailing market conditions  the exchanges are still attracting companies due to factors like existing incentives. Notably  some regions are known to have reduced corporation tax rates and flexible regulations.In general  the outcome of the current macroeconomic conditions will be central to influencing the listing of companies.,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,mixed,0.05,0.1,0.85,True,English,"['five largest stock exchanges list', '450 new companies', 'recession fears', 'World', '2022', 'five leading global stock exchanges', 'leading public capital pools', 'special purpose acquisition companies', 'big Chinese company listings', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'United States stock market', 'U.S. stock exchanges', 'U.S. stock market', 'five stock exchanges', 'United States-based NASDAQ', 'United States-based exchanges', 'ongoing economic condition', 'new macroeconomic conditions', 'U.S. market', 'global stock market', 'several stock exchanges', 'largest stock exchange', 'Shanghai Stock Exchange', 'stock market volatility', 'third highest drawdown', 'global central banks', 'interest rate hikes', 'corporation tax rates', 'current macroeconomic conditions', 'Japan Exchange Group', 'Asia Pacific region', 'prevailing market conditions', 'central banks’ ability', 'third highest number', 'Prevailing recession fears', 'most regional companies', 'long-term growth plans', 'stock prices', 'global economy', 'unemployment rates', 'reduced interest', 'several initiatives', 'Chinese companies', 'diverse group', 'market cap', 'IPO market', 'American market', 'looming recession', 'same time', 'geopolitical tensions', 'growing concerns', 'widespread fears', 'recession environment', 'consumer spending', 'recent report', 'inflationary environment', 'main barrier', 'SPAC activity', 'slowing down', 'alternative channel', 'Covid-19 pandemic', 'regulatory changes', 'Asian markets', 'existing incentives', 'flexible regulations', 'most companies', 'different companies', 'three companies', 'listing activities', 'listing activity', 'skyrocketing inflation', 'private companies', 'extended impact', 'high-profile companies', 'Asia companies', 'residual factors', '459 companies', '144 companies', '2,123 companies', '32 companies', '1,981 companies', '13,838 companies', '0.84% growth', 'capitalization', 'plenty', 'turbulence', 'projections', 'situation', 'investors', 'signs', 'stability', 'data', 'Finbold', 'January', 'September', 'NYSE', 'Europe', 'Euronext', 'period', 'total', 'increase', 'emerging', 'commodities', 'potential', 'depressed', 'stocks', 'narrative', 'history', 'line', 'IPOs', 'rebound', 'demand', 'SPACs', 'vessel', 'performance', 'benefits', 'access', 'branding', 'visibility', 'accountability', 'liquidity', 'support', 'governments', 'optimism', 'Influx', 'uncertainty', 'China', 'appetite', 'threat', 'relationship', 'regions', 'outcome', '5.']",2022-10-17,2022-10-18,finbold.com

But if we focus solely on the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  we see that Paris generated 3.2% of global auction turnover in 2000  but only 2.6% in 2021 and only 1.8% in H1 2022.Contemporary Art auction turnover per city: 2000 vs. 2021New York: $59 million in 2000 – $955 million in 2021Hong Kong: $558 000 – $700 million in 2021London: $13 million in 2000 – $432 million in 2021Paris: $3 million in 2000 – $73 million in 2021It is this context that prompted the RMN (Réunion des Musées Nationaux) to launch a call-for-tender to rent its Grand-Palais for a new Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Previously granted to the FIAC for almost half a century  it has now been granted to the MCH group for the next seven years. The innovative proposals of the ""Art Basel"" fairs  organized by the MCH Group in Basel  Miami and Hong Kong  should revitalize a Parisian marketplace that has become a little too complacent. So instead of the 48th edition of the FIAC  the City of Light is about to discover the ""grand premiere"" of Paris+.The Marcel Duchamp Prize awarded to...The month of October is of considerable importance for the Parisian art market with numerous events profiting from the magnetic pull of its major Contemporary art fair. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the ADIAF to award the Marcel Duchamp prize to one of the four artists shortlisted this year: Giulia Andreani  Iván Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard. Artprice is proud to support this initiative and congratulates the 2022 winner  Mimosa Echard.www.adiaf.com/le-prix-marcel-duchamp-2022/www.artprice.com/artist/544338/mimosas-echard/lots/pastsDuring the week of 17-23 October  Artprice has identified no less than twenty Fine Art auction sales in the French capital.

For the time being  Phillips is concentrating on the New York - London - Hong Kong dynamic for its high-end sales in its specialty fields: Contemporary and Post-War art (along with watches  jewelry  and design).Bonhams  on the other hand  is following a completely different expansion strategy with the acquisition of Cornette de Saint-Cyr  active in both France and Belgium.

The Tezos Blockchain – of French origin – has also become one of Art Basel's main partners.As we mentioned  Paris is indeed struggling to assert itself on the Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market. Its best three auction results above $20 million in the first half of 2022 were for Old and Modern works:Woman Walking [I] by Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collectionby Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collection Basket of Wild Strawberries attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquinattributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquin A Nude Man with two Figures reattributed by Christie's to MichelangeloIn H1 2022  the best French result for a Contemporary work (i.e. one created by an artist born after 1945) capped at $1 million  a threshold that  this year  has already been crossed 47 times in Hong Kong  51 times in London and 71 times in New York.Artprice by Artmarket's latest Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report highlights the difficulties France faces when it comes to nurturing its own Contemporary art scene.

This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  including Skarstedt  David Zwirner  and Peter Kilchmann  as well as the addition of new branches for Gagosian and Continua  and the inauguration of the Pinault Collection at the former Bourse de Commerce (Trade Exchange). Taken together  these developments clearly illustrate Paris's ambitions to recover a dominant position in the global art market in the post-Covid and post-Brexit eras.Fine Art auction turnover in Paris  London  and Hong Kong Fine Art auction turnover by period (in 2021) Paris vs. London and Hong Kong""Because of its history  Paris will always remain a center for Modern and Impressionist art; but the French capital must today forge a place for itself in Contemporary art and  indeed  in Ultra-Contemporary art  or risk missing the digital train altogether""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The efforts deployed by the United States after WWII demonstrated the influence a strong market can have in stimulating artistic creativity and giving it international visibility. This is why we are very proud with Artmarket.com to support the ADIAF ((Association for the International Dissemination of French Art) and the Marcel Duchamp prize"".A complacent Parisian marketOver the past twenty years  fine art auction turnover has progressed at the same rate in France as in the rest of the world  both in terms of the volume of transactions and auction turnover. But if we focus solely on the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  we see that Paris generated 3.2% of global auction turnover in 2000  but only 2.6% in 2021 and only 1.8% in H1 2022.Contemporary Art auction turnover per city: 2000 vs. 2021New York: $59 million in 2000 – $955 million in 2021Hong Kong: $558 000 – $700 million in 2021London: $13 million in 2000 – $432 million in 2021Paris: $3 million in 2000 – $73 million in 2021It is this context that prompted the RMN (Réunion des Musées Nationaux) to launch a call-for-tender to rent its Grand-Palais for a new Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Previously granted to the FIAC for almost half a century  it has now been granted to the MCH group for the next seven years. The innovative proposals of the ""Art Basel"" fairs  organized by the MCH Group in Basel  Miami and Hong Kong  should revitalize a Parisian marketplace that has become a little too complacent. So instead of the 48th edition of the FIAC  the City of Light is about to discover the ""grand premiere"" of Paris+.The Marcel Duchamp Prize awarded to...The month of October is of considerable importance for the Parisian art market with numerous events profiting from the magnetic pull of its major Contemporary art fair. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the ADIAF to award the Marcel Duchamp prize to one of the four artists shortlisted this year: Giulia Andreani  Iván Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard. Artprice is proud to support this initiative and congratulates the 2022 winner  Mimosa Echard.www.adiaf.com/le-prix-marcel-duchamp-2022/www.artprice.com/artist/544338/mimosas-echard/lots/pastsDuring the week of 17-23 October  Artprice has identified no less than twenty Fine Art auction sales in the French capital. Christie's will be hosting two major sessions there (""Modern Art"" and ""Avant-Garde(s)"")  and will also be dispersing the magnificent African collection of Béatrice and Patrick Caput.Sotheby's  for its part  has chosen to host its major Fine Art sales the following week (24-26 October)  considering Paris+ and the tumult that will accompany it as a perfect springboard.""Phillips will not be opening an auction room soon in France""The world's third-largest auction house  by Fine Art turnover  has confirmed it does not intend to host sales in the French capital. For the time being  Phillips is concentrating on the New York - London - Hong Kong dynamic for its high-end sales in its specialty fields: Contemporary and Post-War art (along with watches  jewelry  and design).Bonhams  on the other hand  is following a completely different expansion strategy with the acquisition of Cornette de Saint-Cyr  active in both France and Belgium. Without overshadowing the French capital  Brussels offers a fairly natural development opportunity for many players in the Parisian art market. The Templon  Obadia  and Almine Rech galleries have gradually set up there  while others prefer Geneva or Luxembourg: two cities with free ports.Operation ""Contemporary Art and NFTs""The MCH Group has made Contemporary art the principal locomotive of its Art Basel editions by selecting only the most prestigious local and international galleries and creating synergies with the world of fashion and technology (hence the ""+"" sign in the name of the fair). The Tezos Blockchain – of French origin – has also become one of Art Basel's main partners.As we mentioned  Paris is indeed struggling to assert itself on the Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market. Its best three auction results above $20 million in the first half of 2022 were for Old and Modern works:Woman Walking [I] by Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collectionby Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collection Basket of Wild Strawberries attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquinattributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquin A Nude Man with two Figures reattributed by Christie's to MichelangeloIn H1 2022  the best French result for a Contemporary work (i.e. one created by an artist born after 1945) capped at $1 million  a threshold that  this year  has already been crossed 47 times in Hong Kong  51 times in London and 71 times in New York.Artprice by Artmarket's latest Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report highlights the difficulties France faces when it comes to nurturing its own Contemporary art scene. For example  in 2021  paintings by Claire Tabouret – the most successful French artist under 40 at auction – were sold in London (49% of her auction turnover)  New York (30%)  and Hong Kong (20%).Paris+ by Art Basel  therefore  has a mission to put the French capital back at the heart of the international Contemporary art market  while embracing its history and its specificity.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image1-ArtMarket-Turnover-CA-Paris.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image2-Paris-vs-London-vs-HongKong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Banks are no longer “trying to do every single thing ourselves  and every single thing all the time ” Butler continued. Partnerships allow more potential for scaling  and enhance investor protection.Samuel Riley  head of securites services at Clearstream  agreed  commenting that a variety of participants across the industry will play important roles in the development of this area — there will be no single presence  rather a collection of interconnected players.Stephen Prosperi  head of product development and digital securities management at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation  cited a “culture shift”  in which banks are far more willing to partner with fintechs than they have been in the past.Clients are demanding a “one-stop shop” that can provide services throughout the entire portfolio and lifecycle  Butler claimed  something that requires banks to partner with other companies to provide. Through this collaboration an ecosystem will be constructed  she said  providing clients with a trusted platform that can meet their expectations.Nadine Chakar  executive vice president of State Street DigitalSM  admitted that building technology is not banks’ strong suit  and that as a result  partnerships with those who can provide these services are essential if they want to keep up the pace of development.She added that startups bring “hunger and innovation” to their operations  providing a “breath of fresh air” for banks  accelerating processes  and building intellectual capital on both sides of the exchange.Justin Chapman  global head of digital assets and financial markets at Northern Trust  acknowledged that there may be difficulties in this approach  as it can be challenging to work with smaller companies  however he concurred with the panel that partnerships are ultimately worth it.Chapman also observed that investors are less interested in whether assets are digital or not — their focus is on asset and liquidity availability. Other speakers  such as Riley  suggested that companies must find a way to bridge the gap between traditional and digital assets  as this is something that clients do not have the power to do themselves. “You have to link the old with the new ” he said  a sentiment echoed by other panellists.An emerging issue for the market is regulation  the speakers agreed. Chakar brought up the problem of clients not fitting into existing regulatory frameworks  while Chapman stated that “none of this works unless you bring an issuer to the table”. Although the ecosystem is developing at a rapid rate  it still has a long way to go; institutional investors “need safety guide rails” if they are going to invest in digital assets  Butler added.However  Chakar reassured that  generally  technology leads and regulation follows — and with the speed that digital assets are developing  it seems likely that we will see more regulation soon.Butler concluded that the core investment in the market over the next few years must be around risk  compliance  and governance  with a need for more education and stronger investor protection essential.Finishing the panel with a question for the future  the speakers were asked what percentage of assets under custody they expect to be digital by 2030. All five responded with at least 10 per cent  with Riley emphasising the speed with which the market is moving  and the unpredictability of where it will head next.,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.0,mixed,0.25,0.03,0.73,True,English,"['digital asset tech', 'SIBOS panellists', 'Industry', 'executive vice president', 'State Street DigitalSM', 'existing regulatory frameworks', 'safety guide rails', 'digital securities management', 'stronger investor protection', 'digital asset tech', 'banks’ strong suit', 'digital assets ecosystem', 'SIBOS conference', 'BNY Mellon', 'single thing', 'important roles', 'single presence', 'interconnected players', 'Stephen Prosperi', 'Depository Trust', 'Clearing Corporation', 'culture shift', 'one-stop shop', 'entire portfolio', 'trusted platform', 'building technology', 'fresh air', 'intellectual capital', 'financial markets', 'Northern Trust', 'liquidity availability', 'emerging issue', 'rapid rate', 'technology leads', 'core investment', '10 per cent', 'other companies', 'smaller companies', 'SIBOS panellists', 'other panellists', 'future plans', 'securites services', 'long way', 'institutional investors', 'Samuel Riley', 'Nadine Chakar', 'Justin Chapman', 'global head', 'Caroline Butler', 'product development', 'Other speakers', 'custody services', 'Industry', 'Collaboration', 'year', 'conclusion', 'battle', 'name', 'odds', 'observations', 'insights', 'CEO', 'cross-pollination', 'talent', 'fintechs', 'Partnerships', 'potential', 'Clearstream', 'variety', 'participants', 'area', 'collection', 'past', 'Clients', 'lifecycle', 'something', 'expectations', 'result', 'pace', 'startups', 'hunger', 'innovation', 'operations', 'breath', 'processes', 'sides', 'exchange', 'difficulties', 'approach', 'focus', 'gap', 'traditional', 'power', 'sentiment', 'regulation', 'problem', 'issuer', 'table', 'speed', 'next', 'risk', 'compliance', 'governance', 'need', 'education', 'question', 'percentage', 'unpredictability']",2022-10-18,2022-10-18,assetservicingtimes.com

Oct. 18  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with ca…,PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Oct. 18  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced execution of a final agreement with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) to re-align approximately €30.7 million in outstanding debt obligations with the Company’s expected development and commercialization timelines. Nanobiotix previously announced agreement-in-principle with EIB for this restructuring on September 12th  2022.The original finance contract and royalty agreement established between Nanobiotix and EIB in July 2018 included an initial tranche of €16.0 million drawn in October 2018 and repayable in a single installment at maturity in 2023; and a second tranche of €14.0 million granted in March 2019 and repayable in semi-annual installments of principal and interest after a two-year grace period. The agreement also included a commitment to an annual royalty payment in the low single-digits over a six-year period beginning January 2021.Terms and Conditions of the Restructuring AgreementThe newly executed restructuring agreement enables Nanobiotix to defer repayment of the remaining €25.3 million in principal for both tranches up to June 2029.Under the terms of the agreement  €5.4 million in interest accrued on the first tranche since 2018 will be restructured as payment-in-kind (“PIK”) and will be deferred up to October 2024. Going forward  principal from the first tranche will accrue interest at the rate of 6% annually  with such interest being capitalized and due as PIK interest at maturity. Interest on the remaining €9.3 million in principal from the second tranche will continue to accrue at a 5% fixed rate paid in semi-annual installments through June 2029.The annual royalty payment remains in the low single-digits and continues to cover a six-year period but has been re-aligned to begin as of the first year of NBTXR3 commercialization.The restructuring agreement also includes a new milestone payment of €20 million due in June 2029.While the restructuring of the finance and royalty agreement is intended to align debt obligations with the Company’s anticipated commercial timelines  the agreement contains provisions that would accelerate the maturity and repayment schedule  should Nanobiotix generate commercial revenue prior to June 2029. Specifically  principal and interest accrued on the first tranche following the amendment would be due in a single installment at the earlier of four years after commercialization or June 2029. Semi-annual principal repayments for the second tranche would resume with a maturity date at the earlier of three years following commercialization or June 2029. Finally  an accelerated redemption schedule for the new €20 million milestone payment would be triggered calling for the repayment in two equal installments due one year and two years after commercialization  respectively.Further  should the company secure non-dilutive capital through the execution of any business development deal  the €5.4 million PIK interest payment associated with the first tranche would be due by October 2023 and an accelerated redemption schedule for the new €20 million milestone payment would be triggered. The accelerated redemption schedule would reflect a prorated payment amount not exceeding 10% of any upfront or milestone payment received by Nanobiotix with any remaining balance of the €20 million milestone payment due at maturity.As part of the restructuring  Nanobiotix has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance equal to the outstanding principal owed to EIB. All other covenants included in the 2018 finance contract remain unchanged.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

We are now confident of delivering circa +8.5% organic growth versus +6 to +7% previously  with an operating margin at close to 18% and a Free Cash Flow close to €1.6bn.Our Q3 numbers are clearly encouraging. But what really stands out is our performance versus pre-pandemic levels. Compared to 2019  we’ve seen our organic growth accelerate to +16% in Q3. This demonstrates our ability to more than withstand the ups and downs of the global economy  and makes us confident in our ability to face ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.I’d like to thank our clients for their partnership. I also want to say a big ‘merci’ to all of our people for their outstanding efforts. In a context where inflation is impacting the daily lives of many of them  we want to ensure we are giving additional support where it is most needed as we enter the holiday season.

At constant parities  the revenue growth was -0.2%  in a context of anticipated slowing market growth  compared to a third quarter 2021 that had been exceptional. Asia Pacific (+6.8% at constant rates) and Africa/Middle East (+18.3% at constant rates) regions are growing in the quarter due particularly to performance in India  Australia and Turkey. All other areas are behind over the period impacted by a high comparison base for the European area (-1.8% at constant rates)  and the United States (-6.6% at a constant rate) which had experienced remarkable growth in the third quarter of 2021 due to new product launches (Clomicalm  Itrafungol  petfood iVet  Milbehart…). Lastly  Latin America (-6.8% at constant exchange rates) is strongly impacted by Chile  which is down over the quarter due to an unfavorable base effect  following the rebound observed in the third quarter of 2021  as well as the decline in sales of antibiotic and parasiticide products for salmon  following the suspension by the Chilean maritime authority of the marketing authorization for a parasiticide product in distribution.Cumulative consolidated reve nue at the end of SeptemberOur revenue through to the end of September was €921.2 million  compared with €817.7 million  representing an overall increase of +12.7% compared with the same period in 2021. Adjusted for the favorable impact of exchange rates  revenue shows growth of +7.7%. This growth benefited  in part  from a favorable baseline effect representing 0.5 point of growth in revenue  attributable to new products acquired starting in the second quarter of 2021. All areas are growing organically at the end of September  despite a slowdown in the market. In Asia Pacific  the growth at real rates is +17.9% (+12.1% at constant exchange rates)  India and Australia continue to derive growth from the area  thanks to products for cattle  representing approximately 80% of the area’s growth. In Europe  revenue grew by +4% at real rates (+3.5% at constant rates). The main countries contributing to this performance are the United Kingdom  France  Italy  Germany and Spain  carried by the strong dynamism of the ranges for companion animals (in particular the ranges of petfood  specialties  and the vaccines)  which offset the withdrawal of antibiotic ranges for food producing animals. In the United States  business grew by +23.2% (+9.5% at constant exchange rates). It benefited from strong sales of new products launched in 2021 (Clomicalm and Itrafungol) and those launched in early 2022 (petfood  and for the production animals segment Tulissin)  as well as good performance on the dental and dermatology range. Finally  in Latin America  business grew by +18.1% at actual rates (+6.8% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to the contribution of Mexico and Brazil  which offset the decline in Chile.In terms of species  revenue in the companion animal segment grew overall by +14.4% at real rates (+10.1% at constant exchange rates)  mainly driven by very good double-digit growth in the petfood  specialty  and dental ranges. The food producing animal segment also posted growth of +12.0% at real rates (+6.2% at constant exchange rates)  driven by the ruminant sector (+11.2% at constant rates)  which compensates for the decline in the pig-poultry (-5.1% at constant rates) and aquaculture (-10.8% at constant rates) segments compared to the same period of 2021  and this mainly due to the decline in sales of vaccines as well as the suspension of the marketing of the aforementioned parasiticide product.OutlookRevenue growth at constant rates and perimeter is now expected to be in a range of between 6% and 9%. The ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions” to “revenue” should be in a range of between 14% and 15% at constant exchange rates. Finally  our deleveraging should be around 30 million € excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates.CONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin millions of euros 2022 2021 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates 1 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope 1 First quarter revenue 318.1 266.5 +19.3% +16.2% +16.2% Second-quarter revenue 298.3 262.9 +13.5% +7.8% +7.8% Third-quarter revenue 304.9 288.2 +5.8% -0.2% -0.2% Revenue at the end of September 921.2 817.7 +12.7% +7.7% +7.7%A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

With a +46% increase in new bookings  this quarter is in line with our first half year 2022 performance of +42%. These business results are mainly driven by international markets  notably our successes in North America which already represents 41% of total bookings for the period. In addition to this  and for the first time in its history  Sidetrade has achieved more than half of its revenue  53%  internationally with 23% generated in North America. The ramp-up in our North American salesforce  supported by our new business hub in Calgary (Canada)  will further accelerate this momentum in the quarters ahead. Sidetrade is definitively taking an important step in its development.”Record new bookings in Q3 2022 with a +46% increaseAfter reporting a +42% increase for SaaS orders in the first half of 2022  Sidetrade delivered a record-high third-quarter performance  generating €1.38 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) in Q3 2022  compared with €0.95 million in Q3 2021; a +46% increase. The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) represents €3.87 million of Total Contract Value (“TCV”) in Q3 2022 versus €2.42 million in Q3 2021; a +60% increase.68% of total bookings were international  and 41% from North AmericaIn Q3 2022  international orders represented more than 68% of all bookings with significant business successes in Europe  Latin America and North America.Just over one year after the Company launched operations in North America  this market has become a major growth driver  accounting for 41% of total bookings in Q3 2022 (58% in the first half of 2022). Note that this performance surpassed the Company’s initial target of achieving more than one-third of its bookings in North America by the second half of 2022.To these SaaS bookings should be added €0.89 million of services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.)  compared with €0.63 million in Q3 2021  a +41% increase. In total and considering that almost all of these services will be invoiced over the next twelve months  Q3 2022 enables Sidetrade to add the equivalent of €2.27 million in Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) compared to €1.58 million in Q3 2021  a +44% increase.Overall  in Q3 2022  bookings by new customers (“New Business”) and Cross-selling represented 81% of the total versus 75% on average in recent quarters  with the remaining 19% of bookings accounting for Upselling of additional modules to existing customers.Lastly  it should be noted that as with all existing contracts  the new contracts include an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on changes in price indices for the relevant country.In an inflationary market environment  now more than ever  businesses must deploy efficient solutions to manage their Order-to-Cash process as they face a twofold challenge: to consolidate cash reserves with multiple hikes in interest rates while generating productivity gains to address salary increases and recruitment difficulties. This trend is expected to continue over the next 12 to 24 months with an additional increased future risk of future recession in certain countries. In this disrupted context  the management of operating working capital  and particularly accounts receivable  is a major challenge for all finance departments.Acceleration in Order-to-Cash SaaS subscription revenue by 23% and revenue by 12%  driven by international ordersSidetrade(€m) Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 9.1 7.7 +19% of which SaaS Subscriptions 7.7 6.2 +23% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.2 0.6 -72% Revenue 9.2 8.2 +12%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities grew very sharply by +19% in Q3 2022  driven by +23% growth in SaaS subscriptions. The growth in this recurring revenue is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year  which will continue to impact revenue growth throughout the 2022 fiscal year.‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities  a core business within the Company’s strategy since 2019  now represent 98% of total revenue as of Q3 2022.The ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities  which have become secondary to Sidetrade’s activities  now account for only 2% of total revenue in this quarter  and will continue to decline  with estimated revenue of €0.9 million at end-2022.Total revenue grew by +12% in Q3 2022  to €9.2 million. This performance is supported by solid growth drivers in international markets which  for the first time in the Company’s history  represent 53% of total revenue  including 23% for North America.Sidetrade’s economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring  representing a significant advantage in the current and future environment.All of these multi-year contracts are indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States)  which alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices.Sidetrade therefore has robust pricing power that protects the Company’s future revenue against uncertainties and inflationary pressures. At present  Sidetrade perfectly combines its sound fundamentals with a highly favorable growth outlook.Next financial announcementAnnual Revenue for 2022: January 24  2023  after the stock market closesInvestor & Media relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsRebecca Parlby +44 7824 505 584 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  including Skarstedt  David Zwirner  and Peter Kilchmann  as well as the addition of new branches for Gagosian and Continua  and the inauguration of the Pinault Collection at the former Bourse de Commerce (Trade Exchange). Taken together  these developments clearly illustrate Paris's ambitions to recover a dominant position in the global art market in the post-Covid and post-Brexit eras.Fine Art auction turnover in Paris  London  and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com) Fine Art auction turnover by period (in 2021) Paris vs. London and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com)""Because of its history  Paris will always remain a center for Modern and Impressionist art; but the French capital must today forge a place for itself in Contemporary art and  indeed  in Ultra-Contemporary art  or risk missing the digital train altogether""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The efforts deployed by the United States after WWII demonstrated the influence a strong market can have in stimulating artistic creativity and giving it international visibility. This is why we are very proud with Artmarket.com to support the ADIAF ((Association for the International Dissemination of French Art) and the Marcel Duchamp prize"".A complacent Parisian marketOver the past twenty years  fine art auction turnover has progressed at the same rate in France as in the rest of the world  both in terms of the volume of transactions and auction turnover. But if we focus solely on the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  we see that Paris generated 3.2% of global auction turnover in 2000  but only 2.6% in 2021 and only 1.8% in H1 2022.Contemporary Art auction turnover per city: 2000 vs. 2021New York: $59 million in 2000 – $955 million in 2021Hong Kong: $558 000 – $700 million in 2021London: $13 million in 2000 – $432 million in 2021Paris: $3 million in 2000 – $73 million in 2021It is this context that prompted the RMN (Réunion des Musées Nationaux) to launch a call-for-tender to rent its Grand-Palais for a new Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Previously granted to the FIAC for almost half a century  it has now been granted to the MCH group for the next seven years. The innovative proposals of the ""Art Basel"" fairs  organized by the MCH Group in Basel  Miami and Hong Kong  should revitalize a Parisian marketplace that has become a little too complacent. So instead of the 48th edition of the FIAC  the City of Light is about to discover the ""grand premiere"" of Paris+.The Marcel Duchamp Prize awarded to...The month of October is of considerable importance for the Parisian art market with numerous events profiting from the magnetic pull of its major Contemporary art fair. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the ADIAF to award the Marcel Duchamp prize to one of the four artists shortlisted this year: Giulia Andreani  Iván Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard. Artprice is proud to support this initiative and congratulates the 2022 winner  Mimosa Echard.www.adiaf.com/le-prix-marcel-duchamp-2022/www.artprice.com/artist/544338/mimosas-echard/lots/pastsDuring the week of 17-23 October  Artprice has identified no less than twenty Fine Art auction sales in the French capital. Christie's will be hosting two major sessions there (""Modern Art"" and ""Avant-Garde(s)"")  and will also be dispersing the magnificent African collection of Béatrice and Patrick Caput.Sotheby's  for its part  has chosen to host its major Fine Art sales the following week (24-26 October)  considering Paris+ and the tumult that will accompany it as a perfect springboard.""Phillips will not be opening an auction room soon in France""The world's third-largest auction house  by Fine Art turnover  has confirmed it does not intend to host sales in the French capital. For the time being  Phillips is concentrating on the New York - London - Hong Kong dynamic for its high-end sales in its specialty fields: Contemporary and Post-War art (along with watches  jewelry  and design).Bonhams  on the other hand  is following a completely different expansion strategy with the acquisition of Cornette de Saint-Cyr  active in both France and Belgium. Without overshadowing the French capital  Brussels offers a fairly natural development opportunity for many players in the Parisian art market. The Templon  Obadia  and Almine Rech galleries have gradually set up there  while others prefer Geneva or Luxembourg: two cities with free ports.Operation ""Contemporary Art and NFTs""The MCH Group has made Contemporary art the principal locomotive of its Art Basel editions by selecting only the most prestigious local and international galleries and creating synergies with the world of fashion and technology (hence the ""+"" sign in the name of the fair). The Tezos Blockchain – of French origin – has also become one of Art Basel's main partners.As we mentioned  Paris is indeed struggling to assert itself on the Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market. Its best three auction results above $20 million in the first half of 2022 were for Old and Modern works:Woman Walking [I] by Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collectionby Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collection Basket of Wild Strawberries attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquinattributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquin A Nude Man with two Figures reattributed by Christie's to MichelangeloIn H1 2022  the best French result for a Contemporary work (i.e. one created by an artist born after 1945) capped at $1 million  a threshold that  this year  has already been crossed 47 times in Hong Kong  51 times in London and 71 times in New York.Artprice by Artmarket's latest Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report highlights the difficulties France faces when it comes to nurturing its own Contemporary art scene. For example  in 2021  paintings by Claire Tabouret – the most successful French artist under 40 at auction – were sold in London (49% of her auction turnover)  New York (30%)  and Hong Kong (20%).Paris+ by Art Basel  therefore  has a mission to put the French capital back at the heart of the international Contemporary art market  while embracing its history and its specificity.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image1-ArtMarket-Turnover-CA-Paris.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image2-Paris-vs-London-vs-HongKong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Publicis Sapient continued to perform strongly with +18.1% organic growth  and Epsilon saw an acceleration to +13.9% organic growth this quarter.All of our regions posted solid organic growth  with both the U.S. and Europe at +11.1%  and China at +5.9% despite the ongoing lockdowns there.Furthermore  our new business record continues to place us at the top of industry rankings on a 12-month basis  well ahead of competition.Overall  our results since the beginning of the year mean that today we are in a position to upgrade our full year 2022 guidance for the second time. We are now confident of delivering circa +8.5% organic growth versus +6 to +7% previously  with an operating margin at close to 18% and a Free Cash Flow close to €1.6bn.Our Q3 numbers are clearly encouraging. But what really stands out is our performance versus pre-pandemic levels. Compared to 2019  we’ve seen our organic growth accelerate to +16% in Q3. This demonstrates our ability to more than withstand the ups and downs of the global economy  and makes us confident in our ability to face ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.I’d like to thank our clients for their partnership. I also want to say a big ‘merci’ to all of our people for their outstanding efforts. In a context where inflation is impacting the daily lives of many of them  we want to ensure we are giving additional support where it is most needed as we enter the holiday season. That is why we are granting next month an additional one-week salary to half of our team members who do not have any variable remuneration and have contributed to everything we have achieved over the past year. ”NET REVENUE IN Q3 2022Publicis Groupe's net revenue in Q3 2022 was 3 237 million euros compared to 2 621 million euros in Q3 2021  increasing by +23.5%.

This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  including Skarstedt  David Zwirner  and Peter Kilchmann  as well as the addition of new branches for Gagosian and Continua  and the inauguration of the Pinault Collection at the former Bourse de Commerce (Trade Exchange). Taken together  these developments clearly illustrate Paris's ambitions to recover a dominant position in the global art market in the post-Covid and post-Brexit eras.Fine Art auction turnover by period (in 2021) Paris vs. London and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com) Fine Art auction turnover in Paris  London  and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com)""Because of its history  Paris will always remain a center for Modern and Impressionist art; but the French capital must today forge a place for itself in Contemporary art and  indeed  in Ultra-Contemporary art  or risk missing the digital train altogether""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The efforts deployed by the United States after WWII demonstrated the influence a strong market can have in stimulating artistic creativity and giving it international visibility. This is why we are very proud with Artmarket.com to support the ADIAF ((Association for the International Dissemination of French Art) and the Marcel Duchamp prize"".A complacent Parisian marketOver the past twenty years  fine art auction turnover has progressed at the same rate in France as in the rest of the world  both in terms of the volume of transactions and auction turnover. But if we focus solely on the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  we see that Paris generated 3.2% of global auction turnover in 2000  but only 2.6% in 2021 and only 1.8% in H1 2022.Contemporary Art auction turnover per city: 2000 vs. 2021New York: $59 million in 2000 – $955 million in 2021Hong Kong: $558 000 – $700 million in 2021London: $13 million in 2000 – $432 million in 2021Paris: $3 million in 2000 – $73 million in 2021It is this context that prompted the RMN (Réunion des Musées Nationaux) to launch a call-for-tender to rent its Grand-Palais for a new Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Previously granted to the FIAC for almost half a century  it has now been granted to the MCH group for the next seven years. The innovative proposals of the ""Art Basel"" fairs  organized by the MCH Group in Basel  Miami and Hong Kong  should revitalize a Parisian marketplace that has become a little too complacent. So instead of the 48th edition of the FIAC  the City of Light is about to discover the ""grand premiere"" of Paris+.The Marcel Duchamp Prize awarded to...The month of October is of considerable importance for the Parisian art market with numerous events profiting from the magnetic pull of its major Contemporary art fair. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the ADIAF to award the Marcel Duchamp prize to one of the four artists shortlisted this year: Giulia Andreani  Iván Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard. Artprice is proud to support this initiative and congratulates the 2022 winner  Mimosa Echard.www.adiaf.com/le-prix-marcel-duchamp-2022/www.artprice.com/artist/544338/mimosas-echard/lots/pastsDuring the week of 17-23 October  Artprice has identified no less than twenty Fine Art auction sales in the French capital. Christie's will be hosting two major sessions there (""Modern Art"" and ""Avant-Garde(s)"")  and will also be dispersing the magnificent African collection of Béatrice and Patrick Caput.Sotheby's  for its part  has chosen to host its major Fine Art sales the following week (24-26 October)  considering Paris+ and the tumult that will accompany it as a perfect springboard.""Phillips will not be opening an auction room soon in France""The world's third-largest auction house  by Fine Art turnover  has confirmed it does not intend to host sales in the French capital. For the time being  Phillips is concentrating on the New York - London - Hong Kong dynamic for its high-end sales in its specialty fields: Contemporary and Post-War art (along with watches  jewelry  and design).Bonhams  on the other hand  is following a completely different expansion strategy with the acquisition of Cornette de Saint-Cyr  active in both France and Belgium. Without overshadowing the French capital  Brussels offers a fairly natural development opportunity for many players in the Parisian art market. The Templon  Obadia  and Almine Rech galleries have gradually set up there  while others prefer Geneva or Luxembourg: two cities with free ports.Operation ""Contemporary Art and NFTs""The MCH Group has made Contemporary art the principal locomotive of its Art Basel editions by selecting only the most prestigious local and international galleries and creating synergies with the world of fashion and technology (hence the ""+"" sign in the name of the fair). The Tezos Blockchain – of French origin – has also become one of Art Basel's main partners.As we mentioned  Paris is indeed struggling to assert itself on the Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market. Its best three auction results above $20 million in the first half of 2022 were for Old and Modern works:Woman Walking [I] by Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collectionby Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collection Basket of Wild Strawberries attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquinattributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquin A Nude Man with two Figures reattributed by Christie's to MichelangeloIn H1 2022  the best French result for a Contemporary work (i.e. one created by an artist born after 1945) capped at $1 million  a threshold that  this year  has already been crossed 47 times in Hong Kong  51 times in London and 71 times in New York.Artprice by Artmarket's latest Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report highlights the difficulties France faces when it comes to nurturing its own Contemporary art scene. For example  in 2021  paintings by Claire Tabouret – the most successful French artist under 40 at auction – were sold in London (49% of her auction turnover)  New York (30%)  and Hong Kong (20%).Paris+ by Art Basel  therefore  has a mission to put the French capital back at the heart of the international Contemporary art market  while embracing its history and its specificity.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image1-ArtMarket-Turnover-CA-Paris.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image2-Paris-vs-London-vs-HongKong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

But if we focus solely on the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  we see that Paris generated 3.2% of global auction turnover in 2000  but only 2.6% in 2021 and only 1.8% in H1 2022.Contemporary Art auction turnover per city: 2000 vs. 2021New York: $59 million in 2000 – $955 million in 2021Hong Kong: $558 000 – $700 million in 2021London: $13 million in 2000 – $432 million in 2021Paris: $3 million in 2000 – $73 million in 2021It is this context that prompted the RMN (Réunion des Musées Nationaux) to launch a call-for-tender to rent its Grand-Palais for a new Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Previously granted to the FIAC for almost half a century  it has now been granted to the MCH group for the next seven years. The innovative proposals of the ""Art Basel"" fairs  organized by the MCH Group in Basel  Miami and Hong Kong  should revitalize a Parisian marketplace that has become a little too complacent. So instead of the 48th edition of the FIAC  the City of Light is about to discover the ""grand premiere"" of Paris+.The Marcel Duchamp Prize awarded to...The month of October is of considerable importance for the Parisian art market with numerous events profiting from the magnetic pull of its major Contemporary art fair. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the ADIAF to award the Marcel Duchamp prize to one of the four artists shortlisted this year: Giulia Andreani  Iván Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard. Artprice is proud to support this initiative and congratulates the 2022 winner  Mimosa Echard.www.adiaf.com/le-prix-marcel-duchamp-2022/www.artprice.com/artist/544338/mimosas-echard/lots/pastsDuring the week of 17-23 October  Artprice has identified no less than twenty Fine Art auction sales in the French capital. Christie's will be hosting two major sessions there (""Modern Art"" and ""Avant-Garde(s)"")  and will also be dispersing the magnificent African collection of Béatrice and Patrick Caput.Sotheby's  for its part  has chosen to host its major Fine Art sales the following week (24-26 October)  considering Paris+ and the tumult that will accompany it as a perfect springboard.""Phillips will not be opening an auction room soon in France""The world's third-largest auction house  by Fine Art turnover  has confirmed it does not intend to host sales in the French capital. For the time being  Phillips is concentrating on the New York - London - Hong Kong dynamic for its high-end sales in its specialty fields: Contemporary and Post-War art (along with watches  jewelry  and design).Bonhams  on the other hand  is following a completely different expansion strategy with the acquisition of Cornette de Saint-Cyr  active in both France and Belgium. Without overshadowing the French capital  Brussels offers a fairly natural development opportunity for many players in the Parisian art market. The Templon  Obadia  and Almine Rech galleries have gradually set up there  while others prefer Geneva or Luxembourg: two cities with free ports.Operation ""Contemporary Art and NFTs""The MCH Group has made Contemporary art the principal locomotive of its Art Basel editions by selecting only the most prestigious local and international galleries and creating synergies with the world of fashion and technology (hence the ""+"" sign in the name of the fair). The Tezos Blockchain – of French origin – has also become one of Art Basel's main partners.As we mentioned  Paris is indeed struggling to assert itself on the Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market. Its best three auction results above $20 million in the first half of 2022 were for Old and Modern works:Woman Walking [I] by Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collectionby Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collection Basket of Wild Strawberries attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquinattributed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin by the Cabinet Turquin A Nude Man with two Figures reattributed by Christie's to MichelangeloIn H1 2022  the best French result for a Contemporary work (i.e. one created by an artist born after 1945) capped at $1 million  a threshold that  this year  has already been crossed 47 times in Hong Kong  51 times in London and 71 times in New York.Artprice by Artmarket's latest Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report highlights the difficulties France faces when it comes to nurturing its own Contemporary art scene. For example  in 2021  paintings by Claire Tabouret – the most successful French artist under 40 at auction – were sold in London (49% of her auction turnover)  New York (30%)  and Hong Kong (20%).Paris+ by Art Basel  therefore  has a mission to put the French capital back at the heart of the international Contemporary art market  while embracing its history and its specificity.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image1-ArtMarket-Turnover-CA-Paris.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image2-Paris-vs-London-vs-HongKong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Within this agreement  Brill offers a discount on the book and chapter publication charge …The post Max Planck Society…,Leiden / Göttingen – 18 October 2022 – Brill is proud to announce a new collaboration with the Max Planck Society on Open Access for books. Within this agreement  Brill offers a discount on the book and chapter publication charge for all affiliates of the Max Planck Institutes. Coordinated by the Max Planck Digital Library  50% of the book or chapter publication charge is funded centrally. The other 50% of the Open Access costs are funded by the applicable Max Planck Institute. This extensive agreement covers not only monographs and edited volumes  but also individual chapters from Max Planck-affiliated authors to any Brill volume. All 86 Max Planck Institutes are eligible  which makes this a landmark agreement for Brill and its German imprints Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht  Böhlau  and Schöningh  Fink & mentis. The agreement runs for three years  until October 2025.Dr. Ralf Schimmer  Head of Information at the Max Planck Digital Library  comments: “With this agreement we respond to the articulated demands of our researchers and offer a new opportunity to publish their research results in Open Access. We acknowledge the commitment of Brill to finding pathways to more openness in the system and are very pleased to collaborate with this distinguished publisher.”Dr. Jasmin Lange  Chief Publishing Officer  comments: ”Max Planck Digital Library has always been at the forefront of the transition to Open Access. It is essential that such a key organization recognizes the need for extending Open Access to books and chapters. Monographs and edited volumes continue to be a vital format for dissemination of research in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Yet Open Access efforts have primarily concentrated on journals and articles so far  which puts at risk the visibility and impact of books and the fields that rely on them. Brill is firmly committed to accelerate Open Access for its book program and is delighted to partner with Max Planck Digital Library in delivering that.”For more information on this media alert  contact Stephanie Veldman  Head of Open Access at Brill  via Stephanie.Veldman@brill.com.

Oct. 18  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced execution of a final agreement with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) to re-align approximately €30.7 million in outstanding debt obligations with the Company’s expected development and commercialization timelines. Nanobiotix previously announced agreement-in-principle with EIB for this restructuring on September 12th  2022.The original finance contract and royalty agreement established between Nanobiotix and EIB in July 2018 included an initial tranche of €16.0 million drawn in October 2018 and repayable in a single installment at maturity in 2023; and a second tranche of €14.0 million granted in March 2019 and repayable in semi-annual installments of principal and interest after a two-year grace period. The agreement also included a commitment to an annual royalty payment in the low single-digits over a six-year period beginning January 2021.Terms and Conditions of the Restructuring AgreementThe newly executed restructuring agreement enables Nanobiotix to defer repayment of the remaining €25.3 million in principal for both tranches up to June 2029.Under the terms of the agreement  €5.4 million in interest accrued on the first tranche since 2018 will be restructured as payment-in-kind (“PIK”) and will be deferred up to October 2024. Going forward  principal from the first tranche will accrue interest at the rate of 6% annually  with such interest being capitalized and due as PIK interest at maturity. Interest on the remaining €9.3 million in principal from the second tranche will continue to accrue at a 5% fixed rate paid in semi-annual installments through June 2029.The annual royalty payment remains in the low single-digits and continues to cover a six-year period but has been re-aligned to begin as of the first year of NBTXR3 commercialization.Story continuesThe restructuring agreement also includes a new milestone payment of €20 million due in June 2029.While the restructuring of the finance and royalty agreement is intended to align debt obligations with the Company’s anticipated commercial timelines  the agreement contains provisions that would accelerate the maturity and repayment schedule  should Nanobiotix generate commercial revenue prior to June 2029. Specifically  principal and interest accrued on the first tranche following the amendment would be due in a single installment at the earlier of four years after commercialization or June 2029. Semi-annual principal repayments for the second tranche would resume with a maturity date at the earlier of three years following commercialization or June 2029. Finally  an accelerated redemption schedule for the new €20 million milestone payment would be triggered calling for the repayment in two equal installments due one year and two years after commercialization  respectively.Further  should the company secure non-dilutive capital through the execution of any business development deal  the €5.4 million PIK interest payment associated with the first tranche would be due by October 2023 and an accelerated redemption schedule for the new €20 million milestone payment would be triggered. The accelerated redemption schedule would reflect a prorated payment amount not exceeding 10% of any upfront or milestone payment received by Nanobiotix with any remaining balance of the €20 million milestone payment due at maturity.As part of the restructuring  Nanobiotix has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance equal to the outstanding principal owed to EIB. All other covenants included in the 2018 finance contract remain unchanged.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.
