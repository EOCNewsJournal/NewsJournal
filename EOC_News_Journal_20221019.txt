This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  i‚Ä¶,"PARIS  Oct. 18  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The international Art Basel organization (owned by MCH Group) is about to open its first Paris+ art fair (20-23 October)  which replaces the FIAC. This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  including Skarstedt  David Zwirner  and Peter Kilchmann  as well as the addition of new branches for Gagosian and Continua  and the inauguration of the Pinault Collection at the former Bourse de Commerce (Trade Exchange). Taken together  these developments clearly illustrate Paris's ambitions to recover a dominant position in the global art market in the post-Covid and post-Brexit eras.Fine Art auction turnover in Paris  London  and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com) Fine Art auction turnover by period (in 2021) Paris vs. London and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com)""Because of its history  Paris will always remain a center for Modern and Impressionist art; but the French capital must today forge a place for itself in Contemporary art and  indeed  in Ultra-Contemporary art  or risk missing the digital train altogether""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The efforts deployed by the United States after WWII demonstrated the influence a strong market can have in stimulating artistic creativity and giving it international visibility. This is why we are very proud with Artmarket.com to support the ADIAF ((Association for the International Dissemination of French Art) and the Marcel Duchamp prize"".A complacent Parisian marketOver the past twenty years  fine art auction turnover has progressed at the same rate in France as in the rest of the world  both in terms of the volume of transactions and auction turnover. But if we focus solely on the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  we see that Paris generated 3.2% of global auction turnover in 2000  but only 2.6% in 2021 and only 1.8% in H1 2022.Contemporary Art auction turnover per city: 2000 vs. 2021New York: $59 million in 2000 ‚Äì $955 million in 2021Hong Kong: $558 000 ‚Äì $700 million in 2021London: $13 million in 2000 ‚Äì $432 million in 2021Paris: $3 million in 2000 ‚Äì $73 million in 2021It is this context that prompted the RMN (R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux) to launch a call-for-tender to rent its Grand-Palais for a new Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Previously granted to the FIAC for almost half a century  it has now been granted to the MCH group for the next seven years. The innovative proposals of the ""Art Basel"" fairs  organized by the MCH Group in Basel  Miami and Hong Kong  should revitalize a Parisian marketplace that has become a little too complacent. So instead of the 48th edition of the FIAC  the City of Light is about to discover the ""grand premiere"" of Paris+.The Marcel Duchamp Prize awarded to...The month of October is of considerable importance for the Parisian art market with numerous events profiting from the magnetic pull of its major Contemporary art fair. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the ADIAF to award the Marcel Duchamp prize to one of the four artists shortlisted this year: Giulia Andreani  Iv√°n Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard. Artprice is proud to support this initiative and congratulates the 2022 winner  Mimosa Echard.www.adiaf.com/le-prix-marcel-duchamp-2022/www.artprice.com/artist/544338/mimosas-echard/lots/pastsDuring the week of 17-23 October  Artprice has identified no less than twenty Fine Art auction sales in the French capital. Christie's will be hosting two major sessions there (""Modern Art"" and ""Avant-Garde(s)"")  and will also be dispersing the magnificent African collection of B√©atrice and Patrick Caput.Sotheby's  for its part  has chosen to host its major Fine Art sales the following week (24-26 October)  considering Paris+ and the tumult that will accompany it as a perfect springboard.""Phillips will not be opening an auction room soon in France""The world's third-largest auction house  by Fine Art turnover  has confirmed it does not intend to host sales in the French capital. For the time being  Phillips is concentrating on the New York - London - Hong Kong dynamic for its high-end sales in its specialty fields: Contemporary and Post-War art (along with watches  jewelry  and design).Bonhams  on the other hand  is following a completely different expansion strategy with the acquisition of Cornette de Saint-Cyr  active in both France and Belgium. Without overshadowing the French capital  Brussels offers a fairly natural development opportunity for many players in the Parisian art market. The Templon  Obadia  and Almine Rech galleries have gradually set up there  while others prefer Geneva or Luxembourg: two cities with free ports.Operation ""Contemporary Art and NFTs""The MCH Group has made Contemporary art the principal locomotive of its Art Basel editions by selecting only the most prestigious local and international galleries and creating synergies with the world of fashion and technology (hence the ""+"" sign in the name of the fair). The Tezos Blockchain ‚Äì of French origin ‚Äì has also become one of Art Basel's main partners.As we mentioned  Paris is indeed struggling to assert itself on the Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market. Its best three auction results above $20 million in the first half of 2022 were for Old and Modern works:Woman Walking [I] by Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collectionby Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collection Basket of Wild Strawberries attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin by the Cabinet Turquinattributed to Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin by the Cabinet Turquin A Nude Man with two Figures reattributed by Christie's to MichelangeloIn H1 2022  the best French result for a Contemporary work (i.e. one created by an artist born after 1945) capped at $1 million  a threshold that  this year  has already been crossed 47 times in Hong Kong  51 times in London and 71 times in New York.Artprice by Artmarket's latest Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report highlights the difficulties France faces when it comes to nurturing its own Contemporary art scene. For example  in 2021  paintings by Claire Tabouret ‚Äì the most successful French artist under 40 at auction ‚Äì were sold in London (49% of her auction turnover)  New York (30%)  and Hong Kong (20%).Paris+ by Art Basel  therefore  has a mission to put the French capital back at the heart of the international Contemporary art market  while embracing its history and its specificity.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image1-ArtMarket-Turnover-CA-Paris.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image2-Paris-vs-London-vs-HongKong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Oct. 18  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with ca‚Ä¶,PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Oct. 18  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced execution of a final agreement with the European Investment Bank (‚ÄúEIB‚Äù) to re-align approximately ‚Ç¨30.7 million in outstanding debt obligations with the Company‚Äôs expected development and commercialization timelines. Nanobiotix previously announced agreement-in-principle with EIB for this restructuring on September 12th  2022.The original finance contract and royalty agreement established between Nanobiotix and EIB in July 2018 included an initial tranche of ‚Ç¨16.0 million drawn in October 2018 and repayable in a single installment at maturity in 2023; and a second tranche of ‚Ç¨14.0 million granted in March 2019 and repayable in semi-annual installments of principal and interest after a two-year grace period. The agreement also included a commitment to an annual royalty payment in the low single-digits over a six-year period beginning January 2021.Terms and Conditions of the Restructuring AgreementThe newly executed restructuring agreement enables Nanobiotix to defer repayment of the remaining ‚Ç¨25.3 million in principal for both tranches up to June 2029.Under the terms of the agreement  ‚Ç¨5.4 million in interest accrued on the first tranche since 2018 will be restructured as payment-in-kind (‚ÄúPIK‚Äù) and will be deferred up to October 2024. Going forward  principal from the first tranche will accrue interest at the rate of 6% annually  with such interest being capitalized and due as PIK interest at maturity. Interest on the remaining ‚Ç¨9.3 million in principal from the second tranche will continue to accrue at a 5% fixed rate paid in semi-annual installments through June 2029.The annual royalty payment remains in the low single-digits and continues to cover a six-year period but has been re-aligned to begin as of the first year of NBTXR3 commercialization.The restructuring agreement also includes a new milestone payment of ‚Ç¨20 million due in June 2029.While the restructuring of the finance and royalty agreement is intended to align debt obligations with the Company‚Äôs anticipated commercial timelines  the agreement contains provisions that would accelerate the maturity and repayment schedule  should Nanobiotix generate commercial revenue prior to June 2029. Specifically  principal and interest accrued on the first tranche following the amendment would be due in a single installment at the earlier of four years after commercialization or June 2029. Semi-annual principal repayments for the second tranche would resume with a maturity date at the earlier of three years following commercialization or June 2029. Finally  an accelerated redemption schedule for the new ‚Ç¨20 million milestone payment would be triggered calling for the repayment in two equal installments due one year and two years after commercialization  respectively.Further  should the company secure non-dilutive capital through the execution of any business development deal  the ‚Ç¨5.4 million PIK interest payment associated with the first tranche would be due by October 2023 and an accelerated redemption schedule for the new ‚Ç¨20 million milestone payment would be triggered. The accelerated redemption schedule would reflect a prorated payment amount not exceeding 10% of any upfront or milestone payment received by Nanobiotix with any remaining balance of the ‚Ç¨20 million milestone payment due at maturity.As part of the restructuring  Nanobiotix has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance equal to the outstanding principal owed to EIB. All other covenants included in the 2018 finance contract remain unchanged.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

We are now confident of delivering circa +8.5% organic growth versus +6 to +7% previously  with an operating margin at close to 18% and a Free Cash Flow close to ‚Ç¨1.6bn.Our Q3 numbers are clearly encouraging. But what really stands out is our performance versus pre-pandemic levels. Compared to 2019  we‚Äôve seen our organic growth accelerate to +16% in Q3. This demonstrates our ability to more than withstand the ups and downs of the global economy  and makes us confident in our ability to face ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.I‚Äôd like to thank our clients for their partnership. I also want to say a big ‚Äòmerci‚Äô to all of our people for their outstanding efforts. In a context where inflation is impacting the daily lives of many of them  we want to ensure we are giving additional support where it is most needed as we enter the holiday season.

At constant parities  the revenue growth was -0.2%  in a context of anticipated slowing market growth  compared to a third quarter 2021 that had been exceptional. Asia Pacific (+6.8% at constant rates) and Africa/Middle East (+18.3% at constant rates) regions are growing in the quarter due particularly to performance in India  Australia and Turkey. All other areas are behind over the period impacted by a high comparison base for the European area (-1.8% at constant rates)  and the United States (-6.6% at a constant rate) which had experienced remarkable growth in the third quarter of 2021 due to new product launches (Clomicalm  Itrafungol  petfood iVet  Milbehart‚Ä¶). Lastly  Latin America (-6.8% at constant exchange rates) is strongly impacted by Chile  which is down over the quarter due to an unfavorable base effect  following the rebound observed in the third quarter of 2021  as well as the decline in sales of antibiotic and parasiticide products for salmon  following the suspension by the Chilean maritime authority of the marketing authorization for a parasiticide product in distribution.Cumulative consolidated reve nue at the end of SeptemberOur revenue through to the end of September was ‚Ç¨921.2 million  compared with ‚Ç¨817.7 million  representing an overall increase of +12.7% compared with the same period in 2021. Adjusted for the favorable impact of exchange rates  revenue shows growth of +7.7%. This growth benefited  in part  from a favorable baseline effect representing 0.5 point of growth in revenue  attributable to new products acquired starting in the second quarter of 2021. All areas are growing organically at the end of September  despite a slowdown in the market. In Asia Pacific  the growth at real rates is +17.9% (+12.1% at constant exchange rates)  India and Australia continue to derive growth from the area  thanks to products for cattle  representing approximately 80% of the area‚Äôs growth. In Europe  revenue grew by +4% at real rates (+3.5% at constant rates). The main countries contributing to this performance are the United Kingdom  France  Italy  Germany and Spain  carried by the strong dynamism of the ranges for companion animals (in particular the ranges of petfood  specialties  and the vaccines)  which offset the withdrawal of antibiotic ranges for food producing animals. In the United States  business grew by +23.2% (+9.5% at constant exchange rates). It benefited from strong sales of new products launched in 2021 (Clomicalm and Itrafungol) and those launched in early 2022 (petfood  and for the production animals segment Tulissin)  as well as good performance on the dental and dermatology range. Finally  in Latin America  business grew by +18.1% at actual rates (+6.8% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to the contribution of Mexico and Brazil  which offset the decline in Chile.In terms of species  revenue in the companion animal segment grew overall by +14.4% at real rates (+10.1% at constant exchange rates)  mainly driven by very good double-digit growth in the petfood  specialty  and dental ranges. The food producing animal segment also posted growth of +12.0% at real rates (+6.2% at constant exchange rates)  driven by the ruminant sector (+11.2% at constant rates)  which compensates for the decline in the pig-poultry (-5.1% at constant rates) and aquaculture (-10.8% at constant rates) segments compared to the same period of 2021  and this mainly due to the decline in sales of vaccines as well as the suspension of the marketing of the aforementioned parasiticide product.OutlookRevenue growth at constant rates and perimeter is now expected to be in a range of between 6% and 9%. The ratio of ‚Äúcurrent operating income before depreciation of assets from acquisitions‚Äù to ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù should be in a range of between 14% and 15% at constant exchange rates. Finally  our deleveraging should be around 30 million ‚Ç¨ excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates.CONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin millions of euros 2022 2021 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates 1 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope 1 First quarter revenue 318.1 266.5 +19.3% +16.2% +16.2% Second-quarter revenue 298.3 262.9 +13.5% +7.8% +7.8% Third-quarter revenue 304.9 288.2 +5.8% -0.2% -0.2% Revenue at the end of September 921.2 817.7 +12.7% +7.7% +7.7%A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

With a +46% increase in new bookings  this quarter is in line with our first half year 2022 performance of +42%. These business results are mainly driven by international markets  notably our successes in North America which already represents 41% of total bookings for the period. In addition to this  and for the first time in its history  Sidetrade has achieved more than half of its revenue  53%  internationally with 23% generated in North America. The ramp-up in our North American salesforce  supported by our new business hub in Calgary (Canada)  will further accelerate this momentum in the quarters ahead. Sidetrade is definitively taking an important step in its development.‚ÄùRecord new bookings in Q3 2022 with a +46% increaseAfter reporting a +42% increase for SaaS orders in the first half of 2022  Sidetrade delivered a record-high third-quarter performance  generating ‚Ç¨1.38 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (‚ÄúARR‚Äù) in Q3 2022  compared with ‚Ç¨0.95 million in Q3 2021; a +46% increase. The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) represents ‚Ç¨3.87 million of Total Contract Value (‚ÄúTCV‚Äù) in Q3 2022 versus ‚Ç¨2.42 million in Q3 2021; a +60% increase.68% of total bookings were international  and 41% from North AmericaIn Q3 2022  international orders represented more than 68% of all bookings with significant business successes in Europe  Latin America and North America.Just over one year after the Company launched operations in North America  this market has become a major growth driver  accounting for 41% of total bookings in Q3 2022 (58% in the first half of 2022). Note that this performance surpassed the Company‚Äôs initial target of achieving more than one-third of its bookings in North America by the second half of 2022.To these SaaS bookings should be added ‚Ç¨0.89 million of services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.)  compared with ‚Ç¨0.63 million in Q3 2021  a +41% increase. In total and considering that almost all of these services will be invoiced over the next twelve months  Q3 2022 enables Sidetrade to add the equivalent of ‚Ç¨2.27 million in Annual Contract Value (‚ÄúACV‚Äù) compared to ‚Ç¨1.58 million in Q3 2021  a +44% increase.Overall  in Q3 2022  bookings by new customers (‚ÄúNew Business‚Äù) and Cross-selling represented 81% of the total versus 75% on average in recent quarters  with the remaining 19% of bookings accounting for Upselling of additional modules to existing customers.Lastly  it should be noted that as with all existing contracts  the new contracts include an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on changes in price indices for the relevant country.In an inflationary market environment  now more than ever  businesses must deploy efficient solutions to manage their Order-to-Cash process as they face a twofold challenge: to consolidate cash reserves with multiple hikes in interest rates while generating productivity gains to address salary increases and recruitment difficulties. This trend is expected to continue over the next 12 to 24 months with an additional increased future risk of future recession in certain countries. In this disrupted context  the management of operating working capital  and particularly accounts receivable  is a major challenge for all finance departments.Acceleration in Order-to-Cash SaaS subscription revenue by 23% and revenue by 12%  driven by international ordersSidetrade(‚Ç¨m) Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change ‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities 9.1 7.7 +19% of which SaaS Subscriptions 7.7 6.2 +23% ‚ÄòSales & Marketing‚Äô Activities 0.2 0.6 -72% Revenue 9.2 8.2 +12%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities grew very sharply by +19% in Q3 2022  driven by +23% growth in SaaS subscriptions. The growth in this recurring revenue is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year  which will continue to impact revenue growth throughout the 2022 fiscal year.‚ÄòOrder-to-Cash‚Äô Activities  a core business within the Company‚Äôs strategy since 2019  now represent 98% of total revenue as of Q3 2022.The ‚ÄòSales & Marketing‚Äô Activities  which have become secondary to Sidetrade‚Äôs activities  now account for only 2% of total revenue in this quarter  and will continue to decline  with estimated revenue of ‚Ç¨0.9 million at end-2022.Total revenue grew by +12% in Q3 2022  to ‚Ç¨9.2 million. This performance is supported by solid growth drivers in international markets which  for the first time in the Company‚Äôs history  represent 53% of total revenue  including 23% for North America.Sidetrade‚Äôs economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring  representing a significant advantage in the current and future environment.All of these multi-year contracts are indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States)  which alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices.Sidetrade therefore has robust pricing power that protects the Company‚Äôs future revenue against uncertainties and inflationary pressures. At present  Sidetrade perfectly combines its sound fundamentals with a highly favorable growth outlook.Next financial announcementAnnual Revenue for 2022: January 24  2023  after the stock market closesInvestor & Media relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsRebecca Parlby +44 7824 505 584 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  i‚Ä¶,"PARIS  Oct. 18  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The international Art Basel organization (owned by MCH Group) is about to open its first Paris+ art fair (20-23 October)  which replaces the FIAC. This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  including Skarstedt  David Zwirner  and Peter Kilchmann  as well as the addition of new branches for Gagosian and Continua  and the inauguration of the Pinault Collection at the former Bourse de Commerce (Trade Exchange). Taken together  these developments clearly illustrate Paris's ambitions to recover a dominant position in the global art market in the post-Covid and post-Brexit eras.Fine Art auction turnover in Paris  London  and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com) Fine Art auction turnover by period (in 2021) Paris vs. London and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com)""Because of its history  Paris will always remain a center for Modern and Impressionist art; but the French capital must today forge a place for itself in Contemporary art and  indeed  in Ultra-Contemporary art  or risk missing the digital train altogether""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The efforts deployed by the United States after WWII demonstrated the influence a strong market can have in stimulating artistic creativity and giving it international visibility. This is why we are very proud with Artmarket.com to support the ADIAF ((Association for the International Dissemination of French Art) and the Marcel Duchamp prize"".A complacent Parisian marketOver the past twenty years  fine art auction turnover has progressed at the same rate in France as in the rest of the world  both in terms of the volume of transactions and auction turnover. But if we focus solely on the Contemporary Art segment (artists born after 1945)  we see that Paris generated 3.2% of global auction turnover in 2000  but only 2.6% in 2021 and only 1.8% in H1 2022.Contemporary Art auction turnover per city: 2000 vs. 2021New York: $59 million in 2000 ‚Äì $955 million in 2021Hong Kong: $558 000 ‚Äì $700 million in 2021London: $13 million in 2000 ‚Äì $432 million in 2021Paris: $3 million in 2000 ‚Äì $73 million in 2021It is this context that prompted the RMN (R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux) to launch a call-for-tender to rent its Grand-Palais for a new Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Previously granted to the FIAC for almost half a century  it has now been granted to the MCH group for the next seven years. The innovative proposals of the ""Art Basel"" fairs  organized by the MCH Group in Basel  Miami and Hong Kong  should revitalize a Parisian marketplace that has become a little too complacent. So instead of the 48th edition of the FIAC  the City of Light is about to discover the ""grand premiere"" of Paris+.The Marcel Duchamp Prize awarded to...The month of October is of considerable importance for the Parisian art market with numerous events profiting from the magnetic pull of its major Contemporary art fair. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the ADIAF to award the Marcel Duchamp prize to one of the four artists shortlisted this year: Giulia Andreani  Iv√°n Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard. Artprice is proud to support this initiative and congratulates the 2022 winner  Mimosa Echard.www.adiaf.com/le-prix-marcel-duchamp-2022/www.artprice.com/artist/544338/mimosas-echard/lots/pastsDuring the week of 17-23 October  Artprice has identified no less than twenty Fine Art auction sales in the French capital. Christie's will be hosting two major sessions there (""Modern Art"" and ""Avant-Garde(s)"")  and will also be dispersing the magnificent African collection of B√©atrice and Patrick Caput.Sotheby's  for its part  has chosen to host its major Fine Art sales the following week (24-26 October)  considering Paris+ and the tumult that will accompany it as a perfect springboard.""Phillips will not be opening an auction room soon in France""The world's third-largest auction house  by Fine Art turnover  has confirmed it does not intend to host sales in the French capital. For the time being  Phillips is concentrating on the New York - London - Hong Kong dynamic for its high-end sales in its specialty fields: Contemporary and Post-War art (along with watches  jewelry  and design).Bonhams  on the other hand  is following a completely different expansion strategy with the acquisition of Cornette de Saint-Cyr  active in both France and Belgium. Without overshadowing the French capital  Brussels offers a fairly natural development opportunity for many players in the Parisian art market. The Templon  Obadia  and Almine Rech galleries have gradually set up there  while others prefer Geneva or Luxembourg: two cities with free ports.Operation ""Contemporary Art and NFTs""The MCH Group has made Contemporary art the principal locomotive of its Art Basel editions by selecting only the most prestigious local and international galleries and creating synergies with the world of fashion and technology (hence the ""+"" sign in the name of the fair). The Tezos Blockchain ‚Äì of French origin ‚Äì has also become one of Art Basel's main partners.As we mentioned  Paris is indeed struggling to assert itself on the Contemporary and Ultra-Contemporary art market. Its best three auction results above $20 million in the first half of 2022 were for Old and Modern works:Woman Walking [I] by Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collectionby Alberto Giacometti  from the Givenchy Collection Basket of Wild Strawberries attributed to Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin by the Cabinet Turquinattributed to Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin by the Cabinet Turquin A Nude Man with two Figures reattributed by Christie's to MichelangeloIn H1 2022  the best French result for a Contemporary work (i.e. one created by an artist born after 1945) capped at $1 million  a threshold that  this year  has already been crossed 47 times in Hong Kong  51 times in London and 71 times in New York.Artprice by Artmarket's latest Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report highlights the difficulties France faces when it comes to nurturing its own Contemporary art scene. For example  in 2021  paintings by Claire Tabouret ‚Äì the most successful French artist under 40 at auction ‚Äì were sold in London (49% of her auction turnover)  New York (30%)  and Hong Kong (20%).Paris+ by Art Basel  therefore  has a mission to put the French capital back at the heart of the international Contemporary art market  while embracing its history and its specificity.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image1-ArtMarket-Turnover-CA-Paris.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/10/image2-Paris-vs-London-vs-HongKong.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

But what really stands out is our performance versus pre-pandemic levels. Compared to 2019  we‚Äôve seen our organic growth accelerate to +16% in Q3. This demonstrates our ability to more than withstand the ups and downs of the global economy  and makes us confident in our ability to face ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.I‚Äôd like to thank our clients for their partnership. I also want to say a big ‚Äòmerci‚Äô to all of our people for their outstanding efforts. In a context where inflation is impacting the daily lives of many of them  we want to ensure we are giving additional support where it is most needed as we enter the holiday season.

This change follows a wave of new gallery openings in the French capital  including Skarstedt  David Zwirner  and Peter Kilchmann  as well as the addition of new branches for Gagosian and Continua  and the inauguration of the Pinault Collection at the former Bourse de Commerce (Trade Exchange). Taken together  these developments clearly illustrate Paris's ambitions to recover a dominant position in the global art market in the post-Covid and post-Brexit eras.Fine Art auction turnover by period (in 2021) Paris vs. London and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com) Fine Art auction turnover in Paris  London  and Hong Kong (PRNewsfoto/Artprice.com)""Because of its history  Paris will always remain a center for Modern and Impressionist art; but the French capital must today forge a place for itself in Contemporary art and  indeed  in Ultra-Contemporary art  or risk missing the digital train altogether""  says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice.""The efforts deployed by the United States after WWII demonstrated the influence a strong market can have in stimulating artistic creativity and giving it international visibility. This is why we are very proud with Artmarket.com to support the ADIAF ((Association for the International Dissemination of French Art) and the Marcel Duchamp prize"".A complacent Parisian marketOver the past twenty years  fine art auction turnover has progressed at the same rate in France as in the rest of the world  both in terms of the volume of transactions and auction turnover.

Within this agreement  Brill offers a discount on the book and chapter publication charge ‚Ä¶The post Max Planck Society‚Ä¶,Leiden / G√∂ttingen ‚Äì 18 October 2022 ‚Äì Brill is proud to announce a new collaboration with the Max Planck Society on Open Access for books. Within this agreement  Brill offers a discount on the book and chapter publication charge for all affiliates of the Max Planck Institutes. Coordinated by the Max Planck Digital Library  50% of the book or chapter publication charge is funded centrally. The other 50% of the Open Access costs are funded by the applicable Max Planck Institute. This extensive agreement covers not only monographs and edited volumes  but also individual chapters from Max Planck-affiliated authors to any Brill volume. All 86 Max Planck Institutes are eligible  which makes this a landmark agreement for Brill and its German imprints Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht  B√∂hlau  and Sch√∂ningh  Fink & mentis. The agreement runs for three years  until October 2025.Dr. Ralf Schimmer  Head of Information at the Max Planck Digital Library  comments: ‚ÄúWith this agreement we respond to the articulated demands of our researchers and offer a new opportunity to publish their research results in Open Access. We acknowledge the commitment of Brill to finding pathways to more openness in the system and are very pleased to collaborate with this distinguished publisher.‚ÄùDr. Jasmin Lange  Chief Publishing Officer  comments: ‚ÄùMax Planck Digital Library has always been at the forefront of the transition to Open Access. It is essential that such a key organization recognizes the need for extending Open Access to books and chapters. Monographs and edited volumes continue to be a vital format for dissemination of research in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Yet Open Access efforts have primarily concentrated on journals and articles so far  which puts at risk the visibility and impact of books and the fields that rely on them. Brill is firmly committed to accelerate Open Access for its book program and is delighted to partner with Max Planck Digital Library in delivering that.‚ÄùFor more information on this media alert  contact Stephanie Veldman  Head of Open Access at Brill  via Stephanie.Veldman@brill.com.

In Asia  stocks were mostly up; Treasury yields rose; the dollar weakened; while oil rose and gold was flat.Equities:European shares could extend gains Wednesday after U.S. stocks finished higher for the second day in a row  as investors celebrated another batch of robust corporate earnings reports.""Corporate earnings are stealing the show and overshadowing recession concerns. Those same recession fears had meant that the bar was low heading into earnings  raising the likelihood of beating estimates "" said Fiona Cincotta  senior financial markets analyst at City Index.However  some analysts remained skeptical about the rebound in stocks. Jonathan Krinsky  chief market technician at BTIG  noted that although the Nasdaq-100 gained more than 3% in the previous session  it had remained within Friday's range.""We don't think we are at the final end of this bear market  and therefore would be inclined to fade this rally "" said Krinsky.Forex:The dollar weakened early Wednesday amid risk-on sentiment prompted by a second straight session of gains on Wall Street  following better-than-expected earnings from U.S. companies.Volatility over the last couple weeks seems to have subsided a bit this week  said Silicon Valley Bank's Minh Trang.""It also seems like there's more of a risk-on mood  you see the dollar oscillating a bit "" the senior FX trader said. With two more Fed meetings left in 2022  ""it feels like a lot of the information uncertainty has been scrubbed out for the year and from that standpoint it does feel like we'll be oscillating for the next two months "" he said.""We're pretty much near the peak here from everything we've seen in terms of the dollar's rally.""Bonds:Treasury yields rose in Asia after closing little changed Tuesday  although the 10-year rate slipped from its highest level since October 2008  as investors welcomed this week's budget U-turn by the U.K. government.""The new sense of calm emanating from the U.K. has helped spread ripples of optimism across global markets...as concerns about contagion from a bond market meltdown abate "" wrote Susannah Streeter  senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.Also  U.K bond yields got a temporary boost after the Bank of England disputed a Financial Times report that claimed the bank was set to further delay its quantitative-tightening program.Markets are pricing in a 95.4% likelihood that the Fed will raise interest rates by another 75 basis points to between 3.75% and 4% on Nov. 2. The central bank is mostly expected to take its fed-funds rate target to at least between 4.75% and 5% by March  according to the CME FedWatch tool.Energy:Oil was up in Asia  recovering somewhat from declines overnight despite persistent concerns over softer demand as global economic growth slows.""We continue to see scope for near-term gains in Brent  as the EU imposes its ban on imports of seaborne Russian crude  effective December 2022  and the G-7 moves to implement a price cap on Russia's oil exports  "" Fitch Solutions said.Meanwhile  the Biden administration is planning to sell more oil from the country's strategic reserves-and is considering authorizing new sales this winter-as it tries to head off the potential for more market shocks and high prices  according to senior administration officials.President Biden plans to address the nation on gasoline prices Wednesday as midterm elections near and the clock runs down on previously planned releases of government reserves that have helped temper prices at the pump.Read more here.Metals:Gold was flat early Wednesday  after futures fell overnight amid continued expectations of aggressive monetary tightening by the Fed.""Gold prices continue to remain heavy despite a respite in the bond market selloff "" Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said.""The current market environment is still bearish for gold as Wall Street becomes convinced that the Fed will need to continue [raising] rates into the spring.""---Copper prices were a tad higher in early trade. Despite the slight gain  slowing economic growth  China's zero-Covid policy and the delay in the release of the country's key economic data are fueling uncertainty about demand  ANZ said.---Chinese iron ore futures rose in morning trade  stabilizing after recent declines  amid expectations that demand for the raw material could improve.Iron ore has recently been weighed in part by a sluggish property sector  but prices could stabilize in the near term  Galaxy Futures said.The momentum for a rebound may come from low inventory levels in steel mills and potentially stronger demand for iron ore  it added.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESBiden to Sell More Oil From Strategic Reserve to Keep Gas Prices in CheckWASHINGTON-The Biden administration is planning to sell more oil from the country's strategic reserves-and is considering authorizing new sales this winter-as it tries to head off the potential for more market shocks and high prices  according to senior administration officials.President Biden plans to address the nation on gasoline prices Wednesday as midterm elections near and the clock runs down on previously planned releases of government reserves that have helped temper prices at the pump.BOJ Board Member Adachi Pledges to Continue Monetary EasingBank of Japan policy board member Seiji Adachi said Wednesday that the bank should continue its easy policy and needs to be careful about monetary tightening amid concerns about a global economic slowdown.""History tells us it comes with a great risk to shift monetary policy toward tightening when there is a risk of a storm coming "" Mr. Adachi said. He warned of the possibility of a slowdown in the world economy due to factors including the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate increases.HSBC's COP26 Climate-Change Ads Were Misleading  U.K. Watchdog SaysA U.K. advertising watchdog ruled that HSBC Holdings PLC posted misleading advertisements in the run-up to last year's United Nations climate summit  serving a warning to companies marketing their environmental credentials.In October 2021  ahead of the U.N.

Oct. 18  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage...,Nanobiotix S.A.PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Oct. 18  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced execution of a final agreement with the European Investment Bank (‚ÄúEIB‚Äù) to re-align approximately ‚Ç¨30.7 million in outstanding debt obligations with the Company‚Äôs expected development and commercialization timelines. Nanobiotix previously announced agreement-in-principle with EIB for this restructuring on September 12th  2022.The original finance contract and royalty agreement established between Nanobiotix and EIB in July 2018 included an initial tranche of ‚Ç¨16.0 million drawn in October 2018 and repayable in a single installment at maturity in 2023; and a second tranche of ‚Ç¨14.0 million granted in March 2019 and repayable in semi-annual installments of principal and interest after a two-year grace period. The agreement also included a commitment to an annual royalty payment in the low single-digits over a six-year period beginning January 2021.Terms and Conditions of the Restructuring AgreementThe newly executed restructuring agreement enables Nanobiotix to defer repayment of the remaining ‚Ç¨25.3 million in principal for both tranches up to June 2029.Under the terms of the agreement  ‚Ç¨5.4 million in interest accrued on the first tranche since 2018 will be restructured as payment-in-kind (‚ÄúPIK‚Äù) and will be deferred up to October 2024. Going forward  principal from the first tranche will accrue interest at the rate of 6% annually  with such interest being capitalized and due as PIK interest at maturity. Interest on the remaining ‚Ç¨9.3 million in principal from the second tranche will continue to accrue at a 5% fixed rate paid in semi-annual installments through June 2029.The annual royalty payment remains in the low single-digits and continues to cover a six-year period but has been re-aligned to begin as of the first year of NBTXR3 commercialization.Story continuesThe restructuring agreement also includes a new milestone payment of ‚Ç¨20 million due in June 2029.While the restructuring of the finance and royalty agreement is intended to align debt obligations with the Company‚Äôs anticipated commercial timelines  the agreement contains provisions that would accelerate the maturity and repayment schedule  should Nanobiotix generate commercial revenue prior to June 2029. Specifically  principal and interest accrued on the first tranche following the amendment would be due in a single installment at the earlier of four years after commercialization or June 2029. Semi-annual principal repayments for the second tranche would resume with a maturity date at the earlier of three years following commercialization or June 2029. Finally  an accelerated redemption schedule for the new ‚Ç¨20 million milestone payment would be triggered calling for the repayment in two equal installments due one year and two years after commercialization  respectively.Further  should the company secure non-dilutive capital through the execution of any business development deal  the ‚Ç¨5.4 million PIK interest payment associated with the first tranche would be due by October 2023 and an accelerated redemption schedule for the new ‚Ç¨20 million milestone payment would be triggered. The accelerated redemption schedule would reflect a prorated payment amount not exceeding 10% of any upfront or milestone payment received by Nanobiotix with any remaining balance of the ‚Ç¨20 million milestone payment due at maturity.As part of the restructuring  Nanobiotix has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance equal to the outstanding principal owed to EIB. All other covenants included in the 2018 finance contract remain unchanged.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Both sides are set to sign a non-binding agreement after details were largely finalized late last week  said the person  who asked not to be identif‚Ä¶,The unveiling of the Renault SA 4Ever Trophy all-electric concept vehicle on the opening day of the Paris Motor Show in Paris  France  on Monday  Oct. 17  2022. Nissan Motor Co. is willing to invest as much as $750 million in Renault¬ís planned electric-vehicle business  in exchange  the French manufacturer is open to paring its ownership of Nissan to 15% over time.Renault SA is in the final stages of concluding a deal this week to reduce its stake in Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co. and reshape their two-decades-old alliance  a person familiar with the negotiations said.The pact would allow the French carmaker to proceed with a planned carve-out of its electric-vehicle business. Both sides are set to sign a non-binding agreement after details were largely finalized late last week  said the person  who asked not to be identified because the plans aren‚Äôt public.Although an event is being planned in Tokyo on Nov. 15 to announce the deal  discussions are ongoing and a final agreement could still be delayed  people familiar with the talks said. Shares of Renault rose as much as 3.2% in morning trading on Euronext.Under the plan  the French carmaker will reduce its ownership of Nissan over time to 15% from the current 43%. In return  Nissan will invest $500 million to $750 million for a stake of about 15% in Renault‚Äôs electric-vehicle business  code-named Ampere  which is being split from the combustion-engine and powertrain operations by Renault Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo.The change in ownership would alleviate an imbalance that‚Äôs been a source of friction for years. Although Renault has an outsized stake in Nissan  the Japanese carmaker sold 4 million vehicles in 2021 versus the French manufacturer‚Äôs 2.7 million. The 2018 arrest of Carlos Ghosn  who was sent in to run the partnership when Renault rescued Nissan two decades ago  planted the early seeds of the changes in the alliance. The former chairman and CEO escaped Japan in December 2019 and is currently in Lebanon.Nissan plans to start repatriating cash from China for the deal soon after the non-binding agreement is signed  one person said. The Japanese carmaker is still willing to walk away should Renault seek different terms or the French government  a key Renault investor  seek to block the plan  the person said.Representatives for Renault and Nissan declined to comment.Speaking Tuesday on the sidelines of the Paris Automotive Summit  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was in talks with de Meo and was about to meet with him. ‚ÄúWe just want the guarantee that the decisions taken by Renault will preserve the alliance  which is in the interest of Renault ‚Äù he said.Executives have discussed the carve-out plan since February  as Renault seeks to shore up its future in the shifting European car market  the company‚Äôs mainstay. Discussions intensified earlier this month when Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta met in Japan with de Meo and Francois Provost  senior vice president of international development and partnerships.Carmakers are taking unprecedented steps to navigate the EV transformation. Ford Motor Co. in March said it‚Äôll separate the fast-growing EV and software business from the combustion-engine assets that will focus on cutting costs and streamlining operations. Last year  Daimler ended more than a century of making cars and trucks under one roof  with Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Daimler Truck Holding AG now listed separately.Under Renault‚Äôs plans  an entity dedicated to EVs and software would be based in France and employ about 10 000 people by 2023. A second entity  a partnership with China‚Äôs Zhejiang Geely Holding Group  would focus on internal combustion and hybrid powertrains  and be based outside France  also with a staff of about 10 000.One potential snag could be the Japanese government‚Äôs concern over the transfer of combustion-powertrain technology to Aurobay  a joint venture between Geely and Volvo Car AB  and other investors  the person said.Executives from Renault and Nissan aim to formally unveil the agreement next month  the people said. All board members from Renault  Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  the junior member of the three-way alliance  will attend the event in Tokyo  the people said.Before then  Renault is scheduled to speak to investors at its capital markets day scheduled for Nov. 8  when de Meo is expected to give an update on financial targets as well as on the plan to split the two businesses.The talks with Nissan on ‚Äúseveral‚Äù projects are ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù and will ‚Äútake time ‚Äù de Meo told reporters on Oct. 13 at a press conference on Renault‚Äôs recycling plans. Still  he said he was optimistic that an agreement with Nissan could be found in coming weeks on some of the projects under discussion.‚ÄúWe are working with the right frame of mind ‚Äù de Meo said about the talks. ‚ÄúWe have some interesting leads.‚ÄùThe agreement includes provisions preventing Renault from selling shares to a competitor or to an activist investor  the person said. Renault has no plans to sell right away because it would have to take an impairment by selling at current prices  and will seek an orderly disposal of stock.One option being discussed is placing shares in a trust and giving Nissan the right of first refusal for any stock that is offered for sale  according to the person familiar with the talks.Renault‚Äôs voting rights in Nissan will also be capped immediately when the deal goes into effect. The changes will require a new operating agreement between the companies  the person said.‚ÄúWe talk every day ‚Äù Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said Monday at the Paris car show when asked about current discussions.

At constant exchange rates the increase is +2%  reflecting the continued appreciation of the Brazilian Real over the period. The average EUR/BRL rate was 5.46 in 9M 2022  compared to 6.38 in 9M 2021.During the first nine months  Voltalia benefited from the strong acceleration of production by its subsidiary Helexia  which specialises in on-site energy production from rooftops and solar shading systems and in energy optimisation for buildings.As at 30 September 2022  production reached 2.5 TWh  compared with 2.9 TWh as at 30 September 2021. This decrease is explained  on the one hand  by the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants in Brazil (which had started producing in 9M 2021)  and on the other hand by fewer wind and solar resources than in 2021.The increase in revenues (+12%) in a context of falling production (-15%) reflects a sharp rise in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors9: (i) contractual indexation of sales prices to inflation up to 83% of revenues in 2021  (ii) replacement of projects with low prices per MWh by higher-priced projects  and (iii) strengthening of the Brazilian real.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Energy Sales reach ‚Ç¨74.8 million  up +16% (+4% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021.Quarterly production was 1.2 TWh compared to 1.3 TWh in 2021 and operating capacity is 1 521 MW to date10 (+19% compared to the end of September 2021).By country:In Brazil  production decreased by -17% due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in the first half of 2021)  partly offset by the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3) and the first effects of the plant commissioned in the first half of 2022 (SSM1-2);In France  production is up by +17% mainly due to the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao)  and the first effects of the Carri√®re des Plaines solar plant (which started operations in June 2022). Helexia is contributing to this progress  notably with the production of the agricultural photovoltaic roofs of Cap Sud  whose acquisition was finalised in July and consolidated from that date;In the other countries  production is growing overall (+19%). It increased by a factor of x3.7 in Greece due to the full effect of the production of the new Stavria solar power plant commissioned in March  and by +48% in Spain and +64% in Portugal  due to the strong increase in Helexia's production during the period. In Egypt and Jordan  production was up by +2% compared to last year.SERVICESRevenues for 9M 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨240.3 million  up +58% (+56% at constant exchange rates) compared to 9M 2021. Revenues with third party clients are up +79% to ‚Ç¨178.5 million and internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) are up +18% to ‚Ç¨61.8 million. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment increases by +65% to ‚Ç¨217.3 million and the Operation-Maintenance segment by +12% to ‚Ç¨23.0 million.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨73.2 million  up +36% (+35% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021.

If you want to see some more of the top 10 stock exchanges  go directly to Top 5 Stock Exchanges in the World.Stock exchanges are exchanges where different financial instruments such as stocks  bonds  and commodities are traded. For each trade  there is a buyer and a seller.Stock exchanges are at the heart of capitalism. By being listed on stock exchanges  companies can raise capital to grow. If companies successfully grow with the capital they raise  they can hire more people and create more jobs. The increase in the value of their stocks further increases the wealth of the owners  who if they live in the same country  could help increase demand in that country. Because they are so important for the economy  stock exchanges are heavily regulated.HistoryImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayThe first stock exchange was founded in Amsterdam in 1611 and the first stock to ever be traded was the Dutch East India Company and for a while it was the only company with any meaningful trading activity.In the United States  the first stock exchange was the Philadelphia Stock Exchange which was founded in 1790. The stock exchange helped the U.S. financial sector develop and also helped the United States expand west. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange would later be surpassed by the New York Stock Exchange.In 1971  the NASDAQ was founded as an exchange that allowed the buying and selling of stocks via a network of computers rather than in-person like on the NYSE during that time.Given the growth of the U.S. and global economy  stock exchanges have since formed all across the world and the total market capitalization of listed companies on stock exchanges have grown substantially from the 1970's.2022 HeadwindsSource: Federal Reserve.Chairman Powell presents the Monetary Policy Report to the Senate Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs. Report here: www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2018-07-mpr-summary...Story continuesStock exchanges have seen a lot of times of bullish sentiment and a lot of times of bearish sentiment. In times of bullish sentiment  the market capitalization of listed companies can grow and it can be easier for stock exchanges to make money. In times of bearish sentiment  however  it can be a little bit more difficult.In terms of 2022  it seems like we're in a bear market given that the markets have fallen substantially from their highs.The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times this year and as a result  it's harder for some businesses to grow. With the sudden rate of the raises  there is also concern that a recession could occur in 2023. According to a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists  there is a 60% chance of a recession over the next 12 months. According to some models  the odds of a recession are even higher.Some also think the Federal Reserve could continue to raise interest rates.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of inflation in September  ""Our expectation has been we would begin to see inflation come down  largely because of supply side healing. We haven‚Äôt. We have seen some supply side healing but inflation has not really come down.""Powell also commented on the interest rate hikes  ""No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be. That‚Äôs going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down  whether expectations remain anchored and also if we get more labor supply.""The United StatesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comIn terms of the stock exchanges in the United States  the NYSE and the NASDAQ are the two main ones.Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) owns the NYSE exchange as well as several other futures and energy exchanges. The company began in May 2000 as an OTC trading platform that expanded through M&A to acquire future exchanges and clearing. In 2012  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) did a transformative deal to buy NYSE Euronext which owned the NYSE at the time. Given successful M&A  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) has rallied substantially since it went public. Due to the stock market decline  shares of the stock are down around 31.5% year to date in 2022.ClearBridge Investments commented on Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) in its Q2 2022 investor letter earlier in the year Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) operates global financial exchanges and clearing houses  which we believe is a resilient business at a good valuation. One of our key tactics in a potential recessionary environment is to focus on stocks where earnings and cash flow will hold up better than the market. ICE fits the bill as it benefits directly from volatility in financial markets  including in commodities where we are seeing major price swings. During the first half  ICE earnings estimates came up modestly  but its valuation multiple fell over 30%. Some of this weakness is due to ICE‚Äôs planned acquisition of Black Knight (BKI)  which we think makes strategic sense. However  it is being done as Black Knight‚Äôs business is projected to slow as housing activity cools on higher mortgage rates  and the deal may also face regulatory scrutiny. Regardless  the recent weakness in the stock gave us a price below our estimate of long-term business value for a solid and resilient business and we acted accordingly.For the second quarter  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) reported EPS of $1.32 versus the consensus of $1.27. Revenue for the period was $2.41 billion versus the consensus of $1.8 billion. While those numbers are strong  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE)'s results might face headwinds in the future given the macro headwinds. On 10/6 Alex Kramm of UBS cut his price target to $116 from $128 but kept a 'Buy' rating citing softer than expected trends in the energy business as well as lower pricing. Kramm sees a significant sequential decline in the company's mortgage tech segment.Of the 895 hedge funds in our database  51 were long Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) at the end of the second quarter. Cantillon Capital Management owned almost 4 million shares of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) at the end of the second quarter.Nasdaq  Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is a global tech company that serves the capital markets and other industries. In addition to owning the NASDAQ exchange  the company offers data  analytics  software and services. On 10/12  Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank lowerd his price target to $67 from $68 on the NASDAQ but nevertheless kept a 'Buy' rating. Bedell cited revised macro assumptions in his models  among other things.The Federal Reserve rate hikes could cause market volatility  and that some companies might not go public when markets are extremely volatile. In addition to its valuation multiple  Nasdaq  Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ)'s revenue could be affected by the market volatility as well.30 hedge funds we track owned shares of Nasdaq  Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) at the end of Q2 2022. Among them  Diamond Hill Capital was the top holder at the end of Q2 with a holding of almost 2.04 million shares.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list  we took the top 10 stock exchanges from statista.com's Largest stock exchange operators worldwide as of August 2022  by market capitalization of listed companies.

This financing will further support Aqemia‚Äôs core mission: to massively scale drug discovery  through a first-in-class technological platform combining quantum-inspired physics and machine learning.In three years  Aqemia has grown from a spin-off of Ecole Normale Superieure to an A-team of 50 people at the crossroads of Chemistry and Artificial Intelligence  and has built its innovation engine - Aqemia‚Äôs Launchpad.The Launchpad has proven successful in several disclosed and undisclosed collaborations worth up to millions of euros with leading pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi  Janssen and Servier.This unique technology has already resulted in the launch of a proprietary pipeline of several drug discovery projects  which now range from in vitro to in vivo phases  especially in oncology and immuno-oncology.‚ÄúAfter repeated successes in generating very efficiently innovative new chemical matter in collaboration with large pharmaceutical companies around the world  we are now excited to leverage this fundraising to accelerate towards Aqemia‚Äôs mission: build a massive pipeline of wholly-owned drug discovery projects.‚Äù  said Maximilien Levesque  Co-founder and CEO of Aqemia.Unlike AI-based platforms that need experimental data to train on  Aqemia addresses drug discovery projects from their earliest stage by generating its own data using unique quantum physics algorithms derived from 12 years of research at univ. Cambridge and Oxford (UK)  and √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and CNRS.‚ÄúThe unprecedented pace ‚Äì a whopping 10 000x faster while maintaining costs - and accuracy of our deep physics algorithms  adding up to our generative AI  creates a unique combination that permits to generate innovative new drug candidates more quickly  and scale drug discovery projects as technology projects.‚Äù continued Emmanuelle Martiano  Co-Founder & COO of Aqemia. ‚ÄúWe are continuously recruiting to address our next technology and drug discovery challenges‚Äù  she added.Aqemia's ambition is to optimize and accelerate early drug discovery projects on a massive scale in order to uncover dozens of proprietary new drug candidates. Those candidates will fuel a diversified therapeutic pipeline across a variety of targets and indications that Aqemia intends to advance into clinical trials alone through a constellation of Biotech spin-offs or with partners as the case may be.‚ÄúWe are thrilled to welcome Eurazeo and Bpifrance‚Äôs Large Venture fund onboard  as they are known for investing in the finest French scale-ups  and to receive again backing from Elaia  the first French Deeptech VC investor‚Äù said Maximilien.When asked about this investment  Antoine Zins  Investment Director at Eurazeo  stated:""I strongly believe that Aqemia has unparalleled power to shift the drug discovery paradigm. They have not only solved the missing data paradox in the discovery process with deep physics and AI  they can also generate leads at a faster pace than any discovery platform before them. We are very excited to be part of the adventure by their side‚Äù.Laurent Higueret  Senior Investment Director at Bpifrance‚Äôs Large Venture fund  added:""Early drug discovery is a long  costly and cumbersome process with often unsatisfactory outcomes for sponsors and ultimately patients. Aqemia‚Äôs ambition is to change all that by bringing together deep physics and AI into a powerful computational engine that has the potential to generate promising new development candidates at scale. Through this investment  we are thrilled to be part of this exciting journey and further expand Bpifrance portfolio in deeptech and AI.‚Äù***About AqemiaAqemia is a next-gen pharmatech company generating one of the world's fastest-growing drug discovery pipeline.

There is uncertainty in the market due to a number of global macro-economic concerns including inflation  consumer confidence and the risk of a recession.

We recorded a double-digit increase in sales revenue and  despite unfavorable trends on the cost and currency side  a very good profit margin. As expected  the development was also characterized by a swift normalization of demand following two years influenced by strong special effects due to the pandemic. We expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of Albumedix  adding an important component for the manufacture of innovative biopharmaceuticals  particularly regarding modalities such as cell therapies  viral therapies and vaccines. We are specifying our full-year outlook for 2022 within the range projected so far  but the global political and economic uncertainties remain high "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first nine months  Group sales revenue recorded a year-over-year increase of 17.0 percent in constant currencies (reported: +23.4 percent) to 2 603 million euros. This performance was driven by organic growth  while acquisitions 2 as expected  contributed around 2 percentage points to growth. All major product segments contributed to the sales revenue development  while coronavirus-related business declined significantly from the prior-year period. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA 3 the Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì recorded significant growth  with the Americas region posting the strongest gain. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic as well as business limitations in Russia dampened growth to a limited extend.Story continuesFollowing an exceptionally strong prior-year figure due to the pandemic  order intake  as expected  declined in the first nine months and reached 2 601 million euros (in constant currencies: -12.8 percent  reported: -8.8 percent). The first nine months of 2021 had been influenced by high demand from vaccine manufacturers and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who had placed orders larger in size and further in advance than usual.Underlying EBITDA increased by 19.1 percent to 912 million euros in the first nine months. The corresponding margin reached 35.0 percent (prior-year period: 36.3 percent). This development was positively influenced by economies of scale from sales revenue growth  but diluted by currency effects and  as planned  higher costs resulting from the recruitment of new employees as well as other normalized cost positions. Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit reached 607 million euros  representing a significant increase of 19.2 percent from the first nine months of 2021. Underlying earnings per share were 6.58 euros (prior-year period: 5.52 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. Its equity ratio stood at a very robust level of 46.1 percent as of September 30  2022 (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent)  despite the acquisition of Albumedix  which was completed at the end of September 2022. The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 0.9 as of the reporting date  compared with 0.4 at the end of 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at -289 million euros  compared with -186 million euros in the first nine months of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 11.1 percent (prior-year period: 8.8 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of September 30  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a total of 12 120 employees worldwide  representing a rise in headcount of 1 711 from the end of 2021. Following a significant increase in the first six months of the year  the number of new hires slowed down considerably with the beginning of the second half of 2022  as planned.Outlook for fiscal 2022 specifiedBased on the results of the first nine months  management specifies its outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue growth is now expected to be in the lower half of the range of around 15 percent to 19 percent projected so far  with non-organic growth from acquisitions anticipated to contribute about 2 percentage points. Regarding profitability  Sartorius Stedim Biotech continues to expect its underlying EBITDA margin to reach more than 35 percent.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA is now anticipated to be about 0.8 at year end (previously about 0.2) following the closing of the Albumedix acquisition. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Moreover  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains  inflation and energy supply  and no new relevant restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Accordingly  current forecasts show higher uncertainties than usual.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

The project integrates the revived district with the local community  creating better connectivity with the surrounding neighbourhood while acting as a catalyst for the broader regeneration of Montparnasse.Commenting on the opening  Jean-Marie Tritant  Chief Executive Officer  said: ‚ÄúLes Ateliers Ga√Æt√© demonstrates our commitment to partnering with cities on major regeneration projects that meet the changing needs of an urban society. We worked closely with the City of Paris to create a vibrant and people-centric mixed-use destination that makes a practical contribution to the lives of residents  workers and visitors in the Montparnasse neighbourhood.‚ÄùAs part of the wider Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© project  URW has already successfully delivered the refurbishment of the 52 000 sqm Pullman Montparnasse hotel  operated by Accor  in H2-2021  and a 13 000 sqm office project in H1-2022  fully let to Accor Group‚Äôs co-working operator Wojo.The final part of the project  a three-floor 28 800 sqm shopping and lifestyle destination  has now opened to the public. It is over 90% let and incorporates services that meet the needs of local residents and workers  as well as a wide range of restaurant and entertainment options ‚Äì including the first Food Society food hall in Paris with 15 kiosks and 3 bars. The development also incorporates 62 social housing units which will be owned by the City of Paris and triples the area dedicated to public services  including a new municipal library and a childcare centre.In line with URW‚Äôs Better Places 2030 sustainability strategy  Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√©‚Äôs redevelopment delivers a 40% reduction in energy used for heating resulting in 880 tonnes of avoided CO2 emissions each year. This is achieved through highly efficient new buildings and innovations including an energy transfer loop that recovers more than 50% of the waste heat emitted by the retail centre  which can then be reused to heat the hotel.For more information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39audrey.arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf ‚Äì Finelk+44 7387 108 998France:Nathalie Feld ‚Äì Image7+33 6 30 47 18 37nfeld@image7.frUnited States:Molly Morse ‚Äì Kekst CNC+1 212 521 4826molly.morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 80 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

At constant exchange rates the increase is +2%  reflecting the continued appreciation of the Brazilian Real over the period. The average EUR/BRL rate was 5.46 in 9M 2022  compared to 6.38 in 9M 2021.During the first nine months  Voltalia benefited from the strong acceleration of production by its subsidiary Helexia  which specialises in on-site energy production from rooftops and solar shading systems and in energy optimisation for buildings.As at 30 September 2022  production reached 2.5 TWh  compared with 2.9 TWh as at 30 September 2021. This decrease is explained  on the one hand  by the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants in Brazil (which had started producing in 9M 2021)  and on the other hand by fewer wind and solar resources than in 2021.The increase in revenues (+12%) in a context of falling production (-15%) reflects a sharp rise in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors9: (i) contractual indexation of sales prices to inflation up to 83% of revenues in 2021  (ii) replacement of projects with low prices per MWh by higher-priced projects  and (iii) strengthening of the Brazilian real.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Energy Sales reach ‚Ç¨74.8 million  up +16% (+4% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021.Quarterly production was 1.2 TWh compared to 1.3 TWh in 2021 and operating capacity is 1 521 MW to date10 (+19% compared to the end of September 2021).By country:In Brazil  production decreased by -17% due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in the first half of 2021)  partly offset by the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3) and the first effects of the plant commissioned in the first half of 2022 (SSM1-2);In France  production is up by +17% mainly due to the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao)  and the first effects of the Carri√®re des Plaines solar plant (which started operations in June 2022). Helexia is contributing to this progress  notably with the production of the agricultural photovoltaic roofs of Cap Sud  whose acquisition was finalised in July and consolidated from that date;In the other countries  production is growing overall (+19%). It increased by a factor of x3.7 in Greece due to the full effect of the production of the new Stavria solar power plant commissioned in March  and by +48% in Spain and +64% in Portugal  due to the strong increase in Helexia's production during the period. In Egypt and Jordan  production was up by +2% compared to last year.SERVICESRevenues for 9M 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨240.3 million  up +58% (+56% at constant exchange rates) compared to 9M 2021. Revenues with third party clients are up +79% to ‚Ç¨178.5 million and internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) are up +18% to ‚Ç¨61.8 million. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment increases by +65% to ‚Ç¨217.3 million and the Operation-Maintenance segment by +12% to ‚Ç¨23.0 million.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach ‚Ç¨73.2 million  up +36% (+35% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021. Revenues from third party clients grow strongly by +62% while internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) decrease by -18%. The analysis by segment shows the following developments:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts revenues of ‚Ç¨65.3 million  up +42% (at current and constant exchange rates). During the quarter  Development revenues benefited from the sale of solar power plant development projects in Brazil to third parties  while Equipment Procurement was particularly strong in France  Italy and the UK. Construction revenues decreased slightly during the quarter due to lower activity levels in France and the UK  partly offset by a strong performance in Portugal. Third party revenues increased by +66%  while internal revenues decreased by -18%;The Operations-Maintenance segment reports stable revenues of ‚Ç¨8.0 million  slightly up by +3% compared to Q3 2021 (-2% at constant exchange rates). Third party customers account for 55% of the segment's revenues.Revenue eliminations for 9M and Q3 2022 amount to respectively ‚Ç¨61.8 million (+18% at current exchange rates and +15% at constant exchange rates) and ‚Ç¨12.9 million (- 22% at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting less internally focused construction activity in Q3 2022  with a growing share of external clients.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)In South Africa  Voltalia signed a 148 MW power sales contract with Rio Tinto11Voltalia entered into a 20-year Corporate PPA with Richards Bay Minerals (RBM)  a leading international mineral sands company and subsidiary of Rio Tinto.RBM will be powered by the Bolobedu solar project  the largest dedicated corporate renewable energy site in South Africa.

For the first nine months of 2022  Invibes Advertising posts a cumulative increase in turnover of +35%  off of a high nine-month 2021 basis which had shown 3-digit growth.Market conditions have been challenging  with a notably soft summer that has affected the entire sector. While September is usually a strong month  this year  September was impacted by the difficult economic context and rising inflation in several European countries. With growing concerns about consumer purchasing power  some advertisers decided to reduce their budget or direct it towards limited promotional campaigns. In particular  the French digital advertising market has been very slow in Q3 2022.Focus on ExcellenceAfter expanding its commercial presence in 8 additional countries over the last 18 months  Invibes Advertising‚Äôs management is focusing its efforts on core service to ensure that the Company delivers Excellence for its clients and achieves further growth.Several elements point to the quality of Invibes Advertising‚Äôs offering:The number of clients of the Company has increased by 43% in the first nine months of 2022 vs the same period in 2021. Some large campaigns run last year by public bodies in the context of Covid are being replaced by several individual campaigns for other advertisers.The number of clients taking advantage of the Company‚Äôs capability to run cross-market campaigns has doubled between the first nine months of 2022 and the first nine months of 2021.Scale-up and start-up countries are increasingly contributing to the Group‚Äôs performance  confirming their strong potential  even though the important UK advertising market was severely affected by the death of Queen Elisabeth II at the beginning of September  with a recovery towards the end of the month.If anything  the current challenges of the economic context act as additional incentive to further strengthen a fundamentally good business that will be able to grow as soon as market conditions improve. Already in 2020  the advertising market was severely affected by the Covid pandemic  and yet  Invibes Advertising was able to achieve 19% growth that year  followed by a doubling in revenues in 2021. Now again  the whole Company is fully mobilised towards delivering Excellence for its clients to gain market share and lay the ground for accelerated growth once the economic environment improves.Heightened focus on cost controlFollowing a strong commercial push and an ambitious recruitment programme in the first half of 2022  Invibes Advertising now has teams in place across 18 offices in 15 countries  in line with the international expansion objectives announced in the Company‚Äôs development roadmap. This international footprint now provides Invibes Advertising with sufficient scale to execute its development plan  without needing to expand further in the medium-term.Management‚Äôs focus is firmly set on improving the Company‚Äôs profitability by optimising the cost structure and increasing productivity.Sound financial structure to finance strategic investments and fuel future developmentInvibes Advertising raised ‚Ç¨17m in a private placement in January 2022 to have the financial resources to fund its development. After substantial investments to achieve its planned international expansion  the Company‚Äôs priority is to improve its offer. Thanks to a strong balance sheet  Invibes Advertising is able to continue to invest in technology and operations in order to innovate  to further enrich its products range  and to ensure a high level of service to its clients.That sustained level of investment is essential to enable Invibes Advertising to convert the current economic challenges into an opportunity to strengthen its position in the market. This will give the Company the capacity to fully benefit from the future market recovery. In the meantime  in light of the currently challenging market conditions  management is reviewing its announced 2024 target turnover.Next publication: 2022 full-year revenues on 25 January 2023  after market close.About Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising is an international technology company specializing in digital advertising innovation.

We recorded a double-digit increase in sales revenue and  despite unfavorable trends on the cost and currency side  a very good profit margin. As expected  the development was also characterized by a swift normalization of demand following two years influenced by strong special effects due to the pandemic. We expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of Albumedix  adding an important component for the manufacture of innovative biopharmaceuticals  particularly regarding modalities such as cell therapies  viral therapies and vaccines. We are specifying our full-year outlook for 2022 within the range projected so far  but the global political and economic uncertainties remain high "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first nine months  Group sales revenue recorded a year-over-year increase of 17.0 percent in constant currencies (reported: +23.4 percent) to 2 603 million euros. This performance was driven by organic growth  while acquisitions 2 as expected  contributed around 2 percentage points to growth. All major product segments contributed to the sales revenue development  while coronavirus-related business declined significantly from the prior-year period. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA 3 the Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì recorded significant growth  with the Americas region posting the strongest gain. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic as well as business limitations in Russia dampened growth to a limited extend.Following an exceptionally strong prior-year figure due to the pandemic  order intake  as expected  declined in the first nine months and reached 2 601 million euros (in constant currencies: -12.8 percent  reported: -8.8 percent). The first nine months of 2021 had been influenced by high demand from vaccine manufacturers and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who had placed orders larger in size and further in advance than usual.Underlying EBITDA increased by 19.1 percent to 912 million euros in the first nine months. The corresponding margin reached 35.0 percent (prior-year period: 36.3 percent). This development was positively influenced by economies of scale from sales revenue growth  but diluted by currency effects and  as planned  higher costs resulting from the recruitment of new employees as well as other normalized cost positions. Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit reached 607 million euros  representing a significant increase of 19.2 percent from the first nine months of 2021. Underlying earnings per share were 6.58 euros (prior-year period: 5.52 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. Its equity ratio stood at a very robust level of 46.1 percent as of September 30  2022 (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent)  despite the acquisition of Albumedix  which was completed at the end of September 2022. The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 0.9 as of the reporting date  compared with 0.4 at the end of 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at -289 million euros  compared with -186 million euros in the first nine months of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 11.1 percent (prior-year period: 8.8 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of September 30  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a total of 12 120 employees worldwide  representing a rise in headcount of 1 711 from the end of 2021. Following a significant increase in the first six months of the year  the number of new hires slowed down considerably with the beginning of the second half of 2022  as planned.Outlook for fiscal 2022 specifiedBased on the results of the first nine months  management specifies its outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue growth is now expected to be in the lower half of the range of around 15 percent to 19 percent projected so far  with non-organic growth from acquisitions anticipated to contribute about 2 percentage points. Regarding profitability  Sartorius Stedim Biotech continues to expect its underlying EBITDA margin to reach more than 35 percent.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA is now anticipated to be about 0.8 at year end (previously about 0.2) following the closing of the Albumedix acquisition. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends.

For,"Lyon  19 October 2022 - 6:00 pm. Visiativ  a digital transformation and innovation expert for small and medium-sized businesses  is listed on Euronext Growth in Paris (FR0004029478  ALVIV).For the first nine months of its 2022 financial year (running from 1 January to 30 September 2022)  Visiativ recorded consolidated revenue of ‚Ç¨158.0m  up 18% relative to the year-earlier period. Organic[1] growth stood at 9%.Nine-month revenue in the SOFTWARE business  which includes all software sales  stood at ‚Ç¨94.5m  up 17% (9% in organic terms). Revenue in the CONSULTING business  which includes all services provided  totalled ‚Ç¨63.4m  showing robust growth of 20% (9% in organic terms).Nine-month revenue from recurring businesses (multi-year contracts  software maintenance and software subscriptions)  which represented 64% of revenue at end-September  was up 20% (+12% on a constant scope and exchange-rate basis[1]).In the wake of the first half performance  growth momentum remained particularly robust outside France with revenue up 53% over the period  with 26% organic growth. International business also enjoys higher profitability levels and now accounts for 36% of revenue compared with 27% in the year-earlier period.Visiativ confirms its EBITDA target of ‚Ç¨30m for 2023.‚Ç¨m - Unaudited data as of 30/09 9 months 2021 9 months 2022 Change Organic change[1] SOFTWARE 81.0 94.5 +17% +9% o/w SaaS subscriptions 10.3 14.2 +38% +24% CONSULTING 52.7 63.4 +20% +9% TOTAL REVENUE 133.8 158.0 +18% +9% o/w International revenue 36.7 56.3 +53% +26% As a % 27% 36% o/w Recurring revenue 84.3 101.4 +20% +12% As a % 63% 64%Revenue in the SOFTWARE business was up 8% to ‚Ç¨27.7m in Q3 2022 (-2% in organic terms) in line with the Q2 trend. The performance was not particularly meaningful given the extremely robust momentum seen at the start of the year (+30% organic growth in Q1) with a high level of order anticipations  especially in industry.Revenue generated from Software as a Service (SaaS) subscriptions was up 38% over nine months (+24% in organic terms) and accounted for 15% of total SOFTWARE revenue. At end-September 2022  ARR (annual recurring revenue) amounted to ‚Ç¨22.1m  up 53% (+28% in organic terms) relative to the amount on 30 September 2021.Revenue in the CONSULTING business remained robust in Q3 2022 (+23%  including 8% organic growth) in all businesses. Momentum was driven by growth in the Americas region (+94%)  which now accounts for a third of revenue in the CONSULTING business vs. just over 20% in Q3 2021. The appeal of the cybersecurity and digital transformation offers has not weakened with 16 diagnostics contracts signed over the past quarter  after 32 during the first half of 2022.Recurring revenue (multi-year contracts  software maintenance and software subscriptions) exceeded the ‚Ç¨100m mark at end-September 2022 to stand at ‚Ç¨101.4m  up 20% (+12% in organic terms) over nine months. Recurring business represents 64% of Visiativ's total billings (vs. 63% at end-September 2021).Continuing on from previous quarters  sales generated outside France remained particularly dynamic in the third quarter of 2022 (up 52% including 15% on a constant scope and exchange rate basis). At end-September  they represented 36% of Visiativ's revenue vs. 27% at end-September 2021.OUTLOOKAfter a strong first half showing 20% growth and a 32% increase in EBITDA  Visiativ continues to deliver robust growth  especially in international business. The recent acquisitions of MB CAD in Germany and Braithwaite in Canada and in Ireland and Absiskey in France  are set to fully contribute to this positive and margin-enhancing momentum.At the same time  the share of recurring business is growing from one quarter to the next  with ARR of more than ‚Ç¨22m (vs. ‚Ç¨19m at end-June)  benefiting from the entry into the scope of consolidation of business mobile apps publisher Daxium in Q3 (‚Ç¨2.1m in additional ARR).Strengthened by this solid momentum  Visiativ reiterates the targets of its CATALYST strategic plan aiming for EBITDA of ‚Ç¨30m for 2023.2022 FINANCIAL AGENDAEVENTS DATES Full-year 2022 revenue Wednesday 25 January  2023 Full-year 2022 results Tuesday 21 March  2023These dates are an indication and may be changed if necessary.
