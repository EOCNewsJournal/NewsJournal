Both sides are set to sign a non-binding agreement after details were largely finalized late last week  said the person  who asked not to be identif…,The unveiling of the Renault SA 4Ever Trophy all-electric concept vehicle on the opening day of the Paris Motor Show in Paris  France  on Monday  Oct. 17  2022. Nissan Motor Co. is willing to invest as much as $750 million in Renaults planned electric-vehicle business  in exchange  the French manufacturer is open to paring its ownership of Nissan to 15% over time.Renault SA is in the final stages of concluding a deal this week to reduce its stake in Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co. and reshape their two-decades-old alliance  a person familiar with the negotiations said.The pact would allow the French carmaker to proceed with a planned carve-out of its electric-vehicle business. Both sides are set to sign a non-binding agreement after details were largely finalized late last week  said the person  who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Although an event is being planned in Tokyo on Nov. 15 to announce the deal  discussions are ongoing and a final agreement could still be delayed  people familiar with the talks said. Shares of Renault rose as much as 3.2% in morning trading on Euronext.Under the plan  the French carmaker will reduce its ownership of Nissan over time to 15% from the current 43%. In return  Nissan will invest $500 million to $750 million for a stake of about 15% in Renault’s electric-vehicle business  code-named Ampere  which is being split from the combustion-engine and powertrain operations by Renault Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo.The change in ownership would alleviate an imbalance that’s been a source of friction for years. Although Renault has an outsized stake in Nissan  the Japanese carmaker sold 4 million vehicles in 2021 versus the French manufacturer’s 2.7 million. The 2018 arrest of Carlos Ghosn  who was sent in to run the partnership when Renault rescued Nissan two decades ago  planted the early seeds of the changes in the alliance. The former chairman and CEO escaped Japan in December 2019 and is currently in Lebanon.Nissan plans to start repatriating cash from China for the deal soon after the non-binding agreement is signed  one person said. The Japanese carmaker is still willing to walk away should Renault seek different terms or the French government  a key Renault investor  seek to block the plan  the person said.Representatives for Renault and Nissan declined to comment.Speaking Tuesday on the sidelines of the Paris Automotive Summit  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was in talks with de Meo and was about to meet with him. “We just want the guarantee that the decisions taken by Renault will preserve the alliance  which is in the interest of Renault ” he said.Executives have discussed the carve-out plan since February  as Renault seeks to shore up its future in the shifting European car market  the company’s mainstay. Discussions intensified earlier this month when Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta met in Japan with de Meo and Francois Provost  senior vice president of international development and partnerships.Carmakers are taking unprecedented steps to navigate the EV transformation. Ford Motor Co. in March said it’ll separate the fast-growing EV and software business from the combustion-engine assets that will focus on cutting costs and streamlining operations. Last year  Daimler ended more than a century of making cars and trucks under one roof  with Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Daimler Truck Holding AG now listed separately.Under Renault’s plans  an entity dedicated to EVs and software would be based in France and employ about 10 000 people by 2023. A second entity  a partnership with China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group  would focus on internal combustion and hybrid powertrains  and be based outside France  also with a staff of about 10 000.One potential snag could be the Japanese government’s concern over the transfer of combustion-powertrain technology to Aurobay  a joint venture between Geely and Volvo Car AB  and other investors  the person said.Executives from Renault and Nissan aim to formally unveil the agreement next month  the people said. All board members from Renault  Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  the junior member of the three-way alliance  will attend the event in Tokyo  the people said.Before then  Renault is scheduled to speak to investors at its capital markets day scheduled for Nov. 8  when de Meo is expected to give an update on financial targets as well as on the plan to split the two businesses.The talks with Nissan on “several” projects are “complex” and will “take time ” de Meo told reporters on Oct. 13 at a press conference on Renault’s recycling plans. Still  he said he was optimistic that an agreement with Nissan could be found in coming weeks on some of the projects under discussion.“We are working with the right frame of mind ” de Meo said about the talks. “We have some interesting leads.”The agreement includes provisions preventing Renault from selling shares to a competitor or to an activist investor  the person said. Renault has no plans to sell right away because it would have to take an impairment by selling at current prices  and will seek an orderly disposal of stock.One option being discussed is placing shares in a trust and giving Nissan the right of first refusal for any stock that is offered for sale  according to the person familiar with the talks.Renault’s voting rights in Nissan will also be capped immediately when the deal goes into effect. The changes will require a new operating agreement between the companies  the person said.“We talk every day ” Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said Monday at the Paris car show when asked about current discussions.

At constant exchange rates the increase is +2%  reflecting the continued appreciation of the Brazilian Real over the period. The average EUR/BRL rate was 5.46 in 9M 2022  compared to 6.38 in 9M 2021.During the first nine months  Voltalia benefited from the strong acceleration of production by its subsidiary Helexia  which specialises in on-site energy production from rooftops and solar shading systems and in energy optimisation for buildings.As at 30 September 2022  production reached 2.5 TWh  compared with 2.9 TWh as at 30 September 2021. This decrease is explained  on the one hand  by the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants in Brazil (which had started producing in 9M 2021)  and on the other hand by fewer wind and solar resources than in 2021.The increase in revenues (+12%) in a context of falling production (-15%) reflects a sharp rise in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors9: (i) contractual indexation of sales prices to inflation up to 83% of revenues in 2021  (ii) replacement of projects with low prices per MWh by higher-priced projects  and (iii) strengthening of the Brazilian real.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Energy Sales reach €74.8 million  up +16% (+4% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021.Quarterly production was 1.2 TWh compared to 1.3 TWh in 2021 and operating capacity is 1 521 MW to date10 (+19% compared to the end of September 2021).By country:In Brazil  production decreased by -17% due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in the first half of 2021)  partly offset by the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3) and the first effects of the plant commissioned in the first half of 2022 (SSM1-2);In France  production is up by +17% mainly due to the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao)  and the first effects of the Carrière des Plaines solar plant (which started operations in June 2022). Helexia is contributing to this progress  notably with the production of the agricultural photovoltaic roofs of Cap Sud  whose acquisition was finalised in July and consolidated from that date;In the other countries  production is growing overall (+19%). It increased by a factor of x3.7 in Greece due to the full effect of the production of the new Stavria solar power plant commissioned in March  and by +48% in Spain and +64% in Portugal  due to the strong increase in Helexia's production during the period. In Egypt and Jordan  production was up by +2% compared to last year.SERVICESRevenues for 9M 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach €240.3 million  up +58% (+56% at constant exchange rates) compared to 9M 2021. Revenues with third party clients are up +79% to €178.5 million and internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) are up +18% to €61.8 million. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment increases by +65% to €217.3 million and the Operation-Maintenance segment by +12% to €23.0 million.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach €73.2 million  up +36% (+35% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021. Revenues from third party clients grow strongly by +62% while internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) decrease by -18%. The analysis by segment shows the following developments:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts revenues of €65.3 million  up +42% (at current and constant exchange rates). During the quarter  Development revenues benefited from the sale of solar power plant development projects in Brazil to third parties  while Equipment Procurement was particularly strong in France  Italy and the UK. Construction revenues decreased slightly during the quarter due to lower activity levels in France and the UK  partly offset by a strong performance in Portugal. Third party revenues increased by +66%  while internal revenues decreased by -18%;The Operations-Maintenance segment reports stable revenues of €8.0 million  slightly up by +3% compared to Q3 2021 (-2% at constant exchange rates). Third party customers account for 55% of the segment's revenues.Revenue eliminations for 9M and Q3 2022 amount to respectively €61.8 million (+18% at current exchange rates and +15% at constant exchange rates) and €12.9 million (- 22% at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting less internally focused construction activity in Q3 2022  with a growing share of external clients.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)In South Africa  Voltalia signed a 148 MW power sales contract with Rio Tinto11Voltalia entered into a 20-year Corporate PPA with Richards Bay Minerals (RBM)  a leading international mineral sands company and subsidiary of Rio Tinto.RBM will be powered by the Bolobedu solar project  the largest dedicated corporate renewable energy site in South Africa.

If you want to see some more of the top 10 stock exchanges  go directly to Top 5 Stock Exchanges in the World.Stock exchanges are exchanges where different financial instruments such as stocks  bonds  and commodities are traded. For each trade  there is a buyer and a seller.Stock exchanges are at the heart of capitalism. By being listed on stock exchanges  companies can raise capital to grow. If companies successfully grow with the capital they raise  they can hire more people and create more jobs. The increase in the value of their stocks further increases the wealth of the owners  who if they live in the same country  could help increase demand in that country. Because they are so important for the economy  stock exchanges are heavily regulated.HistoryImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayThe first stock exchange was founded in Amsterdam in 1611 and the first stock to ever be traded was the Dutch East India Company and for a while it was the only company with any meaningful trading activity.In the United States  the first stock exchange was the Philadelphia Stock Exchange which was founded in 1790. The stock exchange helped the U.S. financial sector develop and also helped the United States expand west. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange would later be surpassed by the New York Stock Exchange.In 1971  the NASDAQ was founded as an exchange that allowed the buying and selling of stocks via a network of computers rather than in-person like on the NYSE during that time.Given the growth of the U.S. and global economy  stock exchanges have since formed all across the world and the total market capitalization of listed companies on stock exchanges have grown substantially from the 1970's.2022 HeadwindsSource: Federal Reserve.Chairman Powell presents the Monetary Policy Report to the Senate Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs. Report here: www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2018-07-mpr-summary...Story continuesStock exchanges have seen a lot of times of bullish sentiment and a lot of times of bearish sentiment. In times of bullish sentiment  the market capitalization of listed companies can grow and it can be easier for stock exchanges to make money. In times of bearish sentiment  however  it can be a little bit more difficult.In terms of 2022  it seems like we're in a bear market given that the markets have fallen substantially from their highs.The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times this year and as a result  it's harder for some businesses to grow. With the sudden rate of the raises  there is also concern that a recession could occur in 2023. According to a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists  there is a 60% chance of a recession over the next 12 months. According to some models  the odds of a recession are even higher.Some also think the Federal Reserve could continue to raise interest rates.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of inflation in September  ""Our expectation has been we would begin to see inflation come down  largely because of supply side healing. We haven’t. We have seen some supply side healing but inflation has not really come down.""Powell also commented on the interest rate hikes  ""No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be. That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down  whether expectations remain anchored and also if we get more labor supply.""The United StatesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comIn terms of the stock exchanges in the United States  the NYSE and the NASDAQ are the two main ones.Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) owns the NYSE exchange as well as several other futures and energy exchanges. The company began in May 2000 as an OTC trading platform that expanded through M&A to acquire future exchanges and clearing. In 2012  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) did a transformative deal to buy NYSE Euronext which owned the NYSE at the time. Given successful M&A  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) has rallied substantially since it went public. Due to the stock market decline  shares of the stock are down around 31.5% year to date in 2022.ClearBridge Investments commented on Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) in its Q2 2022 investor letter earlier in the year Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) operates global financial exchanges and clearing houses  which we believe is a resilient business at a good valuation. One of our key tactics in a potential recessionary environment is to focus on stocks where earnings and cash flow will hold up better than the market. ICE fits the bill as it benefits directly from volatility in financial markets  including in commodities where we are seeing major price swings. During the first half  ICE earnings estimates came up modestly  but its valuation multiple fell over 30%. Some of this weakness is due to ICE’s planned acquisition of Black Knight (BKI)  which we think makes strategic sense. However  it is being done as Black Knight’s business is projected to slow as housing activity cools on higher mortgage rates  and the deal may also face regulatory scrutiny. Regardless  the recent weakness in the stock gave us a price below our estimate of long-term business value for a solid and resilient business and we acted accordingly.For the second quarter  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) reported EPS of $1.32 versus the consensus of $1.27. Revenue for the period was $2.41 billion versus the consensus of $1.8 billion. While those numbers are strong  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE)'s results might face headwinds in the future given the macro headwinds. On 10/6 Alex Kramm of UBS cut his price target to $116 from $128 but kept a 'Buy' rating citing softer than expected trends in the energy business as well as lower pricing. Kramm sees a significant sequential decline in the company's mortgage tech segment.Of the 895 hedge funds in our database  51 were long Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) at the end of the second quarter. Cantillon Capital Management owned almost 4 million shares of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) at the end of the second quarter.Nasdaq  Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is a global tech company that serves the capital markets and other industries. In addition to owning the NASDAQ exchange  the company offers data  analytics  software and services. On 10/12  Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank lowerd his price target to $67 from $68 on the NASDAQ but nevertheless kept a 'Buy' rating. Bedell cited revised macro assumptions in his models  among other things.The Federal Reserve rate hikes could cause market volatility  and that some companies might not go public when markets are extremely volatile. In addition to its valuation multiple  Nasdaq  Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ)'s revenue could be affected by the market volatility as well.30 hedge funds we track owned shares of Nasdaq  Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) at the end of Q2 2022. Among them  Diamond Hill Capital was the top holder at the end of Q2 with a holding of almost 2.04 million shares.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list  we took the top 10 stock exchanges from statista.com's Largest stock exchange operators worldwide as of August 2022  by market capitalization of listed companies.

Having shortlisted four artists – Giulia Andreani  Iván Argote  Philippe Decrauzat  and Mimosa Echard – the prize committee has effectively illustrated the attractiveness of France for foreign artists because  among them  three are of foreign origin who have chosen to work in France.Mimosa Echard  the winner after long and lively discussionsThe four nominees for 2022 – whose works reflect the diversity of artistic practice in a dynamic French art scene – were chosen by a committee of ADIAF collectors  which is renewed each year.

This financing will further support Aqemia’s core mission: to massively scale drug discovery  through a first-in-class technological platform combining quantum-inspired physics and machine learning.In three years  Aqemia has grown from a spin-off of Ecole Normale Superieure to an A-team of 50 people at the crossroads of Chemistry and Artificial Intelligence  and has built its innovation engine - Aqemia’s Launchpad.The Launchpad has proven successful in several disclosed and undisclosed collaborations worth up to millions of euros with leading pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi  Janssen and Servier.This unique technology has already resulted in the launch of a proprietary pipeline of several drug discovery projects  which now range from in vitro to in vivo phases  especially in oncology and immuno-oncology.“After repeated successes in generating very efficiently innovative new chemical matter in collaboration with large pharmaceutical companies around the world  we are now excited to leverage this fundraising to accelerate towards Aqemia’s mission: build a massive pipeline of wholly-owned drug discovery projects.”  said Maximilien Levesque  Co-founder and CEO of Aqemia.Unlike AI-based platforms that need experimental data to train on  Aqemia addresses drug discovery projects from their earliest stage by generating its own data using unique quantum physics algorithms derived from 12 years of research at univ. Cambridge and Oxford (UK)  and École Normale Supérieure and CNRS.“The unprecedented pace – a whopping 10 000x faster while maintaining costs - and accuracy of our deep physics algorithms  adding up to our generative AI  creates a unique combination that permits to generate innovative new drug candidates more quickly  and scale drug discovery projects as technology projects.” continued Emmanuelle Martiano  Co-Founder & COO of Aqemia. “We are continuously recruiting to address our next technology and drug discovery challenges”  she added.Aqemia's ambition is to optimize and accelerate early drug discovery projects on a massive scale in order to uncover dozens of proprietary new drug candidates. Those candidates will fuel a diversified therapeutic pipeline across a variety of targets and indications that Aqemia intends to advance into clinical trials alone through a constellation of Biotech spin-offs or with partners as the case may be.“We are thrilled to welcome Eurazeo and Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund onboard  as they are known for investing in the finest French scale-ups  and to receive again backing from Elaia  the first French Deeptech VC investor” said Maximilien.When asked about this investment  Antoine Zins  Investment Director at Eurazeo  stated:""I strongly believe that Aqemia has unparalleled power to shift the drug discovery paradigm. They have not only solved the missing data paradox in the discovery process with deep physics and AI  they can also generate leads at a faster pace than any discovery platform before them. We are very excited to be part of the adventure by their side”.Laurent Higueret  Senior Investment Director at Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund  added:""Early drug discovery is a long  costly and cumbersome process with often unsatisfactory outcomes for sponsors and ultimately patients. Aqemia’s ambition is to change all that by bringing together deep physics and AI into a powerful computational engine that has the potential to generate promising new development candidates at scale. Through this investment  we are thrilled to be part of this exciting journey and further expand Bpifrance portfolio in deeptech and AI.”***About AqemiaAqemia is a next-gen pharmatech company generating one of the world's fastest-growing drug discovery pipeline. Our mission is to design fast innovative drug candidates for dozens of critical diseases. What sets us apart is our unique quantum and statistical mechanics algorithms fueling a generative AI to design novel drug candidates.

Final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer site.

A complete summary of US GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations is published on www.asml.comCEO statement and outlook""Our third-quarter net sales came in at €5.8 billion with a gross margin of 51.8% — above our guidance. There is uncertainty in the market due to a number of global macro-economic concerns including inflation  consumer confidence and the risk of a recession. While we are starting to see diverging demand dynamics per market segment  the overall demand for our systems continues to be strong. This resulted in record bookings in the third quarter of around €8.9 billion of which €3.8 billion is EUV  including High-NA systems.Story continuesWe are continuing to assess and follow the new US export control regulations. Based on our initial assessment  the new restrictions do not amend the rules governing lithography equipment shipped by ASML out of the Netherlands and we expect the direct impact on ASML's overall 2023 shipment plan to be limited.""ASML expects fourth-quarter net sales between €6.1 billion and €6.6 billion with a gross margin around 49%. ASML expects R&D costs of around €880 million and SG&A costs of around €265 million.

We recorded a double-digit increase in sales revenue and  despite unfavorable trends on the cost and currency side  a very good profit margin. As expected  the development was also characterized by a swift normalization of demand following two years influenced by strong special effects due to the pandemic. We expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of Albumedix  adding an important component for the manufacture of innovative biopharmaceuticals  particularly regarding modalities such as cell therapies  viral therapies and vaccines. We are specifying our full-year outlook for 2022 within the range projected so far  but the global political and economic uncertainties remain high "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first nine months  Group sales revenue recorded a year-over-year increase of 17.0 percent in constant currencies (reported: +23.4 percent) to 2 603 million euros. This performance was driven by organic growth  while acquisitions 2 as expected  contributed around 2 percentage points to growth. All major product segments contributed to the sales revenue development  while coronavirus-related business declined significantly from the prior-year period. All three business regions – EMEA 3 the Americas  and Asia | Pacific – recorded significant growth  with the Americas region posting the strongest gain. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic as well as business limitations in Russia dampened growth to a limited extend.Story continuesFollowing an exceptionally strong prior-year figure due to the pandemic  order intake  as expected  declined in the first nine months and reached 2 601 million euros (in constant currencies: -12.8 percent  reported: -8.8 percent). The first nine months of 2021 had been influenced by high demand from vaccine manufacturers and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who had placed orders larger in size and further in advance than usual.Underlying EBITDA increased by 19.1 percent to 912 million euros in the first nine months. The corresponding margin reached 35.0 percent (prior-year period: 36.3 percent). This development was positively influenced by economies of scale from sales revenue growth  but diluted by currency effects and  as planned  higher costs resulting from the recruitment of new employees as well as other normalized cost positions. Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit reached 607 million euros  representing a significant increase of 19.2 percent from the first nine months of 2021. Underlying earnings per share were 6.58 euros (prior-year period: 5.52 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. Its equity ratio stood at a very robust level of 46.1 percent as of September 30  2022 (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent)  despite the acquisition of Albumedix  which was completed at the end of September 2022. The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 0.9 as of the reporting date  compared with 0.4 at the end of 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at -289 million euros  compared with -186 million euros in the first nine months of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 11.1 percent (prior-year period: 8.8 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of September 30  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a total of 12 120 employees worldwide  representing a rise in headcount of 1 711 from the end of 2021. Following a significant increase in the first six months of the year  the number of new hires slowed down considerably with the beginning of the second half of 2022  as planned.Outlook for fiscal 2022 specifiedBased on the results of the first nine months  management specifies its outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue growth is now expected to be in the lower half of the range of around 15 percent to 19 percent projected so far  with non-organic growth from acquisitions anticipated to contribute about 2 percentage points. Regarding profitability  Sartorius Stedim Biotech continues to expect its underlying EBITDA margin to reach more than 35 percent.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA is now anticipated to be about 0.8 at year end (previously about 0.2) following the closing of the Albumedix acquisition. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Moreover  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains  inflation and energy supply  and no new relevant restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Accordingly  current forecasts show higher uncertainties than usual.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

The project integrates the revived district with the local community  creating better connectivity with the surrounding neighbourhood while acting as a catalyst for the broader regeneration of Montparnasse.Commenting on the opening  Jean-Marie Tritant  Chief Executive Officer  said: “Les Ateliers Gaîté demonstrates our commitment to partnering with cities on major regeneration projects that meet the changing needs of an urban society. We worked closely with the City of Paris to create a vibrant and people-centric mixed-use destination that makes a practical contribution to the lives of residents  workers and visitors in the Montparnasse neighbourhood.”As part of the wider Les Ateliers Gaîté project  URW has already successfully delivered the refurbishment of the 52 000 sqm Pullman Montparnasse hotel  operated by Accor  in H2-2021  and a 13 000 sqm office project in H1-2022  fully let to Accor Group’s co-working operator Wojo.The final part of the project  a three-floor 28 800 sqm shopping and lifestyle destination  has now opened to the public. It is over 90% let and incorporates services that meet the needs of local residents and workers  as well as a wide range of restaurant and entertainment options – including the first Food Society food hall in Paris with 15 kiosks and 3 bars. The development also incorporates 62 social housing units which will be owned by the City of Paris and triples the area dedicated to public services  including a new municipal library and a childcare centre.In line with URW’s Better Places 2030 sustainability strategy  Les Ateliers Gaîté’s redevelopment delivers a 40% reduction in energy used for heating resulting in 880 tonnes of avoided CO2 emissions each year. This is achieved through highly efficient new buildings and innovations including an energy transfer loop that recovers more than 50% of the waste heat emitted by the retail centre  which can then be reused to heat the hotel.For more information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39audrey.arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf – Finelk+44 7387 108 998France:Nathalie Feld – Image7+33 6 30 47 18 37nfeld@image7.frUnited States:Molly Morse – Kekst CNC+1 212 521 4826molly.morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 80 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

At constant exchange rates the increase is +2%  reflecting the continued appreciation of the Brazilian Real over the period. The average EUR/BRL rate was 5.46 in 9M 2022  compared to 6.38 in 9M 2021.During the first nine months  Voltalia benefited from the strong acceleration of production by its subsidiary Helexia  which specialises in on-site energy production from rooftops and solar shading systems and in energy optimisation for buildings.As at 30 September 2022  production reached 2.5 TWh  compared with 2.9 TWh as at 30 September 2021. This decrease is explained  on the one hand  by the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants in Brazil (which had started producing in 9M 2021)  and on the other hand by fewer wind and solar resources than in 2021.The increase in revenues (+12%) in a context of falling production (-15%) reflects a sharp rise in the average selling price per MWh (+32%) and is explained by a combination of several factors9: (i) contractual indexation of sales prices to inflation up to 83% of revenues in 2021  (ii) replacement of projects with low prices per MWh by higher-priced projects  and (iii) strengthening of the Brazilian real.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Energy Sales reach €74.8 million  up +16% (+4% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021.Quarterly production was 1.2 TWh compared to 1.3 TWh in 2021 and operating capacity is 1 521 MW to date10 (+19% compared to the end of September 2021).By country:In Brazil  production decreased by -17% due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants (which had started production in the first half of 2021)  partly offset by the full effect of the plants that started contributing during 2021 (mainly VSM3) and the first effects of the plant commissioned in the first half of 2022 (SSM1-2);In France  production is up by +17% mainly due to the production of the solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao)  and the first effects of the Carrière des Plaines solar plant (which started operations in June 2022). Helexia is contributing to this progress  notably with the production of the agricultural photovoltaic roofs of Cap Sud  whose acquisition was finalised in July and consolidated from that date;In the other countries  production is growing overall (+19%). It increased by a factor of x3.7 in Greece due to the full effect of the production of the new Stavria solar power plant commissioned in March  and by +48% in Spain and +64% in Portugal  due to the strong increase in Helexia's production during the period. In Egypt and Jordan  production was up by +2% compared to last year.SERVICESRevenues for 9M 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach €240.3 million  up +58% (+56% at constant exchange rates) compared to 9M 2021. Revenues with third party clients are up +79% to €178.5 million and internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) are up +18% to €61.8 million. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment increases by +65% to €217.3 million and the Operation-Maintenance segment by +12% to €23.0 million.Revenues for Q3 2022 from Services (internal and external) reach €73.2 million  up +36% (+35% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q3 2021. Revenues from third party clients grow strongly by +62% while internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) decrease by -18%. The analysis by segment shows the following developments:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts revenues of €65.3 million  up +42% (at current and constant exchange rates). During the quarter  Development revenues benefited from the sale of solar power plant development projects in Brazil to third parties  while Equipment Procurement was particularly strong in France  Italy and the UK. Construction revenues decreased slightly during the quarter due to lower activity levels in France and the UK  partly offset by a strong performance in Portugal. Third party revenues increased by +66%  while internal revenues decreased by -18%;The Operations-Maintenance segment reports stable revenues of €8.0 million  slightly up by +3% compared to Q3 2021 (-2% at constant exchange rates). Third party customers account for 55% of the segment's revenues.Revenue eliminations for 9M and Q3 2022 amount to respectively €61.8 million (+18% at current exchange rates and +15% at constant exchange rates) and €12.9 million (- 22% at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting less internally focused construction activity in Q3 2022  with a growing share of external clients.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)In South Africa  Voltalia signed a 148 MW power sales contract with Rio Tinto11Voltalia entered into a 20-year Corporate PPA with Richards Bay Minerals (RBM)  a leading international mineral sands company and subsidiary of Rio Tinto.RBM will be powered by the Bolobedu solar project  the largest dedicated corporate renewable energy site in South Africa.

For the first nine months of 2022  Invibes Advertising posts a cumulative increase in turnover of +35%  off of a high nine-month 2021 basis which had shown 3-digit growth.Market conditions have been challenging  with a notably soft summer that has affected the entire sector. While September is usually a strong month  this year  September was impacted by the difficult economic context and rising inflation in several European countries. With growing concerns about consumer purchasing power  some advertisers decided to reduce their budget or direct it towards limited promotional campaigns. In particular  the French digital advertising market has been very slow in Q3 2022.Focus on ExcellenceAfter expanding its commercial presence in 8 additional countries over the last 18 months  Invibes Advertising’s management is focusing its efforts on core service to ensure that the Company delivers Excellence for its clients and achieves further growth.Several elements point to the quality of Invibes Advertising’s offering:The number of clients of the Company has increased by 43% in the first nine months of 2022 vs the same period in 2021. Some large campaigns run last year by public bodies in the context of Covid are being replaced by several individual campaigns for other advertisers.The number of clients taking advantage of the Company’s capability to run cross-market campaigns has doubled between the first nine months of 2022 and the first nine months of 2021.Scale-up and start-up countries are increasingly contributing to the Group’s performance  confirming their strong potential  even though the important UK advertising market was severely affected by the death of Queen Elisabeth II at the beginning of September  with a recovery towards the end of the month.If anything  the current challenges of the economic context act as additional incentive to further strengthen a fundamentally good business that will be able to grow as soon as market conditions improve. Already in 2020  the advertising market was severely affected by the Covid pandemic  and yet  Invibes Advertising was able to achieve 19% growth that year  followed by a doubling in revenues in 2021. Now again  the whole Company is fully mobilised towards delivering Excellence for its clients to gain market share and lay the ground for accelerated growth once the economic environment improves.Heightened focus on cost controlFollowing a strong commercial push and an ambitious recruitment programme in the first half of 2022  Invibes Advertising now has teams in place across 18 offices in 15 countries  in line with the international expansion objectives announced in the Company’s development roadmap. This international footprint now provides Invibes Advertising with sufficient scale to execute its development plan  without needing to expand further in the medium-term.Management’s focus is firmly set on improving the Company’s profitability by optimising the cost structure and increasing productivity.Sound financial structure to finance strategic investments and fuel future developmentInvibes Advertising raised €17m in a private placement in January 2022 to have the financial resources to fund its development. After substantial investments to achieve its planned international expansion  the Company’s priority is to improve its offer. Thanks to a strong balance sheet  Invibes Advertising is able to continue to invest in technology and operations in order to innovate  to further enrich its products range  and to ensure a high level of service to its clients.That sustained level of investment is essential to enable Invibes Advertising to convert the current economic challenges into an opportunity to strengthen its position in the market. This will give the Company the capacity to fully benefit from the future market recovery. In the meantime  in light of the currently challenging market conditions  management is reviewing its announced 2024 target turnover.Next publication: 2022 full-year revenues on 25 January 2023  after market close.About Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising is an international technology company specializing in digital advertising innovation.

Final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer site. This leads to a deferral of revenue recognition for those shipments until formal customer acceptance  but does provide our customers with earlier access to wafer output capacity.(Figures in millions of euros unless otherwise indicated) Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Net sales 5 431 5 778 ...of which Installed Base Management sales 1 1 290 1 524 New lithography systems sold (units) 83 80 Used lithography systems sold (units) 8 6 Net bookings 28 461 8 920 Gross profit 2 665 2 994 Gross margin (%) 49.1 51.8 Net income 1 411 1 701 EPS (basic; in euros) 3.54 4.29 End-quarter cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments 4 402 3 363(1) Installed Base Management sales equals our net service and field option sales.(2) Net bookings include all system sales orders for which written authorizations have been acceptedNumbers have been rounded for readers' convenience. A complete summary of US GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations is published on www.asml.comCEO statement and outlook""Our third-quarter net sales came in at €5.8 billion with a gross margin of 51.8% — above our guidance. There is uncertainty in the market due to a number of global macro-economic concerns including inflation  consumer confidence and the risk of a recession. While we are starting to see diverging demand dynamics per market segment  the overall demand for our systems continues to be strong. This resulted in record bookings in the third quarter of around €8.9 billion of which €3.8 billion is EUV  including High-NA systems.We are continuing to assess and follow the new US export control regulations. Based on our initial assessment  the new restrictions do not amend the rules governing lithography equipment shipped by ASML out of the Netherlands and we expect the direct impact on ASML's overall 2023 shipment plan to be limited.""ASML expects fourth-quarter net sales between €6.1 billion and €6.6 billion with a gross margin around 49%. ASML expects R&D costs of around €880 million and SG&A costs of around €265 million.

We recorded a double-digit increase in sales revenue and  despite unfavorable trends on the cost and currency side  a very good profit margin. As expected  the development was also characterized by a swift normalization of demand following two years influenced by strong special effects due to the pandemic. We expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of Albumedix  adding an important component for the manufacture of innovative biopharmaceuticals  particularly regarding modalities such as cell therapies  viral therapies and vaccines. We are specifying our full-year outlook for 2022 within the range projected so far  but the global political and economic uncertainties remain high "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first nine months  Group sales revenue recorded a year-over-year increase of 17.0 percent in constant currencies (reported: +23.4 percent) to 2 603 million euros. This performance was driven by organic growth  while acquisitions 2 as expected  contributed around 2 percentage points to growth. All major product segments contributed to the sales revenue development  while coronavirus-related business declined significantly from the prior-year period. All three business regions – EMEA 3 the Americas  and Asia | Pacific – recorded significant growth  with the Americas region posting the strongest gain. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic as well as business limitations in Russia dampened growth to a limited extend.Following an exceptionally strong prior-year figure due to the pandemic  order intake  as expected  declined in the first nine months and reached 2 601 million euros (in constant currencies: -12.8 percent  reported: -8.8 percent). The first nine months of 2021 had been influenced by high demand from vaccine manufacturers and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who had placed orders larger in size and further in advance than usual.Underlying EBITDA increased by 19.1 percent to 912 million euros in the first nine months. The corresponding margin reached 35.0 percent (prior-year period: 36.3 percent). This development was positively influenced by economies of scale from sales revenue growth  but diluted by currency effects and  as planned  higher costs resulting from the recruitment of new employees as well as other normalized cost positions. Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit reached 607 million euros  representing a significant increase of 19.2 percent from the first nine months of 2021. Underlying earnings per share were 6.58 euros (prior-year period: 5.52 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. Its equity ratio stood at a very robust level of 46.1 percent as of September 30  2022 (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent)  despite the acquisition of Albumedix  which was completed at the end of September 2022. The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 0.9 as of the reporting date  compared with 0.4 at the end of 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at -289 million euros  compared with -186 million euros in the first nine months of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 11.1 percent (prior-year period: 8.8 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of September 30  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a total of 12 120 employees worldwide  representing a rise in headcount of 1 711 from the end of 2021. Following a significant increase in the first six months of the year  the number of new hires slowed down considerably with the beginning of the second half of 2022  as planned.Outlook for fiscal 2022 specifiedBased on the results of the first nine months  management specifies its outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue growth is now expected to be in the lower half of the range of around 15 percent to 19 percent projected so far  with non-organic growth from acquisitions anticipated to contribute about 2 percentage points. Regarding profitability  Sartorius Stedim Biotech continues to expect its underlying EBITDA margin to reach more than 35 percent.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA is now anticipated to be about 0.8 at year end (previously about 0.2) following the closing of the Albumedix acquisition. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Moreover  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains  inflation and energy supply  and no new relevant restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Accordingly  current forecasts show higher uncertainties than usual.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation.Let me now turn the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our third quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation and afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions.The link to the presentation material for this call has been sent out by email and it can also be downloaded from the Investor Relation section of our website. As usual  the conference call is recorded and will be available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome  ladies and gentlemen. The times we are currently living in continue to be quite unprecedented. After the strong first quarter  we were expecting at Deutsche Börse a normalization of activity throughout the year  but what we saw instead was an even acceleration of growth throughout the year 2022. In the end  the third quarter turned out to be our strongest quarter ever from a net revenue perspective.The main driver for the 12% cyclical net revenue growth we have seen in the first nine months is the beginning cycle of rising interest rates. In the United States  we have meanwhile reached a fair target range of 3% to 3.25% and in September  the ECB raised rates in Europe to a level that will last saw back in 2011.This has resulted in greater trading and hedging needs for our clients in almost all asset classes  as well as growth of the net interest income of our security service business  which had been depressed for so many years. This is the new area as we called it  and as I was referring to at our last Investor Day in June  which adds additional cyclical opportunities to our consistent delivery of secular growth.Combining the two  we are now expecting organic growth rates of 7% to 9% on average per annum from this year onwards through the current cycle. Organic growth will continue to be complemented by M&A with the same approach as previously. In the third quarter  the situation on the European gas markets has continued to fuel the activities in commodities  but we are now also starting to see some negative effects of the market uncertainty in our European power product complex  which saw declining activity.Very encouraging to see is the continued strong secular net revenue growth  which amounted to 8% in the first nine months. This is really the result of the many initiatives to win new clients and market share as well as introducing new products and services over the last couple of years. This also continues to be our top priority because the current strong cyclical tailwinds are not going to last forever.The development in 2022 also underscores the quality of our business portfolio. The strong results are not just driven by single businesses  but by double-digit net revenue growth in almost all business lines. On the operating expense side  we have faced with an unusual combination of drivers that have resulted in higher cost growth compared to our initial guidance.Foreign exchange effects have gotten stronger throughout the year and are expected to effect as well into next year  but this item is overcompensated by the positive FX impact on our net revenue. While we don't see headline inflation numbers in our overall operating cost yet  the 4% we are currently looking at are certainly an elevated level compared to past periods.And finally  the favorable financial development and relative share price performance has resulted in an increase of the provisions for variable and share-based compensation.In total net revenue in the first nine months increased by 23% and amounted to more than €3.2 billion. The EBITDA increased by 24% to around €1.9 billion euro. Since the overall development in the first nine months so far exceeded our initial expectations for 2022  we are further increasing our guidance for the full year 2022.Our expectation now is to exceed €4.1 billion euro of net revenue and €2.3 billion of EBITDA. This might sound conservative to some of you  but you guys know us. We are all cautious management people and rather want to under-promise and over deliver than the opposite.With that  let me now hand over to you  Gregor to present the financial results in greater detail.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we show the details also besides for the first nine months. All segments have contributed double-digit cost rates to the overall net revenue development. Three out of four segments even achieved organic net revenue growth rate of more than 20%.As part of the net revenue  the net interest income across the globe has roughly tripled compared to the previous year. On the one hand  this was driven by much higher colateral levels in financial derivatives and especially commodities. On the other hand  the net interest income of security services has started to meaningful benefit from higher US and now also European interest rates.The result from financial investments saw a small negative contribution from our FinTech fund investments in the third quarter and amounted to €29 million for the first nine months. For the full year  we are now expecting any positive contribution  but might see a further small decline.In terms of operating costs in the first nine months is on Page 3  we saw several different drivers. First M&A effect  which declined compared to half year one and amounted to 5%. They were still mainly driven by the IFS acquisition. Second  the FX effect from the stronger US dollar increased and resided in a 3% operating expense increase  but this was obviously also beneficial to the net revenue development particular in the data and analytics segment.This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating cost scores of 8%. On the one hand  it was driven by inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to continue to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in the light of the favorable financial development and relative share price performance.This brings me to the details of the third quarter reside on Page 4 of the presentation. While the secular close remained at high levels and slightly above our expectation  cyclical tailwinds have accelerated in the third quarter compared to the first half of this year. The cyclical growth was driven in particular by market volatility and hedging needs of our clients and financial derivatives  commodities and of products.In addition  and as expected  the net interest income has become a more material growth driver for security services. The M&A effect again had minor impact in the third quarter since they were only driven by some of the smaller more recent acquisitions.The explanations are just provided on operating cost development in the first nine months can generally also be applied to the third quarter. While the M&A impact on the operating costs has become smaller compared to previous quarters  the impact from variable and share-based compensation has increased. Furthermore  we saw an increase of project cost and some additional IT investments in cloud technology.So aside from financial investments in the previous year included a positive valuation effect of €32 million from the minority investment in Clarity AI as a result of the financing round with SoftBank. In the third quarter  depreciation and amortization included some one-off effects from software impairments and the financial results included higher interest from our funds outstanding in particular from the hybrid bond that was issued in March  as well as some FX effect.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments starting with data and analytics on Page 5. We saw good organic net revenue growth levels across all business lines in the segment. This was driven by the continuing trend towards ESG  new clients and higher market activity for the index licensing business. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  included some inorganic growth from the acquisition of Discovery Data.Most of our direct US dollar exposure in is in the data and analytics segment from the ISS and Axioma subsidiaries  but constant currency net revenue cost in the third quarter was still very strong with 19%. The EBITDA in the previous year's quarter included the gain of around €32 million from the evaluation of the stake in Clarity AI that I mentioned before. Adjusted for this effect  the EBITDA has increased by 33%.Let me turn to Slide 6 in the trading and clearing segment. The trading and clearing segment continue to benefit from higher volatility and increased client hedging needs. The financial derivatives business of Eurex was as strong as in the first quarter. This was driven by high cost in all product lines and in particular by the increased margin fees. They amounted to €34 million in the third quarter.In commodities  we achieved another quarter because of the increased trading and hedging needs of our clients in gas products and due to the higher margin fees  but at the same time  the situation in European energy markets increasingly became a headwind for net revenue which was power product in Europe. They declined by 11%.In the cash equity business  we saw headwinds from elevated levels of retail participation last year  which has normalized this year. In addition  one of our peers has increased liquidity payments this year  which resided in some market share decline for all incumbents in Europe.As a result of higher volatility  the demand for foreign exchange products was significantly higher compared to previous quarters and we achieved our  by far best quarter ever  there's a net revenue increase of 33%.In the fund services segment  on Page 7  the continued onboarding of new clients more than offset the cyclical headwinds from the market performance  especially in equity product. In addition  we saw the inorganic contribution of the Kneip acquisition  which was closed at the end of March.In the operating expense base of the segment  we saw a few one-off effects in the quarter. They're related to the integration of Kneip and the preparations for the carve-out of the fund service business from Clearstream. It's also encouraging to see that the momentum of new partnerships has continued. HSBC has chosen Deutsche Börse as its global partner for fund auto loading  safekeeping  settlement and distribution for very meaningful fund portfolio.Our security services segment on Slide 8  saw a significant acceleration of close in the third quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation were overcompensated by solid levels of fixed income issuance activity. Some is FX effects on assets under custody denominated in US dollar and the collateral management business with the close of more than 30%.In addition  the net interest income has increased more than six fold compared to last year. This was driven much by -- this was driven by much higher US interest rates and for the first time in more than a decade  increasing European interest rates. Furthermore  the cash balances has increased by roughly 30% compared to the previous year.The last page of today's presentation shows our guidance for 2022. We have already increased our guidance twice this year. However  these increases were either qualitative than quantitative. Since the third quarter developed significantly above our even more recent expectations  we have now increased our net revenue guidance to more than €4.1 billion and the EBITDA guidance to more than €2.3 billion.Depending on the cyclical development in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter  those numbers look conservative  but we want to be on the safe site.Since most of the operating expense drivers we have seen in the first nine months are also expected to impact our cost base in the fourth quarter  we are currently expecting operating cost of slightly more than €1.8 billion for the full year. This expectation is a result of the combination of the different operating cost drivers I've outlined before.We consider some of them to be more temporary in nature and would expect some easing of the cost pressure going into next year. This will also help us to address all sorts of potential net revenue scenarios next year against the tougher 2022 comparables.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your question.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator instructions] And the first question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BNP Paribas Exane. Over to you.Arnaud GiblatYeah  good afternoon. My question is on interest income. Clearly we all understand how it works in our history  but it's a bit more obscure at how NI works at Eurex and EEX. I was wondering if you could spend a bit of time explaining the growth there. Is it entirely coming from increased cash balances and margining and how sustainable is that increase in margining? I suspect it's linked to the volatility  but can use hold a higher level of margin for some time?And could you talk about the net interest margin? Is that linked to short term rates? How does NIM work for those businesses? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  thanks Arnaud for this question. Obviously  the net interest income is an important line item now in our P&L and gets even more important in this future. So it's different in our Clearstream business compared to our clearing business. So starting with Clearstream  here you have heard that the customer cash balance is even increased to roughly €18 billion. And this interest income we achieved here with increased interest rates or fed fund rate of 3% to 3.25% and will most probably further increase or over the next weeks and months.So here you can basically multiply it. So saying additional 1% on €18 billion  it's another €180 million at Clearstream. So  that's the concept here.With regard to the two clearing houses  so US Clearing and ECC  here the model is different from a P&L perspective. So here  we get roughly a fee-based income on the margins  right?So the margin at Eurex increased to a level of €130 billion to €140 billion now is much higher compared to previous year due to increased volatility and due to the successfully increasing of our OTC interest rate swap business. So here  we have an increased basis. And the same is basically true for the clearinghouse ECC. So for our commodities business at EEX. So here  we have seen in the past one or two years ago  it was €5 billion roughly a margin requirement here and collateral we had available and more than 90% is euro cash basically.And that increased now to a level of €50 billion  €60 billion. So it's 10x higher. And obviously  here  we get also some fee income. So this is the concept. And the question  how sustainable is that now? So on the one hand side  I would say  at Clearstream. So we expect at the market that continue to increase wages for the Fed and even for the ECB  at least for the next months. So that will further strengthen our NII at Clearstream.On the other hand side  if rates continue to increase  there's a higher probability that our customer cash balances will decrease and we will see. So far  it did not decrease so far until end of September. But from a logical perspective  it should continue to decrease as there is a high incentive for the treasuries and the banks due to efficient cash allocation.And with regard to the margins at ECG and ECC  they won't drop on a short-term basis. So that's much more stable for -- at least for the next months  right? I wouldn't say for the next years  but it's much more stable than potentially the customer cash balances could be a little bit more volatile.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerJust a question following up on the cost in terms of the €1.8 billion kind of targeted for this year. If we think about that  how much of that is kind of costs that are being brought forward from next year? And if you can just clarify just in terms of the last statements you made in your prepared remarks about how we should think about the cost base as we look out to 2023? I suspect the €1.8 billion should allow you to still generate operating leverage next year. Is that how -- is that correct?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Mike. I think the cost topic is an important topic  that's good that we can a little bit elaborate on that. So I think this year is a very specific year this effect  we hadn't even not planned for  right? So we had plan for this M&A  right  as we were aware for that and that cost increase shouldn't be a surprise.So the FX impact to 3% or 3-plus percent I think that's a little bit of a surprise. But the good thing on a P&L perspective  that FX impact will be compensated by higher impact on the net revenue. So at FX stronger U.S. dollar is positive for Deutsche Börse that shouldn't be a concern at all for all of us.So we are more focused on what we say the operating organic cost growth on a constant portfolio basis  so a constant FX basis. And so that's roughly the 8% we have to talk about. And here  we have two elements. So the one is the inflation. That's roughly 4%. I think that's even good because the journal inflation is 8%. You are aware of that. So that's even below that level. But it's more than we originally expected when we made up our plan.And this component  I would assume  will continue to be there also in next year. The other  let's say  4% increase  share payments and specifically bonus  right? That is due to our very successful performance in this year. And so we pay higher bonus than originally planned. This is obviously not sustainable. So having a much more tougher year next in 2023  so most probably bonus could even go down compared to the plus 4%.So taking these 4 components  so M&A  FX  inflation and compensation. So just the inflation part will continue to happen next year or the other three could disappear  M&A  we will finally see it really will disappear. But the variable compensation could be even lower. So it would be a decrease in next year. So to cut a long story short  so this 16% cost  what we have seen here. And our guidance  we expect a similar growth in Q4. That's why we say it's slightly above €1.8 billion.So for 2023  we do not expect at all double-digit cost. So it will be clearly single digit from today's perspective  where we just have to deal with the inflationary aspect and obviously  we are currently in the process of doing the budgeting and therefore  we have some scenario planning  and we are also able to deliver on a contingent cost base.So I would -- from my perspective  overall  that's exceptional development in 2022 from a cost perspective  2023 will come back to a level you are used to see in the past.Theodor WeimerIf I may add  Mike  Theodor here  right? Gregor is stating now from a technical point of view  what happened this year and what can you expect next year? And I can fully underscore what Gregor said. From a strategic point of view  I always said  and I'll stick to this statement here today again  right. Always said  cost growth rate should not be higher than the secular growth of the company. And as Gregor pointed out in his presentation  we are growing 8% secularly this year  and our cost rate -- organic cost rate increases exactly 8%  right?And next year  that was question what you can expect is if the organic growth rate is in the range of 5%  6% or whatever or 7%  right? Then you take it as a commitment of the CFO and CEO that we say  we stick to this commitment  right? Cost shall not overrun taking the FX side and the M&A side shall not over on organic growth rates on the revenue side  secular growth rates on the revenue side.OperatorThe next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citigroup.Andrew CoombsJust firstly  just to come back to the costs. You talked about some temporary costs that are dropping away next year. Can you just elaborate and quantify what those temporary costs are? Second question  when I look at your Eurex revenue per contract  that seems to have surprised positively. So perhaps you could talk about some of the pricing dynamics there  whether that was a change in pricing or whether that was just mix effect between the different asset classes and contracts?Gregor PottmeyerYes  interesting. Thanks for the question. Yes  with regard to the temporary development of the cost  so I already elaborated when I answered Mike's question a little bit on that  but to be more precise here. So they are basically  I'd say easily 4x -- 4% cost increase. And so the variable compensation is definitely of temporary nature or it's related to this more than 20% top line and bottom line growth. And no one expects the same development next year having debt at higher starting point.So most probably  the variable compensation will go down compared to this year's development. So out of this plus 4% or plus 5%  you will see minus something most probably  right? So that's why we say that's definitely temporary of nature.Then the FX is temporary of nature because now serve as a starting point from a U.S. dollar perspective  as an average  slightly above parity. So yes  it could even go down a little bit further  but the big jump you have seen now. And therefore  the FX impact  if it does not completely disappear is much smaller compared to this year.M&A  that depends whether we are doing additional M&A yes or no. And so as a conclusion  only the inflationary impact will continue to happen next year.With regard to your second question  Eurex revenue per contract. So that's obviously just depending on the product mix  right? So if they are traded more products where we have a higher revenue level  then that contributes  obviously  positive if you do an average calculation on Eurex. So a substantial change of the revenue per contract on product level does not happen.Andrew CoombsOkay. Just to put point because I think what you're referring to is temporary growth factors around the temporary absolute cost contribution because unless FX rates change or unless you were to divest one of the businesses you've acquired  that's obviously here to stay going into next year. But perhaps I can push you on that variable compensation component exactly how is that calibrated and calculated as a percentage of your revenue and EBITDA growth? And how much of your overall personnel expenses  does that account for?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So overall  so bonus are in the level of 10% of our operating expenses  and so the level is definitely above the level we have planned for  right? And if we exceed our plans  what we definitely do is more than 20%  then obviously  the bonus level is much higher.And now it depends on the variability of the salary  obviously  the highest variability you see on the executive and on the management board level and the lowest you see on the staff level. So -- and in average  there's obviously a fluctuation of  let's say  20% to 30% out of this number  whether we are able -- whether we are very successful or whether we are in line with our plan or even if we are below our plan.OperatorNext question is Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyQuestion on EEX and the European commodity clearing in particular. Maybe you can speak a bit more about the stress you see in the system? Are we past the peak after the government supports various government measures? So maybe a bit in the short term. And then what does it mean for medium to long term? Do you think this issue of counterparty risk is a real accelerator for your market share or more steady continuously structured story of taking market share from OTC players?Gregor PottmeyerOkay. What we currently see is that we passed the peak  right? So we have seen in the peak times and the margin  the collateral  I think  is the best indicator for that. It was in the range of €100 billion. And today  it's more in the range of €50 billion to €60 billion.And you see that -- and the reason for that is that you have seen over the last weeks that gas and power prices decreased  significantly decreased  right? So people think now that we are able to manage the next winter at least  right? So that's why the prices are going down. And that's obviously good. So that's the stress out of this system is decreasing here  and hopefully  that will continue to happen.I think for us  it's -- and we are proud that we are really able to manage even in that stress the duration  our exchange and our clearing house here at Eurex and we were to work together with all the market participants and the market participants were able to deliver the necessary collateral and even with the German government and even on the European level  we are in close discussion and they are strongly supportive to help that markets are open and that we have a clear market-led solution here.And even if you see some discussion around pricing cap and so on  so the basic logic still is that if government or EU commission would like to see a cap that this will be compensated by the government  so the delta between the market price and the cap price. And so that helps us to continue to help here the market solutions here.With regard to the medium to long-term aspect  so currently  we see due to that stress in the system that our market share even increased. So in the European power derivatives market  it's currently 58%. So a year ago  it was 40% or 40 plus or something like that. So it's now 58%.But what we also see is that the trading volume is going down. I told you that the power derivatives revenue in Q3 decreased adjusted trading fees by 11%. And it's going down. And the reason for that is  yes  if you have to put in a lot of collateral and margins  obviously  your flexibility to trade a lot is certainly limited at that point of time.What we expect for the mid- to long-term view that this will reasonably calibrate. So we expect that our margins and collateral requirements will go down and that the trading activity will continue to increase. And the secular growth drivers from our perspective are all intact.So with regard to renewables and carbon certificates  hydrogen markets and so on. So that's all positive for us. So for the mid- to long term  we expect this will come back to a normal situation. Then trading activity will increase  margin will go down  the fee income on the margin will go down. And overall  we think we are well prepared without this extraordinary impact today to grow double-digit also for the next year.OperatorThe next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtSo obviously  there's very strong revenue growth of 30% in the quarter. Just wondering  could you more specifically provide the FX in the third quarter? And how much FX added to the revenue growth? And you also disclosed 8% secular revenue growth for the third quarter  specifically in your financial statement. Can you clarify whether any of that secular growth includes an FX benefit or is that purely constant currency as well? .Gregor PottmeyerYes. So the second part is quite clear. So the secular growth is without FX impact. So the FX impact we include in the cyclical cost. Your first question  what is the FX impact on our revenues? So on our cost side  it's roughly 3%. And on our revenue  it's in the range of 1% to 2%  so 1.5%  something like that.Kyle VoigtOkay. And that was for the third quarter specifically  Gregor?Gregor PottmeyerYes. It's specifically also true for the third quarter.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonI guess just thinking about M&A activity  clearly  looking into 2023  it looks like after a banner year this year  it's going to be a little bit more challenging potentially from a cyclical standpoint. So does that mean -- does that likely accelerate some of your M&A plans? I mean  obviously  there's some notable sort of valuation decreases in the fund platform space  for example.So perhaps if you could outline where you think looks kind of most interesting on this sort of nonorganic side? And then just remind us where you are in terms of your sort of current balance sheet leverage and therefore  capacity to do deals from sort of balance sheet as of today or year-end?Theodor Weimerhank you  Bruce. Let me take the first one and the capacity shall be taken then by Gregor as always. Let me share with you a couple of observations which are certainly new to the majority of you -- on the M&A side  it's very clear. The M&A market has changed fundamentally over the last 12 months  not only on the tech side  but particularly in the tech and data side where we are particularly interested in  right. Point number one. Everybody understands that the interest rates have increased the capital cost  right  and therefore  per se  every day  you have to be even more selective.Point number three  from my point of view  some 12 months ago  even less  right  the market -- M&A market has been a pure sellers market  right? So the sellers basically said  I'm willing to sell if and then they demand it and egress the high numbers. This has also fundamentally changed. We're now seeing clearly a buyer's market. And the fact that we are potentially a very fought after strategic buyer  we received lots of inbound calls. But -- and that's point number four  from my point of view  you need differentiate between private and public market developments.On the public market side valuations  as you said  Bruce  have come down significantly already. On the private side  I don't know what happens. But as you can imagine  some of the holders of the private side  private asset side  there's still dream of the good old days  some 8 to 18 months ago. So they have not -- some of them might not have realized that valuations have changed that the market has fundamentally changed.And therefore  what we currently see is lots of opportunities  right? But I need to state also very clearly  we can become and we are even more selective given the situation that we are -- and you listen to what we have said today. We can look back and also look forward to the next quarter. We have pretty strong results  financial results. Nobody right is forcing us to be very aggressive on the way.And last but not least  with regards to certain areas you were mentioning hinting in a certain direction. Of course  we do not comment on any specific M&A targets  but you can be assured we will -- we are very reasonable. We are not under pressure. We are highly selective and determined to do if you do deals. We do good deals. And if you simply look in what happened on the data side  especially on the ISS side  that's a big  big positive right of what we can report here for the year 2022.Gregor PottmeyerAnd your second question with regard to the balance sheet  obviously  you are aware that  that S&P just confirmed our AA rating because we are able to come back to the grid threshold at year-end without doing further M&A. So that was positively confirmed also from S&P.Here  you can see that we are back in a situation to have financial flexibility because we are very cash generative every year  more than €1.5 billion cash we generate every year. So funding is not a limitation or refinancing is not a limitation for our M&A activity. So we have enough headroom here available from a cash perspective  from a debt -- additional debt perspective or on even some equity perspective  where we have treasury shares and authorization.And also from a structuring and M&A deal  there's not always a need that we need additional cash. So we can also bring in some assets doing some joint venture or partnerships as we have done for instance  this continue in our stock business. So overall  from a funding refinancing perspective  there are no limitation for M&A deals.OperatorThe next question comes from Philip Middleton from Bank of America.Philip MiddletonThank you very much for the presentation today. Just to round out the cost discussion. Entirely understand how you're segregating the cost between some things which are obviously going to drop away like the variable comp and some things which should happen that are outside your control of the inflation.But are you saying that there's a cap at the rate of inflation  which is your organic growth? Or -- because you used to talk about operating leverage sort of being built into the model. And if you -- is that still the case? Or how should we actually think about operating leverage in the current environment?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Philip for specifically asking that  that operating leverage topic. So overall  we show on our existing portfolio  strong operating leverage  right? If you take  for instance  our Eurex business and -- or even our Trading & Clearing business  and doing -- and comparing the EBITDA margin last year compared with this year  then you see a nice increase.So for the existing business  we are able to show operating leverage. And the old formula for whether we trade 15 million or 10 million contracts a day  there are no additional costs with regard to that. So we are able to show that even in some times with a little bit more in inflation. So that's a clear commitment of us as a management team.When you do this operating leverage on a group level  so there are additional aspects why we are not able to show an increased EBITDA margin. So first is that we're currently doing M&A in an area where we achieve -- so for instance  with regard to ISS in the range of EBITDA margin of 30% to 35%. So it's clearly above the 58% what you see as an average. So this dilutes basically our M&A margin.And secondly  last year  we had a strong equity result of some €85 million. And this year  roughly €30 million. So we also do some on a group level perspective. But from an operational perspective  we are strongly committed to continue to show operating leverage in our existing business.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschYes. One on the secular growth  the 8% you pointed out in Q3. Could you elaborate bits on it again  maybe also allocating a share to Eurex especially  overall you guided for a kind of 5%  you demonstrated that over the past three years  year-to-date  you achieved 6%. So how should we think about the 8%? And how much is really coming from Eurex and not the other growth segments that we were talking about?Theodor WeimerSo Eurex is also in the range of 8%  like the average on group level. So how do we calibrate the secular growth? So in principle  we consider secular growth if we are able to increase our market shares  if we win new market segments  if we build up new products. And here  we've done from with regard to new products  we don't say just a new product out of this year because of product side  let's say  five to seven years.So we go back 5 to 7 years and say  what are the new products here. And we consider still for instance  at Eurex  but just have to give you some examples that we say our derivatives on MSCI level as just said  such a product or total return futures  we define as a new product or still dividend and volatility derivatives. So just to give you a few examples.So all the revenue increase we are able to achieve in this new product category. So this we show as a secular growth. And that's basically true for all the other segments. So we have here a clear distinction what we say  that's basically more a sustainable level  this is 8% and when you say the 12% on a cyclical basis. So that is just specifically linked to the specific situation this year with its higher volatility  and that depends basically what we will see in the next year. But the secular growth is defined as a sustainable growth rate also for the future.Tobias LukeschAnd given the fact that you were also emphasizing new clients and also market share gains in the various segments. Is it fair to assume that this kind of 8% secular growth is something you're not worried about over the next quarters? Or it could even be accelerated? I mean  what is your kind of view on that development?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So you are aware that on our Investor Day and end of June. So we guided at least a 5% secular growth rate  right? So -- and that's what we're definitely targeting for and what we are committed to deliver also for the next year. But this 8% is above our average here. And my guess would be even in Q4  we would have good chances to deliver this 8%  but for the next three to five years  things like that. So our commitment is to achieve at least 5% cyclical.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.Johannes ThormannSome follow-up questions  please. First of all  on the NII dynamic. What do you think are -- as you have given a broad range between €5 billion to €50 billion margin calls? What is a normalized collateral or margin level in energy business? And at what point in time in Clearstream  do you think you have to share upcoming rate hikes with the customers? And regarding the M&A pipeline or your thoughts on the change in the market  just would be great to know if the dynamic has hinted talks and postpone talks? Or have they actually intensified discussions?Gregor PottmeyerSo I'll start with the first question and Theodor handle the M&A question. So with regard to NII  what is the right level at our clearing -- commodity clearinghouse ECC. So it's difficult to judge  I think. So yes  I told you two years ago  it was €5 billion and now it's €50 billion €60 billion. I don't think that it will come back to the €5 billion right it.But it's difficult to get whether for the next three to five years  right? What is the right number here. I think it will be a double-digit €1 billion a month because we continue to grow but it's really difficult to judge.But on a short-term basis  it won't go down sharply due to the €5 billion. So that's what we -- not expect and the situation in gas and power is obviously not solved  even it's currently a little bit relaxed  but it's by far more soft  and you will see high volatility also in 2023. So I don't think that the margins will go significantly down.Your second question with regard to sharing NII results at Clearstream that we will see that. So the higher the amount we will achieve  the more we have also to consider to talk to our clients. So far  up to now  we do not share  but at certain point in time  I think there will be the need also to share.Theodor WeimerAnd Johannes on the M&A side  whether it's an answer whether the overall environment descending discussions. I can be very  very smart and referred to the M&A market globally as such  it is basically M&A shrink significantly. But I would say without saying anything beyond what I'm saying  right  on our side  it's rather such that the level of inbound calls  the level of ideas  which we are getting is rather enhanced.OperatorAnd next up is Ian White from Autonomous Research.Ian WhiteJust a couple of follow-ups from my side  please. First up  I think earlier you said there is a sort of a one-off software impairment that's impacting depreciation and amortization this quarter. Could you just call that out for us  please  in terms of how much that was? Sorry if I've missed it in the presentation or the release  but that would be helpful.And just secondly  on M&A  I think you said on the call earlier this year  you were perhaps less focused on fund services M&A due to sort of strong organic progression there. Am I right to take from your earlier remarks on this call that you might be more open to inorganic growth in Fund Services now? And how does the carve-out of the Fund Services business from Clearstream help to enable M&A if at all  please?Theodor WeimerSo the first question is very easy. So this one-off software is roughly €5 million. And the second question with regard to M&A. I think you are aware of this carve out in our investment Fund Service business. So that's continuing to be right on track  right? So we are able to deliver what we want to achieve. So 2023 is the year where we are able to achieve our targets. And therefore  we would be also prepared to do partnerships in that way when we want to.And so it's -- from an M&A perspective  it's difficult to judge what customers would like to do because customers have always three opportunities to work together with Deutsche Börse Investment Fund Services. So they can easily connect to our platform  they can outsource. So these two elements we show as an organic growth.And thirdly  they can sell the business  right? So with regard to HSBC  that was basically an outsourcing contract  right? So very successful have won that with regard to Kneip  there was a decision that we don't want to buy the business or and the Kneip asset owner wanted to sale. So that's why we say  in principle  fund services is of high interest of Deutsche Börse  whether it's organic  inorganic partner approach. So therefore  we are open and flexible. And with regard to preparing all until year-end and fulfilling that in 2023  this carve-out for this fund service business  we are even more flexible to do partnerships.OperatorAnd we're coming to the next question  and it comes from Haley Tam from Credit Suisse.Haley TamQuick follow-up on costs  if I may. And then a question about the cash equities market. In terms of costs  can I just pick up? I think you said earlier that you had a 4% impact of inflation in the 9 months so far  and you noted that was lower than the current rate of inflation. So we should interpret this to mean that you are expecting there to be further inflationary impact in your organic cost growth next year and that will be within the perimeter when you're thinking about the comparison to secular revenue growth. So I just wanted to check on that.And any comments you might have there in terms of wage inflation  in particular  I guess would be particularly interesting to me. In terms of the cash equities market  you did note there that you had seen some loss of market share has had all other market participants due to a competitor stepping up the liquidity payments. And I just wondered whether you consider a one-off shift in market share or whether you are actually considering any plans to match those payments to win back share?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So with regard to your first question of cost and this year  4% in inflation  so -- and my comment that inflation will not disappear is not to understand in the way that it will increase next year  right? But it won't go down. So we all do not know what are the final outcome and specific with regard to the wage increase. And that we are in the process and just started that process to talk about with our workers council and soon  so no decisions are made.But in principle  this 4% inflation most probably will not increase next year  but you will see a comparable number also in 2023 and whether these are triggered by one-off payments to people or either to regular increase. So that we will see how the final decisions will end  but I don't expect that the inflation will increase at least not the 4% overall on personnel costs  nonpersonnel costs and in average for Deutsche Börse across all locations.The second question with regard to the cash equity business. Yes  there's one aggressive competitor currently in Europe underway  and they make attractive liquidity program. So they invest basically to win market share. And -- you can be sure that we obviously monitor that situation that we are not happy with the development. And so that we are currently in the process to implement counteractive measures to stop that and -- you will see that in the next weeks and months.Haley TamThe cost answer was very clear. And if I could be cheeky just in terms of those counteractive measures  we should keep a close eye on your revenue yield then  would that be the right interpretation?Gregor PottmeyerIt depends how the countermeasures look like  right? So -- is it about processes  functionality? Is it about the market model? Is it about a temporary liquidity program. So it really depends on the single concrete countermeasures  but you can be sure that it won't accept that situation.OperatorThe follow-up question comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerI appreciate the follow-up. You guys have been highlighting you expect about 1% tailwinds to revenues coming from pricing power. I was just wondering if you're thinking about that has changed. That was in a low inflation environment. Now that inflation has picked up. Have you changed your thoughts about pricing as we look out over the next couple of years? .Gregor PottmeyerSorry  I was muted. So sorry not to be yet. So from a pricing perspective  so the impact you currently see on the revenue this year and next year  so the pricing impact is more than 1% currently. And so also  we use the opportunity to increase prices  but we don't do it always straightforward  let's say  on trading fees. So we talk about volume rebate schemes and renter or introducing service fees and so on. So there are different ways how to do that. But the current impact is higher than the 1% you have seen in the past.Looking forward  medium to long term  our focus is still unchanged. Our focus is having attractive liquidity platform. So having the lowest spread as possible being benchmarked. So our focus is on winning market share  winning liquidity and not using the pricing power.

At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation.Let me now turn the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our third quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation and afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions.The link to the presentation material for this call has been sent out by email and it can also be downloaded from the Investor Relation section of our website. As usual  the conference call is recorded and will be available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome  ladies and gentlemen. The times we are currently living in continue to be quite unprecedented. After the strong first quarter  we were expecting at Deutsche Börse a normalization of activity throughout the year  but what we saw instead was an even acceleration of growth throughout the year 2022. In the end  the third quarter turned out to be our strongest quarter ever from a net revenue perspective.The main driver for the 12% cyclical net revenue growth we have seen in the first nine months is the beginning cycle of rising interest rates. In the United States  we have meanwhile reached a fair target range of 3% to 3.25% and in September  the ECB raised rates in Europe to a level that will last saw back in 2011.This has resulted in greater trading and hedging needs for our clients in almost all asset classes  as well as growth of the net interest income of our security service business  which had been depressed for so many years. This is the new area as we called it  and as I was referring to at our last Investor Day in June  which adds additional cyclical opportunities to our consistent delivery of secular growth.Combining the two  we are now expecting organic growth rates of 7% to 9% on average per annum from this year onwards through the current cycle. Organic growth will continue to be complemented by M&A with the same approach as previously. In the third quarter  the situation on the European gas markets has continued to fuel the activities in commodities  but we are now also starting to see some negative effects of the market uncertainty in our European power product complex  which saw declining activity.Very encouraging to see is the continued strong secular net revenue growth  which amounted to 8% in the first nine months. This is really the result of the many initiatives to win new clients and market share as well as introducing new products and services over the last couple of years. This also continues to be our top priority because the current strong cyclical tailwinds are not going to last forever.The development in 2022 also underscores the quality of our business portfolio. The strong results are not just driven by single businesses  but by double-digit net revenue growth in almost all business lines. On the operating expense side  we have faced with an unusual combination of drivers that have resulted in higher cost growth compared to our initial guidance.Foreign exchange effects have gotten stronger throughout the year and are expected to effect as well into next year  but this item is overcompensated by the positive FX impact on our net revenue. While we don't see headline inflation numbers in our overall operating cost yet  the 4% we are currently looking at are certainly an elevated level compared to past periods.And finally  the favorable financial development and relative share price performance has resulted in an increase of the provisions for variable and share-based compensation.In total net revenue in the first nine months increased by 23% and amounted to more than €3.2 billion. The EBITDA increased by 24% to around €1.9 billion euro. Since the overall development in the first nine months so far exceeded our initial expectations for 2022  we are further increasing our guidance for the full year 2022.Our expectation now is to exceed €4.1 billion euro of net revenue and €2.3 billion of EBITDA. This might sound conservative to some of you  but you guys know us. We are all cautious management people and rather want to under-promise and over deliver than the opposite.With that  let me now hand over to you  Gregor to present the financial results in greater detail.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we show the details also besides for the first nine months. All segments have contributed double-digit cost rates to the overall net revenue development. Three out of four segments even achieved organic net revenue growth rate of more than 20%.As part of the net revenue  the net interest income across the globe has roughly tripled compared to the previous year. On the one hand  this was driven by much higher colateral levels in financial derivatives and especially commodities. On the other hand  the net interest income of security services has started to meaningful benefit from higher US and now also European interest rates.The result from financial investments saw a small negative contribution from our FinTech fund investments in the third quarter and amounted to €29 million for the first nine months. For the full year  we are now expecting any positive contribution  but might see a further small decline.In terms of operating costs in the first nine months is on Page 3  we saw several different drivers. First M&A effect  which declined compared to half year one and amounted to 5%. They were still mainly driven by the IFS acquisition. Second  the FX effect from the stronger US dollar increased and resided in a 3% operating expense increase  but this was obviously also beneficial to the net revenue development particular in the data and analytics segment.This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating cost scores of 8%. On the one hand  it was driven by inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to continue to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in the light of the favorable financial development and relative share price performance.This brings me to the details of the third quarter reside on Page 4 of the presentation. While the secular close remained at high levels and slightly above our expectation  cyclical tailwinds have accelerated in the third quarter compared to the first half of this year. The cyclical growth was driven in particular by market volatility and hedging needs of our clients and financial derivatives  commodities and of products.In addition  and as expected  the net interest income has become a more material growth driver for security services. The M&A effect again had minor impact in the third quarter since they were only driven by some of the smaller more recent acquisitions.The explanations are just provided on operating cost development in the first nine months can generally also be applied to the third quarter. While the M&A impact on the operating costs has become smaller compared to previous quarters  the impact from variable and share-based compensation has increased. Furthermore  we saw an increase of project cost and some additional IT investments in cloud technology.So aside from financial investments in the previous year included a positive valuation effect of €32 million from the minority investment in Clarity AI as a result of the financing round with SoftBank. In the third quarter  depreciation and amortization included some one-off effects from software impairments and the financial results included higher interest from our funds outstanding in particular from the hybrid bond that was issued in March  as well as some FX effect.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments starting with data and analytics on Page 5. We saw good organic net revenue growth levels across all business lines in the segment. This was driven by the continuing trend towards ESG  new clients and higher market activity for the index licensing business. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  included some inorganic growth from the acquisition of Discovery Data.Most of our direct US dollar exposure in is in the data and analytics segment from the ISS and Axioma subsidiaries  but constant currency net revenue cost in the third quarter was still very strong with 19%. The EBITDA in the previous year's quarter included the gain of around €32 million from the evaluation of the stake in Clarity AI that I mentioned before. Adjusted for this effect  the EBITDA has increased by 33%.Let me turn to Slide 6 in the trading and clearing segment. The trading and clearing segment continue to benefit from higher volatility and increased client hedging needs. The financial derivatives business of Eurex was as strong as in the first quarter. This was driven by high cost in all product lines and in particular by the increased margin fees. They amounted to €34 million in the third quarter.In commodities  we achieved another quarter because of the increased trading and hedging needs of our clients in gas products and due to the higher margin fees  but at the same time  the situation in European energy markets increasingly became a headwind for net revenue which was power product in Europe. They declined by 11%.In the cash equity business  we saw headwinds from elevated levels of retail participation last year  which has normalized this year. In addition  one of our peers has increased liquidity payments this year  which resided in some market share decline for all incumbents in Europe.As a result of higher volatility  the demand for foreign exchange products was significantly higher compared to previous quarters and we achieved our  by far best quarter ever  there's a net revenue increase of 33%.In the fund services segment  on Page 7  the continued onboarding of new clients more than offset the cyclical headwinds from the market performance  especially in equity product. In addition  we saw the inorganic contribution of the Kneip acquisition  which was closed at the end of March.In the operating expense base of the segment  we saw a few one-off effects in the quarter. They're related to the integration of Kneip and the preparations for the carve-out of the fund service business from Clearstream. It's also encouraging to see that the momentum of new partnerships has continued. HSBC has chosen Deutsche Börse as its global partner for fund auto loading  safekeeping  settlement and distribution for very meaningful fund portfolio.Our security services segment on Slide 8  saw a significant acceleration of close in the third quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation were overcompensated by solid levels of fixed income issuance activity. Some is FX effects on assets under custody denominated in US dollar and the collateral management business with the close of more than 30%.In addition  the net interest income has increased more than six fold compared to last year. This was driven much by -- this was driven by much higher US interest rates and for the first time in more than a decade  increasing European interest rates. Furthermore  the cash balances has increased by roughly 30% compared to the previous year.The last page of today's presentation shows our guidance for 2022. We have already increased our guidance twice this year. However  these increases were either qualitative than quantitative. Since the third quarter developed significantly above our even more recent expectations  we have now increased our net revenue guidance to more than €4.1 billion and the EBITDA guidance to more than €2.3 billion.Depending on the cyclical development in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter  those numbers look conservative  but we want to be on the safe site.Since most of the operating expense drivers we have seen in the first nine months are also expected to impact our cost base in the fourth quarter  we are currently expecting operating cost of slightly more than €1.8 billion for the full year. This expectation is a result of the combination of the different operating cost drivers I've outlined before.We consider some of them to be more temporary in nature and would expect some easing of the cost pressure going into next year. This will also help us to address all sorts of potential net revenue scenarios next year against the tougher 2022 comparables.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your question.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator instructions] And the first question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BNP Paribas Exane. Over to you.Arnaud GiblatYeah  good afternoon. My question is on interest income. Clearly we all understand how it works in our history  but it's a bit more obscure at how NI works at Eurex and EEX. I was wondering if you could spend a bit of time explaining the growth there. Is it entirely coming from increased cash balances and margining and how sustainable is that increase in margining? I suspect it's linked to the volatility  but can use hold a higher level of margin for some time?And could you talk about the net interest margin? Is that linked to short term rates? How does NIM work for those businesses? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  thanks Arnaud for this question. Obviously  the net interest income is an important line item now in our P&L and gets even more important in this future. So it's different in our Clearstream business compared to our clearing business. So starting with Clearstream  here you have heard that the customer cash balance is even increased to roughly €18 billion. And this interest income we achieved here with increased interest rates or fed fund rate of 3% to 3.25% and will most probably further increase or over the next weeks and months.So here you can basically multiply it. So saying additional 1% on €18 billion  it's another €180 million at Clearstream. So  that's the concept here.With regard to the two clearing houses  so US Clearing and ECC  here the model is different from a P&L perspective. So here  we get roughly a fee-based income on the margins  right?So the margin at Eurex increased to a level of €130 billion to €140 billion now is much higher compared to previous year due to increased volatility and due to the successfully increasing of our OTC interest rate swap business. So here  we have an increased basis. And the same is basically true for the clearinghouse ECC. So for our commodities business at EEX. So here  we have seen in the past one or two years ago  it was €5 billion roughly a margin requirement here and collateral we had available and more than 90% is euro cash basically.And that increased now to a level of €50 billion  €60 billion. So it's 10x higher. And obviously  here  we get also some fee income. So this is the concept. And the question  how sustainable is that now? So on the one hand side  I would say  at Clearstream. So we expect at the market that continue to increase wages for the Fed and even for the ECB  at least for the next months. So that will further strengthen our NII at Clearstream.On the other hand side  if rates continue to increase  there's a higher probability that our customer cash balances will decrease and we will see. So far  it did not decrease so far until end of September. But from a logical perspective  it should continue to decrease as there is a high incentive for the treasuries and the banks due to efficient cash allocation.And with regard to the margins at ECG and ECC  they won't drop on a short-term basis. So that's much more stable for -- at least for the next months  right? I wouldn't say for the next years  but it's much more stable than potentially the customer cash balances could be a little bit more volatile.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerJust a question following up on the cost in terms of the €1.8 billion kind of targeted for this year. If we think about that  how much of that is kind of costs that are being brought forward from next year? And if you can just clarify just in terms of the last statements you made in your prepared remarks about how we should think about the cost base as we look out to 2023? I suspect the €1.8 billion should allow you to still generate operating leverage next year. Is that how -- is that correct?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Mike. I think the cost topic is an important topic  that's good that we can a little bit elaborate on that. So I think this year is a very specific year this effect  we hadn't even not planned for  right? So we had plan for this M&A  right  as we were aware for that and that cost increase shouldn't be a surprise.So the FX impact to 3% or 3-plus percent I think that's a little bit of a surprise. But the good thing on a P&L perspective  that FX impact will be compensated by higher impact on the net revenue. So at FX stronger U.S. dollar is positive for Deutsche Börse that shouldn't be a concern at all for all of us.So we are more focused on what we say the operating organic cost growth on a constant portfolio basis  so a constant FX basis. And so that's roughly the 8% we have to talk about. And here  we have two elements. So the one is the inflation. That's roughly 4%. I think that's even good because the journal inflation is 8%. You are aware of that. So that's even below that level. But it's more than we originally expected when we made up our plan.And this component  I would assume  will continue to be there also in next year. The other  let's say  4% increase  share payments and specifically bonus  right? That is due to our very successful performance in this year. And so we pay higher bonus than originally planned. This is obviously not sustainable. So having a much more tougher year next in 2023  so most probably bonus could even go down compared to the plus 4%.So taking these 4 components  so M&A  FX  inflation and compensation. So just the inflation part will continue to happen next year or the other three could disappear  M&A  we will finally see it really will disappear. But the variable compensation could be even lower. So it would be a decrease in next year. So to cut a long story short  so this 16% cost  what we have seen here. And our guidance  we expect a similar growth in Q4. That's why we say it's slightly above €1.8 billion.So for 2023  we do not expect at all double-digit cost. So it will be clearly single digit from today's perspective  where we just have to deal with the inflationary aspect and obviously  we are currently in the process of doing the budgeting and therefore  we have some scenario planning  and we are also able to deliver on a contingent cost base.So I would -- from my perspective  overall  that's exceptional development in 2022 from a cost perspective  2023 will come back to a level you are used to see in the past.Theodor WeimerIf I may add  Mike  Theodor here  right? Gregor is stating now from a technical point of view  what happened this year and what can you expect next year? And I can fully underscore what Gregor said. From a strategic point of view  I always said  and I'll stick to this statement here today again  right. Always said  cost growth rate should not be higher than the secular growth of the company. And as Gregor pointed out in his presentation  we are growing 8% secularly this year  and our cost rate -- organic cost rate increases exactly 8%  right?And next year  that was question what you can expect is if the organic growth rate is in the range of 5%  6% or whatever or 7%  right? Then you take it as a commitment of the CFO and CEO that we say  we stick to this commitment  right? Cost shall not overrun taking the FX side and the M&A side shall not over on organic growth rates on the revenue side  secular growth rates on the revenue side.OperatorThe next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citigroup.Andrew CoombsJust firstly  just to come back to the costs. You talked about some temporary costs that are dropping away next year. Can you just elaborate and quantify what those temporary costs are? Second question  when I look at your Eurex revenue per contract  that seems to have surprised positively. So perhaps you could talk about some of the pricing dynamics there  whether that was a change in pricing or whether that was just mix effect between the different asset classes and contracts?Gregor PottmeyerYes  interesting. Thanks for the question. Yes  with regard to the temporary development of the cost  so I already elaborated when I answered Mike's question a little bit on that  but to be more precise here. So they are basically  I'd say easily 4x -- 4% cost increase. And so the variable compensation is definitely of temporary nature or it's related to this more than 20% top line and bottom line growth. And no one expects the same development next year having debt at higher starting point.So most probably  the variable compensation will go down compared to this year's development. So out of this plus 4% or plus 5%  you will see minus something most probably  right? So that's why we say that's definitely temporary of nature.Then the FX is temporary of nature because now serve as a starting point from a U.S. dollar perspective  as an average  slightly above parity. So yes  it could even go down a little bit further  but the big jump you have seen now. And therefore  the FX impact  if it does not completely disappear is much smaller compared to this year.M&A  that depends whether we are doing additional M&A yes or no. And so as a conclusion  only the inflationary impact will continue to happen next year.With regard to your second question  Eurex revenue per contract. So that's obviously just depending on the product mix  right? So if they are traded more products where we have a higher revenue level  then that contributes  obviously  positive if you do an average calculation on Eurex. So a substantial change of the revenue per contract on product level does not happen.Andrew CoombsOkay. Just to put point because I think what you're referring to is temporary growth factors around the temporary absolute cost contribution because unless FX rates change or unless you were to divest one of the businesses you've acquired  that's obviously here to stay going into next year. But perhaps I can push you on that variable compensation component exactly how is that calibrated and calculated as a percentage of your revenue and EBITDA growth? And how much of your overall personnel expenses  does that account for?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So overall  so bonus are in the level of 10% of our operating expenses  and so the level is definitely above the level we have planned for  right? And if we exceed our plans  what we definitely do is more than 20%  then obviously  the bonus level is much higher.And now it depends on the variability of the salary  obviously  the highest variability you see on the executive and on the management board level and the lowest you see on the staff level. So -- and in average  there's obviously a fluctuation of  let's say  20% to 30% out of this number  whether we are able -- whether we are very successful or whether we are in line with our plan or even if we are below our plan.OperatorNext question is Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyQuestion on EEX and the European commodity clearing in particular. Maybe you can speak a bit more about the stress you see in the system? Are we past the peak after the government supports various government measures? So maybe a bit in the short term. And then what does it mean for medium to long term? Do you think this issue of counterparty risk is a real accelerator for your market share or more steady continuously structured story of taking market share from OTC players?Gregor PottmeyerOkay. What we currently see is that we passed the peak  right? So we have seen in the peak times and the margin  the collateral  I think  is the best indicator for that. It was in the range of €100 billion. And today  it's more in the range of €50 billion to €60 billion.And you see that -- and the reason for that is that you have seen over the last weeks that gas and power prices decreased  significantly decreased  right? So people think now that we are able to manage the next winter at least  right? So that's why the prices are going down. And that's obviously good. So that's the stress out of this system is decreasing here  and hopefully  that will continue to happen.I think for us  it's -- and we are proud that we are really able to manage even in that stress the duration  our exchange and our clearing house here at Eurex and we were to work together with all the market participants and the market participants were able to deliver the necessary collateral and even with the German government and even on the European level  we are in close discussion and they are strongly supportive to help that markets are open and that we have a clear market-led solution here.And even if you see some discussion around pricing cap and so on  so the basic logic still is that if government or EU commission would like to see a cap that this will be compensated by the government  so the delta between the market price and the cap price. And so that helps us to continue to help here the market solutions here.With regard to the medium to long-term aspect  so currently  we see due to that stress in the system that our market share even increased. So in the European power derivatives market  it's currently 58%. So a year ago  it was 40% or 40 plus or something like that. So it's now 58%.But what we also see is that the trading volume is going down. I told you that the power derivatives revenue in Q3 decreased adjusted trading fees by 11%. And it's going down. And the reason for that is  yes  if you have to put in a lot of collateral and margins  obviously  your flexibility to trade a lot is certainly limited at that point of time.What we expect for the mid- to long-term view that this will reasonably calibrate. So we expect that our margins and collateral requirements will go down and that the trading activity will continue to increase. And the secular growth drivers from our perspective are all intact.So with regard to renewables and carbon certificates  hydrogen markets and so on. So that's all positive for us. So for the mid- to long term  we expect this will come back to a normal situation. Then trading activity will increase  margin will go down  the fee income on the margin will go down. And overall  we think we are well prepared without this extraordinary impact today to grow double-digit also for the next year.OperatorThe next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtSo obviously  there's very strong revenue growth of 30% in the quarter. Just wondering  could you more specifically provide the FX in the third quarter? And how much FX added to the revenue growth? And you also disclosed 8% secular revenue growth for the third quarter  specifically in your financial statement. Can you clarify whether any of that secular growth includes an FX benefit or is that purely constant currency as well? .Gregor PottmeyerYes. So the second part is quite clear. So the secular growth is without FX impact. So the FX impact we include in the cyclical cost. Your first question  what is the FX impact on our revenues? So on our cost side  it's roughly 3%. And on our revenue  it's in the range of 1% to 2%  so 1.5%  something like that.Kyle VoigtOkay. And that was for the third quarter specifically  Gregor?Gregor PottmeyerYes. It's specifically also true for the third quarter.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonI guess just thinking about M&A activity  clearly  looking into 2023  it looks like after a banner year this year  it's going to be a little bit more challenging potentially from a cyclical standpoint. So does that mean -- does that likely accelerate some of your M&A plans? I mean  obviously  there's some notable sort of valuation decreases in the fund platform space  for example.So perhaps if you could outline where you think looks kind of most interesting on this sort of nonorganic side? And then just remind us where you are in terms of your sort of current balance sheet leverage and therefore  capacity to do deals from sort of balance sheet as of today or year-end?Theodor Weimerhank you  Bruce. Let me take the first one and the capacity shall be taken then by Gregor as always. Let me share with you a couple of observations which are certainly new to the majority of you -- on the M&A side  it's very clear. The M&A market has changed fundamentally over the last 12 months  not only on the tech side  but particularly in the tech and data side where we are particularly interested in  right. Point number one. Everybody understands that the interest rates have increased the capital cost  right  and therefore  per se  every day  you have to be even more selective.Point number three  from my point of view  some 12 months ago  even less  right  the market -- M&A market has been a pure sellers market  right? So the sellers basically said  I'm willing to sell if and then they demand it and egress the high numbers. This has also fundamentally changed. We're now seeing clearly a buyer's market. And the fact that we are potentially a very fought after strategic buyer  we received lots of inbound calls. But -- and that's point number four  from my point of view  you need differentiate between private and public market developments.On the public market side valuations  as you said  Bruce  have come down significantly already. On the private side  I don't know what happens. But as you can imagine  some of the holders of the private side  private asset side  there's still dream of the good old days  some 8 to 18 months ago. So they have not -- some of them might not have realized that valuations have changed that the market has fundamentally changed.And therefore  what we currently see is lots of opportunities  right? But I need to state also very clearly  we can become and we are even more selective given the situation that we are -- and you listen to what we have said today. We can look back and also look forward to the next quarter. We have pretty strong results  financial results. Nobody right is forcing us to be very aggressive on the way.And last but not least  with regards to certain areas you were mentioning hinting in a certain direction. Of course  we do not comment on any specific M&A targets  but you can be assured we will -- we are very reasonable. We are not under pressure. We are highly selective and determined to do if you do deals. We do good deals. And if you simply look in what happened on the data side  especially on the ISS side  that's a big  big positive right of what we can report here for the year 2022.Gregor PottmeyerAnd your second question with regard to the balance sheet  obviously  you are aware that  that S&P just confirmed our AA rating because we are able to come back to the grid threshold at year-end without doing further M&A. So that was positively confirmed also from S&P.Here  you can see that we are back in a situation to have financial flexibility because we are very cash generative every year  more than €1.5 billion cash we generate every year. So funding is not a limitation or refinancing is not a limitation for our M&A activity. So we have enough headroom here available from a cash perspective  from a debt -- additional debt perspective or on even some equity perspective  where we have treasury shares and authorization.And also from a structuring and M&A deal  there's not always a need that we need additional cash. So we can also bring in some assets doing some joint venture or partnerships as we have done for instance  this continue in our stock business. So overall  from a funding refinancing perspective  there are no limitation for M&A deals.OperatorThe next question comes from Philip Middleton from Bank of America.Philip MiddletonThank you very much for the presentation today. Just to round out the cost discussion. Entirely understand how you're segregating the cost between some things which are obviously going to drop away like the variable comp and some things which should happen that are outside your control of the inflation.But are you saying that there's a cap at the rate of inflation  which is your organic growth? Or -- because you used to talk about operating leverage sort of being built into the model. And if you -- is that still the case? Or how should we actually think about operating leverage in the current environment?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Philip for specifically asking that  that operating leverage topic. So overall  we show on our existing portfolio  strong operating leverage  right? If you take  for instance  our Eurex business and -- or even our Trading & Clearing business  and doing -- and comparing the EBITDA margin last year compared with this year  then you see a nice increase.So for the existing business  we are able to show operating leverage. And the old formula for whether we trade 15 million or 10 million contracts a day  there are no additional costs with regard to that. So we are able to show that even in some times with a little bit more in inflation. So that's a clear commitment of us as a management team.When you do this operating leverage on a group level  so there are additional aspects why we are not able to show an increased EBITDA margin. So first is that we're currently doing M&A in an area where we achieve -- so for instance  with regard to ISS in the range of EBITDA margin of 30% to 35%. So it's clearly above the 58% what you see as an average. So this dilutes basically our M&A margin.And secondly  last year  we had a strong equity result of some €85 million. And this year  roughly €30 million. So we also do some on a group level perspective. But from an operational perspective  we are strongly committed to continue to show operating leverage in our existing business.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschYes. One on the secular growth  the 8% you pointed out in Q3. Could you elaborate bits on it again  maybe also allocating a share to Eurex especially  overall you guided for a kind of 5%  you demonstrated that over the past three years  year-to-date  you achieved 6%. So how should we think about the 8%? And how much is really coming from Eurex and not the other growth segments that we were talking about?Theodor WeimerSo Eurex is also in the range of 8%  like the average on group level. So how do we calibrate the secular growth? So in principle  we consider secular growth if we are able to increase our market shares  if we win new market segments  if we build up new products. And here  we've done from with regard to new products  we don't say just a new product out of this year because of product side  let's say  five to seven years.So we go back 5 to 7 years and say  what are the new products here. And we consider still for instance  at Eurex  but just have to give you some examples that we say our derivatives on MSCI level as just said  such a product or total return futures  we define as a new product or still dividend and volatility derivatives. So just to give you a few examples.So all the revenue increase we are able to achieve in this new product category. So this we show as a secular growth. And that's basically true for all the other segments. So we have here a clear distinction what we say  that's basically more a sustainable level  this is 8% and when you say the 12% on a cyclical basis. So that is just specifically linked to the specific situation this year with its higher volatility  and that depends basically what we will see in the next year. But the secular growth is defined as a sustainable growth rate also for the future.Tobias LukeschAnd given the fact that you were also emphasizing new clients and also market share gains in the various segments. Is it fair to assume that this kind of 8% secular growth is something you're not worried about over the next quarters? Or it could even be accelerated? I mean  what is your kind of view on that development?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So you are aware that on our Investor Day and end of June. So we guided at least a 5% secular growth rate  right? So -- and that's what we're definitely targeting for and what we are committed to deliver also for the next year. But this 8% is above our average here. And my guess would be even in Q4  we would have good chances to deliver this 8%  but for the next three to five years  things like that. So our commitment is to achieve at least 5% cyclical.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.Johannes ThormannSome follow-up questions  please. First of all  on the NII dynamic. What do you think are -- as you have given a broad range between €5 billion to €50 billion margin calls? What is a normalized collateral or margin level in energy business? And at what point in time in Clearstream  do you think you have to share upcoming rate hikes with the customers? And regarding the M&A pipeline or your thoughts on the change in the market  just would be great to know if the dynamic has hinted talks and postpone talks? Or have they actually intensified discussions?Gregor PottmeyerSo I'll start with the first question and Theodor handle the M&A question. So with regard to NII  what is the right level at our clearing -- commodity clearinghouse ECC. So it's difficult to judge  I think. So yes  I told you two years ago  it was €5 billion and now it's €50 billion €60 billion. I don't think that it will come back to the €5 billion right it.But it's difficult to get whether for the next three to five years  right? What is the right number here. I think it will be a double-digit €1 billion a month because we continue to grow but it's really difficult to judge.But on a short-term basis  it won't go down sharply due to the €5 billion. So that's what we -- not expect and the situation in gas and power is obviously not solved  even it's currently a little bit relaxed  but it's by far more soft  and you will see high volatility also in 2023. So I don't think that the margins will go significantly down.Your second question with regard to sharing NII results at Clearstream that we will see that. So the higher the amount we will achieve  the more we have also to consider to talk to our clients. So far  up to now  we do not share  but at certain point in time  I think there will be the need also to share.Theodor WeimerAnd Johannes on the M&A side  whether it's an answer whether the overall environment descending discussions. I can be very  very smart and referred to the M&A market globally as such  it is basically M&A shrink significantly. But I would say without saying anything beyond what I'm saying  right  on our side  it's rather such that the level of inbound calls  the level of ideas  which we are getting is rather enhanced.OperatorAnd next up is Ian White from Autonomous Research.Ian WhiteJust a couple of follow-ups from my side  please. First up  I think earlier you said there is a sort of a one-off software impairment that's impacting depreciation and amortization this quarter. Could you just call that out for us  please  in terms of how much that was? Sorry if I've missed it in the presentation or the release  but that would be helpful.And just secondly  on M&A  I think you said on the call earlier this year  you were perhaps less focused on fund services M&A due to sort of strong organic progression there. Am I right to take from your earlier remarks on this call that you might be more open to inorganic growth in Fund Services now? And how does the carve-out of the Fund Services business from Clearstream help to enable M&A if at all  please?Theodor WeimerSo the first question is very easy. So this one-off software is roughly €5 million. And the second question with regard to M&A. I think you are aware of this carve out in our investment Fund Service business. So that's continuing to be right on track  right? So we are able to deliver what we want to achieve. So 2023 is the year where we are able to achieve our targets. And therefore  we would be also prepared to do partnerships in that way when we want to.And so it's -- from an M&A perspective  it's difficult to judge what customers would like to do because customers have always three opportunities to work together with Deutsche Börse Investment Fund Services. So they can easily connect to our platform  they can outsource. So these two elements we show as an organic growth.And thirdly  they can sell the business  right? So with regard to HSBC  that was basically an outsourcing contract  right? So very successful have won that with regard to Kneip  there was a decision that we don't want to buy the business or and the Kneip asset owner wanted to sale. So that's why we say  in principle  fund services is of high interest of Deutsche Börse  whether it's organic  inorganic partner approach. So therefore  we are open and flexible. And with regard to preparing all until year-end and fulfilling that in 2023  this carve-out for this fund service business  we are even more flexible to do partnerships.OperatorAnd we're coming to the next question  and it comes from Haley Tam from Credit Suisse.Haley TamQuick follow-up on costs  if I may. And then a question about the cash equities market. In terms of costs  can I just pick up? I think you said earlier that you had a 4% impact of inflation in the 9 months so far  and you noted that was lower than the current rate of inflation. So we should interpret this to mean that you are expecting there to be further inflationary impact in your organic cost growth next year and that will be within the perimeter when you're thinking about the comparison to secular revenue growth. So I just wanted to check on that.And any comments you might have there in terms of wage inflation  in particular  I guess would be particularly interesting to me. In terms of the cash equities market  you did note there that you had seen some loss of market share has had all other market participants due to a competitor stepping up the liquidity payments. And I just wondered whether you consider a one-off shift in market share or whether you are actually considering any plans to match those payments to win back share?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So with regard to your first question of cost and this year  4% in inflation  so -- and my comment that inflation will not disappear is not to understand in the way that it will increase next year  right? But it won't go down. So we all do not know what are the final outcome and specific with regard to the wage increase. And that we are in the process and just started that process to talk about with our workers council and soon  so no decisions are made.But in principle  this 4% inflation most probably will not increase next year  but you will see a comparable number also in 2023 and whether these are triggered by one-off payments to people or either to regular increase. So that we will see how the final decisions will end  but I don't expect that the inflation will increase at least not the 4% overall on personnel costs  nonpersonnel costs and in average for Deutsche Börse across all locations.The second question with regard to the cash equity business. Yes  there's one aggressive competitor currently in Europe underway  and they make attractive liquidity program. So they invest basically to win market share. And -- you can be sure that we obviously monitor that situation that we are not happy with the development. And so that we are currently in the process to implement counteractive measures to stop that and -- you will see that in the next weeks and months.Haley TamThe cost answer was very clear. And if I could be cheeky just in terms of those counteractive measures  we should keep a close eye on your revenue yield then  would that be the right interpretation?Gregor PottmeyerIt depends how the countermeasures look like  right? So -- is it about processes  functionality? Is it about the market model? Is it about a temporary liquidity program. So it really depends on the single concrete countermeasures  but you can be sure that it won't accept that situation.OperatorThe follow-up question comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerI appreciate the follow-up. You guys have been highlighting you expect about 1% tailwinds to revenues coming from pricing power. I was just wondering if you're thinking about that has changed. That was in a low inflation environment. Now that inflation has picked up. Have you changed your thoughts about pricing as we look out over the next couple of years? .Gregor PottmeyerSorry  I was muted. So sorry not to be yet. So from a pricing perspective  so the impact you currently see on the revenue this year and next year  so the pricing impact is more than 1% currently. And so also  we use the opportunity to increase prices  but we don't do it always straightforward  let's say  on trading fees. So we talk about volume rebate schemes and renter or introducing service fees and so on. So there are different ways how to do that. But the current impact is higher than the 1% you have seen in the past.Looking forward  medium to long term  our focus is still unchanged. Our focus is having attractive liquidity platform. So having the lowest spread as possible being benchmarked. So our focus is on winning market share  winning liquidity and not using the pricing power. So even if the pricing mechanism is currently higher than the 1% on a mid- to long-term basis  I would expect to keep that 1% level.Jan StreckerAll right. This was the last question for today.

Consequently  the extraordinary resolutions have been debated as listed in the meeting notice published in the French official legal bulletin Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires (BALO) No. 109  dated September 12  2022.The voting rights attached to the shares of the defaulting shareholders represented by the ad hoc representative were exercised at a rate of two thirds votes in favor and one third against  pursuant to the terms of the mission entrusted to the ad hoc representative by order of the President of the Commercial Court of Montpellier dated September 27  2022.All the documents regarding this AGE  including the results of the votes  are available on the Company’s website: https://www.deinove.com/en/investor-room/documentation-center/general-shareholders-meeting-preparatory-documentsStory continuesABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies.

Median is positioning itself to become the strategic partner to extract insights from medical images by applying AI solutions to better understand the mechanism of action of new drugs. Therefore  we are becoming the natural provider for clinical studies. With this strong and unique differentiator  we expect to see a clear impact on our iCRO order backlog in the coming months.Our iBiopsy® activities have also been very intense during the quarter with the formation of a first class clinical advisory board and our continued interaction with the FDA for our iBiopsy® LCS CADe/CADx SaMD which is following its natural course. We still expect to start our pivotal study in the coming months. Furthermore  the European Union has announced that lung cancer screening1 will become one of the main priorities for the new cancer plan “Europe’s beating cancer plan”  which should substantially increase our total addressable market in the coming years.”Further growth during Q3 2022Third quarter revenues amounted to €6.0 million  representing a 13% increase compared to Q3 2021 revenues (€5.3 million). Revenues for the first three quarters of 2022 were €18.7 million  up 21% compared to the €15.4 million for the first three quarters of 2021. Revenues are entirely generated by the iCRO2 business  which provides imaging services to the biopharmaceutical industry worldwide for oncology clinical trials.The order backlog3 was €62.5 million on September 30  2022   up €8.3 million compared to September 30  2021 (€54.2 million  +15%).Cash and cash equivalents totaled €25.9 million on September 30  2022  including receipt of the 2021 research and innovation tax credit for €1.6 million  and benefiting from the collection of late payments from the second quarter by the Chinese subsidiary following the lockdown in the Shanghai region.Financial information at June 30  2022 (IFRS consolidated financial statements)Median Technologies continued robust growth momentum during the first half of 2022 .Cash flow statementCash flow (€ thousands) 06/30/2022(six months) 06/30/2021(six months) Operating cash flow (5 682) (3 961) Change in operating working capital Requirement (4 390) (2 485) Net cash flow from operating activities (10 072) (6 446) Net cash flow from investing activities (662) (417) Net cash flow from financing activities (155) 27 355 Impact of changes in exchange rates 120 126 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (10 769) 20 618 Cash at end of period 28 241 36 933The Company continued the development program of its iBiopsy® Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) CADe/CADx software as medical device (SaMD)  which resulted in an increase of the cash flow deficit  partially offset by the additional margins generated by the growing iCRO business.Working capital requirements deteriorated temporarily due to the closure of Chinese administration offices during the lockdown in Shanghai  which delayed the invoicing and collection process for trade receivables. On June 30  2022  the Group estimated late payments of €2.5 million.Consolidated income statement under IFRS€ thousands H1 2022 H1 2021 Revenue from ordinary activities 12 839 10 207 Staff costs (13 707) (7 721) External costs (9 362) (6 429) Operating profit (loss) (11 010) (4 544) Net financial income 2 441 (4 764) Net profit (loss) (8 881) (9 506)The operating loss reached (€11.0) million  representing an increase of €6.5 million relative to the year-earlier period  including €4.3 million due to the accounting under IFRS of free share allocations made in October 2021 for the Group’s employees and management (with no cash impact)  and also due to the investments made for research and development work for the iBiopsy® platform.The increase in revenues and the margin generated by the iCRO business helped reduce the impact of investments in iBiopsy® on operating result.Financial result reached €2.4 million  due primarily to an IFRS accounting valuation adjustment (with no cash impact) of the equity warrants issued in favor of the EIB with the drawing of the first €15 million tranche of its loan in H1 2020. This valuation has been significantly impacted by changes in the share price since the issue of these warrants. Although it is recorded in the statement of financial position under financial instruments  no reimbursement will be made that could affect the Group’s cash in the future.Median Technologies informs its shareholders and the financial community that its half year financial report on the accounts for the half year ending June 30  2022  has been made available and filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers).The half year financial report is available on the Company’s website:http://www.mediantechnologies.com/investors/Forward-looking statements This press release contains forward-looking statements.

This trend  which impacts the Company's revenue compared to the previous year…,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:During the first 9 months of the year  Axway (Euronext: AXW.PA) (Paris:AXW) confirmed the ramp-up of its cloud-based subscription offerings. This trend  which impacts the Company's revenue compared to the previous year due to lower anticipated revenue recognition  did not prevent the total value of all subscription contracts signed (TCV) from increasing significantly over 9 months (+29%)  despite the slippage of several large Customer Managed deals towards the end of the year.At product level  Axway continued to deploy its strategy focused on its key offerings. At the same time  customer interest in the Company's 4 main product lines remained strong:- the Amplify API Management platform continued to attract new customers with 31% growth in the value of new customer bookings over the first 9 months of 2022. Additionally  at the end of August  Axway was positioned as a Leader in The Forrester WaveTM API Management Solutions  Q3 20222. This new distinction confirms the relevance of the Company's vision of an open platform and a focus on helping customers expand the use of their APIs.- MFT new customer bookings have grown 96% since the beginning of the year. Q3 also saw the launch by Axway of a new partnership with Pro2col to help accelerate enterprise MFT adoption across the UK and Ireland - the value of new customer bookings for the B2B integration platform continued to grow during the quarter  reaching 782% year-to-date growth. This performance was driven by significant Axway Managed subscription deals  where customers entrusted Axway to run their B2B infrastructure and operations  allowing them to reduce their internal resources and focus on their core competencies - A new version of the Axway Financial Accounting Hub offering was launched  enabling Axway to engage in the financial ERP market  which is moving towards the cloud  with a complete SaaS/hybrid platform.Patrick Donovan  Axway's Chief Executive Officer  said:“The transition to a stable recurring revenue model from a traditional license business is a significant challenge  as seen again this year with the irregular revenue recognition we’re experiencing. Business momentum is moving in the right direction as our total bookings grew 16% over the first 3 quarters of 2022 and our overall subscription bookings have been even more dynamic  with 29% growth over the period. However  our revenue does not yet accurately reflect this commercial success and this is explained by the rise of our cloud Axway Managed subscription offers  whose weight in the total value of our bookings doubled year-on-year  from 13% to 26%. As I had the opportunity to explain when I presented our half-year results last July  our revenue will be more stable and predictable in the future thanks to the accumulation of this type of contract whose total earnings are recognized over time. Besides the good bookings  internal adjustments around our core products help deliver the focus and alignment our customers are looking for. Our product roadmaps continue to tighten  we are speeding up our decision making and further strengthening our engagement with customers. This is bearing results through improved customer satisfaction  better product quality and a more efficient organization.”Comments on Q3 2022 activityAxway Software: Consolidated revenue 3rd Quarter 2022 (€m) Q3 2022 Q3 2021Restated* Q3 2021Reported TotalGrowth OrganicGrowth Constant CurrencyGrowth Revenue 67.5 75.6 69.8 -3.3% -10.7% -10.7% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesIn Q3 2022  Axway's revenue was €67.5 m  down 10.7% organically and 3.3% in total. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of €5.8m on quarterly revenue  due to the appreciation of the of the US Dollar against the Euro.Axway Software: Revenue by business line 3rd Quarter 2022 (€m) Q3 2022 Q3 2021Restated* Q3 2021Reported TotalGrowth OrganicGrowth License 2.3 5.3 4.7 -51.7% -56.7% Subscription 27.4 30.2 27.8 -1.7% -9.5% Maintenance 28.3 31.8 29.5 -4.2% -11.1% Services 9.6 8.3 7.7 23.9% 15.8% Axway Software 67.5 75.6 69.8 -3.3% -10.7% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesRevenue from the License activity amounted to €2.3m in Q3 2022 (3% of total revenue)  representing an organic decline of 56.7%. As expected  the activity is still slowing down significantly due to the availability of Subscription offers that are meeting strong demand for all the key products in Axway's portfolio.Subscription revenue totaled €27.4m in Q3 2022 (41% of total revenue)  down 1.7% overall and 9.5% organically. This trend is explained by the high comparison basis established in Q3 2021 (+27.1%) and the decline in recognized upfront revenue  which Axway Managed revenue growth over the period was insufficient to offset.In line with expectations  revenue from the Maintenance activity amounted to €28.3m (42% of total revenue) in Q3 2022  representing a total decline of 4.2% and an organic decline of 11.1%. The migration of value from certain maintenance operations to Subscription has continued and  on a full-year basis  Axway anticipates a decline in activity similar to that seen over the first 9 months of the year.At the end of September 2022  Axway's Annual Recurrent Revenue (ARR) was €191.1m  up 6.6% compared to the end of September 2021. Recurring revenue for the quarter  which includes Subscription and Maintenance activities  represented 83% of the Company's revenue for the period  i.e. €55.7m  including upfront revenue of €7.5m recognized on the signing of Customer Managed subscription contracts.The Services activity generated revenues of €9.6m in Q3 2022 (14% of total revenues)  with organic growth of 15.8% and 23.9% in total. Still heavily impacted last year by travel restrictions in certain regions  the activity is gradually readjusting with a significant increase compared to the favorable comparison basis from which it benefits.Axway Software: Revenue by geographic area 3rd Quarter 2022 (€m) Q3 2022 Q3 2021Restated* Q3 2021Reported TotalGrowth OrganicGrowth France 15.1 19.3 19.3 -21.8% -21.8% Rest of Europe 14.7 14.0 14.0 4.5% 4.8% Americas 32.8 37.5 32.2 1.8% -12.6% Asia/Pacific 5.0 4.8 4.3 15.9% 3.5% Axway Software 67.5 75.6 69.8 -3.3% -10.7% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesFrance reported revenue of €15.1m in Q3 2022 (22% of total revenue)  a decrease of 21.8% compared to Q3 2021. Growth in Axway Managed subscription contracts and Services did not compensate for the low level of upfront revenue recognized over the quarter.The Rest of Europe region grew organically by 4.8% in Q3 2022 thanks to revenue of €14.7m  representing 22% of total revenue. Strong growth in Subscription and Services offset the decline in revenue from other activities. This trend is due to the signing in the region of several multi-year Customer Managed subscription contracts  with customers wishing to take advantage of the latest versions of Axway's APIM  B2B and MFT offerings.The Americas generated revenue of €32.8m in Q3 2022 (49% of total revenue)  up 1.8% overall and down 12.6% organically.

Revenue of the Printhead Solutions segment recovered to levels in line with the third quarter of 2021 after having experienced a severe downturn in H1 due to the global shortage of electronic components. Group revenue for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year despite experiencing more challenging business conditions than a year ago.“The third quarter results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69 000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of €3.3 million which closed in July. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as “Other Income” and is not included in our revenue figures  but it is accretive to EBITDA.“Group EBITDA was significantly up in Q3 thanks to better operational performance across the board and the sale of the IPv4 internet addresses. EBITDA for the quarter was €4.58 million compared to €1.61 million for Q3 2021. Credit is due to the entire team for rising to the challenge of these difficult business conditions  and our smaller businesses which focus on colour management  3-D visualisation  and legacy printing devices deserve special mention for outperforming their revenue and cost targets.“Although business conditions remain challenging  with rising inflation and the war in Ukraine causing uncertainty for our customers  we have delivered profitable growth throughout the difficult climate of the pandemic  and we expect to continue this in the future”.Financial highlights for the nine months ended 30 September 2022The following information is unaudited.For the quarter ended 30 September 2022Revenue for the period was €11.29 million (2021: €10.09 million)EBITDA for the period was €4.58 million  or 41% of revenue (2021: €1.61 million  16% of revenue)Story continuesFor the nine months ended 30 September 2022Revenue for the period was €34.73 million (2021: €33.87 million)EBITDA for the period was €9.20 million  or 26% of revenue (2021: €7.42 million  22% of revenue)Segment analysisThe following tables provide unaudited information about revenue from external customers and EBITDA for the Group's operating segments for the current and previous financial years.

By enhancing our portfolio of solutions and accelerating our technology investments  we continue to increase the efficiency of our digital platform  providing our clients with best-in-class experiences increasingly tailored to their needs. Our solutions  which are synonymous with higher purchasing power for employees and greater efficiency for fleet managers  are even more relevant in today’s inflationary environment. In these circumstances  our powerful go-to-market enables us to speed up our market penetration  notably in the SME segment. We are confident as the year draws to an end and are upgrading our EBITDA outlook. We will present our strategic plan and prospects for the coming three years next week.”Turkey is now qualified as a hyperinflationary economy. The Group has therefore applied IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies to its operations in this country since January 1  2022.THIRD-QUARTER AND NINE-MONTH 2022 TOTAL REVENUEStory continues(in € millions) Third-quarter 2022 Third-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 484 393 +23.0% +19.1% Other revenue 23 11 +100.1% +99.7% Total revenue 506 405 +25.2% +21.4%(in € millions) First nine months 2022 First nine months 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 1 375 1 130 +21.7% +17.9% Other revenue 53 32 +67.3% +65.4% Total revenue 1 428 1 162 +22.9% +19.2%Total revenueFor the third quarter of 2022  total revenue amounted to €506 million  up 25.2% as reported compared with third-quarter 2021. This year-on-year increase includes a favorable currency effect (+3.8%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.1%). On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 21.4%.For the first nine months of the year  total revenue came to €1 428 million  up 22.9% as reported and up 19.2% like-for-like compared with the same period in 2021. Reported growth includes a favorable currency effect (+4.0%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.3%).Operating revenueOperating revenue increased by 23.0% as reported to €484 million in the third quarter of 2022. The currency effect was a favorable 4.1% and the scope effect was a negative 0.2%. On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue rose by 19.1% year-on-year.Following on from the results achieved in the first half of the year  Edenred delivered double-digit like-for-like operating revenue growth in the third quarter in each of its business lines and in each of the regions where the Group operates. This solid performance reflects the dynamism of Edenred’s sales teams as well as the Group’s ability to continuously enhance its portfolio and offer its clients innovative and attractive digital solutions.Operating revenue for the first nine months of 2022 was up by 21.7% as reported and by 17.9% like-for-like compared with the same period in 2021  including a positive currency effect (+4.1%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.4%).Operating revenue by business line(in € millions) Third-quarter 2022 Third-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 275 233 +17.7% +15.5% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 143 110 +30.6% +23.6% Complementary Solutions 65 50 +31.3% +26.4% Total 484 393 +23.0% +19.1%(in € millions) First nine months 2022 First nine months 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 802 682 +17.7% +15.6% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 395 300 +31.7% +23.9% Complementary Solutions 177 148 +19.6% +16.5% Total 1 375 1 130 +21.7% +17.9%Operating revenue for the Employee Benefits business line  which accounts for 57% of the Group’s total operating revenue  was €275 million in third-quarter 2022  a 17.7% year-on-year increase as reported (+15.5% like-for-like).This growth is in line with the Group’s first-half performance and confirms the strong sales momentum gained by Ticket Restaurant® meal benefits  notably among SMEs. It also reflects the progressive impact of clients’ greater use of higher face values to protect their employees’ purchasing power  particularly in countries where the maximum face value by law has been raised. Lastly  Beyond Food solutions  notably designed for companies seeking to enhance their employer brand and boost employee engagement  met with strong commercial success. These solutions are all the more relevant amid today’s structural changes in the workplace and rising inflation.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  operating revenue for Employee Benefits came to €802 million  up 17.7% as reported (+15.6% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which represents 30% of the Group’s total operating revenue  operating revenue for third-quarter 2022 amounted to €143 million  up 30.6% year-on-year as reported (+23.6% like-for-like).This strong growth reflects the continued rollout of the Beyond Fuel strategy  notably through the maintenance and toll offering  which is proving highly successful in both Latin America and in Europe. The business also enjoyed strong sales momentum once again  driven by the relevance of its digital  multi-product offering for fleet managers.For the nine months to September 30  operating revenue for Fleet & Mobility Solutions totaled €395 million  up 31.7% as reported (+23.9% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.The Complementary Solutions business line  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of €65 million in third-quarter 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This figure was up 31.3% as reported (+26.4% like-for-like) compared with the third quarter of 2021.Corporate Payment Services in North America  operated through Edenred CSI  delivered a solid performance  driven by new contract wins  particularly in segments into which the company has recently expanded such as property management and energy  as well as by the ramp-up of its commercial partnerships with several banks and software companies  including Sage. The strong growth in Complementary Solutions also reflects the success of the Group’s innovative programs  such as the fully digital Benefit Xpress offering in Taiwan and the new value-added services accessible via the C3Pay mobile app in the United Arab Emirates (salary advances  for example).In the first nine months of the year  operating revenue for Complementary Solutions came to €177 million  up 19.6% as reported (+16.5% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.Operating revenue by region(in € millions) Third-quarter 2022 Third-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 283 241 +17.5% +17.6% Latin America 161 120 +34.6% +19.9% Rest of the World 40 33 +21.1% +27.7% Total 484 393 +23.0% +19.1%(in € millions) First nine months 2022 First nine months 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 834 716 +16.5% +16.3% Latin America 432 324 +33.3% +18.0% Rest of the World 109 90 +20.7% +30.0% Total 1 375 1 130 +21.7% +17.9%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to €283 million in the third quarter  a year-on-year increase of 17.5% as reported (+17.6% like-for-like). Europe represented 59% of total consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.In the nine months to September 30  2022  operating revenue in the region totaled €834 million up 16.5% as reported (+16.3% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.In France  operating revenue came to €71 million for the third quarter  up 8.7% both as reported and like-for-like. This growth reflects the success of the Employee Benefits and Fleet & Mobility Solutions businesses  notably in the SME segment  which remains largely underpenetrated. In particular  it is the result of a very good sales performance by the digital Ticket Restaurant® solution. This performance was also partially offset by the impact of the daily spending cap being lowered back to its pre-Covid level of €19 as from July 1  2022 (versus €38 since June 12  2020) and by an unfavorable basis of comparison with third-quarter 2021  when users spent funds they had accumulated while restaurants and certain retailers were shut. Lastly  solutions rolled out under the Beyond Food strategy  including the ProwebCE employee engagement platform and the remote working platform  continued to deliver robust growth  benefiting from continuous  innovation-driven improvements to the user experience.Operating revenue for France in the first nine months of the year amounted to €220 million  up 10.4% as reported and like-for-like compared with the first nine months of 2021.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled €212 million in third-quarter 2022  an increase of 20.8% as reported and like-for-like versus the prior-year period. Employee Benefits enjoyed strong momentum across the region. Ticket Restaurant® meal benefits once again delivered robust growth  boosted by an increase in face values introduced by clients in the current inflationary context  and the Beyond Food strategy continued to be a success. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  further solid growth in the third quarter was driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy and good sales momentum in the SME segment.For the first nine months of 2022  operating revenue for Europe excluding France came to €613 million  up 18.8% year-on-year as reported (+18.6% like-for-like).Operating revenue in Latin America came to €161 million for the third quarter  a rise of 34.6% as reported (+19.9% like-for-like) compared with the third quarter of 2021. Latin America represented 33% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  operating revenue came to €432 million  up 33.3% as reported (+18.0% like-for-like).In Brazil  operating revenue rose by 16.2% like-for-like in third-quarter 2022 versus third-quarter 2021. Fleet & Mobility Solutions continued to be driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel offering in maintenance and toll services. Employee Benefits delivered a good sales performance thanks to the continued penetration of the SME segment  supported notably by the growing contribution of the partnership with Itaú Unibanco and the success of the virtual canteen solution.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Brazil grew by 16.8% like-for-like.In Hispanic Latin America  third-quarter 2022 operating revenue was up 27.9% like-for-like versus the same period in 2021. This robust performance reflects a sharp acceleration in the Employee Benefits business  as well as further strong growth in Fleet & Mobility Solutions.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Hispanic Latin America rose by 20.6% like-for-like.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue came to €40 million for the third quarter  up 21.1% as reported (+27.7% like-for-like). This region represents 8% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.This performance was notably driven by the success of innovative programs proposed in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. In North America  Edenred CSI’s Corporate Payment Services continued to build on the strong momentum seen in the second quarter  thanks in particular to the ramp-up of its commercial partnerships with several banks and software companies.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in the Rest of the World totaled €109 million  up 20.7% as reported (+30.0% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.Other revenueOther revenue for the third quarter of 2022 totaled €23 million  up 100.1% as reported (+99.7% like-for-like). This significant increase reflects the impact of strong business growth on the float2  as well as favorable changes in interest rates in all regions where the Group operates. The gradual acceleration in other revenue growth period after period can be attributed to the steady rise in interest rates observed for several quarters now in Europe (outside the euro zone) and Latin America  as well as to the first effects of interest rate increases in the euro zone. For the nine months ended September 30  2022  other revenue came to €53 million  representing an increase of 67.3% as reported (+65.4% like-for-like).OUTLOOKAfter achieving record results in the first half  Edenred confirmed its very good business momentum in the third quarter.Thanks to its segmented sales approach  Edenred continues to penetrate its core markets  with the economic environment further enhancing the attractiveness of its solutions  which notably enable employers to effectively boost their employees’ purchasing power.Edenred is also unlocking new growth opportunities by expanding its portfolio of solutions to more fully meet clients’ needs. In Employee Benefits  Beyond Food solutions enable companies to enhance their employer brand and boost employee engagement in a fast-changing working world. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  the Beyond Fuel offering (including maintenance and toll management and VAT refund solutions) helps fleet managers control their expenses. And in Complementary Solutions  the Beyond Payment strategy to enhance the value proposition  as illustrated by the acquisition of IPS  a leading invoice automation vendor  is moving Edenred CSI up the accounts payable value chain.Lastly  Edenred is accelerating its investments in product and technology innovation to seize opportunities arising from secular trends  such as remote working as a permanent feature in the workplace  green commuting  the consumption of eco-friendly products and the transition of fleets to electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.Thanks to its ability to leverage the increasing scale effect of its platform  in an environment where its solutions are increasingly attractive and amid favorable economic conditions  the Group is upgrading its 2022 EBITDA outlook to between €810 million and €840 million3 (compared with a target range of between €770 million and €820 million euros announced on July 26  2022).SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTEREdenred joins the Euronext CAC 40 ESG® indexOn September 19  2022  the Group joined the Paris stock exchange’s Euronext CAC 40 ESG index  taking its place alongside other companies demonstrating outstanding environmental  social and governance (ESG) practices.SUBSEQUENT EVENTSEdenred expands its Corporate Payment invoice automation capabilities in the US  with the acquisition of IPSOn October 17  2022  Edenred announced the acquisition of IPS  a leading invoice automation vendor  through its corporate payment subsidiary Edenred CSI.This acquisition enhances Edenred CSI’s value proposition by expanding along the procure-to-pay value chain and integrating a turnkey invoice automation solution into its digital platform.

Consequently  the extraordinary resolutions have been debated as listed in the meeting notice published in the French official legal bulletin Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires (BALO) No. 109  dated September 12  2022.The voting rights attached to the shares of the defaulting shareholders represented by the ad hoc representative were exercised at a rate of two thirds votes in favor and one third against  pursuant to the terms of the mission entrusted to the ad hoc representative by order of the President of the Commercial Court of Montpellier dated September 27  2022.All the documents regarding this AGE  including the results of the votes  are available on the Company’s website: https://www.deinove.com/en/investor-room/documentation-center/general-shareholders-meeting-preparatory-documentsABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Delphine LENS+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 11 07 14 08communication@deinove.comAttachment,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.15,0.61,True,English,"['Shareholders’ Extraordinary General Meeting', 'DEINOVE', 'Adoption', 'resolutions', 'October', 'French official legal bulletin Bulletin', 'Annonces Légales Obligatoires', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'Mr. Vincent AUSSEL', 'ad hoc representative', 'mandataire ad hoc', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'urgent, global challenge', 'Extraordinary General Meeting', 'two thirds votes', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'English French', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'EURONEXT GROWTH®', 'antibiotic resistance', 'meeting notice', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'The Company', 'share capital', 'Commercial Court', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'Delphine LENS', 'extraordinary resolutions', 'voting rights', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'defaulting shareholders', '11 resolutions', 'DEINOVE', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'AGE', 'October', 'recommendations', 'Board', 'Directors', '2,657,573 shares', '69,708,449 shares', 'appointment', 'capacity', 'order', 'President', 'Montpellier', 'mission', 'behalf', '67,050,876 shares', 'quorum', 'representation', 'BALO', 'No.', 'favor', 'terms', 'documents', 'results', 'website', 'investor-room', 'general-shareholders', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', 'ISIN', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Investors', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment']",2022-10-20,2022-10-20,globenewswire.com

As of September 30  2022  the Group’s sales totalled €569.2 million  up +5.2% from the same period in 2021 (€541.0 million). The activity includes a very favourable forex effect of €23.9 million  stemming in large part from the appreciation of the dollar. At constant exchange rates (CER)  9-month revenue increased by +0.8%.After a slight increase in Q1 (+0.5%)  followed by a decrease in Q2 (-3.1%) due to a high basis of comparison  Q3 activity was very dynamic. Revenue reached €187 million  up +5.1% at CER and +11.4% at current exchange rate.Geographical distribution of consolidated group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at September 30  2022 Change (%)9 months 2022at current exchange ratesChange (%)9 months 2022at constant exchange rates19 months 2021Sales in EMEA -1.8% 245.2 -1.3% 246.5 249.7 Sales in Americas +9.7% 182.5 -2.1% 162.9 166.4 Sales in Asia +13.3% 141.4 +8.8% 135.9 124.9 Total +5.2% 569.2 +0.8% 545.3 541.0[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.In the EMEA region  the Group’s activity decreased slightly in the first 9 months (-1.3% at CER). Its Q3 activity (+1.5% at CER) benefited from both an increase in volumes and more stable prices after several quarters of erosion.Story continuesIn the Americas region  sales in the first 9 months increased by 9.7% thanks to a very positive forex effect of €19.6 million over the entire period. At CER  activity was down 2.1% in a context marked by slower activity at the industrial plant in Raleigh (North Carolina) due to recruitment difficulties. However  the improvement of the situation has been concreting since this summer and contributed to the revenue increase in the Americas over Q3 (+0.9% at CER).In Asia  sales growth over the first 9 months reached 13.3% at current exchange rates and 8.8% at CER. It accelerated greatly in Q3 (+18.4% at CER) thanks to a positive trend in activity throughout the region and especially in China (+66.8% at CER)  where sales have fully benefited from the effective implementation of direct distribution since Q2 2022.Distribution of consolidated group revenue by activity (IFRS)In millions of euros at June 30  2022 Change (%)9 months 22at current exchange ratesChange (%)9 months 22at constant exchange rates19 months 2022Diagnostic Imaging +4.9% 502.2 +0.5% 481.5 478.9 MRI +9.6% 192.4 +5.3% 184.8 175.5 X-Ray +2.1% 309.8 -2.2% 296.7 303.4 Interventional Imaging +7.9% 67.0 +2.8% 63.9 62.1 Total +5.2% 569.2 +0.8% 545.3 541.0[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.Revenue from Diagnostic Imaging increased by 0.5% at CER over the first 9 months  with a Q3 up 4.3% compared with the same period in 2021.In MRI   sales over the first 9 months increased by 9.6% at current exchange rates and 5.3% at CER. The acceleration was noticeable in Q3  with an increase of 17.3% at CER and both volumes and prices on the rise.X-Ray revenue at CER decreased by 2.2% at 9 months and 3.1% in Q3 in the wake of the decrease in Optiray® sales  while Xenetix® sales remained very steady.In Interventional Imaging  sales at CER increased by 2.8% over the first 9 months thanks to an excellent Q3 marked by 12% growth at CER and remarkable performance for Lipiodol (+15.3%).Adjustment of the 2022 financial targets incorporating necessary measures to accelerate EluciremTM productionOn the one hand  since the beginning of the summer  the Group has seen a significant improvement in production rates at its Raleigh plant  where the implemented measures (new organisation  increased attractiveness) have led to a significant decrease in employee turnover and an upturn in recruitment. However  this improvement has not been as fast as expected.On the other hand  Guerbet is preparing for the commercial launch of EluciremTM. The new contrast agent obtained the FDA’s marketing authorisation (MA) on September 21. Since then  it has been very well received by the scientific community and has aroused strong buyer interest. To promote a rapid commercial takeoff  the production chains are being adapted at the Raleigh plant to prioritize the production of EluciremTM.Against this backdrop  the Group expects 2022 revenue growth to be less than 2% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates compared with a previously announced range of 2% to 4%. In terms of profitability  Guerbet is now targeting an EBITDA/Revenue ratio between 13% and 14%  excluding extraordinary costs from optimizing the Group’s operating structure and changing the sales model in China (compared with 14.4% previously announced corresponding to the ratio over the 2021 fiscal year).Upcoming events:Publication of 2022 full-year revenueFebruary 9  2023  after trading1 Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Full login details and presentation materials are available at: https://www.voltalia.com/investor-relations""The growth of renewable energy is accelerating. A key element in the fight against global warming  renewable energy has also become the cheapest energy ever produced in history  while meeting the energy security challenges of countries and companies.By creating new renewable power plants on its own behalf and for its customers  while reducing their energy consumption through its subsidiary Helexia  Voltalia is helping to meet the challenge of the energy transition.After achieving an average annual growth in revenues of 46% between 2014  the date of its IPO  and 2021  Voltalia has set itself a new roadmap. While we anticipate that the 2023 capacity target will be reached a year early and confirm the EBITDA target of €275-300 million in 2023  Voltalia is now targeting operating and construction capacity in excess of 5 gigawatts and a normalised EBITDA of around €475 million¹ by 2027. In addition  in line with its status as a company with a mission  Voltalia has set a new environmental objective for 2027: over 4 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent avoided”  commented Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.An extraordinary sectorNumerous structural and economic factors are sustaining the renewable energy sector:Public policies and private initiatives against global warming ;; Intensification of government measures to promote energy independence ;; Trend towards lower costs for renewable energy in a context of rising costs for other energy sources;in a context of rising costs for other energy sources; Willingness of companies to reduce their exposure to the volatility of energy prices in the long term and to lower their energy bills;of energy prices in the long term and to their energy bills; Rise in the electrification of uses with  for example  the emergence of electric vehicles and the gradual switch to electric heating.However  the sector's growth cycle is still in its infancy  and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix should continue to accelerate over the next few years.On the three continents where Voltalia is present:In Europe   which is already committed to the fight against global warming   the war in Ukraine has made energy independence a central priority of government policies. A sudden and sustained acceleration in renewable energy and energy efficiency is taking shape: Europe is once again becoming one of the key global markets;  which is already committed to the   the war in Ukraine has made a central priority of government policies.

South Africa  in particular  is going through a major energy crisis. The growth in demand is combined with the country's need to replace ageing coal-fired power plants that are no longer adapted to the needs of the population; In Latin America  population growth is creating structural demand for energy consumption. In addition  Brazil's extremely favourable wind patterns  coupled with good sunshine  will gradually attract electro-intensive industries.A clear mission  a successful business modelVoltalia has been aware of the challenges facing its sector since its creation in 2005. As a responsible player  Voltalia formally defined its mission in 2014  before officially integrating it in its articles of association in 20202. Within this legal framework  Voltalia defines the extra-financial indicators of its mission. These are audited and presented annually to the general meeting  alongside the financial report. Voltalia’s mission seeks a fair balance between the planet and its inhabitants: improving the global environment while promoting local development. Every day  it guides the actions and decisions of everyone within Voltalia and its governance.Voltalia  directly or through its subsidiaries  implements the energy transition technologies that create the best opportunities:Electricity production: ground-mounted photovoltaic   roof-mounted and car park  onshore wind power   small-scale hydroelectricity and biomass (power plants burning recovered wood);  roof-mounted and car park  onshore   small-scale and (power plants burning recovered wood); Battery storage and potentially other technologies;storage and potentially other technologies; Energy efficiency and energy management.Voltalia has deployed a business model that combines the business of a renewable energy producer through its own power plants with that of service provider to third-party customers. Voltalia's employees who  on behalf of customers  create energy production or savings projects from scratch during the development and construction phases  and then operate and maintain them. This model for itself and third-party customers has the most significant impact on its mission while creating the most financial value.As the services business is not very capital intensive  electricity production and storage account for the vast majority of Voltalia's capital. In this business  Voltalia relies on very long-term electricity sales contracts (generally 20 years) which are designed to ensure the repayment of project financing and to secure equity investments. The contractual sales prices are mostly (83% in 2021) indexed to inflation.A strong growth trajectory since its IPO on EuronextSince its IPO  Voltalia has posted an average annual growth (CAGR) of +46% in revenues and +41% in EBITDA between 2014 and 2021. Over the period  the capacity in operation and under construction has increased more than fourfold  from 365 MW to 1.7 GW in 2021. Voltalia also announced on the occasion of the publication of its half-yearly results for 2022 that its target of 2.6 GW of capacity in operation and under construction  which it planned to achieve by the end of 2023  would finally be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule.This growth trajectory  essentially organic  has benefited from targeted acquisitions which have accelerated the strategy  in particular that of Helexia which offers its client companies  in parallel with Voltalia's corporate PPA offer  on-site solar production ( roofs and car park shades) and investments to reduce their energy consumption.New growth ambitions for 2027On 28 September  during the publication of its half-year results for 2022  Voltalia indicated that it believed that it would be able to achieve its 2023 target of 2.6 gigawatts of capacity in operation and under construction one year ahead of schedule and that it was confirming its two other 2023 targets: a normalised EBITDA of €275 to €300 million and a share of Brazil in capacity in operation and under construction below 50%.In this context  Voltalia has defined a new growth plan for 2027  including the following objectives:Operating and construction capacity owned by Voltalia: over 5 gigawatts by the end of 2027;by the end of 2027; Capacity operated on behalf of third parties: over 8 gigawatts by the end of 2027;by the end of 2027; Normalised EBITDA 3 : around €475 million in 2027;: around in 2027; CO2-equivalent avoided: over 4 million tonnes in 2027.Voltalia will examine the best options for financing its CAPEX of between an estimated €2.5 and €3 billion to support its new ambitions by 2027. In addition to the usual project financing and its significant cash flow  the group reserves the right to raise corporate financing  to selectively sell minority shares to partners in some of its projects or to arrange equity financing  depending on market conditions and  where appropriate  involving all of its existing shareholders  including its main shareholder  the Mulliez family.Solid assets to achieve its ambitionsVoltalia will be able to draw on a number of strengths to achieve this ambitious growth plan up to 2027  including:A portfolio of projects under development at a record level of 13.6 GW  of which 986 MW have won a PPA and 1.8 GW are ready to tender for a PPA;at a record level of 13.6 GW  of which 986 MW have won a PPA and 1.8 GW are ready to tender for a PPA; The gain  since January 2022  of new long-term electricity sales contracts for 640 MW;for 640 MW; A volume of projects in the early stages of development (which meet one  two or three of the four criteria required to enter the development portfolio 4 ) of 22.1 GW;(which meet one  two or three of the four criteria required to enter the development portfolio ) of 22.1 GW; Ability to sell and implement the full range of products offered to businesses : corporate wind and solar PPAs  photovoltaic roofs and shades and energy efficiency;: corporate wind and solar PPAs  photovoltaic roofs and shades and energy efficiency; Expertise in Development  Construction and Supply of equipment and Operation-Maintenance services to third party clients;to third party clients; Expertise in the key technologies of the energy transition  in particular those currently experiencing strong growth: photovoltaics  storage and energy efficiency;of the energy transition  in particular those currently experiencing strong growth: photovoltaics  storage and energy efficiency; A geographical positioning focused on countries where the sector's growth potential is among the highest in the world;positioning focused on countries where the sector's growth potential is among the highest in the world; The ability to make acquisitions   integrate them and then rapidly develop the acquired entities;  integrate them and then rapidly develop the acquired entities; A track record of strong growth management with revenue and EBITDA growing at CAGR since the IPO on the Euronext regulated market in 2014  of 46% and 41% respectively over the period 2014-2021.DisclaimerThis press release and the information contained herein do not constitute either an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase the securities of Voltalia.The release  publication or distribution of this press release may be restricted in certain countries by applicable laws and regulations.

Revenue of the Printhead Solutions segment recovered to levels in line with the third quarter of 2021 after having experienced a severe downturn in H1 due to the global shortage of electronic components. Group revenue for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year despite experiencing more challenging business conditions than a year ago.“The third quarter results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69 000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of €3.3 million which closed in July. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as “Other Income” and is not included in our revenue figures  but it is accretive to EBITDA.“Group EBITDA was significantly up in Q3 thanks to better operational performance across the board and the sale of the IPv4 internet addresses. EBITDA for the quarter was €4.58 million compared to €1.61 million for Q3 2021. Credit is due to the entire team for rising to the challenge of these difficult business conditions  and our smaller businesses which focus on colour management  3-D visualisation  and legacy printing devices deserve special mention for outperforming their revenue and cost targets.“Although business conditions remain challenging  with rising inflation and the war in Ukraine causing uncertainty for our customers  we have delivered profitable growth throughout the difficult climate of the pandemic  and we expect to continue this in the future”.Financial highlights for the nine months ended 30 September 2022The following information is unaudited.For the quarter ended 30 September 2022Revenue for the period was €11.29 million (2021: €10.09 million)EBITDA for the period was €4.58 million  or 41% of revenue (2021: €1.61 million  16% of revenue)For the nine months ended 30 September 2022Revenue for the period was €34.73 million (2021: €33.87 million)EBITDA for the period was €9.20 million  or 26% of revenue (2021: €7.42 million  22% of revenue)Segment analysisThe following tables provide unaudited information about revenue from external customers and EBITDA for the Group's operating segments for the current and previous financial years.

This result was supported by the Fulfilment by Cdiscount and Cdiscount Express Seller marketplace GMV share reaching a record high level of 52% in the 3rd quarter  increasing by +7pts vs. 2021  and dedicated co-financed promotions from top sellers.Advertising services revenues reached €17m in the 3rd quarter of 2022 now representing nearly 2.6% of Product GMV  an increase of +0.5pt vs. 2021  driven by Cnova’s in-house bidding platform: Cdiscount Ads Retail Solution (“CARS”) revenues increased by +22% in the 3rd quarter compared to 2021.B2B investments began to yield positive results with Octopia Marketplace and Mechants-as-a-Service solutions gaining traction and now accumulating 25 clients of which 9 are already live  proving the quality and competitiveness of its all-in-one solution.Last quarter  Cnova announced the implementation of an Efficiency Plan aiming at swiftly recalibrating its cost structure & capex level to the current volume of activity. The plan triggered €75m of projected savings on a full-year basis by the end of 2023  at the end of the 3rd quarter  the execution is on-track to deliver the expected savings of €30m in the 2nd half of the year.Emmanuel Grenier  Cnova’s CEO  commented:“In the 3rd quarter of 2022  while facing continuous adverse market conditions  Cnova’s priority was to successfully deliver its Efficiency Plan  which is on-track with targets  and to keep investing in its core strategic pillars: marketplace share has increased tremendously and reached a record high  advertising services are fast increasing their penetration in GMV. Octopia is dynamic and developing well.”Third Quarter 202 2 Key FiguresCnova N.V.Third Quarter2 Change 2022 2021 Reported L-f-L3 Key operational metrics Traffic (million visits) 228.3 247.4 -7.7% Orders4 (million) 5.3 6.4 -16.8% o/w Marketplace 4.0 4.2 -4.3% Items sold (million) 8.7 11.0 -21.5% o/w Marketplace 6.0 6.1 -1.5% Key financial figures (€m) Total GMV 778.8 1 006.4 -22.6% -15.3% Ecommerce platformo/w Direct sales755.2 984.1 -23.3% -15.8% 305.0 450.7 -32.3% o/w Marketplace 332.4 342.2 -2.9% Marketplace share5 52.2% 43.2% +9.0pts o/w Advertising services 19.8 19.8 -0.2% o/w Services 33.7 75.2 -55.2% +36.5% o/w Other revenues 64.4 96.2 -33.1% +8.1% B2B activities 23.6 22.3 +5.9% o/w Octopia 22.4 22.1 +1.1% o/w C-logistics6 1.3 0.2 x6.9 Total Net Sales 378.8 525.6 -27.9% -23.4%Third Quarter 202 2 HighlightsGMV 3Q22 Total like-for-like2 growth -15.3% Marketplace growth -2.9% Travel growth +37.9% Octopia growth +1.1%GMV posted a resilient -15.3% like-for-like decrease in the 3rd quarter 2022 compared to a high comparison base. This year-on-year change was driven by:Direct Sales contributing -14.5pts (-32.3% y-o-y)  as a result of the on-going voluntary strategic shift to marketplace   mostly for low contribution margin non-technical goods   but preserving and still benefiting from strengthened relationships with top international brands.Marketplace contributing -1.0pt (-2.9% y-o-y) while delivering +9pts in GMV share.

(the “Company"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30  2022.Key Highlights Q3-22Revenue of € 168.8 million declined 21.1% vs. Q2-22 due to lower shipments for mobile applications reflecting seasonal influences and softer market conditions for computing applications. Down 19.0% vs. Q3-21 due to lower demand by Chinese subcontractors and reduced sales for high-end mobile applications. Partially offset by increased automotive and hybrid bonding shipmentsOrders of € 125.3 million decreased 18.2% vs. Q2-22 due principally to weaker demand for high-performance computing applications from IDMs and Asian subcontractors.

Q3-21  down 40.1% primarily due to broad-based market decline  particularly in computing applicationsGross margin of 62.3% rose 1.3 points vs. Q2-22 and 1.9 points vs. Q3-21 principally due to more favorable product mix and beneficial forex influences from increase of USD vs. euroNet income of € 57.3 million decreased 24.2% vs. Q2-22 and 31.9% vs. Q3-21 principally as result of lower revenue and increased R&D spending for wafer level applicationsBesi’s net margin reached 34.0% vs. the 35.4% achieved in Q2-22 despite a 21.1% sequential revenue decrease. Vs. Q3-21  net margin declined by 6.4 pointsKey Highlights YTD -22Revenue of € 585.1 million rose 1.3% vs. YTD-21 reflecting strong demand for high performance computing  automotive and hybrid bonding applications. Partially offset by significant decline in high-end mobile applications post 2021 capacity build and reduced demand by Chinese subcontractorsOrders of € 483.3 million declined 34.4% reflecting broad-based softening of market conditions  and decreased demand for high-end mobile applications and from Chinese subcontractorsGross margin rose 0.6 points to reach 61.1% primarily due to favorable forex influences and Besi’s timely adjustment of production and overhead levels to changing market conditionsNet income of € 200.5 million down 6.9% due primarily to higher R&D spending and forex hedging costs.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported Q3-22 results which were at the favorable end of guidance but reflected the impact of a new industry downturn. For the quarter  revenue  orders and net income of € 168.8 million  € 125.3 million and € 57.3 million decreased by 21.1%  18.2% and 24.2%  respectively  versus Q2-22. Adverse revenue and order development this quarter reflected typical seasonal weakness for mobile applications but also more general weakness in high-end server  data center and general computing applications. Such weakness was partially offset by continued strength in automotive and industrial end-user markets and ongoing shipments of hybrid bonding equipment to customers. Similarly  Besi’s backlog of € 240.6 million at the end of Q3 declined by 12.6% versus Q2-22 but remained at higher than typical levels.Despite a challenging market environment  we maintained profit efficiency at high levels with gross margins of 62.3% exceeding guidance and a net margin of 34.0%. We re-aligned Besi’s production model rapidly in response to changing market conditions. As a result  total headcount has declined by 12.7% and temporary Asian production headcount by 65.2% since the end of Q1-22. We will continue to adjust overhead levels as necessary in accordance with market developments.For the first nine months  Besi reported revenue of € 585.1 million which increased by 1.3% and net income which decreased by 6.9% versus the comparable period of 2021. Growth was favorably influenced by increased demand for Besi’s computing  automotive and hybrid bonding end-user markets. Such strength was partially offset by reduced demand for high-end smartphones following a large capacity build in 2021. It also reflected a 37.6% revenue decrease from Chinese customers primarily associated with overcapacity  slower economic growth and Covid-19 related lockdowns. Orders of € 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% as industry conditions materially weakened post the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. The € 14.8 million decrease in Besi’s net income between the comparable periods principally resulted from a 49.0% increase in development spending as we increased investment in future areas of growth for the next market upcycle.Our liquidity position continues to build with strong cash flow generation of € 185.2 million during the first nine months of 2022 which supports Besi’s capital allocation policy. We ended the quarter with cash and deposits of € 661.8 million and net cash of € 342.5 million that represented increases of 12.1% and 19.0%  respectively  versus September 30  2021. Liquidity has improved this year despite the distribution of € 351.3 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed our prior € 185 million share repurchase program in July and began purchases under our new € 300 million program in August. During the quarter  we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares for an aggregate amount of € 45.5 million.Strategically  we are accelerating investment in Besi’s future despite near term headwinds  particularly for our hybrid bonding and wafer level assembly portfolio  as the long-term drivers of our business remain intact and sub 10 nanometer device innovation continues apace. We see continued interest in hybrid bonding applications as the natural extension of Moore’s law to drive technology gains in new heterogeneous 3D architectures for next generation logic  memory  mobile  automotive and data center applications. Besi received orders subsequent to quarter end both for incremental hybrid bonding capacity and for systems incorporated in hybrid bonding integrated lines. Additional orders are anticipated in Q4-22.The outlook for the assembly equipment market has turned more negative during the quarter as industry conditions weakened  global GDP growth rates decelerated and customer caution increased. At present  it appears to be a traditional industry downturn marked by overcapacity and order pushouts by customers. Downcycles are typically the periods in which Besi looks to improve its business model and plans investment in those products and technologies which will drive revenue growth in the next upcycle. The announcement of new restrictions recently by the US on sales of WFE and assembly equipment to China has added more uncertainty to the industry outlook. We are currently evaluating the proposed restrictions to better understand whether any of Besi’s <10 micron accuracy systems could be subject to such provisions.For Q4-22  we estimate that revenue will decrease by 15-25% versus Q3-22 reflecting uncertain market conditions and seasonal trends. However  Besi’s gross margin is expected to remain in the 60-62% range due to the flexibility of our production model and anticipated product mix. Further  operating expenses are anticipated to increase by approximately 5% versus Q3-22 principally due to higher R&D spending.”Third Quarter Results of Operations€ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Δ Q3-2021 Δ Revenue 168.8 214.0 -21.1% 208.3 -19.0% Orders 125.3 153.1 -18.2% 209.2 -40.1% Book to Bill Ratio 0.7x 0.7x - 1.0x -0.3Q3-22 revenue of € 168.8 million decreased 21.1% versus Q2-22 due to lower shipments for high-end mobile applications reflecting seasonal influences and lower revenue for high performance computing applications given softer market conditions in data center and mainstream computing end-user markets. Revenue for the quarter was at the favorable end of guidance. Versus Q3-21  revenue decreased by 19.0% as a result of significantly lower demand by Chinese subcontractors for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications and  to a lesser extent  to lower demand for high-end smartphones post new product introductions last year. Such weakness was partially offset by revenue growth for high performance computing  hybrid bonding applications and automotive applications.Orders of € 125.3 million decreased 18.2% versus Q2-22 due primarily to lower demand for computing applications by IDMs and Taiwanese subcontractors and softening market conditions. Order weakness was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-user markets both from European IDMs and Asian subcontractors. Versus Q3-21  orders decreased by 40.1% primarily due to a broad-based market decline which started in Q2-22 with particular weakness in high performance computing applications and lower order levels by Chinese subcontractors. Per customer type  IDM orders decreased € 6.1 million  or 7.0%  versus Q2-22 and represented 64% of total orders for the period. Subcontractor orders decreased by € 21.7 million  or 32.7%  versus Q2-22 and represented 36% of total orders.€ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Δ Q3-2021 Δ Gross Margin 62.3% 61.0% +1.3 60.4% +1.9 Operating Expenses 34.0 37.9 -10.3% 30.4 +11.8% Financial Expense/(Income)  net 5.5 5.8 -5.2% 3.4 +61.8% EBITDA 77.1 98.0 -21.3% 99.7 -22.7%Besi’s gross margin rose to 62.3% in Q3-22  an increase of 1.3 points and 1.9 points versus Q2-22 and Q3-21  respectively. It was also above prior guidance (60-62%). The improvement was primarily due to a more favorable product mix and forex benefits from an increase in the value of the USD versus the euro.Q3-22 operating expenses declined by € 3.9 million  or 10.3%  versus Q2-22 principally as a result of a € 2.7 million reduction in share-based compensation expense and lower variable sales related expenses. Operating expenses increased by € 3.6 million  or 11.8%  versus Q3-21 primarily due to increased R&D spending for the development of next generation wafer level assembly systems. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to 20.2% in Q3-22 versus 17.7% in Q2-22 and 14.6% in Q3-21  primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels.€ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Δ Q3-2021 Δ Net Income 57.3 75.6 -24.2% 84.2 -31.9% Net Margin 34.0% 35.4% -1.4 40.4% -6.4 Tax Rate* 12.8% 12.7% +0.1 8.4% +4.4* Effective tax rate reflects € 3.7 million of deferred tax benefits recognized in Q3-21.

Versus Q3-21  net income decreased by € 26.9 million  or 31.9%  principally as a result of a 19.0% revenue decrease  increased R&D spending and a higher effective tax rate. As a result  Besi’s net margin of 34.0% decreased slightly versus the 35.4% achieved in Q2-22. Versus Q3-21  net margin declined by 6.4 points  primarily due to lower revenue levels and an increase in Besi’s effective tax rate related to the absence of € 3.7 million in deferred tax benefits recognized in the prior year period.Nine Months Results of Operations€ millions YTD-2022 YTD-2021 Δ Revenue 585.1 577.6 +1.3% Orders 483.3 736.5 -34.4% Gross Margin 61.1% 60.5% +0.6 Operating Income 245.4 250.4 -2.0% Operating Margin 41.9% 43.4% -1.5 Net Income 200.5 215.3 -6.9% Net Margin 34.3% 37.3% -3.0 Tax Rate* 13.0% 10.2% +2.8* Effective tax rate reflects € 6.1 million of tax benefits recognized in YTD-21.

Of note  revenue from Chinese customers decreased by € 83.7 million  or 37.6%  year-over-year and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 38.5% in YTD-21 to 23.7% in YTD-22.Orders of € 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% versus YTD-21 due to less favorable market conditions after the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. In particular  decreased demand reflected lower orders for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021  lower orders for high performance computing applications and significantly decreased demand from Chinese subcontractors due to overcapacity  decelerating economic growth and rolling Covid-19 lockdowns. Order weakness in YTD-22 was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-markets  continuing a trend which began in the second half of 2021. IDM and subcontractor orders represented 55% and 45%  respectively  of YTD-22 orders versus 51% and 49%  respectively  in YTD-21.Besi’s net income decreased by € 14.8 million  or 6.9%  versus YTD-21 to reach € 200.5 million primarily due to increased R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems  increased forex hedging costs and the absence of € 6.1 million in deferred tax benefits recognized in the prior year period.Financial Condition€ millionsQ32022 Q22022 Δ Q32021 Δ YTD-2022 YTD-2021Δ Total Cash and Deposits 661.8 601.6 +10.0% 590.5 +12.1% 661.8 590.5 +12.1% Net Cash and Deposits 342.5 284.0 +20.6% 287.8 +19.0% 342.5 287.8 +19.0% Cash flow from Ops. 112.7 27.6 +308.3% 98.6 +14.3% 185.2 176.0 +5.2%At the end of Q3-22  Besi had a strong liquidity position with total cash and deposits aggregating € 661.8 million  an increase of € 60.2 million  or 10.0%  versus Q2-22.

We will present our strategic plan and prospects for the coming three years next week.”Turkey is now qualified as a hyperinflationary economy.

This year-on-year increase includes a favorable currency effect (+3.8%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.1%). On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 21.4%.For the first nine months of the year  total revenue came to €1 428 million  up 22.9% as reported and up 19.2% like-for-like compared with the same period in 2021. Reported growth includes a favorable currency effect (+4.0%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.3%).Operating revenueOperating revenue increased by 23.0% as reported to €484 million in the third quarter of 2022. The currency effect was a favorable 4.1% and the scope effect was a negative 0.2%. On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue rose by 19.1% year-on-year.Following on from the results achieved in the first half of the year  Edenred delivered double-digit like-for-like operating revenue growth in the third quarter in each of its business lines and in each of the regions where the Group operates. This solid performance reflects the dynamism of Edenred’s sales teams as well as the Group’s ability to continuously enhance its portfolio and offer its clients innovative and attractive digital solutions.Operating revenue for the first nine months of 2022 was up by 21.7% as reported and by 17.9% like-for-like compared with the same period in 2021  including a positive currency effect (+4.1%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.4%).Operating revenue by business line(in € millions) Third-quarter 2022 Third-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 275 233 +17.7% +15.5% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 143 110 +30.6% +23.6% Complementary Solutions 65 50 +31.3% +26.4% Total 484 393 +23.0% +19.1%(in € millions) First nine months 2022 First nine months 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 802 682 +17.7% +15.6% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 395 300 +31.7% +23.9% Complementary Solutions 177 148 +19.6% +16.5% Total 1 375 1 130 +21.7% +17.9%Operating revenue for the Employee Benefits business line  which accounts for 57% of the Group’s total operating revenue  was €275 million in third-quarter 2022  a 17.7% year-on-year increase as reported (+15.5% like-for-like).This growth is in line with the Group’s first-half performance and confirms the strong sales momentum gained by Ticket Restaurant® meal benefits  notably among SMEs. It also reflects the progressive impact of clients’ greater use of higher face values to protect their employees’ purchasing power  particularly in countries where the maximum face value by law has been raised. Lastly  Beyond Food solutions  notably designed for companies seeking to enhance their employer brand and boost employee engagement  met with strong commercial success. These solutions are all the more relevant amid today’s structural changes in the workplace and rising inflation.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  operating revenue for Employee Benefits came to €802 million  up 17.7% as reported (+15.6% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which represents 30% of the Group’s total operating revenue  operating revenue for third-quarter 2022 amounted to €143 million  up 30.6% year-on-year as reported (+23.6% like-for-like).This strong growth reflects the continued rollout of the Beyond Fuel strategy  notably through the maintenance and toll offering  which is proving highly successful in both Latin America and in Europe. The business also enjoyed strong sales momentum once again  driven by the relevance of its digital  multi-product offering for fleet managers.For the nine months to September 30  operating revenue for Fleet & Mobility Solutions totaled €395 million  up 31.7% as reported (+23.9% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.The Complementary Solutions business line  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of €65 million in third-quarter 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This figure was up 31.3% as reported (+26.4% like-for-like) compared with the third quarter of 2021.Corporate Payment Services in North America  operated through Edenred CSI  delivered a solid performance  driven by new contract wins  particularly in segments into which the company has recently expanded such as property management and energy  as well as by the ramp-up of its commercial partnerships with several banks and software companies  including Sage. The strong growth in Complementary Solutions also reflects the success of the Group’s innovative programs  such as the fully digital Benefit Xpress offering in Taiwan and the new value-added services accessible via the C3Pay mobile app in the United Arab Emirates (salary advances  for example).In the first nine months of the year  operating revenue for Complementary Solutions came to €177 million  up 19.6% as reported (+16.5% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.Operating revenue by region(in € millions) Third-quarter 2022 Third-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 283 241 +17.5% +17.6% Latin America 161 120 +34.6% +19.9% Rest of the World 40 33 +21.1% +27.7% Total 484 393 +23.0% +19.1%(in € millions) First nine months 2022 First nine months 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 834 716 +16.5% +16.3% Latin America 432 324 +33.3% +18.0% Rest of the World 109 90 +20.7% +30.0% Total 1 375 1 130 +21.7% +17.9%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to €283 million in the third quarter  a year-on-year increase of 17.5% as reported (+17.6% like-for-like). Europe represented 59% of total consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.In the nine months to September 30  2022  operating revenue in the region totaled €834 million up 16.5% as reported (+16.3% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.In France  operating revenue came to €71 million for the third quarter  up 8.7% both as reported and like-for-like. This growth reflects the success of the Employee Benefits and Fleet & Mobility Solutions businesses  notably in the SME segment  which remains largely underpenetrated. In particular  it is the result of a very good sales performance by the digital Ticket Restaurant® solution. This performance was also partially offset by the impact of the daily spending cap being lowered back to its pre-Covid level of €19 as from July 1  2022 (versus €38 since June 12  2020) and by an unfavorable basis of comparison with third-quarter 2021  when users spent funds they had accumulated while restaurants and certain retailers were shut. Lastly  solutions rolled out under the Beyond Food strategy  including the ProwebCE employee engagement platform and the remote working platform  continued to deliver robust growth  benefiting from continuous  innovation-driven improvements to the user experience.Operating revenue for France in the first nine months of the year amounted to €220 million  up 10.4% as reported and like-for-like compared with the first nine months of 2021.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled €212 million in third-quarter 2022  an increase of 20.8% as reported and like-for-like versus the prior-year period. Employee Benefits enjoyed strong momentum across the region. Ticket Restaurant® meal benefits once again delivered robust growth  boosted by an increase in face values introduced by clients in the current inflationary context  and the Beyond Food strategy continued to be a success. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  further solid growth in the third quarter was driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy and good sales momentum in the SME segment.For the first nine months of 2022  operating revenue for Europe excluding France came to €613 million  up 18.8% year-on-year as reported (+18.6% like-for-like).Operating revenue in Latin America came to €161 million for the third quarter  a rise of 34.6% as reported (+19.9% like-for-like) compared with the third quarter of 2021. Latin America represented 33% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  operating revenue came to €432 million  up 33.3% as reported (+18.0% like-for-like).In Brazil  operating revenue rose by 16.2% like-for-like in third-quarter 2022 versus third-quarter 2021. Fleet & Mobility Solutions continued to be driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel offering in maintenance and toll services. Employee Benefits delivered a good sales performance thanks to the continued penetration of the SME segment  supported notably by the growing contribution of the partnership with Itaú Unibanco and the success of the virtual canteen solution.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Brazil grew by 16.8% like-for-like.In Hispanic Latin America  third-quarter 2022 operating revenue was up 27.9% like-for-like versus the same period in 2021. This robust performance reflects a sharp acceleration in the Employee Benefits business  as well as further strong growth in Fleet & Mobility Solutions.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Hispanic Latin America rose by 20.6% like-for-like.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue came to €40 million for the third quarter  up 21.1% as reported (+27.7% like-for-like). This region represents 8% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.This performance was notably driven by the success of innovative programs proposed in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. In North America  Edenred CSI’s Corporate Payment Services continued to build on the strong momentum seen in the second quarter  thanks in particular to the ramp-up of its commercial partnerships with several banks and software companies.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in the Rest of the World totaled €109 million  up 20.7% as reported (+30.0% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.Other revenueOther revenue for the third quarter of 2022 totaled €23 million  up 100.1% as reported (+99.7% like-for-like). This significant increase reflects the impact of strong business growth on the float2  as well as favorable changes in interest rates in all regions where the Group operates. The gradual acceleration in other revenue growth period after period can be attributed to the steady rise in interest rates observed for several quarters now in Europe (outside the euro zone) and Latin America  as well as to the first effects of interest rate increases in the euro zone. For the nine months ended September 30  2022  other revenue came to €53 million  representing an increase of 67.3% as reported (+65.4% like-for-like).OUTLOOKAfter achieving record results in the first half  Edenred confirmed its very good business momentum in the third quarter.Thanks to its segmented sales approach  Edenred continues to penetrate its core markets  with the economic environment further enhancing the attractiveness of its solutions  which notably enable employers to effectively boost their employees’ purchasing power.Edenred is also unlocking new growth opportunities by expanding its portfolio of solutions to more fully meet clients’ needs. In Employee Benefits  Beyond Food solutions enable companies to enhance their employer brand and boost employee engagement in a fast-changing working world. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  the Beyond Fuel offering (including maintenance and toll management and VAT refund solutions) helps fleet managers control their expenses. And in Complementary Solutions  the Beyond Payment strategy to enhance the value proposition  as illustrated by the acquisition of IPS  a leading invoice automation vendor  is moving Edenred CSI up the accounts payable value chain.Lastly  Edenred is accelerating its investments in product and technology innovation to seize opportunities arising from secular trends  such as remote working as a permanent feature in the workplace  green commuting  the consumption of eco-friendly products and the transition of fleets to electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.Thanks to its ability to leverage the increasing scale effect of its platform  in an environment where its solutions are increasingly attractive and amid favorable economic conditions  the Group is upgrading its 2022 EBITDA outlook to between €810 million and €840 million3 (compared with a target range of between €770 million and €820 million euros announced on July 26  2022).SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTEREdenred joins the Euronext CAC 40 ESG® indexOn September 19  2022  the Group joined the Paris stock exchange’s Euronext CAC 40 ESG index  taking its place alongside other companies demonstrating outstanding environmental  social and governance (ESG) practices.SUBSEQUENT EVENTSEdenred expands its Corporate Payment invoice automation capabilities in the US  with the acquisition of IPSOn October 17  2022  Edenred announced the acquisition of IPS  a leading invoice automation vendor  through its corporate payment subsidiary Edenred CSI.This acquisition enhances Edenred CSI’s value proposition by expanding along the procure-to-pay value chain and integrating a turnkey invoice automation solution into its digital platform.

The Company believes that presenting the proportionate share of its joint venture revenue in construction projects carried out in joint arrangements enables management and investors to better evaluate the performance of the Company’s core business period-over-period by assisting them in more accurately understanding the activities actually performed by the Company on these projects.Adjusted recurring EBIT: Adjusted recurring EBIT represents the profit before financial expense  net  and income taxes recorded under IFRS as adjusted to reflect line-by-line for their respective share incorporated construction project entities that are not fully owned by the Company (applying to the method described above under adjusted revenue) and adds or removes  as appropriate  items that are considered as non-recurring from EBIT  including (i) restructuring expenses  (ii) separation costs associated with the Spin-off transaction  and (iii) costs arising out of significant litigation that have arisen outside of the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that the exclusion of such expenses or profits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate the Company’s operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked to both investors and management by the excluded items.Adjusted recurring EBITDA: Adjusted recurring EBITDA corresponds to the adjusted recurring EBIT as described above after deduction of depreciation and amortization expenses and as adjusted to reflect for their respective share construction project entities that are not fully owned by the Company. The Company believes that the exclusion of these expenses or profits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate the Company’s operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked to both investors and management by the excluded items.Adjusted net (debt) cash: Adjusted net (debt) cash reflects cash and cash equivalents  net of debt (including short-term debt and loans due to/due from the TechnipFMC Group)  as adjusted according to the method described above under adjusted revenue. Management uses this APM to evaluate the Company’s capital structure and financial leverage. The Company believes adjusted net debt (if debtor)  or adjusted net cash (if creditor)  is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding the Company’s financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in its capital structure.Adjusted order backlog: Order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled  confirmed customer orders at the relevant reporting date. Adjusted order backlog takes into account the Company’s proportionate share of order backlog related to equity affiliates (ENI Coral FLNG  BAPCO Sitra Refinery  Arctic LNG 2 for the In-Russia construction and supervision scope  the joint-venture Rovuma  two affiliates of the NFE joint-venture  and the Nova Energies joint-venture) and restates the share of order backlog related to the Company’s non-controlling interest in Yamal LNG. The Company believes that the adjusted order backlog enables management and investors to evaluate the level of the Company’s core business forthcoming activities by including its proportionate share in the estimated sales coming from construction projects in joint arrangements.Adjusted order intake: Order intake corresponds to signed contracts which have come into force during the reporting period. Adjusted order intake adds the proportionate share of orders signed related to equity affiliates (ENI Coral FLNG  BAPCO Sitra Refinery  Arctic LNG 2 for the In-Russia construction and supervision scope  the joint-venture Rovuma  two affiliates of the NFE joint-venture  and the Nova Energies joint-venture) and restates the share of order intake attributable to the non-controlling interests in Yamal LNG. This financial measure is closely connected with the adjusted order backlog in the evaluation of the level of the Company’s forthcoming activities by presenting its proportionate share of contracts which came into force during the period and that will be performed by the Company.Notes:(1) A “large” award for Technip Energies is a contract award representing between €250 million and €500 million of revenue.(2) A “significant” award for Technip Energies is a contract award representing between €50 million and €250 million of revenue.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.83,0.16,0.0,True,English,"['Technip Energies Financial Results', 'First Nine Months', 'longer cycle Project Delivery', 'robust project delivery model', 'strong TPS order intake', '9M 2022 results conference call', 'strong balance sheet', 'unaudited financial results', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'substantial early engagement', 'order intake trends', 'effective capital allocation', 'effective tax rate', 'world-class project delivery', 'Conference call information', 'next 12-18 months', 'highest margin segment', 'full company guidance', 'Recurring EBIT margin', 'Exit Framework Agreement', 'growing market positions', 'zero carbon solutions', 'robust business execution', 'prior financial framework', 'energy market outlook', 'first nine months', 'IFRS financial measures', 'revenue growth trajectory', '9M 2021 diluted earnings', 'prior framework', 'accretive TPS', 'Financial information', 'Conference Code', 'project development', 'market reality', 'medium-term trajectory', 'orderly exit', 'first half', 'leadership positions', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'business strategy', 'Technology company', 'The Company', 'energy transition', 'energy system', 'energy cycles', 'sustainable energy', 'Regulatory News', 'Technip Energies', 'leading Engineering', 'Arnaud Pieton', 'Recent events', 'urgent need', 'particular emphasis', 'natural gas', '60% step change', 'segment backlog', 'notable awards', 'renewable fuels', 'commercial pipeline', 'traditional prospects', 'significant improvement', 'ideal blend', 'T.EN', 'third quarter', 'underlying portfolio', 'operational personnel', 'technology portfolio', 'sustained excellence', 'Net profit', 'complete definition', 'average number', 'outstanding shares', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'edge.media-server', 'sustainable chemistry', 'CO 2 management', 'extensive technol', 'Arctic LNG', 'Key financials', 'Paris:TE', 'ethylene markets', 'expected contribution', 'green hydrogen', '2021 Revenue', 'affordability', 'availability', 'sustainability', 'investment', 'year', 'combination', 'value', 'teams', 'revenues', 'strength', 'margins', 'quality', 'mix', 'customer', 'process', 'visibility', 'improving', 'commitment', 'shareholders', 'EPS', 'Appendix', 'Reconciliation', 'millions', 'FY', 'webcast', 'Thursday', 'October', '13:00 CET', 'details', 'France', 'blue']",2022-10-20,2022-10-20,businesswire.com
11893,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.rigzone.com/news/seadrill_closes_sale_of_seven_jackups_to_ades-20-oct-2022-170785-article/,Seadrill Closes Sale Of Seven Jack-Ups To ADES,Seadrill Limited has closed the sale of seven jack-ups located in Saudi Arabia to ADES Arabia Holding.,Offshore driller Seadrill Limited has closed the sale of seven jack-ups located in Saudi Arabia to ADES Arabia Holding.The initial deal for the share purchase agreement with subsidiaries of ADES Arabia Holding was signed on September 1. The rigs in question are the AOD I  AOD II  AOD III  West Callisto  West Ariel  West Cressida  and West Leda.ADES will also employ the crews operating the rigs and will hold the drilling contracts related to the rigs. The total consideration for the jack-up sale is $628 million in cash  subject to adjustment for working capital and other items  and reimbursement to Seadrill for any project costs spent at the time of closing concerning the reactivation of the three stacked jack-ups  namely the West Ariel  West Cressida  and West Leda. This translates into around $100 million per rig on a ‘ready-to-drill’ basis.Seadrill said that the proceeds from the jack-up sale would enable it to significantly de-leverage its balance sheet and eliminate outstanding capital expenditure for the West Ariel  West Cressida  and West Leda.ADES has been shopping for rigs for some time now. Namely  it bought a large number of rigs from several companies since November last year. It first bought Noble Roger Lewis  Noble Scott Marks  Noble Joe Knight  and Noble Johnny Whitstine – all contracted by Saudi Aramco – from Noble Corporation. That was followed by a very active April this year with three acquisitions.Namely  Maersk Drilling sold the Maersk Convincer jack-up rig to ADES for $42.5 million. In the same month  ADES bought four jack-up drilling rigs from Aban Offshore for $106 million and the Emerald Driller  Sapphire Driller  and Aquamarine Driller jack-ups from Vantage drilling. The April shopping spree ended with the acquisition of the Valaris 113 and 114 rigs for a price of $125 million.In May  ADES also bought two KFELS B Class rigs from Keppel Offshore & Marine. These rigs were ordered in 2013 and 2014 but nothing came of them. This was beneficial for both parties as Keppel announced last year that it would be exiting the offshore rig-building business.In other Seadrill-related news  it recently received approval to relist its common shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SDRL. The company started trading on NYSE last Friday.Due to the listing on the NYSE  Seadrill also applied to change the status of its listing at Euronext Expand from a primary listing to a secondary listing  and the Oslo Stock Exchange has approved the application. The change from primary to the secondary listing at Euronext Expand took effect on October 17.“We are pleased to be re-listing the company on the NYSE. Our participation in the U.S. public markets should provide additional liquidity in our stock and provide access to new investors. We look forward to continuing our long history of strong engagement with our investment audience ” Seadrill CEO Simon Johnson said.To contact the author  email bojan.lepic@rigzone.com,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.01,positive,0.98,0.02,0.0,True,English,"['Seven Jack-Ups', 'Seadrill', 'Sale', 'ADES', 'two KFELS B Class rigs', 'U.S. public markets', 'Seadrill CEO Simon Johnson', 'Maersk Convincer jack-up rig', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'four jack-up drilling rigs', 'Offshore driller Seadrill Limited', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'share purchase agreement', 'ticker symbol SDRL', 'Noble Roger Lewis', 'Noble Scott Marks', 'Noble Joe Knight', 'Noble Johnny Whitstine', 'Aquamarine Driller jack', 'offshore rig-building business', 'outstanding capital expenditure', 'April shopping spree', 'other Seadrill-related news', 'three stacked jack-ups', 'ADES Arabia Holding', 'Maersk Drilling', 'new investors', 'Noble Corporation', 'Aban Offshore', 'Emerald Driller', 'Sapphire Driller', 'Saudi Arabia', 'seven jack-ups', 'drilling contracts', 'working capital', 'other items', 'active April', 'three acquisitions', 'Vantage drilling', 'Keppel Offshore', 'initial deal', 'AOD I', 'West Callisto', 'West Ariel', 'West Cressida', 'West Leda', 'total consideration', 'project costs', 'balance sheet', 'large number', 'several companies', 'Saudi Aramco', 'same month', 'common shares', 'additional liquidity', 'long history', 'strong engagement', 'investment audience', 'secondary listing', 'Euronext Expand', 'primary listing', '114 rigs', 'sale', 'subsidiaries', 'September', 'question', 'crews', 'cash', 'adjustment', 'reimbursement', 'time', 'reactivation', 'basis', 'proceeds', 'November', 'Valaris 113', 'price', 'May', 'parties', 'approval', 'company', 'NYSE', 'status', 'application', 'effect', 'October', 'participation', 'access', 'author', 'lepic', 'rigzone']",2022-10-20,2022-10-20,rigzone.com

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported Q3-22 results which were at the favorable end of guidance but reflected the impact of a new industry downturn. For the quarter  revenue  orders and net income of € 168.8 million  € 125.3 million and € 57.3 million decreased by 21.1%  18.2% and 24.2%  respectively  versus Q2-22. Adverse revenue and order development this quarter reflected typical seasonal weakness for mobile applications but also more general weakness in high-end server  data center and general computing applications. Such weakness was partially offset by continued strength in automotive and industrial end-user markets and ongoing shipments of hybrid bonding equipment to customers. Similarly  Besi’s backlog of € 240.6 million at the end of Q3 declined by 12.6% versus Q2-22 but remained at higher than typical levels.Despite a challenging market environment  we maintained profit efficiency at high levels with gross margins of 62.3% exceeding guidance and a net margin of 34.0%. We re-aligned Besi’s production model rapidly in response to changing market conditions. As a result  total headcount has declined by 12.7% and temporary Asian production headcount by 65.2% since the end of Q1-22. We will continue to adjust overhead levels as necessary in accordance with market developments.For the first nine months  Besi reported revenue of € 585.1 million which increased by 1.3% and net income which decreased by 6.9% versus the comparable period of 2021. Growth was favorably influenced by increased demand for Besi’s computing  automotive and hybrid bonding end-user markets. Such strength was partially offset by reduced demand for high-end smartphones following a large capacity build in 2021. It also reflected a 37.6% revenue decrease from Chinese customers primarily associated with overcapacity  slower economic growth and Covid-19 related lockdowns. Orders of € 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% as industry conditions materially weakened post the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. The € 14.8 million decrease in Besi’s net income between the comparable periods principally resulted from a 49.0% increase in development spending as we increased investment in future areas of growth for the next market upcycle.Our liquidity position continues to build with strong cash flow generation of € 185.2 million during the first nine months of 2022 which supports Besi’s capital allocation policy. We ended the quarter with cash and deposits of € 661.8 million and net cash of € 342.5 million that represented increases of 12.1% and 19.0%  respectively  versus September 30  2021. Liquidity has improved this year despite the distribution of € 351.3 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed our prior € 185 million share repurchase program in July and began purchases under our new € 300 million program in August. During the quarter  we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares for an aggregate amount of € 45.5 million.Strategically  we are accelerating investment in Besi’s future despite near term headwinds  particularly for our hybrid bonding and wafer level assembly portfolio  as the long-term drivers of our business remain intact and sub 10 nanometer device innovation continues apace. We see continued interest in hybrid bonding applications as the natural extension of Moore’s law to drive technology gains in new heterogeneous 3D architectures for next generation logic  memory  mobile  automotive and data center applications. Besi received orders subsequent to quarter end both for incremental hybrid bonding capacity and for systems incorporated in hybrid bonding integrated lines. Additional orders are anticipated in Q4-22.The outlook for the assembly equipment market has turned more negative during the quarter as industry conditions weakened  global GDP growth rates decelerated and customer caution increased. At present  it appears to be a traditional industry downturn marked by overcapacity and order pushouts by customers. Downcycles are typically the periods in which Besi looks to improve its business model and plans investment in those products and technologies which will drive revenue growth in the next upcycle. The announcement of new restrictions recently by the US on sales of WFE and assembly equipment to China has added more uncertainty to the industry outlook. We are currently evaluating the proposed restrictions to better understand whether any of Besi’s <10 micron accuracy systems could be subject to such provisions.For Q4-22  we estimate that revenue will decrease by 15-25% versus Q3-22 reflecting uncertain market conditions and seasonal trends. However  Besi’s gross margin is expected to remain in the 60-62% range due to the flexibility of our production model and anticipated product mix. Further  operating expenses are anticipated to increase by approximately 5% versus Q3-22 principally due to higher R&D spending.”Third Quarter Results of Operations€ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Δ Q3-2021 Δ Revenue 168.8 214.0 -21.1% 208.3 -19.0% Orders 125.3 153.1 -18.2% 209.2 -40.1% Book to Bill Ratio 0.7x 0.7x - 1.0x -0.3Q3-22 revenue of € 168.8 million decreased 21.1% versus Q2-22 due to lower shipments for high-end mobile applications reflecting seasonal influences and lower revenue for high performance computing applications given softer market conditions in data center and mainstream computing end-user markets. Revenue for the quarter was at the favorable end of guidance. Versus Q3-21  revenue decreased by 19.0% as a result of significantly lower demand by Chinese subcontractors for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications and  to a lesser extent  to lower demand for high-end smartphones post new product introductions last year. Such weakness was partially offset by revenue growth for high performance computing  hybrid bonding applications and automotive applications.Orders of € 125.3 million decreased 18.2% versus Q2-22 due primarily to lower demand for computing applications by IDMs and Taiwanese subcontractors and softening market conditions. Order weakness was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-user markets both from European IDMs and Asian subcontractors. Versus Q3-21  orders decreased by 40.1% primarily due to a broad-based market decline which started in Q2-22 with particular weakness in high performance computing applications and lower order levels by Chinese subcontractors. Per customer type  IDM orders decreased € 6.1 million  or 7.0%  versus Q2-22 and represented 64% of total orders for the period. Subcontractor orders decreased by € 21.7 million  or 32.7%  versus Q2-22 and represented 36% of total orders.€ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Δ Q3-2021 Δ Gross Margin 62.3% 61.0% +1.3 60.4% +1.9 Operating Expenses 34.0 37.9 -10.3% 30.4 +11.8% Financial Expense/(Income)  net 5.5 5.8 -5.2% 3.4 +61.8% EBITDA 77.1 98.0 -21.3% 99.7 -22.7%Besi’s gross margin rose to 62.3% in Q3-22  an increase of 1.3 points and 1.9 points versus Q2-22 and Q3-21  respectively. It was also above prior guidance (60-62%). The improvement was primarily due to a more favorable product mix and forex benefits from an increase in the value of the USD versus the euro.Q3-22 operating expenses declined by € 3.9 million  or 10.3%  versus Q2-22 principally as a result of a € 2.7 million reduction in share-based compensation expense and lower variable sales related expenses. Operating expenses increased by € 3.6 million  or 11.8%  versus Q3-21 primarily due to increased R&D spending for the development of next generation wafer level assembly systems. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to 20.2% in Q3-22 versus 17.7% in Q2-22 and 14.6% in Q3-21  primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels.€ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Δ Q3-2021 Δ Net Income 57.3 75.6 -24.2% 84.2 -31.9% Net Margin 34.0% 35.4% -1.4 40.4% -6.4 Tax Rate* 12.8% 12.7% +0.1 8.4% +4.4* Effective tax rate reflects € 3.7 million of deferred tax benefits recognized in Q3-21.

Such growth was partially offset by significantly decreased demand for high-end smartphones and for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications by Chinese subcontractors. Of note  revenue from Chinese customers decreased by € 83.7 million  or 37.6%  year-over-year and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 38.5% in YTD-21 to 23.7% in YTD-22.Orders of € 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% versus YTD-21 due to less favorable market conditions after the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. In particular  decreased demand reflected lower orders for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021  lower orders for high performance computing applications and significantly decreased demand from Chinese subcontractors due to overcapacity  decelerating economic growth and rolling Covid-19 lockdowns. Order weakness in YTD-22 was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-markets  continuing a trend which began in the second half of 2021.

While last year there were 49 IPOs  a high for the last decade  2022 got off to a ""good start"" but the war in Ukraine slowed things down.""The conflict and the macroeconomic consequences together with a drop in market valuations made it more expensive in terms of opportunity-cost ratio to take a company to the stock market  with a slowdown in IPOs ""  said Celia at an event in Milan.Electrode maker Industrie De Nora listed in June and its shares have risen since. However  energy group Eni put plans to list its Plenitude renewable business on ice because of market conditions.Celia said some large and medium-sized companies might try to test the waters early in 2023  but added it was ""more likely we should wait until May-June to see new IPOs return to the market.""She had some advice for those companies already at work on potential listings.""It is crucial that they prove to investors that they are resilient  that they operate in sectors that will continue to grow despite the recession "" she said.($1 = 1.0173 euros)(Reporting Sara Rossi; editing by Keith Weir)",negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,negative,0.0,0.02,0.98,True,English,"['Italian IPO market', 'Ukraine war', 'new wave', 'Market Intelligence Primary Markets Italy', 'Initial Public Offerings', 'first nine months', 'larger European peers', 'Industrie De Nora', 'Plenitude renewable business', 'Italian IPO market', 'Italian Stock Exchange', 'stock market listings', 'capital markets', 'potential listings', 'market valuations', 'market conditions', 'new wave', 'other rules', 'chronic delays', 'last decade', 'good start', 'macroeconomic consequences', 'opportunity-cost ratio', 'Electrode maker', 'energy group', 'Sara Rossi', 'Keith Weir', 'Milan exchange', 'next May-June', 'Euronext official', '1.4 billion euros', 'medium-sized companies', '21 new IPOs', 'Patrizia Celia', 'Ukraine war', '1.0173 euros', '49 IPOs', 'PHOTO', 'Woman', 'Reuters', 'brake', 'Thursday', 'total', 'Head', 'owner', 'government', 'Rome', 'voting', 'country', 'ability', 'things', 'conflict', 'drop', 'terms', 'company', 'slowdown', 'event', 'shares', 'plans', 'ice', 'waters', 'work', 'investors', 'sectors', 'recession']",2022-10-20,2022-10-20,uk.news.yahoo.com

After taking into account the consolidated financial income and the deferred tax expense  the Group posted quarterly net earnings from continuing operations at the break-even point for the third quarter of 2022 compared to a consolidated net profit from continuing operations at 0.1 million euros for the third quarter of 2021.EBITDA from continuing operations amounted to +0.3 million euros for the third quarter of 2022  thus +1.0 million euros for the 9-month period ending September 30  2022. On September 30  2022  the Group reported available cash at 4.5 million euros (vs. 4.4 million euros at the end of June 2022) including cash investments (Corporate bonds / investment securities) recorded under non-current financial assets for an amount of 1.1 million euros. In addition to this amount  the available unused credit lines amounted to 0.4 million euros on September 30  2022.* * *Restructuring of the US operationsAs previously announced and as part of the progress of the FABLITE program  the MEMSCAP Group has initiated the restructuring phase of its US operations.

Full login details and presentation materials are available at: https://www.voltalia.com/investor-relations""The growth of renewable energy is accelerating. A key element in the fight against global warming  renewable energy has also become the cheapest energy ever produced in history  while meeting the energy security challenges of countries and companies.By creating new renewable power plants on its own behalf and for its customers  while reducing their energy consumption through its subsidiary Helexia  Voltalia is helping to meet the challenge of the energy transition.After achieving an average annual growth in revenues of 46% between 2014  the date of its IPO  and 2021  Voltalia has set itself a new roadmap. While we anticipate that the 2023 capacity target will be reached a year early and confirm the EBITDA target of €275-300 million in 2023  Voltalia is now targeting operating and construction capacity in excess of 5 gigawatts and a normalised EBITDA of around €475 million¹ by 2027. In addition  in line with its status as a company with a mission  Voltalia has set a new environmental objective for 2027: over 4 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent avoided”  commented Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.An extraordinary sectorNumerous structural and economic factors are sustaining the renewable energy sector:Story continuesPublic policies and private initiatives against global warming ;Intensification of government measures to promote energy independence ;Trend towards lower costs for renewable energy in a context of rising costs for other energy sources;Willingness of companies to reduce their exposure to the volatility of energy prices in the long term and to lower their energy bills;Rise in the electrification of uses with  for example  the emergence of electric vehicles and the gradual switch to electric heating.However  the sector's growth cycle is still in its infancy  and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix should continue to accelerate over the next few years.On the three continents where Voltalia is present:In Europe   which is already committed to the fight against global warming   the war in Ukraine has made energy independence a central priority of government policies. A sudden and sustained acceleration in renewable energy and energy efficiency is taking shape: Europe is once again becoming one of the key global markets;In Africa   the market remains dynamic due to strong growth in electricity consumption . South Africa  in particular  is going through a major energy crisis. The growth in demand is combined with the country's need to replace ageing coal-fired power plants that are no longer adapted to the needs of the population;In Latin America  population growth is creating structural demand for energy consumption. In addition  Brazil's extremely favourable wind patterns  coupled with good sunshine  will gradually attract electro-intensive industries.A clear mission  a successful business modelVoltalia has been aware of the challenges facing its sector since its creation in 2005. As a responsible player  Voltalia formally defined its mission in 2014  before officially integrating it in its articles of association in 20202. Within this legal framework  Voltalia defines the extra-financial indicators of its mission. These are audited and presented annually to the general meeting  alongside the financial report. Voltalia’s mission seeks a fair balance between the planet and its inhabitants: improving the global environment while promoting local development. Every day  it guides the actions and decisions of everyone within Voltalia and its governance.Voltalia  directly or through its subsidiaries  implements the energy transition technologies that create the best opportunities:Electricity production: ground-mounted photovoltaic   roof-mounted and car park  onshore wind power   small-scale hydroelectricity and biomass (power plants burning recovered wood);Battery storage and potentially other technologies;Energy efficiency and energy management.Voltalia has deployed a business model that combines the business of a renewable energy producer through its own power plants with that of service provider to third-party customers. Voltalia's employees who  on behalf of customers  create energy production or savings projects from scratch during the development and construction phases  and then operate and maintain them. This model for itself and third-party customers has the most significant impact on its mission while creating the most financial value.As the services business is not very capital intensive  electricity production and storage account for the vast majority of Voltalia's capital. In this business  Voltalia relies on very long-term electricity sales contracts (generally 20 years) which are designed to ensure the repayment of project financing and to secure equity investments. The contractual sales prices are mostly (83% in 2021) indexed to inflation.A strong growth trajectory since its IPO on EuronextSince its IPO  Voltalia has posted an average annual growth (CAGR) of +46% in revenues and +41% in EBITDA between 2014 and 2021. Over the period  the capacity in operation and under construction has increased more than fourfold  from 365 MW to 1.7 GW in 2021. Voltalia also announced on the occasion of the publication of its half-yearly results for 2022 that its target of 2.6 GW of capacity in operation and under construction  which it planned to achieve by the end of 2023  would finally be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule.This growth trajectory  essentially organic  has benefited from targeted acquisitions which have accelerated the strategy  in particular that of Helexia which offers its client companies  in parallel with Voltalia's corporate PPA offer  on-site solar production ( roofs and car park shades) and investments to reduce their energy consumption.New growth ambitions for 2027On 28 September  during the publication of its half-year results for 2022  Voltalia indicated that it believed that it would be able to achieve its 2023 target of 2.6 gigawatts of capacity in operation and under construction one year ahead of schedule and that it was confirming its two other 2023 targets: a normalised EBITDA of €275 to €300 million and a share of Brazil in capacity in operation and under construction below 50%.In this context  Voltalia has defined a new growth plan for 2027  including the following objectives:Operating and construction capacity owned by Voltalia: over 5 gigawatts by the end of 2027;Capacity operated on behalf of third parties: over 8 gigawatts by the end of 2027;Normalised EBITDA 3 : around €475 million in 2027;CO2-equivalent avoided: over 4 million tonnes in 2027.Voltalia will examine the best options for financing its CAPEX of between an estimated €2.5 and €3 billion to support its new ambitions by 2027. In addition to the usual project financing and its significant cash flow  the group reserves the right to raise corporate financing  to selectively sell minority shares to partners in some of its projects or to arrange equity financing  depending on market conditions and  where appropriate  involving all of its existing shareholders  including its main shareholder  the Mulliez family.Solid assets to achieve its ambitionsVoltalia will be able to draw on a number of strengths to achieve this ambitious growth plan up to 2027  including:A portfolio of projects under development at a record level of 13.6 GW  of which 986 MW have won a PPA and 1.8 GW are ready to tender for a PPA;The gain  since January 2022  of new long-term electricity sales contracts for 640 MW;A volume of projects in the early stages of development (which meet one  two or three of the four criteria required to enter the development portfolio 4 ) of 22.1 GW;Ability to sell and implement the full range of products offered to businesses : corporate wind and solar PPAs  photovoltaic roofs and shades and energy efficiency;Expertise in Development  Construction and Supply of equipment and Operation-Maintenance services to third party clients;Expertise in the key technologies of the energy transition  in particular those currently experiencing strong growth: photovoltaics  storage and energy efficiency;A geographical positioning focused on countries where the sector's growth potential is among the highest in the world;The ability to make acquisitions   integrate them and then rapidly develop the acquired entities;A track record of strong growth management with revenue and EBITDA growing at CAGR since the IPO on the Euronext regulated market in 2014  of 46% and 41% respectively over the period 2014-2021.DisclaimerThis press release and the information contained herein do not constitute either an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase the securities of Voltalia.The release  publication or distribution of this press release may be restricted in certain countries by applicable laws and regulations.
