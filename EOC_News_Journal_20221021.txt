At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation.Let me now turn the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our third quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation and afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions.The link to the presentation material for this call has been sent out by email and it can also be downloaded from the Investor Relation section of our website. As usual  the conference call is recorded and will be available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome  ladies and gentlemen. The times we are currently living in continue to be quite unprecedented. After the strong first quarter  we were expecting at Deutsche B√∂rse a normalization of activity throughout the year  but what we saw instead was an even acceleration of growth throughout the year 2022. In the end  the third quarter turned out to be our strongest quarter ever from a net revenue perspective.The main driver for the 12% cyclical net revenue growth we have seen in the first nine months is the beginning cycle of rising interest rates. In the United States  we have meanwhile reached a fair target range of 3% to 3.25% and in September  the ECB raised rates in Europe to a level that will last saw back in 2011.This has resulted in greater trading and hedging needs for our clients in almost all asset classes  as well as growth of the net interest income of our security service business  which had been depressed for so many years. This is the new area as we called it  and as I was referring to at our last Investor Day in June  which adds additional cyclical opportunities to our consistent delivery of secular growth.Combining the two  we are now expecting organic growth rates of 7% to 9% on average per annum from this year onwards through the current cycle. Organic growth will continue to be complemented by M&A with the same approach as previously. In the third quarter  the situation on the European gas markets has continued to fuel the activities in commodities  but we are now also starting to see some negative effects of the market uncertainty in our European power product complex  which saw declining activity.Very encouraging to see is the continued strong secular net revenue growth  which amounted to 8% in the first nine months. This is really the result of the many initiatives to win new clients and market share as well as introducing new products and services over the last couple of years. This also continues to be our top priority because the current strong cyclical tailwinds are not going to last forever.The development in 2022 also underscores the quality of our business portfolio. The strong results are not just driven by single businesses  but by double-digit net revenue growth in almost all business lines. On the operating expense side  we have faced with an unusual combination of drivers that have resulted in higher cost growth compared to our initial guidance.Foreign exchange effects have gotten stronger throughout the year and are expected to effect as well into next year  but this item is overcompensated by the positive FX impact on our net revenue. While we don't see headline inflation numbers in our overall operating cost yet  the 4% we are currently looking at are certainly an elevated level compared to past periods.And finally  the favorable financial development and relative share price performance has resulted in an increase of the provisions for variable and share-based compensation.In total net revenue in the first nine months increased by 23% and amounted to more than ‚Ç¨3.2 billion. The EBITDA increased by 24% to around ‚Ç¨1.9 billion euro. Since the overall development in the first nine months so far exceeded our initial expectations for 2022  we are further increasing our guidance for the full year 2022.Our expectation now is to exceed ‚Ç¨4.1 billion euro of net revenue and ‚Ç¨2.3 billion of EBITDA. This might sound conservative to some of you  but you guys know us. We are all cautious management people and rather want to under-promise and over deliver than the opposite.With that  let me now hand over to you  Gregor to present the financial results in greater detail.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we show the details also besides for the first nine months. All segments have contributed double-digit cost rates to the overall net revenue development. Three out of four segments even achieved organic net revenue growth rate of more than 20%.As part of the net revenue  the net interest income across the globe has roughly tripled compared to the previous year. On the one hand  this was driven by much higher colateral levels in financial derivatives and especially commodities. On the other hand  the net interest income of security services has started to meaningful benefit from higher US and now also European interest rates.The result from financial investments saw a small negative contribution from our FinTech fund investments in the third quarter and amounted to ‚Ç¨29 million for the first nine months. For the full year  we are now expecting any positive contribution  but might see a further small decline.In terms of operating costs in the first nine months is on Page 3  we saw several different drivers. First M&A effect  which declined compared to half year one and amounted to 5%. They were still mainly driven by the IFS acquisition. Second  the FX effect from the stronger US dollar increased and resided in a 3% operating expense increase  but this was obviously also beneficial to the net revenue development particular in the data and analytics segment.This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating cost scores of 8%. On the one hand  it was driven by inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to continue to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in the light of the favorable financial development and relative share price performance.This brings me to the details of the third quarter reside on Page 4 of the presentation. While the secular close remained at high levels and slightly above our expectation  cyclical tailwinds have accelerated in the third quarter compared to the first half of this year. The cyclical growth was driven in particular by market volatility and hedging needs of our clients and financial derivatives  commodities and of products.In addition  and as expected  the net interest income has become a more material growth driver for security services. The M&A effect again had minor impact in the third quarter since they were only driven by some of the smaller more recent acquisitions.The explanations are just provided on operating cost development in the first nine months can generally also be applied to the third quarter. While the M&A impact on the operating costs has become smaller compared to previous quarters  the impact from variable and share-based compensation has increased. Furthermore  we saw an increase of project cost and some additional IT investments in cloud technology.So aside from financial investments in the previous year included a positive valuation effect of ‚Ç¨32 million from the minority investment in Clarity AI as a result of the financing round with SoftBank. In the third quarter  depreciation and amortization included some one-off effects from software impairments and the financial results included higher interest from our funds outstanding in particular from the hybrid bond that was issued in March  as well as some FX effect.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments starting with data and analytics on Page 5. We saw good organic net revenue growth levels across all business lines in the segment. This was driven by the continuing trend towards ESG  new clients and higher market activity for the index licensing business. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  included some inorganic growth from the acquisition of Discovery Data.Most of our direct US dollar exposure in is in the data and analytics segment from the ISS and Axioma subsidiaries  but constant currency net revenue cost in the third quarter was still very strong with 19%. The EBITDA in the previous year's quarter included the gain of around ‚Ç¨32 million from the evaluation of the stake in Clarity AI that I mentioned before. Adjusted for this effect  the EBITDA has increased by 33%.Let me turn to Slide 6 in the trading and clearing segment. The trading and clearing segment continue to benefit from higher volatility and increased client hedging needs. The financial derivatives business of Eurex was as strong as in the first quarter. This was driven by high cost in all product lines and in particular by the increased margin fees. They amounted to ‚Ç¨34 million in the third quarter.In commodities  we achieved another quarter because of the increased trading and hedging needs of our clients in gas products and due to the higher margin fees  but at the same time  the situation in European energy markets increasingly became a headwind for net revenue which was power product in Europe. They declined by 11%.In the cash equity business  we saw headwinds from elevated levels of retail participation last year  which has normalized this year. In addition  one of our peers has increased liquidity payments this year  which resided in some market share decline for all incumbents in Europe.As a result of higher volatility  the demand for foreign exchange products was significantly higher compared to previous quarters and we achieved our  by far best quarter ever  there's a net revenue increase of 33%.In the fund services segment  on Page 7  the continued onboarding of new clients more than offset the cyclical headwinds from the market performance  especially in equity product. In addition  we saw the inorganic contribution of the Kneip acquisition  which was closed at the end of March.In the operating expense base of the segment  we saw a few one-off effects in the quarter. They're related to the integration of Kneip and the preparations for the carve-out of the fund service business from Clearstream. It's also encouraging to see that the momentum of new partnerships has continued. HSBC has chosen Deutsche B√∂rse as its global partner for fund auto loading  safekeeping  settlement and distribution for very meaningful fund portfolio.Our security services segment on Slide 8  saw a significant acceleration of close in the third quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation were overcompensated by solid levels of fixed income issuance activity. Some is FX effects on assets under custody denominated in US dollar and the collateral management business with the close of more than 30%.In addition  the net interest income has increased more than six fold compared to last year. This was driven much by -- this was driven by much higher US interest rates and for the first time in more than a decade  increasing European interest rates. Furthermore  the cash balances has increased by roughly 30% compared to the previous year.The last page of today's presentation shows our guidance for 2022. We have already increased our guidance twice this year. However  these increases were either qualitative than quantitative. Since the third quarter developed significantly above our even more recent expectations  we have now increased our net revenue guidance to more than ‚Ç¨4.1 billion and the EBITDA guidance to more than ‚Ç¨2.3 billion.Depending on the cyclical development in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter  those numbers look conservative  but we want to be on the safe site.Since most of the operating expense drivers we have seen in the first nine months are also expected to impact our cost base in the fourth quarter  we are currently expecting operating cost of slightly more than ‚Ç¨1.8 billion for the full year. This expectation is a result of the combination of the different operating cost drivers I've outlined before.We consider some of them to be more temporary in nature and would expect some easing of the cost pressure going into next year. This will also help us to address all sorts of potential net revenue scenarios next year against the tougher 2022 comparables.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your question.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator instructions] And the first question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BNP Paribas Exane. Over to you.Arnaud GiblatYeah  good afternoon. My question is on interest income. Clearly we all understand how it works in our history  but it's a bit more obscure at how NI works at Eurex and EEX. I was wondering if you could spend a bit of time explaining the growth there. Is it entirely coming from increased cash balances and margining and how sustainable is that increase in margining? I suspect it's linked to the volatility  but can use hold a higher level of margin for some time?And could you talk about the net interest margin? Is that linked to short term rates? How does NIM work for those businesses? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  thanks Arnaud for this question. Obviously  the net interest income is an important line item now in our P&L and gets even more important in this future. So it's different in our Clearstream business compared to our clearing business. So starting with Clearstream  here you have heard that the customer cash balance is even increased to roughly ‚Ç¨18 billion. And this interest income we achieved here with increased interest rates or fed fund rate of 3% to 3.25% and will most probably further increase or over the next weeks and months.So here you can basically multiply it. So saying additional 1% on ‚Ç¨18 billion  it's another ‚Ç¨180 million at Clearstream. So  that's the concept here.With regard to the two clearing houses  so US Clearing and ECC  here the model is different from a P&L perspective. So here  we get roughly a fee-based income on the margins  right?So the margin at Eurex increased to a level of ‚Ç¨130 billion to ‚Ç¨140 billion now is much higher compared to previous year due to increased volatility and due to the successfully increasing of our OTC interest rate swap business. So here  we have an increased basis. And the same is basically true for the clearinghouse ECC. So for our commodities business at EEX. So here  we have seen in the past one or two years ago  it was ‚Ç¨5 billion roughly a margin requirement here and collateral we had available and more than 90% is euro cash basically.And that increased now to a level of ‚Ç¨50 billion  ‚Ç¨60 billion. So it's 10x higher. And obviously  here  we get also some fee income. So this is the concept. And the question  how sustainable is that now? So on the one hand side  I would say  at Clearstream. So we expect at the market that continue to increase wages for the Fed and even for the ECB  at least for the next months. So that will further strengthen our NII at Clearstream.On the other hand side  if rates continue to increase  there's a higher probability that our customer cash balances will decrease and we will see. So far  it did not decrease so far until end of September. But from a logical perspective  it should continue to decrease as there is a high incentive for the treasuries and the banks due to efficient cash allocation.And with regard to the margins at ECG and ECC  they won't drop on a short-term basis. So that's much more stable for -- at least for the next months  right? I wouldn't say for the next years  but it's much more stable than potentially the customer cash balances could be a little bit more volatile.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerJust a question following up on the cost in terms of the ‚Ç¨1.8 billion kind of targeted for this year. If we think about that  how much of that is kind of costs that are being brought forward from next year? And if you can just clarify just in terms of the last statements you made in your prepared remarks about how we should think about the cost base as we look out to 2023? I suspect the ‚Ç¨1.8 billion should allow you to still generate operating leverage next year. Is that how -- is that correct?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Mike. I think the cost topic is an important topic  that's good that we can a little bit elaborate on that. So I think this year is a very specific year this effect  we hadn't even not planned for  right? So we had plan for this M&A  right  as we were aware for that and that cost increase shouldn't be a surprise.So the FX impact to 3% or 3-plus percent I think that's a little bit of a surprise. But the good thing on a P&L perspective  that FX impact will be compensated by higher impact on the net revenue. So at FX stronger U.S. dollar is positive for Deutsche B√∂rse that shouldn't be a concern at all for all of us.So we are more focused on what we say the operating organic cost growth on a constant portfolio basis  so a constant FX basis. And so that's roughly the 8% we have to talk about. And here  we have two elements. So the one is the inflation. That's roughly 4%. I think that's even good because the journal inflation is 8%. You are aware of that. So that's even below that level. But it's more than we originally expected when we made up our plan.And this component  I would assume  will continue to be there also in next year. The other  let's say  4% increase  share payments and specifically bonus  right? That is due to our very successful performance in this year. And so we pay higher bonus than originally planned. This is obviously not sustainable. So having a much more tougher year next in 2023  so most probably bonus could even go down compared to the plus 4%.So taking these 4 components  so M&A  FX  inflation and compensation. So just the inflation part will continue to happen next year or the other three could disappear  M&A  we will finally see it really will disappear. But the variable compensation could be even lower. So it would be a decrease in next year. So to cut a long story short  so this 16% cost  what we have seen here. And our guidance  we expect a similar growth in Q4. That's why we say it's slightly above ‚Ç¨1.8 billion.So for 2023  we do not expect at all double-digit cost. So it will be clearly single digit from today's perspective  where we just have to deal with the inflationary aspect and obviously  we are currently in the process of doing the budgeting and therefore  we have some scenario planning  and we are also able to deliver on a contingent cost base.So I would -- from my perspective  overall  that's exceptional development in 2022 from a cost perspective  2023 will come back to a level you are used to see in the past.Theodor WeimerIf I may add  Mike  Theodor here  right? Gregor is stating now from a technical point of view  what happened this year and what can you expect next year? And I can fully underscore what Gregor said. From a strategic point of view  I always said  and I'll stick to this statement here today again  right. Always said  cost growth rate should not be higher than the secular growth of the company. And as Gregor pointed out in his presentation  we are growing 8% secularly this year  and our cost rate -- organic cost rate increases exactly 8%  right?And next year  that was question what you can expect is if the organic growth rate is in the range of 5%  6% or whatever or 7%  right? Then you take it as a commitment of the CFO and CEO that we say  we stick to this commitment  right? Cost shall not overrun taking the FX side and the M&A side shall not over on organic growth rates on the revenue side  secular growth rates on the revenue side.OperatorThe next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citigroup.Andrew CoombsJust firstly  just to come back to the costs. You talked about some temporary costs that are dropping away next year. Can you just elaborate and quantify what those temporary costs are? Second question  when I look at your Eurex revenue per contract  that seems to have surprised positively. So perhaps you could talk about some of the pricing dynamics there  whether that was a change in pricing or whether that was just mix effect between the different asset classes and contracts?Gregor PottmeyerYes  interesting. Thanks for the question. Yes  with regard to the temporary development of the cost  so I already elaborated when I answered Mike's question a little bit on that  but to be more precise here. So they are basically  I'd say easily 4x -- 4% cost increase. And so the variable compensation is definitely of temporary nature or it's related to this more than 20% top line and bottom line growth. And no one expects the same development next year having debt at higher starting point.So most probably  the variable compensation will go down compared to this year's development. So out of this plus 4% or plus 5%  you will see minus something most probably  right? So that's why we say that's definitely temporary of nature.Then the FX is temporary of nature because now serve as a starting point from a U.S. dollar perspective  as an average  slightly above parity. So yes  it could even go down a little bit further  but the big jump you have seen now. And therefore  the FX impact  if it does not completely disappear is much smaller compared to this year.M&A  that depends whether we are doing additional M&A yes or no. And so as a conclusion  only the inflationary impact will continue to happen next year.With regard to your second question  Eurex revenue per contract. So that's obviously just depending on the product mix  right? So if they are traded more products where we have a higher revenue level  then that contributes  obviously  positive if you do an average calculation on Eurex. So a substantial change of the revenue per contract on product level does not happen.Andrew CoombsOkay. Just to put point because I think what you're referring to is temporary growth factors around the temporary absolute cost contribution because unless FX rates change or unless you were to divest one of the businesses you've acquired  that's obviously here to stay going into next year. But perhaps I can push you on that variable compensation component exactly how is that calibrated and calculated as a percentage of your revenue and EBITDA growth? And how much of your overall personnel expenses  does that account for?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So overall  so bonus are in the level of 10% of our operating expenses  and so the level is definitely above the level we have planned for  right? And if we exceed our plans  what we definitely do is more than 20%  then obviously  the bonus level is much higher.And now it depends on the variability of the salary  obviously  the highest variability you see on the executive and on the management board level and the lowest you see on the staff level. So -- and in average  there's obviously a fluctuation of  let's say  20% to 30% out of this number  whether we are able -- whether we are very successful or whether we are in line with our plan or even if we are below our plan.OperatorNext question is Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyQuestion on EEX and the European commodity clearing in particular. Maybe you can speak a bit more about the stress you see in the system? Are we past the peak after the government supports various government measures? So maybe a bit in the short term. And then what does it mean for medium to long term? Do you think this issue of counterparty risk is a real accelerator for your market share or more steady continuously structured story of taking market share from OTC players?Gregor PottmeyerOkay. What we currently see is that we passed the peak  right? So we have seen in the peak times and the margin  the collateral  I think  is the best indicator for that. It was in the range of ‚Ç¨100 billion. And today  it's more in the range of ‚Ç¨50 billion to ‚Ç¨60 billion.And you see that -- and the reason for that is that you have seen over the last weeks that gas and power prices decreased  significantly decreased  right? So people think now that we are able to manage the next winter at least  right? So that's why the prices are going down. And that's obviously good. So that's the stress out of this system is decreasing here  and hopefully  that will continue to happen.I think for us  it's -- and we are proud that we are really able to manage even in that stress the duration  our exchange and our clearing house here at Eurex and we were to work together with all the market participants and the market participants were able to deliver the necessary collateral and even with the German government and even on the European level  we are in close discussion and they are strongly supportive to help that markets are open and that we have a clear market-led solution here.And even if you see some discussion around pricing cap and so on  so the basic logic still is that if government or EU commission would like to see a cap that this will be compensated by the government  so the delta between the market price and the cap price. And so that helps us to continue to help here the market solutions here.With regard to the medium to long-term aspect  so currently  we see due to that stress in the system that our market share even increased. So in the European power derivatives market  it's currently 58%. So a year ago  it was 40% or 40 plus or something like that. So it's now 58%.But what we also see is that the trading volume is going down. I told you that the power derivatives revenue in Q3 decreased adjusted trading fees by 11%. And it's going down. And the reason for that is  yes  if you have to put in a lot of collateral and margins  obviously  your flexibility to trade a lot is certainly limited at that point of time.What we expect for the mid- to long-term view that this will reasonably calibrate. So we expect that our margins and collateral requirements will go down and that the trading activity will continue to increase. And the secular growth drivers from our perspective are all intact.So with regard to renewables and carbon certificates  hydrogen markets and so on. So that's all positive for us. So for the mid- to long term  we expect this will come back to a normal situation. Then trading activity will increase  margin will go down  the fee income on the margin will go down. And overall  we think we are well prepared without this extraordinary impact today to grow double-digit also for the next year.OperatorThe next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtSo obviously  there's very strong revenue growth of 30% in the quarter. Just wondering  could you more specifically provide the FX in the third quarter? And how much FX added to the revenue growth? And you also disclosed 8% secular revenue growth for the third quarter  specifically in your financial statement. Can you clarify whether any of that secular growth includes an FX benefit or is that purely constant currency as well? .Gregor PottmeyerYes. So the second part is quite clear. So the secular growth is without FX impact. So the FX impact we include in the cyclical cost. Your first question  what is the FX impact on our revenues? So on our cost side  it's roughly 3%. And on our revenue  it's in the range of 1% to 2%  so 1.5%  something like that.Kyle VoigtOkay. And that was for the third quarter specifically  Gregor?Gregor PottmeyerYes. It's specifically also true for the third quarter.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonI guess just thinking about M&A activity  clearly  looking into 2023  it looks like after a banner year this year  it's going to be a little bit more challenging potentially from a cyclical standpoint. So does that mean -- does that likely accelerate some of your M&A plans? I mean  obviously  there's some notable sort of valuation decreases in the fund platform space  for example.So perhaps if you could outline where you think looks kind of most interesting on this sort of nonorganic side? And then just remind us where you are in terms of your sort of current balance sheet leverage and therefore  capacity to do deals from sort of balance sheet as of today or year-end?Theodor Weimerhank you  Bruce. Let me take the first one and the capacity shall be taken then by Gregor as always. Let me share with you a couple of observations which are certainly new to the majority of you -- on the M&A side  it's very clear. The M&A market has changed fundamentally over the last 12 months  not only on the tech side  but particularly in the tech and data side where we are particularly interested in  right. Point number one. Everybody understands that the interest rates have increased the capital cost  right  and therefore  per se  every day  you have to be even more selective.Point number three  from my point of view  some 12 months ago  even less  right  the market -- M&A market has been a pure sellers market  right? So the sellers basically said  I'm willing to sell if and then they demand it and egress the high numbers. This has also fundamentally changed. We're now seeing clearly a buyer's market. And the fact that we are potentially a very fought after strategic buyer  we received lots of inbound calls. But -- and that's point number four  from my point of view  you need differentiate between private and public market developments.On the public market side valuations  as you said  Bruce  have come down significantly already. On the private side  I don't know what happens. But as you can imagine  some of the holders of the private side  private asset side  there's still dream of the good old days  some 8 to 18 months ago. So they have not -- some of them might not have realized that valuations have changed that the market has fundamentally changed.And therefore  what we currently see is lots of opportunities  right? But I need to state also very clearly  we can become and we are even more selective given the situation that we are -- and you listen to what we have said today. We can look back and also look forward to the next quarter. We have pretty strong results  financial results. Nobody right is forcing us to be very aggressive on the way.And last but not least  with regards to certain areas you were mentioning hinting in a certain direction. Of course  we do not comment on any specific M&A targets  but you can be assured we will -- we are very reasonable. We are not under pressure. We are highly selective and determined to do if you do deals. We do good deals. And if you simply look in what happened on the data side  especially on the ISS side  that's a big  big positive right of what we can report here for the year 2022.Gregor PottmeyerAnd your second question with regard to the balance sheet  obviously  you are aware that  that S&P just confirmed our AA rating because we are able to come back to the grid threshold at year-end without doing further M&A. So that was positively confirmed also from S&P.Here  you can see that we are back in a situation to have financial flexibility because we are very cash generative every year  more than ‚Ç¨1.5 billion cash we generate every year. So funding is not a limitation or refinancing is not a limitation for our M&A activity. So we have enough headroom here available from a cash perspective  from a debt -- additional debt perspective or on even some equity perspective  where we have treasury shares and authorization.And also from a structuring and M&A deal  there's not always a need that we need additional cash. So we can also bring in some assets doing some joint venture or partnerships as we have done for instance  this continue in our stock business. So overall  from a funding refinancing perspective  there are no limitation for M&A deals.OperatorThe next question comes from Philip Middleton from Bank of America.Philip MiddletonThank you very much for the presentation today. Just to round out the cost discussion. Entirely understand how you're segregating the cost between some things which are obviously going to drop away like the variable comp and some things which should happen that are outside your control of the inflation.But are you saying that there's a cap at the rate of inflation  which is your organic growth? Or -- because you used to talk about operating leverage sort of being built into the model. And if you -- is that still the case? Or how should we actually think about operating leverage in the current environment?Gregor PottmeyerYes. Thanks  Philip for specifically asking that  that operating leverage topic. So overall  we show on our existing portfolio  strong operating leverage  right? If you take  for instance  our Eurex business and -- or even our Trading & Clearing business  and doing -- and comparing the EBITDA margin last year compared with this year  then you see a nice increase.So for the existing business  we are able to show operating leverage. And the old formula for whether we trade 15 million or 10 million contracts a day  there are no additional costs with regard to that. So we are able to show that even in some times with a little bit more in inflation. So that's a clear commitment of us as a management team.When you do this operating leverage on a group level  so there are additional aspects why we are not able to show an increased EBITDA margin. So first is that we're currently doing M&A in an area where we achieve -- so for instance  with regard to ISS in the range of EBITDA margin of 30% to 35%. So it's clearly above the 58% what you see as an average. So this dilutes basically our M&A margin.And secondly  last year  we had a strong equity result of some ‚Ç¨85 million. And this year  roughly ‚Ç¨30 million. So we also do some on a group level perspective. But from an operational perspective  we are strongly committed to continue to show operating leverage in our existing business.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschYes. One on the secular growth  the 8% you pointed out in Q3. Could you elaborate bits on it again  maybe also allocating a share to Eurex especially  overall you guided for a kind of 5%  you demonstrated that over the past three years  year-to-date  you achieved 6%. So how should we think about the 8%? And how much is really coming from Eurex and not the other growth segments that we were talking about?Theodor WeimerSo Eurex is also in the range of 8%  like the average on group level. So how do we calibrate the secular growth? So in principle  we consider secular growth if we are able to increase our market shares  if we win new market segments  if we build up new products. And here  we've done from with regard to new products  we don't say just a new product out of this year because of product side  let's say  five to seven years.So we go back 5 to 7 years and say  what are the new products here. And we consider still for instance  at Eurex  but just have to give you some examples that we say our derivatives on MSCI level as just said  such a product or total return futures  we define as a new product or still dividend and volatility derivatives. So just to give you a few examples.So all the revenue increase we are able to achieve in this new product category. So this we show as a secular growth. And that's basically true for all the other segments. So we have here a clear distinction what we say  that's basically more a sustainable level  this is 8% and when you say the 12% on a cyclical basis. So that is just specifically linked to the specific situation this year with its higher volatility  and that depends basically what we will see in the next year. But the secular growth is defined as a sustainable growth rate also for the future.Tobias LukeschAnd given the fact that you were also emphasizing new clients and also market share gains in the various segments. Is it fair to assume that this kind of 8% secular growth is something you're not worried about over the next quarters? Or it could even be accelerated? I mean  what is your kind of view on that development?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So you are aware that on our Investor Day and end of June. So we guided at least a 5% secular growth rate  right? So -- and that's what we're definitely targeting for and what we are committed to deliver also for the next year. But this 8% is above our average here. And my guess would be even in Q4  we would have good chances to deliver this 8%  but for the next three to five years  things like that. So our commitment is to achieve at least 5% cyclical.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.Johannes ThormannSome follow-up questions  please. First of all  on the NII dynamic. What do you think are -- as you have given a broad range between ‚Ç¨5 billion to ‚Ç¨50 billion margin calls? What is a normalized collateral or margin level in energy business? And at what point in time in Clearstream  do you think you have to share upcoming rate hikes with the customers? And regarding the M&A pipeline or your thoughts on the change in the market  just would be great to know if the dynamic has hinted talks and postpone talks? Or have they actually intensified discussions?Gregor PottmeyerSo I'll start with the first question and Theodor handle the M&A question. So with regard to NII  what is the right level at our clearing -- commodity clearinghouse ECC. So it's difficult to judge  I think. So yes  I told you two years ago  it was ‚Ç¨5 billion and now it's ‚Ç¨50 billion ‚Ç¨60 billion. I don't think that it will come back to the ‚Ç¨5 billion right it.But it's difficult to get whether for the next three to five years  right? What is the right number here. I think it will be a double-digit ‚Ç¨1 billion a month because we continue to grow but it's really difficult to judge.But on a short-term basis  it won't go down sharply due to the ‚Ç¨5 billion. So that's what we -- not expect and the situation in gas and power is obviously not solved  even it's currently a little bit relaxed  but it's by far more soft  and you will see high volatility also in 2023. So I don't think that the margins will go significantly down.Your second question with regard to sharing NII results at Clearstream that we will see that. So the higher the amount we will achieve  the more we have also to consider to talk to our clients. So far  up to now  we do not share  but at certain point in time  I think there will be the need also to share.Theodor WeimerAnd Johannes on the M&A side  whether it's an answer whether the overall environment descending discussions. I can be very  very smart and referred to the M&A market globally as such  it is basically M&A shrink significantly. But I would say without saying anything beyond what I'm saying  right  on our side  it's rather such that the level of inbound calls  the level of ideas  which we are getting is rather enhanced.OperatorAnd next up is Ian White from Autonomous Research.Ian WhiteJust a couple of follow-ups from my side  please. First up  I think earlier you said there is a sort of a one-off software impairment that's impacting depreciation and amortization this quarter. Could you just call that out for us  please  in terms of how much that was? Sorry if I've missed it in the presentation or the release  but that would be helpful.And just secondly  on M&A  I think you said on the call earlier this year  you were perhaps less focused on fund services M&A due to sort of strong organic progression there. Am I right to take from your earlier remarks on this call that you might be more open to inorganic growth in Fund Services now? And how does the carve-out of the Fund Services business from Clearstream help to enable M&A if at all  please?Theodor WeimerSo the first question is very easy. So this one-off software is roughly ‚Ç¨5 million. And the second question with regard to M&A. I think you are aware of this carve out in our investment Fund Service business. So that's continuing to be right on track  right? So we are able to deliver what we want to achieve. So 2023 is the year where we are able to achieve our targets. And therefore  we would be also prepared to do partnerships in that way when we want to.And so it's -- from an M&A perspective  it's difficult to judge what customers would like to do because customers have always three opportunities to work together with Deutsche B√∂rse Investment Fund Services. So they can easily connect to our platform  they can outsource. So these two elements we show as an organic growth.And thirdly  they can sell the business  right? So with regard to HSBC  that was basically an outsourcing contract  right? So very successful have won that with regard to Kneip  there was a decision that we don't want to buy the business or and the Kneip asset owner wanted to sale. So that's why we say  in principle  fund services is of high interest of Deutsche B√∂rse  whether it's organic  inorganic partner approach. So therefore  we are open and flexible. And with regard to preparing all until year-end and fulfilling that in 2023  this carve-out for this fund service business  we are even more flexible to do partnerships.OperatorAnd we're coming to the next question  and it comes from Haley Tam from Credit Suisse.Haley TamQuick follow-up on costs  if I may. And then a question about the cash equities market. In terms of costs  can I just pick up? I think you said earlier that you had a 4% impact of inflation in the 9 months so far  and you noted that was lower than the current rate of inflation. So we should interpret this to mean that you are expecting there to be further inflationary impact in your organic cost growth next year and that will be within the perimeter when you're thinking about the comparison to secular revenue growth. So I just wanted to check on that.And any comments you might have there in terms of wage inflation  in particular  I guess would be particularly interesting to me. In terms of the cash equities market  you did note there that you had seen some loss of market share has had all other market participants due to a competitor stepping up the liquidity payments. And I just wondered whether you consider a one-off shift in market share or whether you are actually considering any plans to match those payments to win back share?Gregor PottmeyerYes. So with regard to your first question of cost and this year  4% in inflation  so -- and my comment that inflation will not disappear is not to understand in the way that it will increase next year  right? But it won't go down. So we all do not know what are the final outcome and specific with regard to the wage increase. And that we are in the process and just started that process to talk about with our workers council and soon  so no decisions are made.But in principle  this 4% inflation most probably will not increase next year  but you will see a comparable number also in 2023 and whether these are triggered by one-off payments to people or either to regular increase. So that we will see how the final decisions will end  but I don't expect that the inflation will increase at least not the 4% overall on personnel costs  nonpersonnel costs and in average for Deutsche B√∂rse across all locations.The second question with regard to the cash equity business. Yes  there's one aggressive competitor currently in Europe underway  and they make attractive liquidity program. So they invest basically to win market share. And -- you can be sure that we obviously monitor that situation that we are not happy with the development. And so that we are currently in the process to implement counteractive measures to stop that and -- you will see that in the next weeks and months.Haley TamThe cost answer was very clear. And if I could be cheeky just in terms of those counteractive measures  we should keep a close eye on your revenue yield then  would that be the right interpretation?Gregor PottmeyerIt depends how the countermeasures look like  right? So -- is it about processes  functionality? Is it about the market model? Is it about a temporary liquidity program. So it really depends on the single concrete countermeasures  but you can be sure that it won't accept that situation.OperatorThe follow-up question comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerI appreciate the follow-up. You guys have been highlighting you expect about 1% tailwinds to revenues coming from pricing power. I was just wondering if you're thinking about that has changed. That was in a low inflation environment. Now that inflation has picked up. Have you changed your thoughts about pricing as we look out over the next couple of years? .Gregor PottmeyerSorry  I was muted. So sorry not to be yet. So from a pricing perspective  so the impact you currently see on the revenue this year and next year  so the pricing impact is more than 1% currently. And so also  we use the opportunity to increase prices  but we don't do it always straightforward  let's say  on trading fees. So we talk about volume rebate schemes and renter or introducing service fees and so on. So there are different ways how to do that. But the current impact is higher than the 1% you have seen in the past.Looking forward  medium to long term  our focus is still unchanged. Our focus is having attractive liquidity platform. So having the lowest spread as possible being benchmarked. So our focus is on winning market share  winning liquidity and not using the pricing power. So even if the pricing mechanism is currently higher than the 1% on a mid- to long-term basis  I would expect to keep that 1% level.Jan StreckerAll right. This was the last question for today.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

Median is positioning itself to become the strategic partner to extract insights from medical images by applying AI solutions to better understand the mechanism of action of new drugs. Therefore  we are becoming the natural provider for clinical studies. With this strong and unique differentiator  we expect to see a clear impact on our iCRO order backlog in the coming months.Our iBiopsy¬Æ activities have also been very intense during the quarter with the formation of a first class clinical advisory board and our continued interaction with the FDA for our iBiopsy¬Æ LCS CADe/CADx SaMD which is following its natural course. We still expect to start our pivotal study in the coming months. Furthermore  the European Union has announced that lung cancer screening1 will become one of the main priorities for the new cancer plan ‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs beating cancer plan‚Äù  which should substantially increase our total addressable market in the coming years.‚ÄùFurther growth during Q3 2022Third quarter revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨6.0 million  representing a 13% increase compared to Q3 2021 revenues (‚Ç¨5.3 million). Revenues for the first three quarters of 2022 were ‚Ç¨18.7 million  up 21% compared to the ‚Ç¨15.4 million for the first three quarters of 2021. Revenues are entirely generated by the iCRO2 business  which provides imaging services to the biopharmaceutical industry worldwide for oncology clinical trials.The order backlog3 was ‚Ç¨62.5 million on September 30  2022   up ‚Ç¨8.3 million compared to September 30  2021 (‚Ç¨54.2 million  +15%).Cash and cash equivalents totaled ‚Ç¨25.9 million on September 30  2022  including receipt of the 2021 research and innovation tax credit for ‚Ç¨1.6 million  and benefiting from the collection of late payments from the second quarter by the Chinese subsidiary following the lockdown in the Shanghai region.Financial information at June 30  2022 (IFRS consolidated financial statements)Median Technologies continued robust growth momentum during the first half of 2022 .Cash flow statementCash flow (‚Ç¨ thousands) 06/30/2022(six months) 06/30/2021(six months) Operating cash flow (5 682) (3 961) Change in operating working capital Requirement (4 390) (2 485) Net cash flow from operating activities (10 072) (6 446) Net cash flow from investing activities (662) (417) Net cash flow from financing activities (155) 27 355 Impact of changes in exchange rates 120 126 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (10 769) 20 618 Cash at end of period 28 241 36 933The Company continued the development program of its iBiopsy¬Æ Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) CADe/CADx software as medical device (SaMD)  which resulted in an increase of the cash flow deficit  partially offset by the additional margins generated by the growing iCRO business.Working capital requirements deteriorated temporarily due to the closure of Chinese administration offices during the lockdown in Shanghai  which delayed the invoicing and collection process for trade receivables.

This valuation has been significantly impacted by changes in the share price since the issue of these warrants.

This trend  which impacts the Company's revenue compared to the previous year‚Ä¶,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:During the first 9 months of the year  Axway (Euronext: AXW.PA) (Paris:AXW) confirmed the ramp-up of its cloud-based subscription offerings. This trend  which impacts the Company's revenue compared to the previous year due to lower anticipated revenue recognition  did not prevent the total value of all subscription contracts signed (TCV) from increasing significantly over 9 months (+29%)  despite the slippage of several large Customer Managed deals towards the end of the year.At product level  Axway continued to deploy its strategy focused on its key offerings. At the same time  customer interest in the Company's 4 main product lines remained strong:- the Amplify API Management platform continued to attract new customers with 31% growth in the value of new customer bookings over the first 9 months of 2022. Additionally  at the end of August  Axway was positioned as a Leader in The Forrester WaveTM API Management Solutions  Q3 20222. This new distinction confirms the relevance of the Company's vision of an open platform and a focus on helping customers expand the use of their APIs.- MFT new customer bookings have grown 96% since the beginning of the year. Q3 also saw the launch by Axway of a new partnership with Pro2col to help accelerate enterprise MFT adoption across the UK and Ireland - the value of new customer bookings for the B2B integration platform continued to grow during the quarter  reaching 782% year-to-date growth. This performance was driven by significant Axway Managed subscription deals  where customers entrusted Axway to run their B2B infrastructure and operations  allowing them to reduce their internal resources and focus on their core competencies - A new version of the Axway Financial Accounting Hub offering was launched  enabling Axway to engage in the financial ERP market  which is moving towards the cloud  with a complete SaaS/hybrid platform.Patrick Donovan  Axway's Chief Executive Officer  said:‚ÄúThe transition to a stable recurring revenue model from a traditional license business is a significant challenge  as seen again this year with the irregular revenue recognition we‚Äôre experiencing. Business momentum is moving in the right direction as our total bookings grew 16% over the first 3 quarters of 2022 and our overall subscription bookings have been even more dynamic  with 29% growth over the period. However  our revenue does not yet accurately reflect this commercial success and this is explained by the rise of our cloud Axway Managed subscription offers  whose weight in the total value of our bookings doubled year-on-year  from 13% to 26%. As I had the opportunity to explain when I presented our half-year results last July  our revenue will be more stable and predictable in the future thanks to the accumulation of this type of contract whose total earnings are recognized over time.

Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of ‚Ç¨5.8m on quarterly revenue  due to the appreciation of the of the US Dollar against the Euro.Axway Software: Revenue by business line 3rd Quarter 2022 (‚Ç¨m) Q3 2022 Q3 2021Restated* Q3 2021Reported TotalGrowth OrganicGrowth License 2.3 5.3 4.7 -51.7% -56.7% Subscription 27.4 30.2 27.8 -1.7% -9.5% Maintenance 28.3 31.8 29.5 -4.2% -11.1% Services 9.6 8.3 7.7 23.9% 15.8% Axway Software 67.5 75.6 69.8 -3.3% -10.7% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesRevenue from the License activity amounted to ‚Ç¨2.3m in Q3 2022 (3% of total revenue)  representing an organic decline of 56.7%. As expected  the activity is still slowing down significantly due to the availability of Subscription offers that are meeting strong demand for all the key products in Axway's portfolio.Subscription revenue totaled ‚Ç¨27.4m in Q3 2022 (41% of total revenue)  down 1.7% overall and 9.5% organically. This trend is explained by the high comparison basis established in Q3 2021 (+27.1%) and the decline in recognized upfront revenue  which Axway Managed revenue growth over the period was insufficient to offset.In line with expectations  revenue from the Maintenance activity amounted to ‚Ç¨28.3m (42% of total revenue) in Q3 2022  representing a total decline of 4.2% and an organic decline of 11.1%. The migration of value from certain maintenance operations to Subscription has continued and  on a full-year basis  Axway anticipates a decline in activity similar to that seen over the first 9 months of the year.At the end of September 2022  Axway's Annual Recurrent Revenue (ARR) was ‚Ç¨191.1m  up 6.6% compared to the end of September 2021. Recurring revenue for the quarter  which includes Subscription and Maintenance activities  represented 83% of the Company's revenue for the period  i.e. ‚Ç¨55.7m  including upfront revenue of ‚Ç¨7.5m recognized on the signing of Customer Managed subscription contracts.The Services activity generated revenues of ‚Ç¨9.6m in Q3 2022 (14% of total revenues)  with organic growth of 15.8% and 23.9% in total. Still heavily impacted last year by travel restrictions in certain regions  the activity is gradually readjusting with a significant increase compared to the favorable comparison basis from which it benefits.Axway Software: Revenue by geographic area 3rd Quarter 2022 (‚Ç¨m) Q3 2022 Q3 2021Restated* Q3 2021Reported TotalGrowth OrganicGrowth France 15.1 19.3 19.3 -21.8% -21.8% Rest of Europe 14.7 14.0 14.0 4.5% 4.8% Americas 32.8 37.5 32.2 1.8% -12.6% Asia/Pacific 5.0 4.8 4.3 15.9% 3.5% Axway Software 67.5 75.6 69.8 -3.3% -10.7% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesFrance reported revenue of ‚Ç¨15.1m in Q3 2022 (22% of total revenue)  a decrease of 21.8% compared to Q3 2021. Growth in Axway Managed subscription contracts and Services did not compensate for the low level of upfront revenue recognized over the quarter.The Rest of Europe region grew organically by 4.8% in Q3 2022 thanks to revenue of ‚Ç¨14.7m  representing 22% of total revenue. Strong growth in Subscription and Services offset the decline in revenue from other activities. This trend is due to the signing in the region of several multi-year Customer Managed subscription contracts  with customers wishing to take advantage of the latest versions of Axway's APIM  B2B and MFT offerings.The Americas generated revenue of ‚Ç¨32.8m in Q3 2022 (49% of total revenue)  up 1.8% overall and down 12.6% organically. In the region  the strong increase in demand for Axway Managed subscription offerings explains the decline in recognized revenue compared to Q3 2021.The Asia/Pacific region saw its revenue grow by 3.5% organically and 15.9% in total to reach ‚Ç¨5.0m for the quarter (7% of total revenue). As in the first six months of the year  strong Subscription and Services momentum was the main reason for Axway's satisfactory performance in the region.Financial position at September 30  2022At September 30  2022  Axway had cash of ‚Ç¨24.3m and net debt of ‚Ç¨65.6m.Axway highlights that  if necessary  it has access to available financing capacity under its existing revolving credit facility.2022 Targets & OutlookAxway maintains its objective of achieving organic revenue growth of between 1% and 3% in 2022. The Company also aims to improve its profitability  with a margin on operating activities of between 12% and 14% of revenue for the year.In the medium term  Axway's ambitions remain:‚Üí to achieve revenue of ‚Ç¨500m through organic growth in sales and acquisitions‚Üí to return to operating margin on business activity rates above 15%‚Üí to sustainably increase earnings per share to above ‚Ç¨1Financial CalendarWednesday  February 22  2023  after market closing: Publication of 2022 Full-Year ResultsWednesday  February 22  2023  6:30 pm (UTC+1): 2022 Full-Year Results Virtual Analyst ConferenceGlossary and Alternative Performance MeasuresACV: Annual Contract Value ‚Äì Annual contract value of a subscription agreement.ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue ‚Äì Expected annual billing amounts from all active maintenance and subscription agreements.Employee Engagement Score: Measurement of employee engagement through an independent annual survey.Growth at constant exchange rates: Growth in revenue between the period under review and the prior period restated for exchange rate impacts.NPS: Net Promoter Score ‚Äì Customer satisfaction and recommendation indicator for a company.Organic growth: Growth in revenue between the period under review and the prior period  restated for consolidation scope and exchange rate impacts.Profit on operating activities: Profit from recurring operations adjusted for the non-cash share-based payment expense  as well as the amortization of allocated intangible assets.Restated revenue: Revenue for the prior year  adjusted for the consolidation scope and exchange rates of the current year.TCV: Total Contract Value ‚Äì Full contracted value of a subscription agreement over the contract term.DisclaimerThis press release contains forward-looking statements that may be subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning Axway‚Äôs growth and profitability  notably in the event of future acquisitions.

Revenue of the Printhead Solutions segment recovered to levels in line with the third quarter of 2021 after having experienced a severe downturn in H1 due to the global shortage of electronic components. Group revenue for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year despite experiencing more challenging business conditions than a year ago.‚ÄúThe third quarter results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69 000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of ‚Ç¨3.3 million which closed in July. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as ‚ÄúOther Income‚Äù and is not included in our revenue figures  but it is accretive to EBITDA.‚ÄúGroup EBITDA was significantly up in Q3 thanks to better operational performance across the board and the sale of the IPv4 internet addresses. EBITDA for the quarter was ‚Ç¨4.58 million compared to ‚Ç¨1.61 million for Q3 2021. Credit is due to the entire team for rising to the challenge of these difficult business conditions  and our smaller businesses which focus on colour management  3-D visualisation  and legacy printing devices deserve special mention for outperforming their revenue and cost targets.‚ÄúAlthough business conditions remain challenging  with rising inflation and the war in Ukraine causing uncertainty for our customers  we have delivered profitable growth throughout the difficult climate of the pandemic  and we expect to continue this in the future‚Äù.Financial highlights for the nine months ended 30 September 2022The following information is unaudited.For the quarter ended 30 September 2022Revenue for the period was ‚Ç¨11.29 million (2021: ‚Ç¨10.09 million)EBITDA for the period was ‚Ç¨4.58 million  or 41% of revenue (2021: ‚Ç¨1.61 million  16% of revenue)Story continuesFor the nine months ended 30 September 2022Revenue for the period was ‚Ç¨34.73 million (2021: ‚Ç¨33.87 million)EBITDA for the period was ‚Ç¨9.20 million  or 26% of revenue (2021: ‚Ç¨7.42 million  22% of revenue)Segment analysisThe following tables provide unaudited information about revenue from external customers and EBITDA for the Group's operating segments for the current and previous financial years.

By enhancing our portfolio of solutions and accelerating our technology investments  we continue to increase the efficiency of our digital platform  providing our clients with best-in-class experiences increasingly tailored to their needs. Our solutions  which are synonymous with higher purchasing power for employees and greater efficiency for fleet managers  are even more relevant in today‚Äôs inflationary environment. In these circumstances  our powerful go-to-market enables us to speed up our market penetration  notably in the SME segment. We are confident as the year draws to an end and are upgrading our EBITDA outlook. We will present our strategic plan and prospects for the coming three years next week.‚ÄùTurkey is now qualified as a hyperinflationary economy.

This year-on-year increase includes a favorable currency effect (+3.8%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.1%). On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 21.4%.For the first nine months of the year  total revenue came to ‚Ç¨1 428 million  up 22.9% as reported and up 19.2% like-for-like compared with the same period in 2021. Reported growth includes a favorable currency effect (+4.0%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.3%).Operating revenueOperating revenue increased by 23.0% as reported to ‚Ç¨484 million in the third quarter of 2022. The currency effect was a favorable 4.1% and the scope effect was a negative 0.2%. On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue rose by 19.1% year-on-year.Following on from the results achieved in the first half of the year  Edenred delivered double-digit like-for-like operating revenue growth in the third quarter in each of its business lines and in each of the regions where the Group operates. This solid performance reflects the dynamism of Edenred‚Äôs sales teams as well as the Group‚Äôs ability to continuously enhance its portfolio and offer its clients innovative and attractive digital solutions.Operating revenue for the first nine months of 2022 was up by 21.7% as reported and by 17.9% like-for-like compared with the same period in 2021  including a positive currency effect (+4.1%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.4%).Operating revenue by business line(in ‚Ç¨ millions) Third-quarter 2022 Third-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 275 233 +17.7% +15.5% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 143 110 +30.6% +23.6% Complementary Solutions 65 50 +31.3% +26.4% Total 484 393 +23.0% +19.1%(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First nine months 2022 First nine months 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 802 682 +17.7% +15.6% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 395 300 +31.7% +23.9% Complementary Solutions 177 148 +19.6% +16.5% Total 1 375 1 130 +21.7% +17.9%Operating revenue for the Employee Benefits business line  which accounts for 57% of the Group‚Äôs total operating revenue  was ‚Ç¨275 million in third-quarter 2022  a 17.7% year-on-year increase as reported (+15.5% like-for-like).This growth is in line with the Group‚Äôs first-half performance and confirms the strong sales momentum gained by Ticket Restaurant¬Æ meal benefits  notably among SMEs. It also reflects the progressive impact of clients‚Äô greater use of higher face values to protect their employees‚Äô purchasing power  particularly in countries where the maximum face value by law has been raised. Lastly  Beyond Food solutions  notably designed for companies seeking to enhance their employer brand and boost employee engagement  met with strong commercial success. These solutions are all the more relevant amid today‚Äôs structural changes in the workplace and rising inflation.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  operating revenue for Employee Benefits came to ‚Ç¨802 million  up 17.7% as reported (+15.6% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which represents 30% of the Group‚Äôs total operating revenue  operating revenue for third-quarter 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨143 million  up 30.6% year-on-year as reported (+23.6% like-for-like).This strong growth reflects the continued rollout of the Beyond Fuel strategy  notably through the maintenance and toll offering  which is proving highly successful in both Latin America and in Europe. The business also enjoyed strong sales momentum once again  driven by the relevance of its digital  multi-product offering for fleet managers.For the nine months to September 30  operating revenue for Fleet & Mobility Solutions totaled ‚Ç¨395 million  up 31.7% as reported (+23.9% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.The Complementary Solutions business line  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of ‚Ç¨65 million in third-quarter 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This figure was up 31.3% as reported (+26.4% like-for-like) compared with the third quarter of 2021.Corporate Payment Services in North America  operated through Edenred CSI  delivered a solid performance  driven by new contract wins  particularly in segments into which the company has recently expanded such as property management and energy  as well as by the ramp-up of its commercial partnerships with several banks and software companies  including Sage. The strong growth in Complementary Solutions also reflects the success of the Group‚Äôs innovative programs  such as the fully digital Benefit Xpress offering in Taiwan and the new value-added services accessible via the C3Pay mobile app in the United Arab Emirates (salary advances  for example).In the first nine months of the year  operating revenue for Complementary Solutions came to ‚Ç¨177 million  up 19.6% as reported (+16.5% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.Operating revenue by region(in ‚Ç¨ millions) Third-quarter 2022 Third-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 283 241 +17.5% +17.6% Latin America 161 120 +34.6% +19.9% Rest of the World 40 33 +21.1% +27.7% Total 484 393 +23.0% +19.1%(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First nine months 2022 First nine months 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 834 716 +16.5% +16.3% Latin America 432 324 +33.3% +18.0% Rest of the World 109 90 +20.7% +30.0% Total 1 375 1 130 +21.7% +17.9%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨283 million in the third quarter  a year-on-year increase of 17.5% as reported (+17.6% like-for-like). Europe represented 59% of total consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.In the nine months to September 30  2022  operating revenue in the region totaled ‚Ç¨834 million up 16.5% as reported (+16.3% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.In France  operating revenue came to ‚Ç¨71 million for the third quarter  up 8.7% both as reported and like-for-like. This growth reflects the success of the Employee Benefits and Fleet & Mobility Solutions businesses  notably in the SME segment  which remains largely underpenetrated. In particular  it is the result of a very good sales performance by the digital Ticket Restaurant¬Æ solution. This performance was also partially offset by the impact of the daily spending cap being lowered back to its pre-Covid level of ‚Ç¨19 as from July 1  2022 (versus ‚Ç¨38 since June 12  2020) and by an unfavorable basis of comparison with third-quarter 2021  when users spent funds they had accumulated while restaurants and certain retailers were shut. Lastly  solutions rolled out under the Beyond Food strategy  including the ProwebCE employee engagement platform and the remote working platform  continued to deliver robust growth  benefiting from continuous  innovation-driven improvements to the user experience.Operating revenue for France in the first nine months of the year amounted to ‚Ç¨220 million  up 10.4% as reported and like-for-like compared with the first nine months of 2021.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled ‚Ç¨212 million in third-quarter 2022  an increase of 20.8% as reported and like-for-like versus the prior-year period. Employee Benefits enjoyed strong momentum across the region. Ticket Restaurant¬Æ meal benefits once again delivered robust growth  boosted by an increase in face values introduced by clients in the current inflationary context  and the Beyond Food strategy continued to be a success. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  further solid growth in the third quarter was driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy and good sales momentum in the SME segment.For the first nine months of 2022  operating revenue for Europe excluding France came to ‚Ç¨613 million  up 18.8% year-on-year as reported (+18.6% like-for-like).Operating revenue in Latin America came to ‚Ç¨161 million for the third quarter  a rise of 34.6% as reported (+19.9% like-for-like) compared with the third quarter of 2021. Latin America represented 33% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  operating revenue came to ‚Ç¨432 million  up 33.3% as reported (+18.0% like-for-like).In Brazil  operating revenue rose by 16.2% like-for-like in third-quarter 2022 versus third-quarter 2021. Fleet & Mobility Solutions continued to be driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel offering in maintenance and toll services. Employee Benefits delivered a good sales performance thanks to the continued penetration of the SME segment  supported notably by the growing contribution of the partnership with Ita√∫ Unibanco and the success of the virtual canteen solution.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Brazil grew by 16.8% like-for-like.In Hispanic Latin America  third-quarter 2022 operating revenue was up 27.9% like-for-like versus the same period in 2021. This robust performance reflects a sharp acceleration in the Employee Benefits business  as well as further strong growth in Fleet & Mobility Solutions.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Hispanic Latin America rose by 20.6% like-for-like.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue came to ‚Ç¨40 million for the third quarter  up 21.1% as reported (+27.7% like-for-like). This region represents 8% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.This performance was notably driven by the success of innovative programs proposed in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. In North America  Edenred CSI‚Äôs Corporate Payment Services continued to build on the strong momentum seen in the second quarter  thanks in particular to the ramp-up of its commercial partnerships with several banks and software companies.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in the Rest of the World totaled ‚Ç¨109 million  up 20.7% as reported (+30.0% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.Other revenueOther revenue for the third quarter of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨23 million  up 100.1% as reported (+99.7% like-for-like). This significant increase reflects the impact of strong business growth on the float2  as well as favorable changes in interest rates in all regions where the Group operates. The gradual acceleration in other revenue growth period after period can be attributed to the steady rise in interest rates observed for several quarters now in Europe (outside the euro zone) and Latin America  as well as to the first effects of interest rate increases in the euro zone. For the nine months ended September 30  2022  other revenue came to ‚Ç¨53 million  representing an increase of 67.3% as reported (+65.4% like-for-like).OUTLOOKAfter achieving record results in the first half  Edenred confirmed its very good business momentum in the third quarter.Thanks to its segmented sales approach  Edenred continues to penetrate its core markets  with the economic environment further enhancing the attractiveness of its solutions  which notably enable employers to effectively boost their employees‚Äô purchasing power.Edenred is also unlocking new growth opportunities by expanding its portfolio of solutions to more fully meet clients‚Äô needs. In Employee Benefits  Beyond Food solutions enable companies to enhance their employer brand and boost employee engagement in a fast-changing working world. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  the Beyond Fuel offering (including maintenance and toll management and VAT refund solutions) helps fleet managers control their expenses.

Consequently  the extraordinary resolutions have been debated as listed in the meeting notice published in the French official legal bulletin Bulletin des Annonces L√©gales Obligatoires (BALO) No. 109  dated September 12  2022.The voting rights attached to the shares of the defaulting shareholders represented by the ad hoc representative were exercised at a rate of two thirds votes in favor and one third against  pursuant to the terms of the mission entrusted to the ad hoc representative by order of the President of the Commercial Court of Montpellier dated September 27  2022.All the documents regarding this AGE  including the results of the votes  are available on the Company‚Äôs website: https://www.deinove.com/en/investor-room/documentation-center/general-shareholders-meeting-preparatory-documentsABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the ‚Äúmicrobial dark matter‚Äù. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

As of September 30  2022  the Group‚Äôs sales totalled ‚Ç¨569.2 million  up +5.2% from the same period in 2021 (‚Ç¨541.0 million). The activity includes a very favourable forex effect of ‚Ç¨23.9 million  stemming in large part from the appreciation of the dollar. At constant exchange rates (CER)  9-month revenue increased by +0.8%.After a slight increase in Q1 (+0.5%)  followed by a decrease in Q2 (-3.1%) due to a high basis of comparison  Q3 activity was very dynamic. Revenue reached ‚Ç¨187 million  up +5.1% at CER and +11.4% at current exchange rate.Geographical distribution of consolidated group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at September 30  2022 Change (%)9 months 2022at current exchange ratesChange (%)9 months 2022at constant exchange rates19 months 2021Sales in EMEA -1.8% 245.2 -1.3% 246.5 249.7 Sales in Americas +9.7% 182.5 -2.1% 162.9 166.4 Sales in Asia +13.3% 141.4 +8.8% 135.9 124.9 Total +5.2% 569.2 +0.8% 545.3 541.0[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.In the EMEA region  the Group‚Äôs activity decreased slightly in the first 9 months (-1.3% at CER). Its Q3 activity (+1.5% at CER) benefited from both an increase in volumes and more stable prices after several quarters of erosion.Story continuesIn the Americas region  sales in the first 9 months increased by 9.7% thanks to a very positive forex effect of ‚Ç¨19.6 million over the entire period. At CER  activity was down 2.1% in a context marked by slower activity at the industrial plant in Raleigh (North Carolina) due to recruitment difficulties. However  the improvement of the situation has been concreting since this summer and contributed to the revenue increase in the Americas over Q3 (+0.9% at CER).In Asia  sales growth over the first 9 months reached 13.3% at current exchange rates and 8.8% at CER. It accelerated greatly in Q3 (+18.4% at CER) thanks to a positive trend in activity throughout the region and especially in China (+66.8% at CER)  where sales have fully benefited from the effective implementation of direct distribution since Q2 2022.Distribution of consolidated group revenue by activity (IFRS)In millions of euros at June 30  2022 Change (%)9 months 22at current exchange ratesChange (%)9 months 22at constant exchange rates19 months 2022Diagnostic Imaging +4.9% 502.2 +0.5% 481.5 478.9 MRI +9.6% 192.4 +5.3% 184.8 175.5 X-Ray +2.1% 309.8 -2.2% 296.7 303.4 Interventional Imaging +7.9% 67.0 +2.8% 63.9 62.1 Total +5.2% 569.2 +0.8% 545.3 541.0[1] Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.Revenue from Diagnostic Imaging increased by 0.5% at CER over the first 9 months  with a Q3 up 4.3% compared with the same period in 2021.In MRI   sales over the first 9 months increased by 9.6% at current exchange rates and 5.3% at CER. The acceleration was noticeable in Q3  with an increase of 17.3% at CER and both volumes and prices on the rise.X-Ray revenue at CER decreased by 2.2% at 9 months and 3.1% in Q3 in the wake of the decrease in Optiray¬Æ sales  while Xenetix¬Æ sales remained very steady.In Interventional Imaging  sales at CER increased by 2.8% over the first 9 months thanks to an excellent Q3 marked by 12% growth at CER and remarkable performance for Lipiodol (+15.3%).Adjustment of the 2022 financial targets incorporating necessary measures to accelerate EluciremTM productionOn the one hand  since the beginning of the summer  the Group has seen a significant improvement in production rates at its Raleigh plant  where the implemented measures (new organisation  increased attractiveness) have led to a significant decrease in employee turnover and an upturn in recruitment. However  this improvement has not been as fast as expected.On the other hand  Guerbet is preparing for the commercial launch of EluciremTM. The new contrast agent obtained the FDA‚Äôs marketing authorisation (MA) on September 21. Since then  it has been very well received by the scientific community and has aroused strong buyer interest. To promote a rapid commercial takeoff  the production chains are being adapted at the Raleigh plant to prioritize the production of EluciremTM.Against this backdrop  the Group expects 2022 revenue growth to be less than 2% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates compared with a previously announced range of 2% to 4%. In terms of profitability  Guerbet is now targeting an EBITDA/Revenue ratio between 13% and 14%  excluding extraordinary costs from optimizing the Group‚Äôs operating structure and changing the sales model in China (compared with 14.4% previously announced corresponding to the ratio over the 2021 fiscal year).Upcoming events:Publication of 2022 full-year revenueFebruary 9  2023  after trading1 Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous fiscal year.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Full login details and presentation materials are available at: https://www.voltalia.com/investor-relations""The growth of renewable energy is accelerating. A key element in the fight against global warming  renewable energy has also become the cheapest energy ever produced in history  while meeting the energy security challenges of countries and companies.By creating new renewable power plants on its own behalf and for its customers  while reducing their energy consumption through its subsidiary Helexia  Voltalia is helping to meet the challenge of the energy transition.After achieving an average annual growth in revenues of 46% between 2014  the date of its IPO  and 2021  Voltalia has set itself a new roadmap. While we anticipate that the 2023 capacity target will be reached a year early and confirm the EBITDA target of ‚Ç¨275-300 million in 2023  Voltalia is now targeting operating and construction capacity in excess of 5 gigawatts and a normalised EBITDA of around ‚Ç¨475 million¬π by 2027. In addition  in line with its status as a company with a mission  Voltalia has set a new environmental objective for 2027: over 4 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent avoided‚Äù  commented S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.An extraordinary sectorNumerous structural and economic factors are sustaining the renewable energy sector:Public policies and private initiatives against global warming ;; Intensification of government measures to promote energy independence ;; Trend towards lower costs for renewable energy in a context of rising costs for other energy sources;in a context of rising costs for other energy sources; Willingness of companies to reduce their exposure to the volatility of energy prices in the long term and to lower their energy bills;of energy prices in the long term and to their energy bills; Rise in the electrification of uses with  for example  the emergence of electric vehicles and the gradual switch to electric heating.However  the sector's growth cycle is still in its infancy  and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix should continue to accelerate over the next few years.On the three continents where Voltalia is present:In Europe   which is already committed to the fight against global warming   the war in Ukraine has made energy independence a central priority of government policies. A sudden and sustained acceleration in renewable energy and energy efficiency is taking shape: Europe is once again becoming one of the key global markets;  which is already committed to the   the war in Ukraine has made a central priority of government policies. A sudden and sustained acceleration in renewable energy and energy efficiency is taking shape: Europe is once again becoming one of the key global markets; In Africa   the market remains dynamic due to strong growth in electricity consumption . South Africa  in particular  is going through a major energy crisis. The growth in demand is combined with the country's need to replace ageing coal-fired power plants that are no longer adapted to the needs of the population;  the market remains dynamic due to strong . South Africa  in particular  is going through a major energy crisis. The growth in demand is combined with the country's need to replace ageing coal-fired power plants that are no longer adapted to the needs of the population; In Latin America  population growth is creating structural demand for energy consumption. In addition  Brazil's extremely favourable wind patterns  coupled with good sunshine  will gradually attract electro-intensive industries.A clear mission  a successful business modelVoltalia has been aware of the challenges facing its sector since its creation in 2005. As a responsible player  Voltalia formally defined its mission in 2014  before officially integrating it in its articles of association in 20202. Within this legal framework  Voltalia defines the extra-financial indicators of its mission. These are audited and presented annually to the general meeting  alongside the financial report. Voltalia‚Äôs mission seeks a fair balance between the planet and its inhabitants: improving the global environment while promoting local development. Every day  it guides the actions and decisions of everyone within Voltalia and its governance.Voltalia  directly or through its subsidiaries  implements the energy transition technologies that create the best opportunities:Electricity production: ground-mounted photovoltaic   roof-mounted and car park  onshore wind power   small-scale hydroelectricity and biomass (power plants burning recovered wood);  roof-mounted and car park  onshore   small-scale and (power plants burning recovered wood); Battery storage and potentially other technologies;storage and potentially other technologies; Energy efficiency and energy management.Voltalia has deployed a business model that combines the business of a renewable energy producer through its own power plants with that of service provider to third-party customers. Voltalia's employees who  on behalf of customers  create energy production or savings projects from scratch during the development and construction phases  and then operate and maintain them. This model for itself and third-party customers has the most significant impact on its mission while creating the most financial value.As the services business is not very capital intensive  electricity production and storage account for the vast majority of Voltalia's capital. In this business  Voltalia relies on very long-term electricity sales contracts (generally 20 years) which are designed to ensure the repayment of project financing and to secure equity investments. The contractual sales prices are mostly (83% in 2021) indexed to inflation.A strong growth trajectory since its IPO on EuronextSince its IPO  Voltalia has posted an average annual growth (CAGR) of +46% in revenues and +41% in EBITDA between 2014 and 2021. Over the period  the capacity in operation and under construction has increased more than fourfold  from 365 MW to 1.7 GW in 2021. Voltalia also announced on the occasion of the publication of its half-yearly results for 2022 that its target of 2.6 GW of capacity in operation and under construction  which it planned to achieve by the end of 2023  would finally be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule.This growth trajectory  essentially organic  has benefited from targeted acquisitions which have accelerated the strategy  in particular that of Helexia which offers its client companies  in parallel with Voltalia's corporate PPA offer  on-site solar production ( roofs and car park shades) and investments to reduce their energy consumption.New growth ambitions for 2027On 28 September  during the publication of its half-year results for 2022  Voltalia indicated that it believed that it would be able to achieve its 2023 target of 2.6 gigawatts of capacity in operation and under construction one year ahead of schedule and that it was confirming its two other 2023 targets: a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨275 to ‚Ç¨300 million and a share of Brazil in capacity in operation and under construction below 50%.In this context  Voltalia has defined a new growth plan for 2027  including the following objectives:Operating and construction capacity owned by Voltalia: over 5 gigawatts by the end of 2027;by the end of 2027; Capacity operated on behalf of third parties: over 8 gigawatts by the end of 2027;by the end of 2027; Normalised EBITDA 3 : around ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027;: around in 2027; CO2-equivalent avoided: over 4 million tonnes in 2027.Voltalia will examine the best options for financing its CAPEX of between an estimated ‚Ç¨2.5 and ‚Ç¨3 billion to support its new ambitions by 2027. In addition to the usual project financing and its significant cash flow  the group reserves the right to raise corporate financing  to selectively sell minority shares to partners in some of its projects or to arrange equity financing  depending on market conditions and  where appropriate  involving all of its existing shareholders  including its main shareholder  the Mulliez family.Solid assets to achieve its ambitionsVoltalia will be able to draw on a number of strengths to achieve this ambitious growth plan up to 2027  including:A portfolio of projects under development at a record level of 13.6 GW  of which 986 MW have won a PPA and 1.8 GW are ready to tender for a PPA;at a record level of 13.6 GW  of which 986 MW have won a PPA and 1.8 GW are ready to tender for a PPA; The gain  since January 2022  of new long-term electricity sales contracts for 640 MW;for 640 MW; A volume of projects in the early stages of development (which meet one  two or three of the four criteria required to enter the development portfolio 4 ) of 22.1 GW;(which meet one  two or three of the four criteria required to enter the development portfolio ) of 22.1 GW; Ability to sell and implement the full range of products offered to businesses : corporate wind and solar PPAs  photovoltaic roofs and shades and energy efficiency;: corporate wind and solar PPAs  photovoltaic roofs and shades and energy efficiency; Expertise in Development  Construction and Supply of equipment and Operation-Maintenance services to third party clients;to third party clients; Expertise in the key technologies of the energy transition  in particular those currently experiencing strong growth: photovoltaics  storage and energy efficiency;of the energy transition  in particular those currently experiencing strong growth: photovoltaics  storage and energy efficiency; A geographical positioning focused on countries where the sector's growth potential is among the highest in the world;positioning focused on countries where the sector's growth potential is among the highest in the world; The ability to make acquisitions   integrate them and then rapidly develop the acquired entities;  integrate them and then rapidly develop the acquired entities; A track record of strong growth management with revenue and EBITDA growing at CAGR since the IPO on the Euronext regulated market in 2014  of 46% and 41% respectively over the period 2014-2021.DisclaimerThis press release and the information contained herein do not constitute either an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase the securities of Voltalia.The release  publication or distribution of this press release may be restricted in certain countries by applicable laws and regulations.

Revenue of the Printhead Solutions segment recovered to levels in line with the third quarter of 2021 after having experienced a severe downturn in H1 due to the global shortage of electronic components. Group revenue for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year despite experiencing more challenging business conditions than a year ago.‚ÄúThe third quarter results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69 000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of ‚Ç¨3.3 million which closed in July. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as ‚ÄúOther Income‚Äù and is not included in our revenue figures  but it is accretive to EBITDA.‚ÄúGroup EBITDA was significantly up in Q3 thanks to better operational performance across the board and the sale of the IPv4 internet addresses.

Down 19.0% vs. Q3-21 due to lower demand by Chinese subcontractors and reduced sales for high-end mobile applications. Partially offset by increased automotive and hybrid bonding shipmentsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 125.3 million decreased 18.2% vs. Q2-22 due principally to weaker demand for high-performance computing applications from IDMs and Asian subcontractors. Vs. Q3-21  down 40.1% primarily due to broad-based market decline  particularly in computing applicationsGross margin of 62.3% rose 1.3 points vs. Q2-22 and 1.9 points vs. Q3-21 principally due to more favorable product mix and beneficial forex influences from increase of USD vs. euroNet income of ‚Ç¨ 57.3 million decreased 24.2% vs. Q2-22 and 31.9% vs. Q3-21 principally as result of lower revenue and increased R&D spending for wafer level applicationsBesi‚Äôs net margin reached 34.0% vs. the 35.4% achieved in Q2-22 despite a 21.1% sequential revenue decrease. Vs. Q3-21  net margin declined by 6.4 pointsKey Highlights YTD -22Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 585.1 million rose 1.3% vs. YTD-21 reflecting strong demand for high performance computing  automotive and hybrid bonding applications. Partially offset by significant decline in high-end mobile applications post 2021 capacity build and reduced demand by Chinese subcontractorsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 483.3 million declined 34.4% reflecting broad-based softening of market conditions  and decreased demand for high-end mobile applications and from Chinese subcontractorsGross margin rose 0.6 points to reach 61.1% primarily due to favorable forex influences and Besi‚Äôs timely adjustment of production and overhead levels to changing market conditionsNet income of ‚Ç¨ 200.5 million down 6.9% due primarily to higher R&D spending and forex hedging costs.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:‚ÄúBesi reported Q3-22 results which were at the favorable end of guidance but reflected the impact of a new industry downturn. For the quarter  revenue  orders and net income of ‚Ç¨ 168.8 million  ‚Ç¨ 125.3 million and ‚Ç¨ 57.3 million decreased by 21.1%  18.2% and 24.2%  respectively  versus Q2-22. Adverse revenue and order development this quarter reflected typical seasonal weakness for mobile applications but also more general weakness in high-end server  data center and general computing applications. Such weakness was partially offset by continued strength in automotive and industrial end-user markets and ongoing shipments of hybrid bonding equipment to customers. Similarly  Besi‚Äôs backlog of ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million at the end of Q3 declined by 12.6% versus Q2-22 but remained at higher than typical levels.Despite a challenging market environment  we maintained profit efficiency at high levels with gross margins of 62.3% exceeding guidance and a net margin of 34.0%. We re-aligned Besi‚Äôs production model rapidly in response to changing market conditions. As a result  total headcount has declined by 12.7% and temporary Asian production headcount by 65.2% since the end of Q1-22. We will continue to adjust overhead levels as necessary in accordance with market developments.For the first nine months  Besi reported revenue of ‚Ç¨ 585.1 million which increased by 1.3% and net income which decreased by 6.9% versus the comparable period of 2021. Growth was favorably influenced by increased demand for Besi‚Äôs computing  automotive and hybrid bonding end-user markets. Such strength was partially offset by reduced demand for high-end smartphones following a large capacity build in 2021. It also reflected a 37.6% revenue decrease from Chinese customers primarily associated with overcapacity  slower economic growth and Covid-19 related lockdowns. Orders of ‚Ç¨ 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% as industry conditions materially weakened post the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. The ‚Ç¨ 14.8 million decrease in Besi‚Äôs net income between the comparable periods principally resulted from a 49.0% increase in development spending as we increased investment in future areas of growth for the next market upcycle.Our liquidity position continues to build with strong cash flow generation of ‚Ç¨ 185.2 million during the first nine months of 2022 which supports Besi‚Äôs capital allocation policy. We ended the quarter with cash and deposits of ‚Ç¨ 661.8 million and net cash of ‚Ç¨ 342.5 million that represented increases of 12.1% and 19.0%  respectively  versus September 30  2021. Liquidity has improved this year despite the distribution of ‚Ç¨ 351.3 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed our prior ‚Ç¨ 185 million share repurchase program in July and began purchases under our new ‚Ç¨ 300 million program in August. During the quarter  we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares for an aggregate amount of ‚Ç¨ 45.5 million.Strategically  we are accelerating investment in Besi‚Äôs future despite near term headwinds  particularly for our hybrid bonding and wafer level assembly portfolio  as the long-term drivers of our business remain intact and sub 10 nanometer device innovation continues apace. We see continued interest in hybrid bonding applications as the natural extension of Moore‚Äôs law to drive technology gains in new heterogeneous 3D architectures for next generation logic  memory  mobile  automotive and data center applications. Besi received orders subsequent to quarter end both for incremental hybrid bonding capacity and for systems incorporated in hybrid bonding integrated lines. Additional orders are anticipated in Q4-22.The outlook for the assembly equipment market has turned more negative during the quarter as industry conditions weakened  global GDP growth rates decelerated and customer caution increased. At present  it appears to be a traditional industry downturn marked by overcapacity and order pushouts by customers. Downcycles are typically the periods in which Besi looks to improve its business model and plans investment in those products and technologies which will drive revenue growth in the next upcycle. The announcement of new restrictions recently by the US on sales of WFE and assembly equipment to China has added more uncertainty to the industry outlook. We are currently evaluating the proposed restrictions to better understand whether any of Besi‚Äôs <10 micron accuracy systems could be subject to such provisions.For Q4-22  we estimate that revenue will decrease by 15-25% versus Q3-22 reflecting uncertain market conditions and seasonal trends. However  Besi‚Äôs gross margin is expected to remain in the 60-62% range due to the flexibility of our production model and anticipated product mix. Further  operating expenses are anticipated to increase by approximately 5% versus Q3-22 principally due to higher R&D spending.‚ÄùThird Quarter Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Œî Q3-2021 Œî Revenue 168.8 214.0 -21.1% 208.3 -19.0% Orders 125.3 153.1 -18.2% 209.2 -40.1% Book to Bill Ratio 0.7x 0.7x - 1.0x -0.3Q3-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 168.8 million decreased 21.1% versus Q2-22 due to lower shipments for high-end mobile applications reflecting seasonal influences and lower revenue for high performance computing applications given softer market conditions in data center and mainstream computing end-user markets. Revenue for the quarter was at the favorable end of guidance. Versus Q3-21  revenue decreased by 19.0% as a result of significantly lower demand by Chinese subcontractors for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications and  to a lesser extent  to lower demand for high-end smartphones post new product introductions last year. Such weakness was partially offset by revenue growth for high performance computing  hybrid bonding applications and automotive applications.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 125.3 million decreased 18.2% versus Q2-22 due primarily to lower demand for computing applications by IDMs and Taiwanese subcontractors and softening market conditions. Order weakness was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-user markets both from European IDMs and Asian subcontractors. Versus Q3-21  orders decreased by 40.1% primarily due to a broad-based market decline which started in Q2-22 with particular weakness in high performance computing applications and lower order levels by Chinese subcontractors. Per customer type  IDM orders decreased ‚Ç¨ 6.1 million  or 7.0%  versus Q2-22 and represented 64% of total orders for the period. Subcontractor orders decreased by ‚Ç¨ 21.7 million  or 32.7%  versus Q2-22 and represented 36% of total orders.‚Ç¨ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Œî Q3-2021 Œî Gross Margin 62.3% 61.0% +1.3 60.4% +1.9 Operating Expenses 34.0 37.9 -10.3% 30.4 +11.8% Financial Expense/(Income)  net 5.5 5.8 -5.2% 3.4 +61.8% EBITDA 77.1 98.0 -21.3% 99.7 -22.7%Besi‚Äôs gross margin rose to 62.3% in Q3-22  an increase of 1.3 points and 1.9 points versus Q2-22 and Q3-21  respectively. It was also above prior guidance (60-62%). The improvement was primarily due to a more favorable product mix and forex benefits from an increase in the value of the USD versus the euro.Q3-22 operating expenses declined by ‚Ç¨ 3.9 million  or 10.3%  versus Q2-22 principally as a result of a ‚Ç¨ 2.7 million reduction in share-based compensation expense and lower variable sales related expenses. Operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨ 3.6 million  or 11.8%  versus Q3-21 primarily due to increased R&D spending for the development of next generation wafer level assembly systems. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to 20.2% in Q3-22 versus 17.7% in Q2-22 and 14.6% in Q3-21  primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels.‚Ç¨ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Œî Q3-2021 Œî Net Income 57.3 75.6 -24.2% 84.2 -31.9% Net Margin 34.0% 35.4% -1.4 40.4% -6.4 Tax Rate* 12.8% 12.7% +0.1 8.4% +4.4* Effective tax rate reflects ‚Ç¨ 3.7 million of deferred tax benefits recognized in Q3-21.

Versus Q3-21  net income decreased by ‚Ç¨ 26.9 million  or 31.9%  principally as a result of a 19.0% revenue decrease  increased R&D spending and a higher effective tax rate. As a result  Besi‚Äôs net margin of 34.0% decreased slightly versus the 35.4% achieved in Q2-22. Versus Q3-21  net margin declined by 6.4 points  primarily due to lower revenue levels and an increase in Besi‚Äôs effective tax rate related to the absence of ‚Ç¨ 3.7 million in deferred tax benefits recognized in the prior year period.Nine Months Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions YTD-2022 YTD-2021 Œî Revenue 585.1 577.6 +1.3% Orders 483.3 736.5 -34.4% Gross Margin 61.1% 60.5% +0.6 Operating Income 245.4 250.4 -2.0% Operating Margin 41.9% 43.4% -1.5 Net Income 200.5 215.3 -6.9% Net Margin 34.3% 37.3% -3.0 Tax Rate* 13.0% 10.2% +2.8* Effective tax rate reflects ‚Ç¨ 6.1 million of tax benefits recognized in YTD-21. Ex such benefits  the effective tax rate would have been 12.7%YTD-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 585.1 million increased 1.3% reflecting strong demand for Besi‚Äôs high performance computing  hybrid bonding and automotive end-user markets. Such growth was partially offset by significantly decreased demand for high-end smartphones and for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications by Chinese subcontractors. Of note  revenue from Chinese customers decreased by ‚Ç¨ 83.7 million  or 37.6%  year-over-year and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 38.5% in YTD-21 to 23.7% in YTD-22.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% versus YTD-21 due to less favorable market conditions after the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. In particular  decreased demand reflected lower orders for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021  lower orders for high performance computing applications and significantly decreased demand from Chinese subcontractors due to overcapacity  decelerating economic growth and rolling Covid-19 lockdowns. Order weakness in YTD-22 was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-markets  continuing a trend which began in the second half of 2021. IDM and subcontractor orders represented 55% and 45%  respectively  of YTD-22 orders versus 51% and 49%  respectively  in YTD-21.Besi‚Äôs net income decreased by ‚Ç¨ 14.8 million  or 6.9%  versus YTD-21 to reach ‚Ç¨ 200.5 million primarily due to increased R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems  increased forex hedging costs and the absence of ‚Ç¨ 6.1 million in deferred tax benefits recognized in the prior year period.Financial Condition‚Ç¨ millionsQ32022 Q22022 Œî Q32021 Œî YTD-2022 YTD-2021Œî Total Cash and Deposits 661.8 601.6 +10.0% 590.5 +12.1% 661.8 590.5 +12.1% Net Cash and Deposits 342.5 284.0 +20.6% 287.8 +19.0% 342.5 287.8 +19.0% Cash flow from Ops. 112.7 27.6 +308.3% 98.6 +14.3% 185.2 176.0 +5.2%At the end of Q3-22  Besi had a strong liquidity position with total cash and deposits aggregating ‚Ç¨ 661.8 million  an increase of ‚Ç¨ 60.2 million  or 10.0%  versus Q2-22.

This growth reflects the success of the Employee Benefits and Fleet & Mobility Solutions businesses  notably in the SME segment  which remains largely underpenetrated. In particular  it is the result of a very good sales performance by the digital Ticket Restaurant¬Æ solution. This performance was also partially offset by the impact of the daily spending cap being lowered back to its pre-Covid level of ‚Ç¨19 as from July 1  2022 (versus ‚Ç¨38 since June 12  2020) and by an unfavorable basis of comparison with third-quarter 2021  when users spent funds they had accumulated while restaurants and certain retailers were shut. Lastly  solutions rolled out under the Beyond Food strategy  including the ProwebCE employee engagement platform and the remote working platform  continued to deliver robust growth  benefiting from continuous  innovation-driven improvements to the user experience.Operating revenue for France in the first nine months of the year amounted to ‚Ç¨220 million  up 10.4% as reported and like-for-like compared with the first nine months of 2021.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled ‚Ç¨212 million in third-quarter 2022  an increase of 20.8% as reported and like-for-like versus the prior-year period. Employee Benefits enjoyed strong momentum across the region. Ticket Restaurant¬Æ meal benefits once again delivered robust growth  boosted by an increase in face values introduced by clients in the current inflationary context  and the Beyond Food strategy continued to be a success. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  further solid growth in the third quarter was driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy and good sales momentum in the SME segment.For the first nine months of 2022  operating revenue for Europe excluding France came to ‚Ç¨613 million  up 18.8% year-on-year as reported (+18.6% like-for-like).Operating revenue in Latin America came to ‚Ç¨161 million for the third quarter  a rise of 34.6% as reported (+19.9% like-for-like) compared with the third quarter of 2021. Latin America represented 33% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  operating revenue came to ‚Ç¨432 million  up 33.3% as reported (+18.0% like-for-like).In Brazil  operating revenue rose by 16.2% like-for-like in third-quarter 2022 versus third-quarter 2021. Fleet & Mobility Solutions continued to be driven by the success of the Beyond Fuel offering in maintenance and toll services. Employee Benefits delivered a good sales performance thanks to the continued penetration of the SME segment  supported notably by the growing contribution of the partnership with Ita√∫ Unibanco and the success of the virtual canteen solution.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Brazil grew by 16.8% like-for-like.In Hispanic Latin America  third-quarter 2022 operating revenue was up 27.9% like-for-like versus the same period in 2021. This robust performance reflects a sharp acceleration in the Employee Benefits business  as well as further strong growth in Fleet & Mobility Solutions.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in Hispanic Latin America rose by 20.6% like-for-like.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue came to ‚Ç¨40 million for the third quarter  up 21.1% as reported (+27.7% like-for-like). This region represents 8% of consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2022.This performance was notably driven by the success of innovative programs proposed in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. In North America  Edenred CSI‚Äôs Corporate Payment Services continued to build on the strong momentum seen in the second quarter  thanks in particular to the ramp-up of its commercial partnerships with several banks and software companies.For the first nine months of the year  operating revenue in the Rest of the World totaled ‚Ç¨109 million  up 20.7% as reported (+30.0% like-for-like) compared with the first nine months of 2021.Other revenueOther revenue for the third quarter of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨23 million  up 100.1% as reported (+99.7% like-for-like). This significant increase reflects the impact of strong business growth on the float2  as well as favorable changes in interest rates in all regions where the Group operates. The gradual acceleration in other revenue growth period after period can be attributed to the steady rise in interest rates observed for several quarters now in Europe (outside the euro zone) and Latin America  as well as to the first effects of interest rate increases in the euro zone. For the nine months ended September 30  2022  other revenue came to ‚Ç¨53 million  representing an increase of 67.3% as reported (+65.4% like-for-like).OUTLOOKAfter achieving record results in the first half  Edenred confirmed its very good business momentum in the third quarter.Thanks to its segmented sales approach  Edenred continues to penetrate its core markets  with the economic environment further enhancing the attractiveness of its solutions  which notably enable employers to effectively boost their employees‚Äô purchasing power.Edenred is also unlocking new growth opportunities by expanding its portfolio of solutions to more fully meet clients‚Äô needs. In Employee Benefits  Beyond Food solutions enable companies to enhance their employer brand and boost employee engagement in a fast-changing working world. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  the Beyond Fuel offering (including maintenance and toll management and VAT refund solutions) helps fleet managers control their expenses. And in Complementary Solutions  the Beyond Payment strategy to enhance the value proposition  as illustrated by the acquisition of IPS  a leading invoice automation vendor  is moving Edenred CSI up the accounts payable value chain.Lastly  Edenred is accelerating its investments in product and technology innovation to seize opportunities arising from secular trends  such as remote working as a permanent feature in the workplace  green commuting  the consumption of eco-friendly products and the transition of fleets to electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.Thanks to its ability to leverage the increasing scale effect of its platform  in an environment where its solutions are increasingly attractive and amid favorable economic conditions  the Group is upgrading its 2022 EBITDA outlook to between ‚Ç¨810 million and ‚Ç¨840 million3 (compared with a target range of between ‚Ç¨770 million and ‚Ç¨820 million euros announced on July 26  2022).SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTEREdenred joins the Euronext CAC 40 ESG¬Æ indexOn September 19  2022  the Group joined the Paris stock exchange‚Äôs Euronext CAC 40 ESG index  taking its place alongside other companies demonstrating outstanding environmental  social and governance (ESG) practices.SUBSEQUENT EVENTSEdenred expands its Corporate Payment invoice automation capabilities in the US  with the acquisition of IPSOn October 17  2022  Edenred announced the acquisition of IPS  a leading invoice automation vendor  through its corporate payment subsidiary Edenred CSI.This acquisition enhances Edenred CSI‚Äôs value proposition by expanding along the procure-to-pay value chain and integrating a turnkey invoice automation solution into its digital platform.

Recent events have underlined the urgent need for increased investment and accelerated project development  with a particular emphasis on natural gas  LNG  and low-to-zero carbon solutions.‚Äù‚ÄúFor our company  this market reality is first evidenced by strong TPS order intake driving a 60% step change in segment backlog year-over-year  with notable awards in renewable fuels and ethylene markets - this reinforces the revenue growth trajectory of our highest margin segment. Furthermore  the commercial pipeline for Project Delivery is also growing with substantial early engagement in energy transition and traditional prospects. As such  we expect a significant improvement in order intake trends over the next 12-18 months. This also confirms that the combination of longer cycle Project Delivery with value accretive TPS provides an ideal blend for T.EN to be successful across energy cycles.‚Äù‚ÄúIn the third quarter  our teams continued to demonstrate robust business execution and our revenues excluding Arctic LNG 2 increased as planned. The strength in margins  which are in line with our medium-term trajectory  demonstrates the quality of our underlying portfolio  an improving mix  and world-class project delivery.‚Äù‚ÄúOur orderly exit from Arctic LNG 2 is progressing and all operational personnel have been demobilized from the project. We have signed an Exit Framework Agreement with our customer  which we are currently implementing  and anticipate completing this process within the first half of 2023. The improved visibility on Arctic LNG 2 combined with nine months of achieved financials has enabled us to return to full company guidance for 2022.‚Äù‚ÄúT.EN‚Äôs business strategy is fully aligned with an improving energy market outlook. Supported by our strong balance sheet and commitment to further investment in our technology portfolio  we are well positioned to enable solutions for affordable  available  and sustainable energy.

For the periods presented in this Press Release  the Company‚Äôs proportionate share of joint venture revenue from the following projects was included: the revenue from ENI CORAL FLNG  Yamal LNG and NFE is included at 50%  the revenue from BAPCO Sitra Refinery is included at 36%  the revenue from the in-Russia construction and supervision scope of Arctic LNG 2 is included at 33.3%  the revenue from the joint-venture Rovuma is included at 33.3%. Revenue from Nova Energies is included at 50% for the first six months of the year. The Company believes that presenting the proportionate share of its joint venture revenue in construction projects carried out in joint arrangements enables management and investors to better evaluate the performance of the Company‚Äôs core business period-over-period by assisting them in more accurately understanding the activities actually performed by the Company on these projects.Adjusted recurring EBIT: Adjusted recurring EBIT represents the profit before financial expense  net  and income taxes recorded under IFRS as adjusted to reflect line-by-line for their respective share incorporated construction project entities that are not fully owned by the Company (applying to the method described above under adjusted revenue) and adds or removes  as appropriate  items that are considered as non-recurring from EBIT  including (i) restructuring expenses  (ii) separation costs associated with the Spin-off transaction  and (iii) costs arising out of significant litigation that have arisen outside of the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that the exclusion of such expenses or profits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate the Company‚Äôs operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked to both investors and management by the excluded items.Adjusted recurring EBITDA: Adjusted recurring EBITDA corresponds to the adjusted recurring EBIT as described above after deduction of depreciation and amortization expenses and as adjusted to reflect for their respective share construction project entities that are not fully owned by the Company. The Company believes that the exclusion of these expenses or profits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate the Company‚Äôs operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked to both investors and management by the excluded items.Adjusted net (debt) cash: Adjusted net (debt) cash reflects cash and cash equivalents  net of debt (including short-term debt and loans due to/due from the TechnipFMC Group)  as adjusted according to the method described above under adjusted revenue. Management uses this APM to evaluate the Company‚Äôs capital structure and financial leverage. The Company believes adjusted net debt (if debtor)  or adjusted net cash (if creditor)  is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding the Company‚Äôs financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in its capital structure.Adjusted order backlog: Order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled  confirmed customer orders at the relevant reporting date. Adjusted order backlog takes into account the Company‚Äôs proportionate share of order backlog related to equity affiliates (ENI Coral FLNG  BAPCO Sitra Refinery  Arctic LNG 2 for the In-Russia construction and supervision scope  the joint-venture Rovuma  two affiliates of the NFE joint-venture  and the Nova Energies joint-venture) and restates the share of order backlog related to the Company‚Äôs non-controlling interest in Yamal LNG. The Company believes that the adjusted order backlog enables management and investors to evaluate the level of the Company‚Äôs core business forthcoming activities by including its proportionate share in the estimated sales coming from construction projects in joint arrangements.Adjusted order intake: Order intake corresponds to signed contracts which have come into force during the reporting period. Adjusted order intake adds the proportionate share of orders signed related to equity affiliates (ENI Coral FLNG  BAPCO Sitra Refinery  Arctic LNG 2 for the In-Russia construction and supervision scope  the joint-venture Rovuma  two affiliates of the NFE joint-venture  and the Nova Energies joint-venture) and restates the share of order intake attributable to the non-controlling interests in Yamal LNG. This financial measure is closely connected with the adjusted order backlog in the evaluation of the level of the Company‚Äôs forthcoming activities by presenting its proportionate share of contracts which came into force during the period and that will be performed by the Company.Notes:(1) A ‚Äúlarge‚Äù award for Technip Energies is a contract award representing between ‚Ç¨250 million and ‚Ç¨500 million of revenue.(2) A ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù award for Technip Energies is a contract award representing between ‚Ç¨50 million and ‚Ç¨250 million of revenue.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.83,0.16,0.0,True,English,"['Technip Energies Financial Results', 'First Nine Months', 'longer cycle Project Delivery', 'robust project delivery model', 'strong TPS order intake', '9M 2022 results conference call', 'strong balance sheet', 'unaudited financial results', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'substantial early engagement', 'order intake trends', 'effective capital allocation', 'effective tax rate', 'world-class project delivery', 'Conference call information', 'next 12-18 months', 'highest margin segment', 'full company guidance', 'Recurring EBIT margin', 'Exit Framework Agreement', 'growing market positions', 'zero carbon solutions', 'robust business execution', 'prior financial framework', 'energy market outlook', 'first nine months', 'IFRS financial measures', 'revenue growth trajectory', '9M 2021 diluted earnings', 'prior framework', 'accretive TPS', 'Financial information', 'Conference Code', 'project development', 'market reality', 'medium-term trajectory', 'orderly exit', 'first half', 'leadership positions', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'business strategy', 'Technology company', 'The Company', 'energy transition', 'energy system', 'energy cycles', 'sustainable energy', 'Regulatory News', 'Technip Energies', 'leading Engineering', 'Arnaud Pieton', 'Recent events', 'urgent need', 'particular emphasis', 'natural gas', '60% step change', 'segment backlog', 'notable awards', 'renewable fuels', 'commercial pipeline', 'traditional prospects', 'significant improvement', 'ideal blend', 'T.EN', 'third quarter', 'underlying portfolio', 'operational personnel', 'technology portfolio', 'sustained excellence', 'Net profit', 'complete definition', 'average number', 'outstanding shares', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'edge.media-server', 'sustainable chemistry', 'CO 2 management', 'extensive technol', 'Arctic LNG', 'Key financials', 'Paris:TE', 'ethylene markets', 'expected contribution', 'green hydrogen', '2021 Revenue', 'affordability', 'availability', 'sustainability', 'investment', 'year', 'combination', 'value', 'teams', 'revenues', 'strength', 'margins', 'quality', 'mix', 'customer', 'process', 'visibility', 'improving', 'commitment', 'shareholders', 'EPS', 'Appendix', 'Reconciliation', 'millions', 'FY', 'webcast', 'Thursday', 'October', '13:00 CET', 'details', 'France', 'blue']",2022-10-20,2022-10-21,businesswire.com
11893,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.rigzone.com/news/seadrill_closes_sale_of_seven_jackups_to_ades-20-oct-2022-170785-article/,Seadrill Closes Sale Of Seven Jack-Ups To ADES,Seadrill Limited has closed the sale of seven jack-ups located in Saudi Arabia to ADES Arabia Holding.,Offshore driller Seadrill Limited has closed the sale of seven jack-ups located in Saudi Arabia to ADES Arabia Holding.The initial deal for the share purchase agreement with subsidiaries of ADES Arabia Holding was signed on September 1. The rigs in question are the AOD I  AOD II  AOD III  West Callisto  West Ariel  West Cressida  and West Leda.ADES will also employ the crews operating the rigs and will hold the drilling contracts related to the rigs. The total consideration for the jack-up sale is $628 million in cash  subject to adjustment for working capital and other items  and reimbursement to Seadrill for any project costs spent at the time of closing concerning the reactivation of the three stacked jack-ups  namely the West Ariel  West Cressida  and West Leda. This translates into around $100 million per rig on a ‚Äòready-to-drill‚Äô basis.Seadrill said that the proceeds from the jack-up sale would enable it to significantly de-leverage its balance sheet and eliminate outstanding capital expenditure for the West Ariel  West Cressida  and West Leda.ADES has been shopping for rigs for some time now. Namely  it bought a large number of rigs from several companies since November last year. It first bought Noble Roger Lewis  Noble Scott Marks  Noble Joe Knight  and Noble Johnny Whitstine ‚Äì all contracted by Saudi Aramco ‚Äì from Noble Corporation. That was followed by a very active April this year with three acquisitions.Namely  Maersk Drilling sold the Maersk Convincer jack-up rig to ADES for $42.5 million. In the same month  ADES bought four jack-up drilling rigs from Aban Offshore for $106 million and the Emerald Driller  Sapphire Driller  and Aquamarine Driller jack-ups from Vantage drilling. The April shopping spree ended with the acquisition of the Valaris 113 and 114 rigs for a price of $125 million.In May  ADES also bought two KFELS B Class rigs from Keppel Offshore & Marine. These rigs were ordered in 2013 and 2014 but nothing came of them. This was beneficial for both parties as Keppel announced last year that it would be exiting the offshore rig-building business.In other Seadrill-related news  it recently received approval to relist its common shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SDRL. The company started trading on NYSE last Friday.Due to the listing on the NYSE  Seadrill also applied to change the status of its listing at Euronext Expand from a primary listing to a secondary listing  and the Oslo Stock Exchange has approved the application. The change from primary to the secondary listing at Euronext Expand took effect on October 17.‚ÄúWe are pleased to be re-listing the company on the NYSE.

The strategic mix improvement towards marketplace brought its GMV share up to 52% in the 3rd quarter  a more than +9pts increase in just a year. This result was supported by the Fulfilment by Cdiscount and Cdiscount Express Seller marketplace GMV share reaching a record high level of 52% in the 3rd quarter  increasing by +7pts vs. 2021  and dedicated co-financed promotions from top sellers.Advertising services revenues reached ‚Ç¨17m in the 3rd quarter of 2022 now representing nearly 2.6% of Product GMV  an increase of +0.5pt vs. 2021  driven by Cnova‚Äôs in-house bidding platform: Cdiscount Ads Retail Solution (‚ÄúCARS‚Äù) revenues increased by +22% in the 3rd quarter compared to 2021.B2B investments began to yield positive results with Octopia Marketplace and Mechants-as-a-Service solutions gaining traction and now accumulating 25 clients of which 9 are already live  proving the quality and competitiveness of its all-in-one solution.Last quarter  Cnova announced the implementation of an Efficiency Plan aiming at swiftly recalibrating its cost structure & capex level to the current volume of activity.

This year-on-year change was driven by:Direct Sales contributing -14.5pts (-32.3% y-o-y)  as a result of the on-going voluntary strategic shift to marketplace   mostly for low contribution margin non-technical goods   but preserving and still benefiting from strengthened relationships with top international brands.Marketplace contributing -1.0pt (-2.9% y-o-y) while delivering +9pts in GMV share.

(the ‚ÄúCompany"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30  2022.Key Highlights Q3-22Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 168.8 million declined 21.1% vs. Q2-22 due to lower shipments for mobile applications reflecting seasonal influences and softer market conditions for computing applications. Down 19.0% vs. Q3-21 due to lower demand by Chinese subcontractors and reduced sales for high-end mobile applications. Partially offset by increased automotive and hybrid bonding shipmentsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 125.3 million decreased 18.2% vs. Q2-22 due principally to weaker demand for high-performance computing applications from IDMs and Asian subcontractors. Vs. Q3-21  down 40.1% primarily due to broad-based market decline  particularly in computing applicationsGross margin of 62.3% rose 1.3 points vs. Q2-22 and 1.9 points vs. Q3-21 principally due to more favorable product mix and beneficial forex influences from increase of USD vs. euroNet income of ‚Ç¨ 57.3 million decreased 24.2% vs. Q2-22 and 31.9% vs. Q3-21 principally as result of lower revenue and increased R&D spending for wafer level applicationsBesi‚Äôs net margin reached 34.0% vs. the 35.4% achieved in Q2-22 despite a 21.1% sequential revenue decrease. Vs. Q3-21  net margin declined by 6.4 pointsKey Highlights YTD -22Revenue of ‚Ç¨ 585.1 million rose 1.3% vs. YTD-21 reflecting strong demand for high performance computing  automotive and hybrid bonding applications. Partially offset by significant decline in high-end mobile applications post 2021 capacity build and reduced demand by Chinese subcontractorsOrders of ‚Ç¨ 483.3 million declined 34.4% reflecting broad-based softening of market conditions  and decreased demand for high-end mobile applications and from Chinese subcontractorsGross margin rose 0.6 points to reach 61.1% primarily due to favorable forex influences and Besi‚Äôs timely adjustment of production and overhead levels to changing market conditionsNet income of ‚Ç¨ 200.5 million down 6.9% due primarily to higher R&D spending and forex hedging costs.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:‚ÄúBesi reported Q3-22 results which were at the favorable end of guidance but reflected the impact of a new industry downturn. For the quarter  revenue  orders and net income of ‚Ç¨ 168.8 million  ‚Ç¨ 125.3 million and ‚Ç¨ 57.3 million decreased by 21.1%  18.2% and 24.2%  respectively  versus Q2-22. Adverse revenue and order development this quarter reflected typical seasonal weakness for mobile applications but also more general weakness in high-end server  data center and general computing applications. Such weakness was partially offset by continued strength in automotive and industrial end-user markets and ongoing shipments of hybrid bonding equipment to customers. Similarly  Besi‚Äôs backlog of ‚Ç¨ 240.6 million at the end of Q3 declined by 12.6% versus Q2-22 but remained at higher than typical levels.Despite a challenging market environment  we maintained profit efficiency at high levels with gross margins of 62.3% exceeding guidance and a net margin of 34.0%. We re-aligned Besi‚Äôs production model rapidly in response to changing market conditions. As a result  total headcount has declined by 12.7% and temporary Asian production headcount by 65.2% since the end of Q1-22. We will continue to adjust overhead levels as necessary in accordance with market developments.For the first nine months  Besi reported revenue of ‚Ç¨ 585.1 million which increased by 1.3% and net income which decreased by 6.9% versus the comparable period of 2021. Growth was favorably influenced by increased demand for Besi‚Äôs computing  automotive and hybrid bonding end-user markets. Such strength was partially offset by reduced demand for high-end smartphones following a large capacity build in 2021. It also reflected a 37.6% revenue decrease from Chinese customers primarily associated with overcapacity  slower economic growth and Covid-19 related lockdowns. Orders of ‚Ç¨ 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% as industry conditions materially weakened post the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. The ‚Ç¨ 14.8 million decrease in Besi‚Äôs net income between the comparable periods principally resulted from a 49.0% increase in development spending as we increased investment in future areas of growth for the next market upcycle.Our liquidity position continues to build with strong cash flow generation of ‚Ç¨ 185.2 million during the first nine months of 2022 which supports Besi‚Äôs capital allocation policy. We ended the quarter with cash and deposits of ‚Ç¨ 661.8 million and net cash of ‚Ç¨ 342.5 million that represented increases of 12.1% and 19.0%  respectively  versus September 30  2021. Liquidity has improved this year despite the distribution of ‚Ç¨ 351.3 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed our prior ‚Ç¨ 185 million share repurchase program in July and began purchases under our new ‚Ç¨ 300 million program in August. During the quarter  we repurchased a total of 0.9 million shares for an aggregate amount of ‚Ç¨ 45.5 million.Strategically  we are accelerating investment in Besi‚Äôs future despite near term headwinds  particularly for our hybrid bonding and wafer level assembly portfolio  as the long-term drivers of our business remain intact and sub 10 nanometer device innovation continues apace. We see continued interest in hybrid bonding applications as the natural extension of Moore‚Äôs law to drive technology gains in new heterogeneous 3D architectures for next generation logic  memory  mobile  automotive and data center applications. Besi received orders subsequent to quarter end both for incremental hybrid bonding capacity and for systems incorporated in hybrid bonding integrated lines. Additional orders are anticipated in Q4-22.The outlook for the assembly equipment market has turned more negative during the quarter as industry conditions weakened  global GDP growth rates decelerated and customer caution increased. At present  it appears to be a traditional industry downturn marked by overcapacity and order pushouts by customers. Downcycles are typically the periods in which Besi looks to improve its business model and plans investment in those products and technologies which will drive revenue growth in the next upcycle. The announcement of new restrictions recently by the US on sales of WFE and assembly equipment to China has added more uncertainty to the industry outlook. We are currently evaluating the proposed restrictions to better understand whether any of Besi‚Äôs <10 micron accuracy systems could be subject to such provisions.For Q4-22  we estimate that revenue will decrease by 15-25% versus Q3-22 reflecting uncertain market conditions and seasonal trends. However  Besi‚Äôs gross margin is expected to remain in the 60-62% range due to the flexibility of our production model and anticipated product mix. Further  operating expenses are anticipated to increase by approximately 5% versus Q3-22 principally due to higher R&D spending.‚ÄùThird Quarter Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Œî Q3-2021 Œî Revenue 168.8 214.0 -21.1% 208.3 -19.0% Orders 125.3 153.1 -18.2% 209.2 -40.1% Book to Bill Ratio 0.7x 0.7x - 1.0x -0.3Q3-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 168.8 million decreased 21.1% versus Q2-22 due to lower shipments for high-end mobile applications reflecting seasonal influences and lower revenue for high performance computing applications given softer market conditions in data center and mainstream computing end-user markets. Revenue for the quarter was at the favorable end of guidance. Versus Q3-21  revenue decreased by 19.0% as a result of significantly lower demand by Chinese subcontractors for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications and  to a lesser extent  to lower demand for high-end smartphones post new product introductions last year. Such weakness was partially offset by revenue growth for high performance computing  hybrid bonding applications and automotive applications.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 125.3 million decreased 18.2% versus Q2-22 due primarily to lower demand for computing applications by IDMs and Taiwanese subcontractors and softening market conditions. Order weakness was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-user markets both from European IDMs and Asian subcontractors. Versus Q3-21  orders decreased by 40.1% primarily due to a broad-based market decline which started in Q2-22 with particular weakness in high performance computing applications and lower order levels by Chinese subcontractors. Per customer type  IDM orders decreased ‚Ç¨ 6.1 million  or 7.0%  versus Q2-22 and represented 64% of total orders for the period. Subcontractor orders decreased by ‚Ç¨ 21.7 million  or 32.7%  versus Q2-22 and represented 36% of total orders.‚Ç¨ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Œî Q3-2021 Œî Gross Margin 62.3% 61.0% +1.3 60.4% +1.9 Operating Expenses 34.0 37.9 -10.3% 30.4 +11.8% Financial Expense/(Income)  net 5.5 5.8 -5.2% 3.4 +61.8% EBITDA 77.1 98.0 -21.3% 99.7 -22.7%Besi‚Äôs gross margin rose to 62.3% in Q3-22  an increase of 1.3 points and 1.9 points versus Q2-22 and Q3-21  respectively. It was also above prior guidance (60-62%). The improvement was primarily due to a more favorable product mix and forex benefits from an increase in the value of the USD versus the euro.Q3-22 operating expenses declined by ‚Ç¨ 3.9 million  or 10.3%  versus Q2-22 principally as a result of a ‚Ç¨ 2.7 million reduction in share-based compensation expense and lower variable sales related expenses. Operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨ 3.6 million  or 11.8%  versus Q3-21 primarily due to increased R&D spending for the development of next generation wafer level assembly systems. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to 20.2% in Q3-22 versus 17.7% in Q2-22 and 14.6% in Q3-21  primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels.‚Ç¨ millions Q3-2022 Q2-2022 Œî Q3-2021 Œî Net Income 57.3 75.6 -24.2% 84.2 -31.9% Net Margin 34.0% 35.4% -1.4 40.4% -6.4 Tax Rate* 12.8% 12.7% +0.1 8.4% +4.4* Effective tax rate reflects ‚Ç¨ 3.7 million of deferred tax benefits recognized in Q3-21.

Versus Q3-21  net income decreased by ‚Ç¨ 26.9 million  or 31.9%  principally as a result of a 19.0% revenue decrease  increased R&D spending and a higher effective tax rate. As a result  Besi‚Äôs net margin of 34.0% decreased slightly versus the 35.4% achieved in Q2-22. Versus Q3-21  net margin declined by 6.4 points  primarily due to lower revenue levels and an increase in Besi‚Äôs effective tax rate related to the absence of ‚Ç¨ 3.7 million in deferred tax benefits recognized in the prior year period.Nine Months Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions YTD-2022 YTD-2021 Œî Revenue 585.1 577.6 +1.3% Orders 483.3 736.5 -34.4% Gross Margin 61.1% 60.5% +0.6 Operating Income 245.4 250.4 -2.0% Operating Margin 41.9% 43.4% -1.5 Net Income 200.5 215.3 -6.9% Net Margin 34.3% 37.3% -3.0 Tax Rate* 13.0% 10.2% +2.8* Effective tax rate reflects ‚Ç¨ 6.1 million of tax benefits recognized in YTD-21. Ex such benefits  the effective tax rate would have been 12.7%YTD-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 585.1 million increased 1.3% reflecting strong demand for Besi‚Äôs high performance computing  hybrid bonding and automotive end-user markets. Such growth was partially offset by significantly decreased demand for high-end smartphones and for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications by Chinese subcontractors. Of note  revenue from Chinese customers decreased by ‚Ç¨ 83.7 million  or 37.6%  year-over-year and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 38.5% in YTD-21 to 23.7% in YTD-22.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 483.3 million decreased by 34.4% versus YTD-21 due to less favorable market conditions after the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. In particular  decreased demand reflected lower orders for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021  lower orders for high performance computing applications and significantly decreased demand from Chinese subcontractors due to overcapacity  decelerating economic growth and rolling Covid-19 lockdowns. Order weakness in YTD-22 was partially offset by continued strength for automotive and industrial end-markets  continuing a trend which began in the second half of 2021. IDM and subcontractor orders represented 55% and 45%  respectively  of YTD-22 orders versus 51% and 49%  respectively  in YTD-21.Besi‚Äôs net income decreased by ‚Ç¨ 14.8 million  or 6.9%  versus YTD-21 to reach ‚Ç¨ 200.5 million primarily due to increased R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems  increased forex hedging costs and the absence of ‚Ç¨ 6.1 million in deferred tax benefits recognized in the prior year period.Financial Condition‚Ç¨ millionsQ32022 Q22022 Œî Q32021 Œî YTD-2022 YTD-2021Œî Total Cash and Deposits 661.8 601.6 +10.0% 590.5 +12.1% 661.8 590.5 +12.1% Net Cash and Deposits 342.5 284.0 +20.6% 287.8 +19.0% 342.5 287.8 +19.0% Cash flow from Ops. 112.7 27.6 +308.3% 98.6 +14.3% 185.2 176.0 +5.2%At the end of Q3-22  Besi had a strong liquidity position with total cash and deposits aggregating ‚Ç¨ 661.8 million  an increase of ‚Ç¨ 60.2 million  or 10.0%  versus Q2-22.

Bruno Le Maire declares: ""And we want France to be the European hub of the crypto-asset ecosystem.""He also said: ""Today  France has some of the most innovative DASPs in the world and can draw on an exceptional concentration of crypto skills  whether scientific  IT  financial  legal or commercial.""Artmarket.com is fully prepared to contribute to making France a Leader in crypto-assets in Europe and also in the world  in the specific field of Art NFTs  adopted by all historical players in the Art Market.As World Leader in Art Market Information and a pioneer on the Internet since 1987 with Group Serveur  Artprice by Artmarket (twice designated an ""innovative company"" by BPI France) has all the advantages  technological know-how  and expertise to give France a place as an international leader in the field of crypto art.Artmarket.com already has a permanent information feed on daily NFT news in 119 countries  as the world's leading press agency dedicated to the Art Market  NFTs  and Metaverse:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that during the first half of 2022  the Art NFT phenomenon (Jeton Non Fongible in French) became a durable segment of the art market on all continents with acceleration in sales and volumes in the second half of 2022. This acceleration has been triggered primarily by a) the purge of cryptocurrencies and b) the introduction of much more favorable legislation in the USA. Meanwhile  Europe has introduced a regulatory framework that supervises and controls the cryptocurrency environment  thereby giving greater confidence to consumers  investors  and operators.This regulation is the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com remarks: ""in our various annual art market reports and our communications with investors  we have always included NFTs in our studies. And we have always said that one cannot understand this market with exponential growth without understanding the vital importance of Blockchains  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origin within the Cypherpunk milieu (period of PGP-type data encryption in the early 1990s).""Indeed  OpenSea USA  the leading NFT platform  itself declares that 80% of the primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced that it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. There is only one viable solution to this problem: the certification of the primary Art-NFT market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of Art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only one on the world market  taking into account all the underlying parameters and data  to be able to truly meet the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.This ability to certify primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the World Leader in Art Market Information and author for 25 years of its authoritative databases. These in turn contain the largest documentary collection in the world of notes  manuscripts  and catalogs of auction sales since 1700  guaranteeing in return the authenticity and the historical proof of its databases.Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive Art NFTs platform through its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution.This Metaverse is the assurance of exponential and continuous growth of the Art Market by NFTs. It will be accompanied by its Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright societies such as ADAGP  of which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors  under the legal provisions of reproduction  for the support of artists.The Minister of the Economy adds ""In the immediate future  I am delighted with the transition from Ethereum to proof of stake  which consumes much less energy. ""This is in line with Artprice by Artmarket.com's Blockchain  which will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts  as announced in its recent press release  following the transition from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" of Ethereum 2.0 on September 15  2022:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-with-a-99-95-reduction-in-energy-consumption-the-merge-is-a-historic-and-ecological-success-for-ethereum-the-reference-cryptocurrency-for-artprice-and-for-the-art-nft-market-301625211.htmlIndeed  Artmarket.com has been following very closely for the last 3 years the transition to ""The Merge"" for the decarbonized Blockchain Ethereum 2.0  in the context of the global energy crisis  which is only just beginning. According to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH collapses by more than 99.95%  going from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to the ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS).The fact that Artprice anticipated three years earlier the Blockchain Ethereum and its smart contract as the reference in the Art Market for NFTs  is further reinforced by the official dispatch from Christie's on September 27  2022  with the launch announced of Christie's 3.0 which is based on the Blockchain Ethereum.According to an Artprice study:""All Market Makers in the Art Market and in particular the majority of Auction Houses worldwide now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year.

Revenues With revenues of EUR 1 774.5 million in the first nine months of financial year 2022  the Logwin Group significantly exceeded the previous year's revenues of EUR 1 ,EQS-News: Logwin AG / Key word(s): Quarterly / Interim Statement/Quarter ResultsLogwin AG: Logwin with continued very pleasing overall development in the first nine months of 2022 (news with additional features)21.10.2022 / 12:15 CET/CESTThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.Overall economic conditionsGrevenmacher (Luxembourg) After an optimistic start to the year  global economic expansion has come to a standstill in view of Inflation and the resulting slowdown  as well as the effects of the war in Ukraine. The German economy is being hit particularly hard by the rise in energy prices.The logistics market remained robust into the third quarter. Supply and logistics bottlenecks in the transportation sector have eased recently. In the warehousing sector  demand for additional space in Europe can only be met in part. High price increases in numerous sectors are increasingly impacting industrial production and exports in Europe. Freight rates fell significantly in the course of the year from their historic high  but were still above the previous year's level. In view of these difficult conditions  the Logwin Group performed well so far in 2022.Net assets  financial situation and earnings positionRevenues With revenues of EUR 1 774.5 million in the first nine months of financial year 2022  the Logwin Group significantly exceeded the previous year's revenues of EUR 1 260.9 million. At EUR 1 426.7 million  sales in the Air + Ocean business segment were above the previous year's sales of EUR 1 019.2 million due to higher freight rates compared with the previous year  with volumes declining slightly. The Solutions business segment generated sales of EUR 350.5 million and was also significantly above the previous year's figure (2021: EUR 242.2 million)  mainly due to freight rates in the international transport network.EBITA The Logwin Group achieved an operating result (EBITA) of EUR 106.0 million in the first nine months of 2022  a very significant increase on the previous year (2021: EUR 67.5 million). The operating result (EBITA) of the Air + Ocean business segment increased significantly from EUR 67.1 million in the comparative period to EUR 107.7 million in the first nine months of 2022. The business segment's earnings performance reflects sales growth in the first nine months combined with an increase in EBITA margin in a challenging market environment. The operating result (EBITA) of the Solutions business segment increased from EUR 6.8 million in the previous year to EUR 10.7 million  taking into account one-off effects. The international transport network in particular developed positively.Net result In the first nine months of 2022  the Logwin Group generated a net result of EUR 64.2 million (2021: EUR 52.4 million). This includes the impairment of goodwill recorded in the Solutions business segment of EUR -11.7 million.Free cash flow Due to the increase in operating earnings and the positive development of working capital  the Logwin Group's free cash flow of EUR 98.7 million in the first three quarters of 2022 significantly exceeded the prior-year figure of EUR 30.4 million.Risks and change in forecastCompared to the disclosures in the Annual Financial Report 2021  the risk situation for the Logwin Group has not changed significantly. However  there is an increased economic risk with regard to energy supply. In addition  there are still high uncertainties with regard to the current geopolitical tensions and risks from the Covid 19 pandemic. As part of its risk management  Logwin identifies and tracks risks at an early stage. Nevertheless  an unexpected negative impact on the net assets  financial situation and earnings position of the Logwin Group cannot be ruled out. With regard to other existing and potential risks  we refer to the Annual Financial Report 2021.For the full year 2022  the Logwin Group continues to expect revenues to develop at the previous year's level  assuming that freight rates continue to decline. The revenue development of the Logwin Group remains highly dependent on the development of air and ocean freight rates. In both business units  the declining development of freight rates will noticeably dampen the increase in sales. Due to the current economic developments and taking into account special effects  the operating result is expected to remain at least at the previous year's level.The aforementioned key performance indicators (KPIs) are an integral part of Logwin Groups system of key figures and are described and defined in the section Financial Performance Management of the management report of the Annual Financial Report 2021 (page 1 et seq.) in line with the European Securities and Markets Authoritys (ESMA) Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) dated 5 October 2015.The Quarterly statement as of 30 September 2022 of Logwin Group is available on the internet at: www.logwin-logistics.comAbout Logwin AGLogwin AG (Grevenmacher  Luxembourg) provides efficient logistics and transport solutions for its customers from industry and trade.

11927,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unifiedpost-settles-earn-obligations-former-050000730.html,Unifiedpost settles earn-out obligations to former Crossinx shareholders,La Hulpe ‚Äì 21 October 2022  7:00 a.m. CET ‚Äì [INSIDE INFORMATION] Unifiedpost Group (Euronext: UPG) (Unifiedpost  or the Company) completed the acquisition of...,La Hulpe ‚Äì 21 October 2022  7:00 a.m. CET ‚Äì [INSIDE INFORMATION] Unifiedpost Group (Euronext: UPG) (Unifiedpost  or the Company) completed the acquisition of the German e-invoicing market leader Crossinx on April 9  2021. In agreement with the former Crossinx shareholders  Unifiedpost now settles the earn-out obligations in exchange for a one-time payment of ‚Ç¨ 4.829.792 94 through the issuance in aggregate of 1.277.723 new shares of Unifiedpost.The original transactionIn April 2021  Unifiedpost acquired with Crossinx a real-time data-driven e-invoice solution. By acquiring this technology  the Unifiedpost solutions will now be able to support data-driven communication in its order-to-cash and procure-to-pay solution with substantive data validation. These digital solutions are now ready for the market transition to data e-invoices validated in real-time. This brings the Company ahead of the market curve  certainly with upcoming mandatory e-invoicing regulation in the EU.In addition to the technology Unifiedpost achieved with the acquisition a direct access to the large DACH market (Germany  Austria  Switzerland) and can benefit from the expected growth opportunities. On top of that  the Company can now serve corporate clients internationally with a full offering.Unifiedpost acquired Crossinx in April 2021 with a cash consideration and share consideration paid in April 2021. The former shareholders of Crossinx were possible entitled to a deferred conditional consideration of up to a maximum of ‚Ç¨ 60 million  partly payable in cash and partly payable in shares. These earn-out payments were due if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Current transaction detailsThrough an addendum dated 20 October 2022 to the share purchase agreement  the parties have decided to replace any potential obligations by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders in respect of any earn-amount by a one-time fixed payment of ‚Ç¨ 4.829.792 94 in aggregate. As the one-time payment is fully settled in shares of Unifiedpost  there is no cash payment by the Company. At an issuance price of ‚Ç¨ 3 78 per share  this corresponds to 1.277.723 new shares which have been issued by the Company on 20 October 2022.Story continuesPursuant to the addendum  the former Crossinx shareholders have agreed to a lock-up. For the four main former Crossinx shareholders (representing 65 77 % of the new shares)  the lock-up will last for 12 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after 6 months  and 25% more shares being released three months thereafter. For the other former Crossinx shareholders the lock-up lasts 6 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after three months.Related partiesThe former Crossinx shareholders include Mr. Michael Kleindl and Mr. Marcus Laube as related parties. Mr. Kleindl is through his company First Performance AG currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company. The announcement required by the related party rules is set out in the appendix.AppendixPublic announcement pursuant to article 7:97  ¬ß4/1 of the Companies and Associations Code relating to the buy-out of the potential earn-out claims of former Crossinx shareholders1. The Board of Directors of the Company held on 20 October 2022 decided to approve the addendum to the sale and purchase agreement of 9 April 2021 between the former Crossinx shareholders and the Company.Two of the former Crossinx shareholders include (i) Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company KOMM Investment AG) and (ii) Mr. Marcus Laube. Following the completion of the acquisition of Crossinx  they have joined the Company. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company.Given their functions  First Performance AG (with permanent representative Mr. Kleindl) and Mr. Laube qualify as related parties within the meaning of IFRS and article 7:97 CAC.In this context  the Board of Directors applied Article 7:97 of the Companies and Associations Code (‚ÄúCAC‚Äù) relating to decisions and transactions concerning a party related to the Company. This provision implies  among other things  the intervention of a committee of independent directors to give an opinion to the Board of Directors. The conclusion of this opinion is set out at the end of this communication.In addition  this provision provides that when the decision or transaction involves a director  such person cannot not take part in the deliberations or vote of the Board of Directors. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) decided not to be present at the Board of Directors which decided on the transaction and did thus not participate in the deliberations or votes.The Company has also applied Article 7:96 CAC  relating to decisions in which a director has a direct or indirect interest of a proprietary nature that is opposed to the interest of the Company. This provision also provides that this director does not participate in the deliberation or votes. The director concerned is the one indicated in the previous paragraph.2. The addendum to the transaction documentation was signed on 20 October 2022. It provides that the former Crossinx shareholders shall receive in aggregate 1.277.723 shares of the Company  replacing the previously agreed potential earn-out amounts  if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Six of the thirty one Sellers (the ‚ÄúESOP Sellers‚Äù)  including Mr Laube  were party to an employee stock option program in Crossinx before the original Crossinx transaction. Shortly before the signing of the original Crossinx transaction  the ESOP Sellers converted their claims under the ESOP into actual Crossinx shares. Despite this conversion  Crossinx remains responsible as tax indemnitor for any wage taxes of the ESOP Sellers. As this is a continuing obligation  it is therefore agreed under the addendum that the value of such taxes (‚ÄúESOP Charges‚Äù) are held back.As a result  the number of new shares issued by the Company on 20 October 2022 amounts to 1.277.723 in aggregate (the ‚ÄúEffective Buy-Off Shares‚Äù)  among which Mr Kleindl has received 20 98% shares and Mr Laube received 18 54% shares. These shares have been allocated proportionally based on the former share percentage in Crossinx but taking into account the hold-back for the ESOP Sellers.The issuance amount per share is equal to the lowest trading price of the shares of the Company on the day that the new shares have been issued by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders  i.e. ‚Ç¨ 3 78. The capital increase of the Company amounts to ‚Ç¨ 4.829.792 94.As the value of the shares is based on an open public market price where mechanism of supply and demand plays  the price should be seen as the current fair price of the share as all trading parties are fully informed with same financial data.3. The new shares have been issued as registered shares and are subject to a lock-up period.The lock-up period will depend on the percentage which the former Crossinx shareholder held in Crossinx prior to the original transaction. Both the company of Mr. Kleindl and Mr. Laube will be subject to the extended lock-up of 12 month with staggering release.4. The immediate early termination of the earn-out terms under the original Crossinx documentation and the entering into the addendum facilitates the full integration of Crossinx with the Company. In the absence thereof  the implementation of the company change and integration project ‚Äúone product  one company‚Äù might be delayed until the end of the earn-out period (i.e. 31 December 2023).The change and integration project is aimed to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company. Further  the addendum will eliminate any potential future risk for the Company to pay earn-out. The addendum does not include any cash payment by the Company.5. A committee of all 5 independent directors of Unifiedpost has assessed the transaction described above  in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC  and has issued a written and substantiated opinion on this matter to the board of directors of Unifiedpost. The conclusions of the opinion of the committee of independent directors are as follows:‚ÄúBased on the above argumentation  the Committee is of the opinion that the completion of the Crossinx Addendum Transaction resulting in an early termination of the Orginal Crossinx Agreement is in the best interest of the Company.The early termination of the Original Crossinx Agreement is a necessary condition precedent if the Company wants to start to implement with immediate effect a change and integration project which is aimed and expected to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company that largely outweighs the disadvantage of the cost and dilutive effect of the new shares to be issued as provided for in the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.In view of this  the Committee unanimously advises the Board of Directors of the Company to approve the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.‚ÄùFinally  the assessment made by the auditor in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC reads as follows: Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data included in the opinion of the committee of independent directors dated 19 October 2022 and in the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors dated 20 October 2022  justifying the proposed transaction  are not fair and sufficient in all material respects in light of the information available to us in connection with our engagement.Financial Calendar 202210 November 2022 Publication Q3 2022 Business Update30 November 2022 Investor Day 2022Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù  ‚ÄúIdentity‚Äù and ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù.

11928,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inventiva-announces-scientific-presentation-aasld-200000190.html,Inventiva announces a scientific presentation at the AASLD The Liver Meeting¬Æ 2022,Daix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  October 21  2022 ‚Äì Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical ...,"INVENTIVADaix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  October 21  2022 ‚Äì Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs  today announced that a scientific abstract has been selected for poster presentation at the upcoming The Liver Meeting¬Æ 2022 hosted by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases on November 4-8  2022 in Washington  DC.The abstract evaluates the correlation between the response to lanifibranor therapy and adiponectin levels. Low adiponectin levels are known to be associated with NASH and with cardiovascular disease. Liver biomarkers and imaging assessments  as well as adiponectin serum levels measures  were conducted during Inventiva‚Äôs NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial  in order to evaluate the relation between adiponectin changes and the improvement of a broad panel of markers of liver and cardiometabolic health in patients with NASH. The adiponectin levels at baseline were low in patients enrolled in the NATIVE clinical trial  and treatment with lanifibranor significantly increased adiponectin levels in contrast to placebo. This increase in adiponectin is correlated with improvements in glycemic control  insulin resistance  lipid profile  liver tests and systemic inflammation  as well as liver steatosis quantified by ultrasound-based imaging. These data further show that lanifibranor  in addition to its beneficial effect on liver histology  also improves markers of cardiometabolic health and increases adiponectin levels  and thus has the potential to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with NASH.The details of the presentation are as follows:Abstract :Abstract title: ""Lanifibranor-induced improvement of liver and cardiometabolic markers of NASH is associated with an increase in adiponectin"" Poster number: 2526 Presentation type: Poster presentation Authors: Michael P. Cooreman  Sven Francque  Philippe Huot-Marchand  Lucile Dzen  Martine Baudin  Jean-Louis Junien  Pierre Broqua  Manal F. Abdelmalek Date: November 5  2022 ‚Äì 8:30am-5:00pm (EST)Inventiva will also be present with a booth: we are inviting you to visit us from Friday 4th through Monday 7th  during exhibition hall opening hours at booth #548 located in the exhibition hall of the conference center.Story continuesAbout lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator‚Äëactivated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well‚Äëcharacterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well‚Äëbalanced activation of PPARŒ± and PPARŒ¥  and a partial activation of PPARŒ≥. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan‚ÄëPPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor‚Äôs moderate and balanced pan‚ÄëPPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre‚Äëclinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORŒ≥ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva‚Äôs pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva‚Äôs decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

Full login details and presentation materials are available at: https://www.voltalia.com/investor-relations""The growth of renewable energy is accelerating. A key element in the fight against global warming  renewable energy has also become the cheapest energy ever produced in history  while meeting the energy security challenges of countries and companies.By creating new renewable power plants on its own behalf and for its customers  while reducing their energy consumption through its subsidiary Helexia  Voltalia is helping to meet the challenge of the energy transition.After achieving an average annual growth in revenues of 46% between 2014  the date of its IPO  and 2021  Voltalia has set itself a new roadmap. While we anticipate that the 2023 capacity target will be reached a year early and confirm the EBITDA target of ‚Ç¨275-300 million in 2023  Voltalia is now targeting operating and construction capacity in excess of 5 gigawatts and a normalised EBITDA of around ‚Ç¨475 million¬π by 2027. In addition  in line with its status as a company with a mission  Voltalia has set a new environmental objective for 2027: over 4 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent avoided‚Äù  commented S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.An extraordinary sectorNumerous structural and economic factors are sustaining the renewable energy sector:Story continuesPublic policies and private initiatives against global warming ;Intensification of government measures to promote energy independence ;Trend towards lower costs for renewable energy in a context of rising costs for other energy sources;Willingness of companies to reduce their exposure to the volatility of energy prices in the long term and to lower their energy bills;Rise in the electrification of uses with  for example  the emergence of electric vehicles and the gradual switch to electric heating.However  the sector's growth cycle is still in its infancy  and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix should continue to accelerate over the next few years.On the three continents where Voltalia is present:In Europe   which is already committed to the fight against global warming   the war in Ukraine has made energy independence a central priority of government policies. A sudden and sustained acceleration in renewable energy and energy efficiency is taking shape: Europe is once again becoming one of the key global markets;In Africa   the market remains dynamic due to strong growth in electricity consumption . South Africa  in particular  is going through a major energy crisis. The growth in demand is combined with the country's need to replace ageing coal-fired power plants that are no longer adapted to the needs of the population;In Latin America  population growth is creating structural demand for energy consumption. In addition  Brazil's extremely favourable wind patterns  coupled with good sunshine  will gradually attract electro-intensive industries.A clear mission  a successful business modelVoltalia has been aware of the challenges facing its sector since its creation in 2005. As a responsible player  Voltalia formally defined its mission in 2014  before officially integrating it in its articles of association in 20202. Within this legal framework  Voltalia defines the extra-financial indicators of its mission. These are audited and presented annually to the general meeting  alongside the financial report. Voltalia‚Äôs mission seeks a fair balance between the planet and its inhabitants: improving the global environment while promoting local development. Every day  it guides the actions and decisions of everyone within Voltalia and its governance.Voltalia  directly or through its subsidiaries  implements the energy transition technologies that create the best opportunities:Electricity production: ground-mounted photovoltaic   roof-mounted and car park  onshore wind power   small-scale hydroelectricity and biomass (power plants burning recovered wood);Battery storage and potentially other technologies;Energy efficiency and energy management.Voltalia has deployed a business model that combines the business of a renewable energy producer through its own power plants with that of service provider to third-party customers. Voltalia's employees who  on behalf of customers  create energy production or savings projects from scratch during the development and construction phases  and then operate and maintain them. This model for itself and third-party customers has the most significant impact on its mission while creating the most financial value.As the services business is not very capital intensive  electricity production and storage account for the vast majority of Voltalia's capital. In this business  Voltalia relies on very long-term electricity sales contracts (generally 20 years) which are designed to ensure the repayment of project financing and to secure equity investments. The contractual sales prices are mostly (83% in 2021) indexed to inflation.A strong growth trajectory since its IPO on EuronextSince its IPO  Voltalia has posted an average annual growth (CAGR) of +46% in revenues and +41% in EBITDA between 2014 and 2021. Over the period  the capacity in operation and under construction has increased more than fourfold  from 365 MW to 1.7 GW in 2021. Voltalia also announced on the occasion of the publication of its half-yearly results for 2022 that its target of 2.6 GW of capacity in operation and under construction  which it planned to achieve by the end of 2023  would finally be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule.This growth trajectory  essentially organic  has benefited from targeted acquisitions which have accelerated the strategy  in particular that of Helexia which offers its client companies  in parallel with Voltalia's corporate PPA offer  on-site solar production ( roofs and car park shades) and investments to reduce their energy consumption.New growth ambitions for 2027On 28 September  during the publication of its half-year results for 2022  Voltalia indicated that it believed that it would be able to achieve its 2023 target of 2.6 gigawatts of capacity in operation and under construction one year ahead of schedule and that it was confirming its two other 2023 targets: a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨275 to ‚Ç¨300 million and a share of Brazil in capacity in operation and under construction below 50%.In this context  Voltalia has defined a new growth plan for 2027  including the following objectives:Operating and construction capacity owned by Voltalia: over 5 gigawatts by the end of 2027;Capacity operated on behalf of third parties: over 8 gigawatts by the end of 2027;Normalised EBITDA 3 : around ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027;CO2-equivalent avoided: over 4 million tonnes in 2027.Voltalia will examine the best options for financing its CAPEX of between an estimated ‚Ç¨2.5 and ‚Ç¨3 billion to support its new ambitions by 2027. In addition to the usual project financing and its significant cash flow  the group reserves the right to raise corporate financing  to selectively sell minority shares to partners in some of its projects or to arrange equity financing  depending on market conditions and  where appropriate  involving all of its existing shareholders  including its main shareholder  the Mulliez family.Solid assets to achieve its ambitionsVoltalia will be able to draw on a number of strengths to achieve this ambitious growth plan up to 2027  including:A portfolio of projects under development at a record level of 13.6 GW  of which 986 MW have won a PPA and 1.8 GW are ready to tender for a PPA;The gain  since January 2022  of new long-term electricity sales contracts for 640 MW;A volume of projects in the early stages of development (which meet one  two or three of the four criteria required to enter the development portfolio 4 ) of 22.1 GW;Ability to sell and implement the full range of products offered to businesses : corporate wind and solar PPAs  photovoltaic roofs and shades and energy efficiency;Expertise in Development  Construction and Supply of equipment and Operation-Maintenance services to third party clients;Expertise in the key technologies of the energy transition  in particular those currently experiencing strong growth: photovoltaics  storage and energy efficiency;A geographical positioning focused on countries where the sector's growth potential is among the highest in the world;The ability to make acquisitions   integrate them and then rapidly develop the acquired entities;A track record of strong growth management with revenue and EBITDA growing at CAGR since the IPO on the Euronext regulated market in 2014  of 46% and 41% respectively over the period 2014-2021.DisclaimerThis press release and the information contained herein do not constitute either an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase the securities of Voltalia.The release  publication or distribution of this press release may be restricted in certain countries by applicable laws and regulations.

All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they are implanted with the alfapump and will be used for primary endpoint analysis. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.Story continuesThe primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival. For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About fluid overload in liver cirrhosis (AKA ascites)Fluid accumulation in the abdomen is a significant and common complication of liver cirrhosis. Approximately 10% of these patients do not respond to diuretic drugs and most require recurrent external drainage (AKA paracentesis)  an invasive and painful procedure that only provides temporary benefit  require frequent hospitalizations and severely impacts their quality of life.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer.

Read why the stock is a buy.,Jean-Luc Ichard/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionA lot has happened since I last discussed Saint-Gobain (OTCPK:CODGF) (OTCPK:CODYY)  a French conglomerate with a history of almost four centuries. In these past 4.5 years we experienced the COVID lockdowns  the brief economic improvement only to be hit by decade-high inflation numbers right now. Despite these headwinds  Saint-Gobain performed quite well in the first semester and the free cash flow remained very strong so I wanted to have a look at the company's performance and financial situation as the share price is currently trading about 10% lower than in 2018.Yahoo FinanceAs Saint-Gobain is a French company  its listing on Euronext Paris is the best way to trade in the company as it definitely is much more liquid. The ticker symbol in France is SGO  and the average daily volume is 1.1M shares. The current market capitalization is approximately 20B EUR. As the company reports and trades in euro  I will use the EUR as base currency throughout this article. Saint-Gobain has published an excellent 54-page presentation which you can consult here to get a better understanding of the company and its divisions.Surprisingly strong results in the first half of the year bode well for the rest of this yearAlthough Saint-Gobain's fate is closely related to the situation of the world economy as the company is one of the most important producers and distributors of construction materials and applications for the automotive industry (like windows)  the performance in the first half of this year was actually stronger than I had anticipated. While I didn't dare to buy the stock once the war in Ukraine started  I decided to keep a closer eye on the financial performance as the share price is currently trading 40% below its 52 week high of 67.12 EUR per share.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsThe total revenue in the first semester increased by approximately 15%  and the entire revenue increase was caused by organic growth and that's pretty impressive. And while the COGS increased by in excess of 15% (which explains the boosted revenue as Saint-Gobain was passing on the higher operating expenses to its customers)  the other 'general expenses' increased by just 7% and this helped to push the operating income higher by about 20%  to just under 2.8B EUR.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsThe other expenses increased somewhat (from 232M EUR to 298M EUR) and these expenses include impairment losses  amortization expenses and acquisition-related expenses. On top of that  there are some restructuring expenses and claims-related expenses as well.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsThe net interest expenses decreased as well and despite recording a total tax pressure of 530M EUR  the reported net income came in at 1.77B EUR. About 50M EUR of this amount was attributable to non-controlling interests  which means the net income attributable to the shareholders of Saint-Gobain was 1.72B EUR. This resulted in an EPS of 3.34 EUR based on the average share count of just under 517M shares. The net share count as of the end of June came in at 520M shares which means the EPS based on the current share count was 3.31 EUR per share. Pretty strong considering the stock is trading below 40 EUR per share.I already noticed in 2018 Saint-Gobain tends to be a strong performer on the cash flow level and H1 2022 wasn't any different. The reported operating cash flow was 1.64B EUR but this included a working capital investment of approximately 1.3B EUR (mainly related to a seasonal build-up of inventory levels). This means the operating cash flow before changes in the working capital was approximately 2.9B EUR.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsFrom that result we still need to deduct the 355M EUR in lease payments. This means the adjusted operating cash flow in the first half of the current financial year was approximately 2.55B EUR. That's an increase of more than 20% compared to the 2.08B EUR in H1 2021.As you can see in the cash flow statement above  the company spent about 832M EUR on capital expenditures. This would indicate the free cash flow result was approximately 1.7B EUR (which would be pretty good  but keep in mind the majority of the 832M EUR in capital expenditures was actually spent on growth as growth investments doubled compared to H1 2021.The image below shows the sustaining capital expenditures in the first half of the yearSaint-Gobain Investor RelationsThis means the underlying sustaining free cash flow in the first half of the year was 2.2B EUR and divided over 520M shares  that's approximately 4.13 EUR per share after also deducting the cash flow attributable to non-controlling interests. The free cash flow result is higher than the reported net income due to the fact the sustaining capex and lease payments of 704M EUR are lower than the 1.04B EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses. Looking at the full-year perspective  I expect a free cash flow result of approximately 3.5B EUR.As of the end of June  the net debt came in at 8.3 BEUR  representing just 1.3 times the underlying EBITDA.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsAnd while Saint-Gobain has divested numerous assets over the past few years  the company is still looking at bolt-on acquisitions. The company closed the Kaycan acquisition for which it paid about $820M or about 8 times EBITDA after taking the anticipated $30M in synergy benefits into consideration. And SGO also closed the GCP acquisition in the third quarter of this year. That deal was originally announced in December 2021 when Saint-Gobain announced an all-cash offer of $32/share for a total value of $2.3B. The deal was originally worth 2B EUR but as the USD strengthened versus the Euro in the past year  the final price tag will be approximately 15% higher in Euro.GCP was anticipated to generate $170M in EBITDA this year  but Saint-Gobain also expects to generate $85M in annual synergy benefits further down the road which means it is paying approximately 8.8 times the EBITDA including synergy benefits.These two acquisitions closed in the third quarter and as they were all-cash acquisitions we should expect the net debt on Saint-Gobain's balance sheet to increase by the end of this year. That shouldn't be an issue as the strong cash flow generation will immediately help to reduce the net debt from next year on while the attributable EBITDA from the acquisitions will also help to keep the debt ratio at an acceptable level.Investment thesisThe company's first semester was much stronger than I had anticipated as the sustaining free cash flow exceeded 2.2B EUR. While that is great  I would still like to see how Saint-Gobain performed in the third quarter of the year and what its anticipations are for the fourth quarter as I can imagine the visibility isn't great.Despite spending in excess of 3B EUR on acquisitions in the past few months  I think the balance sheet is and will be fine and the bond market appears to agree with me. The 2032 bond with a 2.625% coupon is currently trading at 85.6% of the par value  implying a yield of 4.45%. That is a mark-up of less than 150 base points to the French government bond yield for the same period.I currently have no position in Saint-Gobain but I am keeping very close tabs on this one.,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,mixed,0.59,0.09,0.32,True,English,"['Cash Flow Monster Saint-Gobain', 'Less Than 7 Times Earnings', 'CODGF', 'underlying sustaining free cash flow', 'free cash flow result', 'cash flow level', 'cash flow statement', 'operating cash flow', 'brief economic improvement', 'decade-high inflation numbers', 'average daily volume', 'current market capitalization', 'excellent 54-page presentation', 'total tax pressure', 'sustaining capital expenditures', 'higher operating expenses', 'working capital investment', 'average share count', 'current share count', 'Saint-Gobain Investor Relations', ""other 'general expenses"", 'net interest expenses', 'net share count', 'entire revenue increase', 'current financial year', 'sustaining capex', 'operating income', 'other expenses', 'total revenue', 'net income', 'net debt', 'amortization expenses', 'acquisition-related expenses', 'restructuring expenses', 'claims-related expenses', 'Jean-Luc Ichard', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:CODYY', 'French conglomerate', 'four centuries', 'past 4.5 years', 'COVID lockdowns', 'first semester', 'Yahoo Finance', 'Euronext Paris', 'best way', 'ticker symbol', '1.1M shares', 'base currency', 'strong results', 'first half', 'world economy', 'important producers', 'construction materials', 'automotive industry', 'closer eye', 'impairment losses', 'controlling interests', '517M shares', '520M shares', 'strong performer', 'seasonal build-up', 'inventory levels', 'lease payments', 'full-year perspective', 'share price', 'financial situation', '298M EUR', '50M EUR', '355M EUR', '2.08B EUR', '1.04B EUR', 'financial performance', 'organic growth', 'growth investments', 'French company', 'company reports', '832M EUR', '67.12 EUR', 'Editorial', 'Introduction', 'lot', 'history', 'headwinds', 'look', 'listing', 'France', 'SGO', 'trades', 'article', 'understanding', 'divisions', 'fate', 'distributors', 'applications', 'windows', 'stock', 'war', 'Ukraine', '52 week', 'COGS', 'excess', 'customers', '2.8B', '232M', 'top', '530M', 'amount', 'shareholders', 'EPS', 'June', 'H1', 'changes', '9B', '55B', 'mind', 'majority', 'fact', '704M', 'depreciation', '3.5B', '8.3 BEUR', '34', '1.3']",2022-10-21,2022-10-21,seekingalpha.com

The increased cash outflow was primarily due to the PRIMAvera clinical trial in Europe for which the Company reached its enrolment target of 38 patients from its clinical sites in France  Germany  the UK  Spain  the Netherlands and Italy. Furthermore  the manufacturing of remote rehabilitation systems for patients in clinical trials as well as costs related to the preparation of financing options  lead to an increase in spending  which were partially offset by reduced expenses associated with the French and US feasibility studies.Until 30 September 2022  investments in fixed and intangible assets remained low leading to a net cash outflow from investment activities of ‚Ç¨0.1 million.At 30 September 2022  net cash provided by financing activities totalled ‚Ç¨4.2 million  following the drawdown of the first tranche of the convertible note (‚ÄúORNAN 2022‚Äù) signed with ESGO in July 2022 for a total of ‚Ç¨5.5 million and for which the Company received a total amount of ‚Ç¨4.6 million (in net proceeds).Story continuesIn total  at 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision‚Äôs cash position amounted to ‚Ç¨8.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨16.9 million on 1 January 2022. Given its current cash position  the Company believes that it is able to finance its operations until middle of the second quarter 2023.Due to the constraints of its agreement with ESGO  Pixium Vision is currently not able to continue drawing further tranches and therefore the Company is exploring various avenues to enable it to secure its cash flow necessary to pursue its strategic ambitions.Key developments in the third quarter of 2022In the third quarter of 2022 Pixium Vision continued the positive momentum of its clinical development in completing the enrolment of the PRIMAvera study  the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials and has implemented a convertible note facility with a maximum nominal amount of ‚Ç¨30 million with ESGO  including the drawdown of the first tranche of ‚Ç¨5.5 million.On 14 July 2022  Pixium Vision announced the implementation of a financing of a maximum nominal amount of ‚Ç¨30 million with ESGO  and the drawdown of a first tranche of ‚Ç¨5.5 million.On 3 August 2022  Pixium Vision announced the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials.On 19 September 2022  Pixium Vision announced reaching its enrolment target in the European pivotal trial PRIMAvera and confirmed the intention to complete all implantations by end 2022.Subsequent to the closing on 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision published peer-reviewed safety data of the Prima System in Dry AMD in the Journal of Neural Engineering was published.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

At the date of this communication 2 600 K‚Ç¨ are undrawn.Story continuesActivity and outlookResumption of post-pandemic activityAlmost all the constraints linked to the pandemic have been lifted since this summer since when Orege has thus been able to resume the execution of two projects  both frozen for 2.5 years  one in Germany and the other in Japan. However  no revenue will be generated in 2022 from these two projects.Or√®ge has been able to adapt to disrupted supply chainsThe global pressure on supply chains has increased in recent months (prices  delivery times  availability of certain electronic components and PLCs  etc.).Orege started planning for this challenge since the end of 2021 and has since then thus carried out a complete reorganization of its supply chains: recruitment of an experienced supply chain manager  new distributors  ‚Äúopportunistic‚Äù purchases of component stocks  revisited PLC configurations in order to adapt to the context  etc.As a result  Orege does not anticipate any problem for the end of 2022  nor any significant constraint for 2023 on the basis of how things stand presently.Impact of the energy crisis on the businessIn a context where the energy crisis has a strong impact on many of our customers and partners  Orege considers that opportunities are created by proposing an improvement in the performance of ""anaerobic digesters"" which are most often found in large wastewater treatment plants.It should be remembered that the energy costs of wastewater treatment plants are a significant operating expense of these plants.Orege's solutions  which themselves consume little energy  enable operators to generate substantial financial savings  but also from now will enable operators to optimize biogas production.This dedicated commercial approach will enable Orege to refine its positioning in the sludge recovery chain.Projects signed and/or in the execution phase in the US and the UKOrders expected by the end of 2022The two projects signed with municipal utilities in Wisconsin (La Crosse) and in South Carolina (Easley) will be largely completed in 2022  which should generate revenue for the year of approximately 700 K‚Ç¨.A major project on an industrial wastewater treatment plant in Houston  initiated in collaboration with the Alfa Laval Group  is in progress.It should make a significant contribution to revenue for 2022.Orege has just signed a contract in October for the sale of 3 SLG-F thickening solutions with a new Water Utility in the UK. The 3 corresponding units could be implemented by the end of 2022 and generate around ‚Ç¨1 million in revenue for the current financial year.Four orders (3 in the UK and 1 in the US) are expected by the end of 2022 for a total value of around ‚Ç¨1.3 million.

In agreement with the former Crossinx‚Ä¶,La Hulpe ‚Äì 21 October 2022  7:00 a.m. CET ‚Äì [INSIDE INFORMATION] Unifiedpost Group (Euronext: UPG) (Unifiedpost  or the Company) completed the acquisition of the German e-invoicing market leader Crossinx on April 9  2021. In agreement with the former Crossinx shareholders  Unifiedpost now settles the earn-out obligations in exchange for a one-time payment of ‚Ç¨ 4.829.792 94 through the issuance in aggregate of 1.277.723 new shares of Unifiedpost.The original transactionIn April 2021  Unifiedpost acquired with Crossinx a real-time data-driven e-invoice solution. By acquiring this technology  the Unifiedpost solutions will now be able to support data-driven communication in its order-to-cash and procure-to-pay solution with substantive data validation. These digital solutions are now ready for the market transition to data e-invoices validated in real-time. This brings the Company ahead of the market curve  certainly with upcoming mandatory e-invoicing regulation in the EU.In addition to the technology Unifiedpost achieved with the acquisition a direct access to the large DACH market (Germany  Austria  Switzerland) and can benefit from the expected growth opportunities. On top of that  the Company can now serve corporate clients internationally with a full offering.Unifiedpost acquired Crossinx in April 2021 with a cash consideration and share consideration paid in April 2021. The former shareholders of Crossinx were possible entitled to a deferred conditional consideration of up to a maximum of ‚Ç¨ 60 million  partly payable in cash and partly payable in shares. These earn-out payments were due if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Current transaction detailsThrough an addendum dated 20 October 2022 to the share purchase agreement  the parties have decided to replace any potential obligations by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders in respect of any earn-amount by a one-time fixed payment of ‚Ç¨ 4.829.792 94 in aggregate. As the one-time payment is fully settled in shares of Unifiedpost  there is no cash payment by the Company. At an issuance price of ‚Ç¨ 3 78 per share  this corresponds to 1.277.723 new shares which have been issued by the Company on 20 October 2022.Pursuant to the addendum  the former Crossinx shareholders have agreed to a lock-up. For the four main former Crossinx shareholders (representing 65 77 % of the new shares)  the lock-up will last for 12 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after 6 months  and 25% more shares being released three months thereafter. For the other former Crossinx shareholders the lock-up lasts 6 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after three months.Related partiesThe former Crossinx shareholders include Mr. Michael Kleindl and Mr. Marcus Laube as related parties. Mr. Kleindl is through his company First Performance AG currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company. The announcement required by the related party rules is set out in the appendix.AppendixPublic announcement pursuant to article 7:97  ¬ß4/1 of the Companies and Associations Code relating to the buy-out of the potential earn-out claims of former Crossinx shareholders1. The Board of Directors of the Company held on 20 October 2022 decided to approve the addendum to the sale and purchase agreement of 9 April 2021 between the former Crossinx shareholders and the Company.Two of the former Crossinx shareholders include (i) Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company KOMM Investment AG) and (ii) Mr. Marcus Laube. Following the completion of the acquisition of Crossinx  they have joined the Company. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company.Given their functions  First Performance AG (with permanent representative Mr. Kleindl) and Mr. Laube qualify as related parties within the meaning of IFRS and article 7:97 CAC.In this context  the Board of Directors applied Article 7:97 of the Companies and Associations Code (‚ÄúCAC‚Äù) relating to decisions and transactions concerning a party related to the Company. This provision implies  among other things  the intervention of a committee of independent directors to give an opinion to the Board of Directors. The conclusion of this opinion is set out at the end of this communication.In addition  this provision provides that when the decision or transaction involves a director  such person cannot not take part in the deliberations or vote of the Board of Directors. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) decided not to be present at the Board of Directors which decided on the transaction and did thus not participate in the deliberations or votes.The Company has also applied Article 7:96 CAC  relating to decisions in which a director has a direct or indirect interest of a proprietary nature that is opposed to the interest of the Company. This provision also provides that this director does not participate in the deliberation or votes. The director concerned is the one indicated in the previous paragraph.2. The addendum to the transaction documentation was signed on 20 October 2022. It provides that the former Crossinx shareholders shall receive in aggregate 1.277.723 shares of the Company  replacing the previously agreed potential earn-out amounts  if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Six of the thirty one Sellers (the ‚ÄúESOP Sellers‚Äù)  including Mr Laube  were party to an employee stock option program in Crossinx before the original Crossinx transaction. Shortly before the signing of the original Crossinx transaction  the ESOP Sellers converted their claims under the ESOP into actual Crossinx shares. Despite this conversion  Crossinx remains responsible as tax indemnitor for any wage taxes of the ESOP Sellers. As this is a continuing obligation  it is therefore agreed under the addendum that the value of such taxes (‚ÄúESOP Charges‚Äù) are held back.As a result  the number of new shares issued by the Company on 20 October 2022 amounts to 1.277.723 in aggregate (the ‚ÄúEffective Buy-Off Shares‚Äù)  among which Mr Kleindl has received 20 98% shares and Mr Laube received 18 54% shares. These shares have been allocated proportionally based on the former share percentage in Crossinx but taking into account the hold-back for the ESOP Sellers.The issuance amount per share is equal to the lowest trading price of the shares of the Company on the day that the new shares have been issued by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders  i.e. ‚Ç¨ 3 78. The capital increase of the Company amounts to ‚Ç¨ 4.829.792 94.As the value of the shares is based on an open public market price where mechanism of supply and demand plays  the price should be seen as the current fair price of the share as all trading parties are fully informed with same financial data.3. The new shares have been issued as registered shares and are subject to a lock-up period.The lock-up period will depend on the percentage which the former Crossinx shareholder held in Crossinx prior to the original transaction. Both the company of Mr. Kleindl and Mr. Laube will be subject to the extended lock-up of 12 month with staggering release.4. The immediate early termination of the earn-out terms under the original Crossinx documentation and the entering into the addendum facilitates the full integration of Crossinx with the Company. In the absence thereof  the implementation of the company change and integration project ‚Äúone product  one company‚Äù might be delayed until the end of the earn-out period (i.e. 31 December 2023).The change and integration project is aimed to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company. Further  the addendum will eliminate any potential future risk for the Company to pay earn-out. The addendum does not include any cash payment by the Company.5. A committee of all 5 independent directors of Unifiedpost has assessed the transaction described above  in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC  and has issued a written and substantiated opinion on this matter to the board of directors of Unifiedpost. The conclusions of the opinion of the committee of independent directors are as follows:‚ÄúBased on the above argumentation  the Committee is of the opinion that the completion of the Crossinx Addendum Transaction resulting in an early termination of the Orginal Crossinx Agreement is in the best interest of the Company.The early termination of the Original Crossinx Agreement is a necessary condition precedent if the Company wants to start to implement with immediate effect a change and integration project which is aimed and expected to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company that largely outweighs the disadvantage of the cost and dilutive effect of the new shares to be issued as provided for in the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.In view of this  the Committee unanimously advises the Board of Directors of the Company to approve the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.‚ÄùFinally  the assessment made by the auditor in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC reads as follows: Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data included in the opinion of the committee of independent directors dated 19 October 2022 and in the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors dated 20 October 2022  justifying the proposed transaction  are not fair and sufficient in all material respects in light of the information available to us in connection with our engagement.Financial Calendar 202210 November 2022 Publication Q3 2022 Business Update30 November 2022 Investor Day 2022Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù  ‚ÄúIdentity‚Äù and ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù.

Low adiponectin levels are known to be associated with NASH and with cardiovascular disease. Liver biomarkers and imaging assessments  as well as adiponectin serum levels measures  were conducted during Inventiva‚Äôs NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial  in order to evaluate the relation between adiponectin changes and the improvement of a broad panel of markers of liver and cardiometabolic health in patients with NASH. The adiponectin levels at baseline were low in patients enrolled in the NATIVE clinical trial  and treatment with lanifibranor significantly increased adiponectin levels in contrast to placebo. This increase in adiponectin is correlated with improvements in glycemic control  insulin resistance  lipid profile  liver tests and systemic inflammation  as well as liver steatosis quantified by ultrasound-based imaging. These data further show that lanifibranor  in addition to its beneficial effect on liver histology  also improves markers of cardiometabolic health and increases adiponectin levels  and thus has the potential to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with NASH.The details of the presentation are as follows:Abstract :Abstract title: ""Lanifibranor-induced improvement of liver and cardiometabolic markers of NASH is associated with an increase in adiponectin"" Poster number: 2526 Presentation type: Poster presentation Authors: Michael P. Cooreman  Sven Francque  Philippe Huot-Marchand  Lucile Dzen  Martine Baudin  Jean-Louis Junien  Pierre Broqua  Manal F. Abdelmalek Date: November 5  2022 ‚Äì 8:30am-5:00pm (EST)Inventiva will also be present with a booth: we are inviting you to visit us from Friday 4th through Monday 7th  during exhibition hall opening hours at booth #548 located in the exhibition hall of the conference center.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator‚Äëactivated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well‚Äëcharacterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well‚Äëbalanced activation of PPARŒ± and PPARŒ¥  and a partial activation of PPARŒ≥. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan‚ÄëPPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor‚Äôs moderate and balanced pan‚ÄëPPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre‚Äëclinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORŒ≥ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva‚Äôs pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva‚Äôs decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they are implanted with the alfapump and will be used for primary endpoint analysis. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival. For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About fluid overload in liver cirrhosis (AKA ascites)Fluid accumulation in the abdomen is a significant and common complication of liver cirrhosis. Approximately 10% of these patients do not respond to diuretic drugs and most require recurrent external drainage (AKA paracentesis)  an invasive and painful procedure that only provides temporary benefit  require frequent hospitalizations and severely impacts their quality of life.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. Fluid overload is a well-recognized problem in these growing diseases  causing severe problems for the large number of patients for whom current medicines are no longer effective. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life.alfapump and DSR are Sequana Medical‚Äôs proprietary approaches that work with the body to remove this excess fluid  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.

It represents close to 30% of the total target and confirms the program is on track as announced  both in terms of total amount and deadline.Refinancing of the HELLA acquisition:Since July  Faurecia further reduced by ‚Ç¨500 million the remaining part of the bridge-to-loan to be refinanced post-HELLA acquisition  through a ‚Ç¨300 million loan from the European Investment Bank and a USD210 million loan from Latin America banks.Since the announcement of the HELLA acquisition (August 2021)  Faurecia prefinanced and refinanced more than ‚Ç¨3 billion of debt at an average cost below 3.25%.As the expected closing of the divestment of its stake in HBPO by HELLA will reduce the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial net debt by ‚Ç¨290 million  the bridge-to-loan left to be refinanced by August 2023 amounts now to ‚Ç¨900 million  that will be refinanced through a mix of new debt instruments and proceeds from next steps in the disposal program underway.Management of energy prices:The Group‚Äôs operations are not highly energy-intensive: in 2021 (‚Äúreference year‚Äù)  the total Faurecia + HELLA energy bill (electricity c. 70% + gas c. 30%) amounted to c. ‚Ç¨170m  representing only 0.7% of sales.Very efficient historical hedging policies are in place that largely protect the Group‚Äôs energy bill from the current sharp rise in electricity and gas prices.On top of these hedging policies  energy savings measures have already been implemented  and self-production is accelerating:Energy savings measures should represent c. 22% (exit 2023)  including weekend and night flexingSelf-production through solar panels (120 GWh installed) should represent an additional 7% (exit 2023)As a result of efficient hedging policies and self-help measures  the Group‚Äôs energy bill should grow by only 1.8x in 2023 vs. the 2021 ‚Äúreference year‚Äù  while energy prices in Europe have increased more than 10x.UPDATED FY 2022 GUIDANCE (Faurecia incl. 11 months of consolidation of HELLA) WITH SALES TARGET UPGRADED TO BETWEEN ‚Ç¨24.5bn AND ‚Ç¨25.5bn AND OPERATING MARGIN AND NET CASH FLOW TARGETS CONFIRMEDAt this stage of the year  Faurecia is revising upward its assumption for worldwide automotive production in 2022 to 77 million LVs  vs. 74 million previously. This new assumption nevertheless remains cautious vs. S&P Global Mobility‚Äô latest forecast of 79.0 million LVs (dated October 2022).Reflecting:this revised assumption of 77 million LVs produced worldwide in 2022 updated currency assumptions (notably USD/‚Ç¨ now at 1.05 on average in 2022  vs. 1.13 previously) the Group‚Äôs sales guidance is upgraded to between ‚Ç¨24.5 billion and ‚Ç¨25.5 billion (vs. between ‚Ç¨23 billion and ‚Ç¨24 billion  previously).Operating margin and net cash flow targets for the year are confirmed.FY 2022 guidance is now:Sales between ‚Ç¨24.5 billion and ‚Ç¨25.5 billion (vs. between ‚Ç¨23bn and ‚Ç¨24bn  previously) Operating margin confirmed between 4% and 5% of sales Net cash flow confirmed at breakeven (includes building of a safety stock at year-end to secure supplies given energy shortage risks in Europe).In addition  the Group confirms targeting Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio ‚â§ 3x at the end of 2022.The guidance is based on full-year average currency rates of 1.05 for USD/‚Ç¨ and of 7.07 for CNY/‚Ç¨. It assumes no major lockdown impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region in Q4 and takes into account the Group‚Äôs latest update of net impact from cost inflation.SAVE THE DATESOn November 3  FORVIA will hold a Capital Markets Day close to ParisThe Capital Markets Day will include the Analysts Meeting of HELLA pursuant to sec. 55 of the Exchange Rules for the Frankfurter Wertpapierb√∂rse (FWB).On November 4  FORVIA will hold a Sustainability Day close to ParisFaurecia and HELLA will present FORVIA‚Äôs Net Zero ambition  sustainability roadmap and action plan.Both events will take place at Dock Eiffel  50  avenue du Pr√©sident Wilson  93210 Saint Denis (France).For further information  please contact: contact@cmd2022-forvia.com** *Faurecia's Q3 2022 sales presentation is also available on the Faurecia website: www.faurecia.comA webcast will be held today at 09:00am (Paris time).If you wish to follow the presentation using the webcast  please access the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/h2ppuyvqA replay will be available as soon as possible.

Sales growthFaurecia‚Äôs year-on-year sales evolution is made of three components:A ‚Äú Currency effect‚Äù   calculated by applying average currency rates for the period to the sales of the prior year A ‚ÄúScope effect‚Äù (acquisition/divestment) And ‚ÄúGrowth at constant currencies‚Äù.As ‚ÄúScope effect‚Äù  Faurecia presents all acquisitions/divestments  whose sales on an annual basis amount to more than ‚Ç¨250 million.Other acquisitions below this threshold are considered as ‚Äúbolt-on acquisitions‚Äù and are included in ‚ÄúGrowth at constant currencies‚Äù.In 2021  there was no effect from ‚Äúbolt-on acquisitions‚Äù; as a result  ‚ÄúGrowth at constant currencies‚Äù is equivalent to sales growth at constant scope and currencies also presented as organic growth.2. Operating incomeOperating income is the Faurecia group‚Äôs principal performance indicator. It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations;Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses;Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs;Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;Taxes.3. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of ‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term ‚ÄúEBITDA‚Äù that was previously used (this means that ‚ÄúEBITDA‚Äù aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‚ÄòAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù aggregates as from 2022).4. Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets.

The increased cash outflow was primarily due to the PRIMAvera clinical trial in Europe for which the Company reached its enrolment target of 38 patients from its clinical sites in France  Germany  the UK  Spain  the Netherlands and Italy. Furthermore  the manufacturing of remote rehabilitation systems for patients in clinical trials as well as costs related to the preparation of financing options  lead to an increase in spending  which were partially offset by reduced expenses associated with the French and US feasibility studies.Until 30 September 2022  investments in fixed and intangible assets remained low leading to a net cash outflow from investment activities of ‚Ç¨0.1 million.At 30 September 2022  net cash provided by financing activities totalled ‚Ç¨4.2 million  following the drawdown of the first tranche of the convertible note (‚ÄúORNAN 2022‚Äù) signed with ESGO in July 2022 for a total of ‚Ç¨5.5 million and for which the Company received a total amount of ‚Ç¨4.6 million (in net proceeds).In total  at 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision‚Äôs cash position amounted to ‚Ç¨8.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨16.9 million on 1 January 2022. Given its current cash position  the Company believes that it is able to finance its operations until middle of the second quarter 2023.Due to the constraints of its agreement with ESGO  Pixium Vision is currently not able to continue drawing further tranches and therefore the Company is exploring various avenues to enable it to secure its cash flow necessary to pursue its strategic ambitions.Key developments in the third quarter of 2022In the third quarter of 2022 Pixium Vision continued the positive momentum of its clinical development in completing the enrolment of the PRIMAvera study  the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials and has implemented a convertible note facility with a maximum nominal amount of ‚Ç¨30 million with ESGO  including the drawdown of the first tranche of ‚Ç¨5.5 million.On 14 July 2022  Pixium Vision announced the implementation of a financing of a maximum nominal amount of ‚Ç¨30 million with ESGO  and the drawdown of a first tranche of ‚Ç¨5.5 million.On 3 August 2022  Pixium Vision announced the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials.On 19 September 2022  Pixium Vision announced reaching its enrolment target in the European pivotal trial PRIMAvera and confirmed the intention to complete all implantations by end 2022.Subsequent to the closing on 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision published peer-reviewed safety data of the Prima System in Dry AMD in the Journal of Neural Engineering was published.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

At the date of this communication 2 600 K‚Ç¨ are undrawn.Activity and outlookResumption of post-pandemic activityAlmost all the constraints linked to the pandemic have been lifted since this summer since when Orege has thus been able to resume the execution of two projects  both frozen for 2.5 years  one in Germany and the other in Japan. However  no revenue will be generated in 2022 from these two projects.Or√®ge has been able to adapt to disrupted supply chainsThe global pressure on supply chains has increased in recent months (prices  delivery times  availability of certain electronic components and PLCs  etc.).Orege started planning for this challenge since the end of 2021 and has since then thus carried out a complete reorganization of its supply chains: recruitment of an experienced supply chain manager  new distributors  ‚Äúopportunistic‚Äù purchases of component stocks  revisited PLC configurations in order to adapt to the context  etc.As a result  Orege does not anticipate any problem for the end of 2022  nor any significant constraint for 2023 on the basis of how things stand presently.Impact of the energy crisis on the businessIn a context where the energy crisis has a strong impact on many of our customers and partners  Orege considers that opportunities are created by proposing an improvement in the performance of ""anaerobic digesters"" which are most often found in large wastewater treatment plants.It should be remembered that the energy costs of wastewater treatment plants are a significant operating expense of these plants.Orege's solutions  which themselves consume little energy  enable operators to generate substantial financial savings  but also from now will enable operators to optimize biogas production.This dedicated commercial approach will enable Orege to refine its positioning in the sludge recovery chain.Projects signed and/or in the execution phase in the US and the UKOrders expected by the end of 2022The two projects signed with municipal utilities in Wisconsin (La Crosse) and in South Carolina (Easley) will be largely completed in 2022  which should generate revenue for the year of approximately 700 K‚Ç¨.A major project on an industrial wastewater treatment plant in Houston  initiated in collaboration with the Alfa Laval Group  is in progress.It should make a significant contribution to revenue for 2022.Orege has just signed a contract in October for the sale of 3 SLG-F thickening solutions with a new Water Utility in the UK. The 3 corresponding units could be implemented by the end of 2022 and generate around ‚Ç¨1 million in revenue for the current financial year.Four orders (3 in the UK and 1 in the US) are expected by the end of 2022 for a total value of around ‚Ç¨1.3 million. The Orege solutions for these 4 projects would be implemented by early 2023.Outlook 2023A detailed update the outlook for 2023 will be given during the Oddo BHF Forum which will take place on January 9 and 10  2023. The PowerPoint document which will serve as a framework for all investor meetings will be posted on the Or√®ge website. from January 9  2023.Other information:The half year report will be published in French on the Company‚Äôs website ( www.orege.com) 21st October 2022.Orege has been listed on the regulated market Euronext ‚Äì Paris since 5th July 2013 - ISIN FR0010609206 - OREGE.Contact Orege: Financial information ‚Äì George GonsalvesGeorge.gonsalves@orege.com - mob: +33 6 08 03 50 72Attachment",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.35,0.24,0.41,True,English,"['or√®ge Group activity', 'half year 2022 results', 'company total additional shareholder current account advances', 'industrial wastewater treatment plant', 'net foreign exchange gains', 'experienced supply chain manager', 'large wastewater treatment plants', 'sludge recovery chain', 'current financial year', 'Voisins Le Bretonneux', 'dedicated commercial approach', 'Oddo BHF Forum', 'Total operating expenses', 'HALF YEAR 2022 RESULTS', 'first half year', 'half year report', 'research tax credits', 'new Water Utility', 'substantial financial savings', 'Alfa Laval Group', '3 SLG-F thickening solutions', 'Or√®ge website', 'Summary financial information', 'significant operating expense', 'Other operating expenses', 'The Orege solutions', 'total value', 'OREGE GROUP ACTIVITY', 'Net loss', 'Other information', 'Corporation tax', 'supply chains', 'new distributors', 'Payroll expenses', 'significant constraint', 'significant contribution', 'Operating result', 'Financial result', 'Press release', 'six months', 'consolidated accounts', 'interest cost', 'Eren Industries', 'global pressure', 'recent months', 'delivery times', 'electronic components', 'complete reorganization', 'opportunistic‚Äù purchases', 'component stocks', 'PLC configurations', 'energy crisis', 'anaerobic digesters', 'energy costs', 'little energy', 'biogas production', 'municipal utilities', 'La Crosse', 'South Carolina', 'major project', '3 corresponding units', 'detailed update', 'PowerPoint document', 'investor meetings', 'financial debt', 'post-pandemic activity', 'two projects', 'English French', 'financing requirements', 'strong impact', 'execution phase', 'Four orders', '21st October', 'cash equivalents', '4 projects', '19 October', 'Board', 'directors', 'K‚Ç¨', 'IFRS', 'June', 'Turnover', 'Depreciation', 'amortisation', '1 078 K', '790 K', 'increase', '736 K', 'H1', '31 December', '528 K', '30 825 K', 'respect', '26 631 K', 'CIR', '4 600 K', 'communication', 'Resumption', 'constraints', 'summer', '2.5 years', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'revenue', 'prices', 'availability', 'PLCs', 'challenge', 'end', 'recruitment', 'context', 'problem', 'basis', 'things', 'business', 'customers', 'partners', 'opportunities', 'improvement', 'performance', 'operators', 'positioning', 'UK', 'Wisconsin', 'Easley', '700 K', 'Houston', 'collaboration', 'progress', 'contract', 'sale', 'early', 'Outlook', 'place', 'January', 'framework', '740', '2023']",2022-10-21,2022-10-21,globenewswire.com

Bruno Le Maire declares: ""And we want France to be the European hub of the crypto-asset ecosystem.""He also said: ""Today  France has some of the most innovative DASPs in the world and can draw on an exceptional concentration of crypto skills  whether scientific  IT  financial  legal or commercial.""Artmarket.com is fully prepared to contribute to making France a Leader in crypto-assets in Europe and also in the world  in the specific field of Art NFTs  adopted by all historical players in the Art Market.As World Leader in Art Market Information and a pioneer on the Internet since 1987 with Group Serveur  Artprice by Artmarket (twice designated an ""innovative company"" by BPI France) has all the advantages  technological know-how  and expertise to give France a place as an international leader in the field of crypto art.Artmarket.com already has a permanent information feed on daily NFT news in 119 countries  as the world's leading press agency dedicated to the Art Market  NFTs  and Metaverse:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that during the first half of 2022  the Art NFT phenomenon (Jeton Non Fongible in French) became a durable segment of the art market on all continents with acceleration in sales and volumes in the second half of 2022. This acceleration has been triggered primarily by a) the purge of cryptocurrencies and b) the introduction of much more favorable legislation in the USA. Meanwhile  Europe has introduced a regulatory framework that supervises and controls the cryptocurrency environment  thereby giving greater confidence to consumers  investors  and operators.This regulation is the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com remarks: ""in our various annual art market reports and our communications with investors  we have always included NFTs in our studies. And we have always said that one cannot understand this market with exponential growth without understanding the vital importance of Blockchains  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origin within the Cypherpunk milieu (period of PGP-type data encryption in the early 1990s).""Indeed  OpenSea USA  the leading NFT platform  itself declares that 80% of the primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced that it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. There is only one viable solution to this problem: the certification of the primary Art-NFT market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of Art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only one on the world market  taking into account all the underlying parameters and data  to be able to truly meet the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.This ability to certify primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the World Leader in Art Market Information and author for 25 years of its authoritative databases. These in turn contain the largest documentary collection in the world of notes  manuscripts  and catalogs of auction sales since 1700  guaranteeing in return the authenticity and the historical proof of its databases.Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive Art NFTs platform through its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution.This Metaverse is the assurance of exponential and continuous growth of the Art Market by NFTs. It will be accompanied by its Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright societies such as ADAGP  of which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors  under the legal provisions of reproduction  for the support of artists.The Minister of the Economy adds ""In the immediate future  I am delighted with the transition from Ethereum to proof of stake  which consumes much less energy. ""This is in line with Artprice by Artmarket.com's Blockchain  which will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts  as announced in its recent press release  following the transition from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" of Ethereum 2.0 on September 15  2022:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-with-a-99-95-reduction-in-energy-consumption-the-merge-is-a-historic-and-ecological-success-for-ethereum-the-reference-cryptocurrency-for-artprice-and-for-the-art-nft-market-301625211.htmlIndeed  Artmarket.com has been following very closely for the last 3 years the transition to ""The Merge"" for the decarbonized Blockchain Ethereum 2.0  in the context of the global energy crisis  which is only just beginning. According to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH collapses by more than 99.95%  going from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to the ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS).The fact that Artprice anticipated three years earlier the Blockchain Ethereum and its smart contract as the reference in the Art Market for NFTs  is further reinforced by the official dispatch from Christie's on September 27  2022  with the launch announced of Christie's 3.0 which is based on the Blockchain Ethereum.According to an Artprice study:""All Market Makers in the Art Market and in particular the majority of Auction Houses worldwide now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Similarly  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries are starting to publish their own NFTs.Digital Art created in the 1980s is finally making its real revolution by impacting nearly half a billion Art NFT enthusiasts  at purchasing costs that are now very accessible.There are already more than 54 000 artists identified by Artprice who directly produce their NFTs for their buying public and this is only the very beginning of this paradigm shift.It is a major event that definitively modifies the structure of the Art Market and its actors  as known since 1950 according to sociologists  art historians  and analysts. This is also confirmed by the various departments of Artprice  particularly concerning the figures.""https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/29/artmarket_com-rapport-financier-s1-2022-les-capitaux-propres-depassent-les-30m-eur-rn-en-progression-record-ca-s1-mise-en-placeArtmarket.com will contribute to giving France and Europe a chance to counterbalance the Anglo-Saxon hegemony in the field of crypto-assets.

With this new assumption  and also taking into account the evolution of currencies  we are also revising upwards our expected consolidated sales for the year to between 24.5 billion euros and 25.5 billion euros  against a previous expectation of between 23 billion euros and 24 billion euros.In a macroeconomic environment that remains challenging  we are laser-focused on three major objectives:Finalize the refinancing of the HELLA acquisition and deleverage the Group Protect our short-term operating margin and our cash generation in a highly inflationary environment Continue to build a strong and selective order book  thanks to the unique combination of Faurecia and HELLA‚Äôs technologies and innovations.We will have the opportunity to detail these priorities as well as our short-term and longer-term actions during the Capital Markets Day that FORVIA will hold on November 3  followed on the next day by an event specifically dedicated to our sustainable development roadmap.‚ÄùThe Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN   met on October 2 0 and reviewed the present press release .‚Äú Operating income ‚Äù presented as Faurecia‚Äôs main performance indicator is Operating income before amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.‚Äú Adjusted EBITDA ‚Äù is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation   this term of ‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term ‚ÄúEBITDA‚Äù that was previously used (this means that ‚ÄúEBITDA‚Äù aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‚Äò Adjusted EBITDA‚Äù aggregates as from 2022).‚Äú Debt covenant ‚Äù is the ratio ‚Äú Net financial debt at the end of the period ‚Äù vs. ‚Äú Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months ‚Äù ; it is tested twice every year   at June 30 and at December 31.A ll other definitions are explained at the end of this Press Release  under the section ‚ÄúDefinitions of terms used in this document‚Äù.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) forecast dated October 2022 (vehicles segment in line with CAAM for China  i.e. excluding vehicles > 3.5t).MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE H1 2022 RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENTSince July 25  2022:On July 28  HELLA announced the divestment of its 33% stake in the HBPO JV to its co-shareholder Plastic Omnium for ‚Ç¨290mThis is a further milestone reached by HELLA in sharpening its profile as a technology company with Lighting  Electronics and Lifecycle Solutions at its core. Closing expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.This is also the first step of the Group‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1bn disposal program by end-2023  contributing to Group deleveraging after the acquisition of HELLA.On August 18  HELLA announced its outlook for the next 12-month period (June 2022 to May 2023) Sales in the range of ‚Ç¨7.1bn to ‚Ç¨7.6bn (vs. ‚Ç¨6.3bn for FY 2021/2022) Adj.

TOPICSAnnounced disposal program of ‚Ç¨1bn by end-2023:HELLA announced on July 28 the sale of its 33.33% stake in HBPO to its co-shareholder  Plastic Omnium. The agreed purchase price is c. ‚Ç¨290 million and closing of the transaction is expected take place in the fourth quarter of 2022.With this decision  HELLA is continuing its proven course of consistent portfolio management  further sharpening its profile as a focused technology company with Lighting  Electronics and Lifecycle Solutions at its core.This divestment marks a first significant step in the FORVIA Group‚Äôs non-strategic asset disposal program of ‚Ç¨1 billion by end-2023  as part of the Group‚Äôs plan to reduce its consolidated net debt following the acquisition of HELLA. It represents close to 30% of the total target and confirms the program is on track as announced  both in terms of total amount and deadline.Refinancing of the HELLA acquisition:Since July  Faurecia further reduced by ‚Ç¨500 million the remaining part of the bridge-to-loan to be refinanced post-HELLA acquisition  through a ‚Ç¨300 million loan from the European Investment Bank and a USD210 million loan from Latin America banks.Since the announcement of the HELLA acquisition (August 2021)  Faurecia prefinanced and refinanced more than ‚Ç¨3 billion of debt at an average cost below 3.25%.As the expected closing of the divestment of its stake in HBPO by HELLA will reduce the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial net debt by ‚Ç¨290 million  the bridge-to-loan left to be refinanced by August 2023 amounts now to ‚Ç¨900 million  that will be refinanced through a mix of new debt instruments and proceeds from next steps in the disposal program underway.Management of energy prices:The Group‚Äôs operations are not highly energy-intensive: in 2021 (‚Äúreference year‚Äù)  the total Faurecia + HELLA energy bill (electricity c. 70% + gas c. 30%) amounted to c. ‚Ç¨170m  representing only 0.7% of sales.Very efficient historical hedging policies are in place that largely protect the Group‚Äôs energy bill from the current sharp rise in electricity and gas prices.On top of these hedging policies  energy savings measures have already been implemented  and self-production is accelerating:Energy savings measures should represent c. 22% (exit 2023)  including weekend and night flexingSelf-production through solar panels (120 GWh installed) should represent an additional 7% (exit 2023)As a result of efficient hedging policies and self-help measures  the Group‚Äôs energy bill should grow by only 1.8x in 2023 vs. the 2021 ‚Äúreference year‚Äù  while energy prices in Europe have increased more than 10x.UPDATED FY 2022 GUIDANCE (Faurecia incl. 11 months of consolidation of HELLA) WITH SALES TARGET UPGRADED TO BETWEEN ‚Ç¨24.5bn AND ‚Ç¨25.5bn AND OPERATING MARGIN AND NET CASH FLOW TARGETS CONFIRMEDAt this stage of the year  Faurecia is revising upward its assumption for worldwide automotive production in 2022 to 77 million LVs  vs. 74 million previously. This new assumption nevertheless remains cautious vs. S&P Global Mobility‚Äô latest forecast of 79.0 million LVs (dated October 2022).Reflecting:this revised assumption of 77 million LVs produced worldwide in 2022 updated currency assumptions (notably USD/‚Ç¨ now at 1.05 on average in 2022  vs. 1.13 previously) the Group‚Äôs sales guidance is upgraded to between ‚Ç¨24.5 billion and ‚Ç¨25.5 billion (vs. between ‚Ç¨23 billion and ‚Ç¨24 billion  previously).Operating margin and net cash flow targets for the year are confirmed.FY 2022 guidance is now:Sales between ‚Ç¨24.5 billion and ‚Ç¨25.5 billion (vs. between ‚Ç¨23bn and ‚Ç¨24bn  previously) (vs. between ‚Ç¨23bn and ‚Ç¨24bn  previously)  Operating margin confirmed between 4% and 5% of sales Net cash flow confirmed at breakeven (includes building of a safety stock at year-end to secure supplies given energy shortage risks in Europe).In addition  the Group confirms targeting Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio ‚â§ 3x at the end of 2022.The guidance is based on full-year average currency rates of 1.05 for USD/‚Ç¨ and of 7.07 for CNY/‚Ç¨. It assumes no major lockdown impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region in Q4 and takes into account the Group‚Äôs latest update of net impact from cost inflation.SAVE THE DATESOn November 3  FORVIA will hold a Capital Markets Day close to ParisThe Capital Markets Day will include the Analysts Meeting of HELLA pursuant to sec. 55 of the Exchange Rules for the Frankfurter Wertpapierb√∂rse (FWB).On November 4  FORVIA will hold a Sustainability Day close to ParisFaurecia and HELLA will present FORVIA‚Äôs Net Zero ambition  sustainability roadmap and action plan.Both events will take place at Dock Eiffel  50  avenue du Pr√©sident Wilson  93210 Saint Denis (France).For further information  please contact: contact@cmd2022-forvia.com** *Faurecia's Q3 2022 sales presentation is also available on the Faurecia website: www.faurecia.comA webcast will be held today at 09:00am (Paris time).If you wish to follow the presentation using the webcast  please access the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/h2ppuyvqA replay will be available as soon as possible.
