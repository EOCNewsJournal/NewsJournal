Bruno Le Maire declares: ""And we want France to be the European hub of the crypto-asset ecosystem.""He also said: ""Today  France has some of the most innovative DASPs in the world and can draw on an exceptional concentration of crypto skills  whether scientific  IT  financial  legal or commercial.""Artmarket.com is fully prepared to contribute to making France a Leader in crypto-assets in Europe and also in the world  in the specific field of Art NFTs  adopted by all historical players in the Art Market.As World Leader in Art Market Information and a pioneer on the Internet since 1987 with Group Serveur  Artprice by Artmarket (twice designated an ""innovative company"" by BPI France) has all the advantages  technological know-how  and expertise to give France a place as an international leader in the field of crypto art.Artmarket.com already has a permanent information feed on daily NFT news in 119 countries  as the world's leading press agency dedicated to the Art Market  NFTs  and Metaverse:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that during the first half of 2022  the Art NFT phenomenon (Jeton Non Fongible in French) became a durable segment of the art market on all continents with acceleration in sales and volumes in the second half of 2022. This acceleration has been triggered primarily by a) the purge of cryptocurrencies and b) the introduction of much more favorable legislation in the USA. Meanwhile  Europe has introduced a regulatory framework that supervises and controls the cryptocurrency environment  thereby giving greater confidence to consumers  investors  and operators.This regulation is the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com remarks: ""in our various annual art market reports and our communications with investors  we have always included NFTs in our studies. And we have always said that one cannot understand this market with exponential growth without understanding the vital importance of Blockchains  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origin within the Cypherpunk milieu (period of PGP-type data encryption in the early 1990s).""Indeed  OpenSea USA  the leading NFT platform  itself declares that 80% of the primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced that it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. There is only one viable solution to this problem: the certification of the primary Art-NFT market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of Art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only one on the world market  taking into account all the underlying parameters and data  to be able to truly meet the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.This ability to certify primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the World Leader in Art Market Information and author for 25 years of its authoritative databases. These in turn contain the largest documentary collection in the world of notes  manuscripts  and catalogs of auction sales since 1700  guaranteeing in return the authenticity and the historical proof of its databases.Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive Art NFTs platform through its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution.This Metaverse is the assurance of exponential and continuous growth of the Art Market by NFTs. It will be accompanied by its Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright societies such as ADAGP  of which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors  under the legal provisions of reproduction  for the support of artists.The Minister of the Economy adds ""In the immediate future  I am delighted with the transition from Ethereum to proof of stake  which consumes much less energy. ""This is in line with Artprice by Artmarket.com's Blockchain  which will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts  as announced in its recent press release  following the transition from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" of Ethereum 2.0 on September 15  2022:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-with-a-99-95-reduction-in-energy-consumption-the-merge-is-a-historic-and-ecological-success-for-ethereum-the-reference-cryptocurrency-for-artprice-and-for-the-art-nft-market-301625211.htmlIndeed  Artmarket.com has been following very closely for the last 3 years the transition to ""The Merge"" for the decarbonized Blockchain Ethereum 2.0  in the context of the global energy crisis  which is only just beginning. According to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH collapses by more than 99.95%  going from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to the ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS).The fact that Artprice anticipated three years earlier the Blockchain Ethereum and its smart contract as the reference in the Art Market for NFTs  is further reinforced by the official dispatch from Christie's on September 27  2022  with the launch announced of Christie's 3.0 which is based on the Blockchain Ethereum.According to an Artprice study:""All Market Makers in the Art Market and in particular the majority of Auction Houses worldwide now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Similarly  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries are starting to publish their own NFTs.Digital Art created in the 1980s is finally making its real revolution by impacting nearly half a billion Art NFT enthusiasts  at purchasing costs that are now very accessible.There are already more than 54 000 artists identified by Artprice who directly produce their NFTs for their buying public and this is only the very beginning of this paradigm shift.It is a major event that definitively modifies the structure of the Art Market and its actors  as known since 1950 according to sociologists  art historians  and analysts. This is also confirmed by the various departments of Artprice  particularly concerning the figures.""https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/29/artmarket_com-rapport-financier-s1-2022-les-capitaux-propres-depassent-les-30m-eur-rn-en-progression-record-ca-s1-mise-en-placeArtmarket.com will contribute to giving France and Europe a chance to counterbalance the Anglo-Saxon hegemony in the field of crypto-assets.

Bruno Le Maire declares: ""And we want France to be the European hub of the crypto-asset ecosystem.""He also said: ""Today  France has some of the most innovative DASPs in the world and can draw on an exceptional concentration of crypto skills  whether scientific  IT  financial  legal or commercial.""Artmarket.com is fully prepared to contribute to making France a Leader in crypto-assets in Europe and also in the world  in the specific field of Art NFTs  adopted by all historical players in the Art Market.As World Leader in Art Market Information and a pioneer on the Internet since 1987 with Group Serveur  Artprice by Artmarket (twice designated an ""innovative company"" by BPI France) has all the advantages  technological know-how  and expertise to give France a place as an international leader in the field of crypto art.Artmarket.com already has a permanent information feed on daily NFT news in 119 countries  as the world's leading press agency dedicated to the Art Market  NFTs  and Metaverse:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that during the first half of 2022  the Art NFT phenomenon (Jeton Non Fongible in French) became a durable segment of the art market on all continents with acceleration in sales and volumes in the second half of 2022. This acceleration has been triggered primarily by a) the purge of cryptocurrencies and b) the introduction of much more favorable legislation in the USA. Meanwhile  Europe has introduced a regulatory framework that supervises and controls the cryptocurrency environment  thereby giving greater confidence to consumers  investors  and operators.This regulation is the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com remarks: ""in our various annual art market reports and our communications with investors  we have always included NFTs in our studies. And we have always said that one cannot understand this market with exponential growth without understanding the vital importance of Blockchains  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origin within the Cypherpunk milieu (period of PGP-type data encryption in the early 1990s).""Indeed  OpenSea USA  the leading NFT platform  itself declares that 80% of the primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced that it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. There is only one viable solution to this problem: the certification of the primary Art-NFT market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of Art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only one on the world market  taking into account all the underlying parameters and data  to be able to truly meet the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.This ability to certify primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the World Leader in Art Market Information and author for 25 years of its authoritative databases. These in turn contain the largest documentary collection in the world of notes  manuscripts  and catalogs of auction sales since 1700  guaranteeing in return the authenticity and the historical proof of its databases.Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive Art NFTs platform through its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution.This Metaverse is the assurance of exponential and continuous growth of the Art Market by NFTs. It will be accompanied by its Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright societies such as ADAGP  of which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors  under the legal provisions of reproduction  for the support of artists.The Minister of the Economy adds ""In the immediate future  I am delighted with the transition from Ethereum to proof of stake  which consumes much less energy. ""This is in line with Artprice by Artmarket.com's Blockchain  which will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts  as announced in its recent press release  following the transition from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" of Ethereum 2.0 on September 15  2022:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-with-a-99-95-reduction-in-energy-consumption-the-merge-is-a-historic-and-ecological-success-for-ethereum-the-reference-cryptocurrency-for-artprice-and-for-the-art-nft-market-301625211.htmlIndeed  Artmarket.com has been following very closely for the last 3 years the transition to ""The Merge"" for the decarbonized Blockchain Ethereum 2.0  in the context of the global energy crisis  which is only just beginning. According to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH collapses by more than 99.95%  going from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to the ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS).The fact that Artprice anticipated three years earlier the Blockchain Ethereum and its smart contract as the reference in the Art Market for NFTs  is further reinforced by the official dispatch from Christie's on September 27  2022  with the launch announced of Christie's 3.0 which is based on the Blockchain Ethereum.According to an Artprice study:""All Market Makers in the Art Market and in particular the majority of Auction Houses worldwide now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Similarly  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries are starting to publish their own NFTs.Digital Art created in the 1980s is finally making its real revolution by impacting nearly half a billion Art NFT enthusiasts  at purchasing costs that are now very accessible.There are already more than 54 000 artists identified by Artprice who directly produce their NFTs for their buying public and this is only the very beginning of this paradigm shift.It is a major event that definitively modifies the structure of the Art Market and its actors  as known since 1950 according to sociologists  art historians  and analysts.

Bruno Le Maire declares: ""And we want France to be the European hub of the crypto-asset ecosystem.""He also said: ""Today  France has some of the most innovative DASPs in the world and can draw on an exceptional concentration of crypto skills  whether scientific  IT  financial  legal or commercial.""Artmarket.com is fully prepared to contribute to making France a Leader in crypto-assets in Europe and also in the world  in the specific field of Art NFTs  adopted by all historical players in the Art Market.As World Leader in Art Market Information and a pioneer on the Internet since 1987 with Group Serveur  Artprice by Artmarket (twice designated an ""innovative company"" by BPI France) has all the advantages  technological know-how  and expertise to give France a place as an international leader in the field of crypto art.Artmarket.com already has a permanent information feed on daily NFT news in 119 countries  as the world's leading press agency dedicated to the Art Market  NFTs  and Metaverse:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that during the first half of 2022  the Art NFT phenomenon (Jeton Non Fongible in French) became a durable segment of the art market on all continents with acceleration in sales and volumes in the second half of 2022. This acceleration has been triggered primarily by a) the purge of cryptocurrencies and b) the introduction of much more favorable legislation in the USA. Meanwhile  Europe has introduced a regulatory framework that supervises and controls the cryptocurrency environment  thereby giving greater confidence to consumers  investors  and operators.This regulation is the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com remarks: ""in our various annual art market reports and our communications with investors  we have always included NFTs in our studies. And we have always said that one cannot understand this market with exponential growth without understanding the vital importance of Blockchains  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origin within the Cypherpunk milieu (period of PGP-type data encryption in the early 1990s).""Indeed  OpenSea USA  the leading NFT platform  itself declares that 80% of the primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced that it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. There is only one viable solution to this problem: the certification of the primary Art-NFT market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of Art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only one on the world market  taking into account all the underlying parameters and data  to be able to truly meet the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.This ability to certify primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the World Leader in Art Market Information and author for 25 years of its authoritative databases. These in turn contain the largest documentary collection in the world of notes  manuscripts  and catalogs of auction sales since 1700  guaranteeing in return the authenticity and the historical proof of its databases.Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive Art NFTs platform through its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution.This Metaverse is the assurance of exponential and continuous growth of the Art Market by NFTs. It will be accompanied by its Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright societies such as ADAGP  of which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors  under the legal provisions of reproduction  for the support of artists.The Minister of the Economy adds ""In the immediate future  I am delighted with the transition from Ethereum to proof of stake  which consumes much less energy. ""This is in line with Artprice by Artmarket.com's Blockchain  which will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts  as announced in its recent press release  following the transition from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" of Ethereum 2.0 on September 15  2022:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-with-a-99-95-reduction-in-energy-consumption-the-merge-is-a-historic-and-ecological-success-for-ethereum-the-reference-cryptocurrency-for-artprice-and-for-the-art-nft-market-301625211.htmlIndeed  Artmarket.com has been following very closely for the last 3 years the transition to ""The Merge"" for the decarbonized Blockchain Ethereum 2.0  in the context of the global energy crisis  which is only just beginning. According to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH collapses by more than 99.95%  going from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to the ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS).The fact that Artprice anticipated three years earlier the Blockchain Ethereum and its smart contract as the reference in the Art Market for NFTs  is further reinforced by the official dispatch from Christie's on September 27  2022  with the launch announced of Christie's 3.0 which is based on the Blockchain Ethereum.According to an Artprice study:""All Market Makers in the Art Market and in particular the majority of Auction Houses worldwide now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Similarly  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries are starting to publish their own NFTs.Digital Art created in the 1980s is finally making its real revolution by impacting nearly half a billion Art NFT enthusiasts  at purchasing costs that are now very accessible.There are already more than 54 000 artists identified by Artprice who directly produce their NFTs for their buying public and this is only the very beginning of this paradigm shift.It is a major event that definitively modifies the structure of the Art Market and its actors  as known since 1950 according to sociologists  art historians  and analysts. This is also confirmed by the various departments of Artprice  particularly concerning the figures.""https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/29/artmarket_com-rapport-financier-s1-2022-les-capitaux-propres-depassent-les-30m-eur-rn-en-progression-record-ca-s1-mise-en-placeArtmarket.com will contribute to giving France and Europe a chance to counterbalance the Anglo-Saxon hegemony in the field of crypto-assets.

11927,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unifiedpost-settles-earn-obligations-former-050000730.html,Unifiedpost settles earn-out obligations to former Crossinx shareholders,La Hulpe – 21 October 2022  7:00 a.m. CET – [INSIDE INFORMATION] Unifiedpost Group (Euronext: UPG) (Unifiedpost  or the Company) completed the acquisition of...,La Hulpe – 21 October 2022  7:00 a.m. CET – [INSIDE INFORMATION] Unifiedpost Group (Euronext: UPG) (Unifiedpost  or the Company) completed the acquisition of the German e-invoicing market leader Crossinx on April 9  2021. In agreement with the former Crossinx shareholders  Unifiedpost now settles the earn-out obligations in exchange for a one-time payment of € 4.829.792 94 through the issuance in aggregate of 1.277.723 new shares of Unifiedpost.The original transactionIn April 2021  Unifiedpost acquired with Crossinx a real-time data-driven e-invoice solution. By acquiring this technology  the Unifiedpost solutions will now be able to support data-driven communication in its order-to-cash and procure-to-pay solution with substantive data validation. These digital solutions are now ready for the market transition to data e-invoices validated in real-time. This brings the Company ahead of the market curve  certainly with upcoming mandatory e-invoicing regulation in the EU.In addition to the technology Unifiedpost achieved with the acquisition a direct access to the large DACH market (Germany  Austria  Switzerland) and can benefit from the expected growth opportunities. On top of that  the Company can now serve corporate clients internationally with a full offering.Unifiedpost acquired Crossinx in April 2021 with a cash consideration and share consideration paid in April 2021. The former shareholders of Crossinx were possible entitled to a deferred conditional consideration of up to a maximum of € 60 million  partly payable in cash and partly payable in shares. These earn-out payments were due if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Current transaction detailsThrough an addendum dated 20 October 2022 to the share purchase agreement  the parties have decided to replace any potential obligations by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders in respect of any earn-amount by a one-time fixed payment of € 4.829.792 94 in aggregate. As the one-time payment is fully settled in shares of Unifiedpost  there is no cash payment by the Company. At an issuance price of € 3 78 per share  this corresponds to 1.277.723 new shares which have been issued by the Company on 20 October 2022.Story continuesPursuant to the addendum  the former Crossinx shareholders have agreed to a lock-up. For the four main former Crossinx shareholders (representing 65 77 % of the new shares)  the lock-up will last for 12 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after 6 months  and 25% more shares being released three months thereafter. For the other former Crossinx shareholders the lock-up lasts 6 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after three months.Related partiesThe former Crossinx shareholders include Mr. Michael Kleindl and Mr. Marcus Laube as related parties. Mr. Kleindl is through his company First Performance AG currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company. The announcement required by the related party rules is set out in the appendix.AppendixPublic announcement pursuant to article 7:97  §4/1 of the Companies and Associations Code relating to the buy-out of the potential earn-out claims of former Crossinx shareholders1. The Board of Directors of the Company held on 20 October 2022 decided to approve the addendum to the sale and purchase agreement of 9 April 2021 between the former Crossinx shareholders and the Company.Two of the former Crossinx shareholders include (i) Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company KOMM Investment AG) and (ii) Mr. Marcus Laube. Following the completion of the acquisition of Crossinx  they have joined the Company. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company.Given their functions  First Performance AG (with permanent representative Mr. Kleindl) and Mr. Laube qualify as related parties within the meaning of IFRS and article 7:97 CAC.In this context  the Board of Directors applied Article 7:97 of the Companies and Associations Code (“CAC”) relating to decisions and transactions concerning a party related to the Company. This provision implies  among other things  the intervention of a committee of independent directors to give an opinion to the Board of Directors. The conclusion of this opinion is set out at the end of this communication.In addition  this provision provides that when the decision or transaction involves a director  such person cannot not take part in the deliberations or vote of the Board of Directors. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) decided not to be present at the Board of Directors which decided on the transaction and did thus not participate in the deliberations or votes.The Company has also applied Article 7:96 CAC  relating to decisions in which a director has a direct or indirect interest of a proprietary nature that is opposed to the interest of the Company. This provision also provides that this director does not participate in the deliberation or votes. The director concerned is the one indicated in the previous paragraph.2. The addendum to the transaction documentation was signed on 20 October 2022. It provides that the former Crossinx shareholders shall receive in aggregate 1.277.723 shares of the Company  replacing the previously agreed potential earn-out amounts  if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Six of the thirty one Sellers (the “ESOP Sellers”)  including Mr Laube  were party to an employee stock option program in Crossinx before the original Crossinx transaction. Shortly before the signing of the original Crossinx transaction  the ESOP Sellers converted their claims under the ESOP into actual Crossinx shares. Despite this conversion  Crossinx remains responsible as tax indemnitor for any wage taxes of the ESOP Sellers. As this is a continuing obligation  it is therefore agreed under the addendum that the value of such taxes (“ESOP Charges”) are held back.As a result  the number of new shares issued by the Company on 20 October 2022 amounts to 1.277.723 in aggregate (the “Effective Buy-Off Shares”)  among which Mr Kleindl has received 20 98% shares and Mr Laube received 18 54% shares. These shares have been allocated proportionally based on the former share percentage in Crossinx but taking into account the hold-back for the ESOP Sellers.The issuance amount per share is equal to the lowest trading price of the shares of the Company on the day that the new shares have been issued by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders  i.e. € 3 78. The capital increase of the Company amounts to € 4.829.792 94.As the value of the shares is based on an open public market price where mechanism of supply and demand plays  the price should be seen as the current fair price of the share as all trading parties are fully informed with same financial data.3. The new shares have been issued as registered shares and are subject to a lock-up period.The lock-up period will depend on the percentage which the former Crossinx shareholder held in Crossinx prior to the original transaction. Both the company of Mr. Kleindl and Mr. Laube will be subject to the extended lock-up of 12 month with staggering release.4. The immediate early termination of the earn-out terms under the original Crossinx documentation and the entering into the addendum facilitates the full integration of Crossinx with the Company. In the absence thereof  the implementation of the company change and integration project “one product  one company” might be delayed until the end of the earn-out period (i.e. 31 December 2023).The change and integration project is aimed to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company. Further  the addendum will eliminate any potential future risk for the Company to pay earn-out. The addendum does not include any cash payment by the Company.5. A committee of all 5 independent directors of Unifiedpost has assessed the transaction described above  in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC  and has issued a written and substantiated opinion on this matter to the board of directors of Unifiedpost. The conclusions of the opinion of the committee of independent directors are as follows:“Based on the above argumentation  the Committee is of the opinion that the completion of the Crossinx Addendum Transaction resulting in an early termination of the Orginal Crossinx Agreement is in the best interest of the Company.The early termination of the Original Crossinx Agreement is a necessary condition precedent if the Company wants to start to implement with immediate effect a change and integration project which is aimed and expected to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company that largely outweighs the disadvantage of the cost and dilutive effect of the new shares to be issued as provided for in the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.In view of this  the Committee unanimously advises the Board of Directors of the Company to approve the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.”Finally  the assessment made by the auditor in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC reads as follows: Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data included in the opinion of the committee of independent directors dated 19 October 2022 and in the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors dated 20 October 2022  justifying the proposed transaction  are not fair and sufficient in all material respects in light of the information available to us in connection with our engagement.Financial Calendar 202210 November 2022 Publication Q3 2022 Business Update30 November 2022 Investor Day 2022Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on “Documents”  “Identity” and “Payments”.

11928,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inventiva-announces-scientific-presentation-aasld-200000190.html,Inventiva announces a scientific presentation at the AASLD The Liver Meeting® 2022,Daix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  October 21  2022 – Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical ...,"INVENTIVADaix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  October 21  2022 – Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs  today announced that a scientific abstract has been selected for poster presentation at the upcoming The Liver Meeting® 2022 hosted by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases on November 4-8  2022 in Washington  DC.The abstract evaluates the correlation between the response to lanifibranor therapy and adiponectin levels. Low adiponectin levels are known to be associated with NASH and with cardiovascular disease. Liver biomarkers and imaging assessments  as well as adiponectin serum levels measures  were conducted during Inventiva’s NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial  in order to evaluate the relation between adiponectin changes and the improvement of a broad panel of markers of liver and cardiometabolic health in patients with NASH. The adiponectin levels at baseline were low in patients enrolled in the NATIVE clinical trial  and treatment with lanifibranor significantly increased adiponectin levels in contrast to placebo. This increase in adiponectin is correlated with improvements in glycemic control  insulin resistance  lipid profile  liver tests and systemic inflammation  as well as liver steatosis quantified by ultrasound-based imaging. These data further show that lanifibranor  in addition to its beneficial effect on liver histology  also improves markers of cardiometabolic health and increases adiponectin levels  and thus has the potential to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with NASH.The details of the presentation are as follows:Abstract :Abstract title: ""Lanifibranor-induced improvement of liver and cardiometabolic markers of NASH is associated with an increase in adiponectin"" Poster number: 2526 Presentation type: Poster presentation Authors: Michael P.

Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well‑balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan‑PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan‑PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre‑clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they are implanted with the alfapump and will be used for primary endpoint analysis. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.Story continuesThe primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival. For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About fluid overload in liver cirrhosis (AKA ascites)Fluid accumulation in the abdomen is a significant and common complication of liver cirrhosis. Approximately 10% of these patients do not respond to diuretic drugs and most require recurrent external drainage (AKA paracentesis)  an invasive and painful procedure that only provides temporary benefit  require frequent hospitalizations and severely impacts their quality of life.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. Fluid overload is a well-recognized problem in these growing diseases  causing severe problems for the large number of patients for whom current medicines are no longer effective. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life.alfapump and DSR are Sequana Medical’s proprietary approaches that work with the body to remove this excess fluid  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.

11933,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547983-saint-gobain-stock-trading-less-than-7-times-earnings,Cash Flow Monster Saint-Gobain Is Now Trading At Less Than 7 Times Earnings (CODGF),Saint-Gobain's underlying cash flows remain very robust allowing the company to invest in additional capacity while simultaneously pursuing M&A opportunities. Read why the stock is a buy.,Jean-Luc Ichard/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionA lot has happened since I last discussed Saint-Gobain (OTCPK:CODGF) (OTCPK:CODYY)  a French conglomerate with a history of almost four centuries. In these past 4.5 years we experienced the COVID lockdowns  the brief economic improvement only to be hit by decade-high inflation numbers right now. Despite these headwinds  Saint-Gobain performed quite well in the first semester and the free cash flow remained very strong so I wanted to have a look at the company's performance and financial situation as the share price is currently trading about 10% lower than in 2018.Yahoo FinanceAs Saint-Gobain is a French company  its listing on Euronext Paris is the best way to trade in the company as it definitely is much more liquid. The ticker symbol in France is SGO  and the average daily volume is 1.1M shares. The current market capitalization is approximately 20B EUR. As the company reports and trades in euro  I will use the EUR as base currency throughout this article. Saint-Gobain has published an excellent 54-page presentation which you can consult here to get a better understanding of the company and its divisions.Surprisingly strong results in the first half of the year bode well for the rest of this yearAlthough Saint-Gobain's fate is closely related to the situation of the world economy as the company is one of the most important producers and distributors of construction materials and applications for the automotive industry (like windows)  the performance in the first half of this year was actually stronger than I had anticipated. While I didn't dare to buy the stock once the war in Ukraine started  I decided to keep a closer eye on the financial performance as the share price is currently trading 40% below its 52 week high of 67.12 EUR per share.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsThe total revenue in the first semester increased by approximately 15%  and the entire revenue increase was caused by organic growth and that's pretty impressive. And while the COGS increased by in excess of 15% (which explains the boosted revenue as Saint-Gobain was passing on the higher operating expenses to its customers)  the other 'general expenses' increased by just 7% and this helped to push the operating income higher by about 20%  to just under 2.8B EUR.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsThe other expenses increased somewhat (from 232M EUR to 298M EUR) and these expenses include impairment losses  amortization expenses and acquisition-related expenses. On top of that  there are some restructuring expenses and claims-related expenses as well.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsThe net interest expenses decreased as well and despite recording a total tax pressure of 530M EUR  the reported net income came in at 1.77B EUR. About 50M EUR of this amount was attributable to non-controlling interests  which means the net income attributable to the shareholders of Saint-Gobain was 1.72B EUR. This resulted in an EPS of 3.34 EUR based on the average share count of just under 517M shares. The net share count as of the end of June came in at 520M shares which means the EPS based on the current share count was 3.31 EUR per share. Pretty strong considering the stock is trading below 40 EUR per share.I already noticed in 2018 Saint-Gobain tends to be a strong performer on the cash flow level and H1 2022 wasn't any different. The reported operating cash flow was 1.64B EUR but this included a working capital investment of approximately 1.3B EUR (mainly related to a seasonal build-up of inventory levels). This means the operating cash flow before changes in the working capital was approximately 2.9B EUR.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsFrom that result we still need to deduct the 355M EUR in lease payments. This means the adjusted operating cash flow in the first half of the current financial year was approximately 2.55B EUR. That's an increase of more than 20% compared to the 2.08B EUR in H1 2021.As you can see in the cash flow statement above  the company spent about 832M EUR on capital expenditures. This would indicate the free cash flow result was approximately 1.7B EUR (which would be pretty good  but keep in mind the majority of the 832M EUR in capital expenditures was actually spent on growth as growth investments doubled compared to H1 2021.The image below shows the sustaining capital expenditures in the first half of the yearSaint-Gobain Investor RelationsThis means the underlying sustaining free cash flow in the first half of the year was 2.2B EUR and divided over 520M shares  that's approximately 4.13 EUR per share after also deducting the cash flow attributable to non-controlling interests. The free cash flow result is higher than the reported net income due to the fact the sustaining capex and lease payments of 704M EUR are lower than the 1.04B EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses. Looking at the full-year perspective  I expect a free cash flow result of approximately 3.5B EUR.As of the end of June  the net debt came in at 8.3 BEUR  representing just 1.3 times the underlying EBITDA.Saint-Gobain Investor RelationsAnd while Saint-Gobain has divested numerous assets over the past few years  the company is still looking at bolt-on acquisitions. The company closed the Kaycan acquisition for which it paid about $820M or about 8 times EBITDA after taking the anticipated $30M in synergy benefits into consideration. And SGO also closed the GCP acquisition in the third quarter of this year. That deal was originally announced in December 2021 when Saint-Gobain announced an all-cash offer of $32/share for a total value of $2.3B. The deal was originally worth 2B EUR but as the USD strengthened versus the Euro in the past year  the final price tag will be approximately 15% higher in Euro.GCP was anticipated to generate $170M in EBITDA this year  but Saint-Gobain also expects to generate $85M in annual synergy benefits further down the road which means it is paying approximately 8.8 times the EBITDA including synergy benefits.These two acquisitions closed in the third quarter and as they were all-cash acquisitions we should expect the net debt on Saint-Gobain's balance sheet to increase by the end of this year. That shouldn't be an issue as the strong cash flow generation will immediately help to reduce the net debt from next year on while the attributable EBITDA from the acquisitions will also help to keep the debt ratio at an acceptable level.Investment thesisThe company's first semester was much stronger than I had anticipated as the sustaining free cash flow exceeded 2.2B EUR. While that is great  I would still like to see how Saint-Gobain performed in the third quarter of the year and what its anticipations are for the fourth quarter as I can imagine the visibility isn't great.Despite spending in excess of 3B EUR on acquisitions in the past few months  I think the balance sheet is and will be fine and the bond market appears to agree with me. The 2032 bond with a 2.625% coupon is currently trading at 85.6% of the par value  implying a yield of 4.45%. That is a mark-up of less than 150 base points to the French government bond yield for the same period.I currently have no position in Saint-Gobain but I am keeping very close tabs on this one.,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,mixed,0.59,0.09,0.32,True,English,"['Cash Flow Monster Saint-Gobain', 'Less Than 7 Times Earnings', 'CODGF', 'underlying sustaining free cash flow', 'free cash flow result', 'cash flow level', 'cash flow statement', 'operating cash flow', 'brief economic improvement', 'decade-high inflation numbers', 'average daily volume', 'current market capitalization', 'excellent 54-page presentation', 'total tax pressure', 'sustaining capital expenditures', 'higher operating expenses', 'working capital investment', 'average share count', 'current share count', 'Saint-Gobain Investor Relations', ""other 'general expenses"", 'net interest expenses', 'net share count', 'entire revenue increase', 'current financial year', 'sustaining capex', 'operating income', 'other expenses', 'total revenue', 'net income', 'net debt', 'amortization expenses', 'acquisition-related expenses', 'restructuring expenses', 'claims-related expenses', 'Jean-Luc Ichard', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:CODYY', 'French conglomerate', 'four centuries', 'past 4.5 years', 'COVID lockdowns', 'first semester', 'Yahoo Finance', 'Euronext Paris', 'best way', 'ticker symbol', '1.1M shares', 'base currency', 'strong results', 'first half', 'world economy', 'important producers', 'construction materials', 'automotive industry', 'closer eye', 'impairment losses', 'controlling interests', '517M shares', '520M shares', 'strong performer', 'seasonal build-up', 'inventory levels', 'lease payments', 'full-year perspective', 'share price', 'financial situation', '298M EUR', '50M EUR', '355M EUR', '2.08B EUR', '1.04B EUR', 'financial performance', 'organic growth', 'growth investments', 'French company', 'company reports', '832M EUR', '67.12 EUR', 'Editorial', 'Introduction', 'lot', 'history', 'headwinds', 'look', 'listing', 'France', 'SGO', 'trades', 'article', 'understanding', 'divisions', 'fate', 'distributors', 'applications', 'windows', 'stock', 'war', 'Ukraine', '52 week', 'COGS', 'excess', 'customers', '2.8B', '232M', 'top', '530M', 'amount', 'shareholders', 'EPS', 'June', 'H1', 'changes', '9B', '55B', 'mind', 'majority', 'fact', '704M', 'depreciation', '3.5B', '8.3 BEUR', '34', '1.3']",2022-10-21,2022-10-22,seekingalpha.com

The increased cash outflow was primarily due to the PRIMAvera clinical trial in Europe for which the Company reached its enrolment target of 38 patients from its clinical sites in France  Germany  the UK  Spain  the Netherlands and Italy. Furthermore  the manufacturing of remote rehabilitation systems for patients in clinical trials as well as costs related to the preparation of financing options  lead to an increase in spending  which were partially offset by reduced expenses associated with the French and US feasibility studies.Until 30 September 2022  investments in fixed and intangible assets remained low leading to a net cash outflow from investment activities of €0.1 million.At 30 September 2022  net cash provided by financing activities totalled €4.2 million  following the drawdown of the first tranche of the convertible note (“ORNAN 2022”) signed with ESGO in July 2022 for a total of €5.5 million and for which the Company received a total amount of €4.6 million (in net proceeds).Story continuesIn total  at 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision’s cash position amounted to €8.5 million  compared to €16.9 million on 1 January 2022. Given its current cash position  the Company believes that it is able to finance its operations until middle of the second quarter 2023.Due to the constraints of its agreement with ESGO  Pixium Vision is currently not able to continue drawing further tranches and therefore the Company is exploring various avenues to enable it to secure its cash flow necessary to pursue its strategic ambitions.Key developments in the third quarter of 2022In the third quarter of 2022 Pixium Vision continued the positive momentum of its clinical development in completing the enrolment of the PRIMAvera study  the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials and has implemented a convertible note facility with a maximum nominal amount of €30 million with ESGO  including the drawdown of the first tranche of €5.5 million.On 14 July 2022  Pixium Vision announced the implementation of a financing of a maximum nominal amount of €30 million with ESGO  and the drawdown of a first tranche of €5.5 million.On 3 August 2022  Pixium Vision announced the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials.On 19 September 2022  Pixium Vision announced reaching its enrolment target in the European pivotal trial PRIMAvera and confirmed the intention to complete all implantations by end 2022.Subsequent to the closing on 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision published peer-reviewed safety data of the Prima System in Dry AMD in the Journal of Neural Engineering was published.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

At the date of this communication 2 600 K€ are undrawn.Story continuesActivity and outlookResumption of post-pandemic activityAlmost all the constraints linked to the pandemic have been lifted since this summer since when Orege has thus been able to resume the execution of two projects  both frozen for 2.5 years  one in Germany and the other in Japan. However  no revenue will be generated in 2022 from these two projects.Orège has been able to adapt to disrupted supply chainsThe global pressure on supply chains has increased in recent months (prices  delivery times  availability of certain electronic components and PLCs  etc.).Orege started planning for this challenge since the end of 2021 and has since then thus carried out a complete reorganization of its supply chains: recruitment of an experienced supply chain manager  new distributors  “opportunistic” purchases of component stocks  revisited PLC configurations in order to adapt to the context  etc.As a result  Orege does not anticipate any problem for the end of 2022  nor any significant constraint for 2023 on the basis of how things stand presently.Impact of the energy crisis on the businessIn a context where the energy crisis has a strong impact on many of our customers and partners  Orege considers that opportunities are created by proposing an improvement in the performance of ""anaerobic digesters"" which are most often found in large wastewater treatment plants.It should be remembered that the energy costs of wastewater treatment plants are a significant operating expense of these plants.Orege's solutions  which themselves consume little energy  enable operators to generate substantial financial savings  but also from now will enable operators to optimize biogas production.This dedicated commercial approach will enable Orege to refine its positioning in the sludge recovery chain.Projects signed and/or in the execution phase in the US and the UKOrders expected by the end of 2022The two projects signed with municipal utilities in Wisconsin (La Crosse) and in South Carolina (Easley) will be largely completed in 2022  which should generate revenue for the year of approximately 700 K€.A major project on an industrial wastewater treatment plant in Houston  initiated in collaboration with the Alfa Laval Group  is in progress.It should make a significant contribution to revenue for 2022.Orege has just signed a contract in October for the sale of 3 SLG-F thickening solutions with a new Water Utility in the UK.

In agreement with the former Crossinx…,La Hulpe – 21 October 2022  7:00 a.m. CET – [INSIDE INFORMATION] Unifiedpost Group (Euronext: UPG) (Unifiedpost  or the Company) completed the acquisition of the German e-invoicing market leader Crossinx on April 9  2021. In agreement with the former Crossinx shareholders  Unifiedpost now settles the earn-out obligations in exchange for a one-time payment of € 4.829.792 94 through the issuance in aggregate of 1.277.723 new shares of Unifiedpost.The original transactionIn April 2021  Unifiedpost acquired with Crossinx a real-time data-driven e-invoice solution. By acquiring this technology  the Unifiedpost solutions will now be able to support data-driven communication in its order-to-cash and procure-to-pay solution with substantive data validation. These digital solutions are now ready for the market transition to data e-invoices validated in real-time. This brings the Company ahead of the market curve  certainly with upcoming mandatory e-invoicing regulation in the EU.In addition to the technology Unifiedpost achieved with the acquisition a direct access to the large DACH market (Germany  Austria  Switzerland) and can benefit from the expected growth opportunities. On top of that  the Company can now serve corporate clients internationally with a full offering.Unifiedpost acquired Crossinx in April 2021 with a cash consideration and share consideration paid in April 2021. The former shareholders of Crossinx were possible entitled to a deferred conditional consideration of up to a maximum of € 60 million  partly payable in cash and partly payable in shares. These earn-out payments were due if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Current transaction detailsThrough an addendum dated 20 October 2022 to the share purchase agreement  the parties have decided to replace any potential obligations by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders in respect of any earn-amount by a one-time fixed payment of € 4.829.792 94 in aggregate. As the one-time payment is fully settled in shares of Unifiedpost  there is no cash payment by the Company. At an issuance price of € 3 78 per share  this corresponds to 1.277.723 new shares which have been issued by the Company on 20 October 2022.Pursuant to the addendum  the former Crossinx shareholders have agreed to a lock-up. For the four main former Crossinx shareholders (representing 65 77 % of the new shares)  the lock-up will last for 12 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after 6 months  and 25% more shares being released three months thereafter. For the other former Crossinx shareholders the lock-up lasts 6 months  with release of 50% of the new shares after three months.Related partiesThe former Crossinx shareholders include Mr. Michael Kleindl and Mr. Marcus Laube as related parties. Mr. Kleindl is through his company First Performance AG currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company. The announcement required by the related party rules is set out in the appendix.AppendixPublic announcement pursuant to article 7:97  §4/1 of the Companies and Associations Code relating to the buy-out of the potential earn-out claims of former Crossinx shareholders1. The Board of Directors of the Company held on 20 October 2022 decided to approve the addendum to the sale and purchase agreement of 9 April 2021 between the former Crossinx shareholders and the Company.Two of the former Crossinx shareholders include (i) Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company KOMM Investment AG) and (ii) Mr. Marcus Laube. Following the completion of the acquisition of Crossinx  they have joined the Company. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Mr. Marcus Laube is the Chief Sales Officer and member of the Management Committee of the Company.Given their functions  First Performance AG (with permanent representative Mr. Kleindl) and Mr. Laube qualify as related parties within the meaning of IFRS and article 7:97 CAC.In this context  the Board of Directors applied Article 7:97 of the Companies and Associations Code (“CAC”) relating to decisions and transactions concerning a party related to the Company. This provision implies  among other things  the intervention of a committee of independent directors to give an opinion to the Board of Directors. The conclusion of this opinion is set out at the end of this communication.In addition  this provision provides that when the decision or transaction involves a director  such person cannot not take part in the deliberations or vote of the Board of Directors. Mr. Michael Kleindl (through his company First Performance AG) decided not to be present at the Board of Directors which decided on the transaction and did thus not participate in the deliberations or votes.The Company has also applied Article 7:96 CAC  relating to decisions in which a director has a direct or indirect interest of a proprietary nature that is opposed to the interest of the Company. This provision also provides that this director does not participate in the deliberation or votes. The director concerned is the one indicated in the previous paragraph.2. The addendum to the transaction documentation was signed on 20 October 2022. It provides that the former Crossinx shareholders shall receive in aggregate 1.277.723 shares of the Company  replacing the previously agreed potential earn-out amounts  if certain revenue targets were reached in the financial years 2021  2022 and 2023.Six of the thirty one Sellers (the “ESOP Sellers”)  including Mr Laube  were party to an employee stock option program in Crossinx before the original Crossinx transaction. Shortly before the signing of the original Crossinx transaction  the ESOP Sellers converted their claims under the ESOP into actual Crossinx shares. Despite this conversion  Crossinx remains responsible as tax indemnitor for any wage taxes of the ESOP Sellers. As this is a continuing obligation  it is therefore agreed under the addendum that the value of such taxes (“ESOP Charges”) are held back.As a result  the number of new shares issued by the Company on 20 October 2022 amounts to 1.277.723 in aggregate (the “Effective Buy-Off Shares”)  among which Mr Kleindl has received 20 98% shares and Mr Laube received 18 54% shares. These shares have been allocated proportionally based on the former share percentage in Crossinx but taking into account the hold-back for the ESOP Sellers.The issuance amount per share is equal to the lowest trading price of the shares of the Company on the day that the new shares have been issued by the Company to the former Crossinx shareholders  i.e. € 3 78. The capital increase of the Company amounts to € 4.829.792 94.As the value of the shares is based on an open public market price where mechanism of supply and demand plays  the price should be seen as the current fair price of the share as all trading parties are fully informed with same financial data.3. The new shares have been issued as registered shares and are subject to a lock-up period.The lock-up period will depend on the percentage which the former Crossinx shareholder held in Crossinx prior to the original transaction. Both the company of Mr. Kleindl and Mr. Laube will be subject to the extended lock-up of 12 month with staggering release.4. The immediate early termination of the earn-out terms under the original Crossinx documentation and the entering into the addendum facilitates the full integration of Crossinx with the Company. In the absence thereof  the implementation of the company change and integration project “one product  one company” might be delayed until the end of the earn-out period (i.e. 31 December 2023).The change and integration project is aimed to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company. Further  the addendum will eliminate any potential future risk for the Company to pay earn-out. The addendum does not include any cash payment by the Company.5. A committee of all 5 independent directors of Unifiedpost has assessed the transaction described above  in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC  and has issued a written and substantiated opinion on this matter to the board of directors of Unifiedpost. The conclusions of the opinion of the committee of independent directors are as follows:“Based on the above argumentation  the Committee is of the opinion that the completion of the Crossinx Addendum Transaction resulting in an early termination of the Orginal Crossinx Agreement is in the best interest of the Company.The early termination of the Original Crossinx Agreement is a necessary condition precedent if the Company wants to start to implement with immediate effect a change and integration project which is aimed and expected to have a substantial operational and financial impact on the Company that largely outweighs the disadvantage of the cost and dilutive effect of the new shares to be issued as provided for in the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.In view of this  the Committee unanimously advises the Board of Directors of the Company to approve the Crossinx Addendum Transaction.”Finally  the assessment made by the auditor in accordance with Article 7:97 CAC reads as follows: Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data included in the opinion of the committee of independent directors dated 19 October 2022 and in the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors dated 20 October 2022  justifying the proposed transaction  are not fair and sufficient in all material respects in light of the information available to us in connection with our engagement.Financial Calendar 202210 November 2022 Publication Q3 2022 Business Update30 November 2022 Investor Day 2022Investor Relations & MediaSarah Heuninck+32 491 15 05 09sarah.heuninck@unifiedpost.comAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on “Documents”  “Identity” and “Payments”.

Low adiponectin levels are known to be associated with NASH and with cardiovascular disease. Liver biomarkers and imaging assessments  as well as adiponectin serum levels measures  were conducted during Inventiva’s NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial  in order to evaluate the relation between adiponectin changes and the improvement of a broad panel of markers of liver and cardiometabolic health in patients with NASH. The adiponectin levels at baseline were low in patients enrolled in the NATIVE clinical trial  and treatment with lanifibranor significantly increased adiponectin levels in contrast to placebo. This increase in adiponectin is correlated with improvements in glycemic control  insulin resistance  lipid profile  liver tests and systemic inflammation  as well as liver steatosis quantified by ultrasound-based imaging. These data further show that lanifibranor  in addition to its beneficial effect on liver histology  also improves markers of cardiometabolic health and increases adiponectin levels  and thus has the potential to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with NASH.The details of the presentation are as follows:Abstract :Abstract title: ""Lanifibranor-induced improvement of liver and cardiometabolic markers of NASH is associated with an increase in adiponectin"" Poster number: 2526 Presentation type: Poster presentation Authors: Michael P. Cooreman  Sven Francque  Philippe Huot-Marchand  Lucile Dzen  Martine Baudin  Jean-Louis Junien  Pierre Broqua  Manal F. Abdelmalek Date: November 5  2022 – 8:30am-5:00pm (EST)Inventiva will also be present with a booth: we are inviting you to visit us from Friday 4th through Monday 7th  during exhibition hall opening hours at booth #548 located in the exhibition hall of the conference center.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well‑characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well‑balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan‑PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan‑PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre‑clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they are implanted with the alfapump and will be used for primary endpoint analysis. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival. For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About fluid overload in liver cirrhosis (AKA ascites)Fluid accumulation in the abdomen is a significant and common complication of liver cirrhosis. Approximately 10% of these patients do not respond to diuretic drugs and most require recurrent external drainage (AKA paracentesis)  an invasive and painful procedure that only provides temporary benefit  require frequent hospitalizations and severely impacts their quality of life.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. Fluid overload is a well-recognized problem in these growing diseases  causing severe problems for the large number of patients for whom current medicines are no longer effective. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life.alfapump and DSR are Sequana Medical’s proprietary approaches that work with the body to remove this excess fluid  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.

With this new assumption  and also taking into account the evolution of currencies  we are also revising upwards our expected consolidated sales for the year to between 24.5 billion euros and 25.5 billion euros  against a previous expectation of between 23 billion euros and 24 billion euros.In a macroeconomic environment that remains challenging  we are laser-focused on three major objectives:Finalize the refinancing of the HELLA acquisition and deleverage the Group Protect our short-term operating margin and our cash generation in a highly inflationary environment Continue to build a strong and selective order book  thanks to the unique combination of Faurecia and HELLA’s technologies and innovations.We will have the opportunity to detail these priorities as well as our short-term and longer-term actions during the Capital Markets Day that FORVIA will hold on November 3  followed on the next day by an event specifically dedicated to our sustainable development roadmap.”The Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN   met on October 2 0 and reviewed the present press release .“ Operating income ” presented as Faurecia’s main performance indicator is Operating income before amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.“ Adjusted EBITDA ” is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation   this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘ Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).“ Debt covenant ” is the ratio “ Net financial debt at the end of the period ” vs. “ Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months ” ; it is tested twice every year   at June 30 and at December 31.A ll other definitions are explained at the end of this Press Release  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) forecast dated October 2022 (vehicles segment in line with CAAM for China  i.e. excluding vehicles > 3.5t).MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE H1 2022 RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENTSince July 25  2022:On July 28  HELLA announced the divestment of its 33% stake in the HBPO JV to its co-shareholder Plastic Omnium for €290mThis is a further milestone reached by HELLA in sharpening its profile as a technology company with Lighting  Electronics and Lifecycle Solutions at its core. Closing expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.This is also the first step of the Group’s €1bn disposal program by end-2023  contributing to Group deleveraging after the acquisition of HELLA.On August 18  HELLA announced its outlook for the next 12-month period (June 2022 to May 2023) Sales in the range of €7.1bn to €7.6bn (vs. €6.3bn for FY 2021/2022) Adj.

It represents close to 30% of the total target and confirms the program is on track as announced  both in terms of total amount and deadline.Refinancing of the HELLA acquisition:Since July  Faurecia further reduced by €500 million the remaining part of the bridge-to-loan to be refinanced post-HELLA acquisition  through a €300 million loan from the European Investment Bank and a USD210 million loan from Latin America banks.Since the announcement of the HELLA acquisition (August 2021)  Faurecia prefinanced and refinanced more than €3 billion of debt at an average cost below 3.25%.As the expected closing of the divestment of its stake in HBPO by HELLA will reduce the Group’s consolidated financial net debt by €290 million  the bridge-to-loan left to be refinanced by August 2023 amounts now to €900 million  that will be refinanced through a mix of new debt instruments and proceeds from next steps in the disposal program underway.Management of energy prices:The Group’s operations are not highly energy-intensive: in 2021 (“reference year”)  the total Faurecia + HELLA energy bill (electricity c. 70% + gas c. 30%) amounted to c. €170m  representing only 0.7% of sales.Very efficient historical hedging policies are in place that largely protect the Group’s energy bill from the current sharp rise in electricity and gas prices.On top of these hedging policies  energy savings measures have already been implemented  and self-production is accelerating:Energy savings measures should represent c. 22% (exit 2023)  including weekend and night flexingSelf-production through solar panels (120 GWh installed) should represent an additional 7% (exit 2023)As a result of efficient hedging policies and self-help measures  the Group’s energy bill should grow by only 1.8x in 2023 vs. the 2021 “reference year”  while energy prices in Europe have increased more than 10x.UPDATED FY 2022 GUIDANCE (Faurecia incl. 11 months of consolidation of HELLA) WITH SALES TARGET UPGRADED TO BETWEEN €24.5bn AND €25.5bn AND OPERATING MARGIN AND NET CASH FLOW TARGETS CONFIRMEDAt this stage of the year  Faurecia is revising upward its assumption for worldwide automotive production in 2022 to 77 million LVs  vs. 74 million previously. This new assumption nevertheless remains cautious vs. S&P Global Mobility’ latest forecast of 79.0 million LVs (dated October 2022).Reflecting:this revised assumption of 77 million LVs produced worldwide in 2022 updated currency assumptions (notably USD/€ now at 1.05 on average in 2022  vs. 1.13 previously) the Group’s sales guidance is upgraded to between €24.5 billion and €25.5 billion (vs. between €23 billion and €24 billion  previously).Operating margin and net cash flow targets for the year are confirmed.FY 2022 guidance is now:Sales between €24.5 billion and €25.5 billion (vs. between €23bn and €24bn  previously) Operating margin confirmed between 4% and 5% of sales Net cash flow confirmed at breakeven (includes building of a safety stock at year-end to secure supplies given energy shortage risks in Europe).In addition  the Group confirms targeting Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio ≤ 3x at the end of 2022.The guidance is based on full-year average currency rates of 1.05 for USD/€ and of 7.07 for CNY/€. It assumes no major lockdown impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region in Q4 and takes into account the Group’s latest update of net impact from cost inflation.SAVE THE DATESOn November 3  FORVIA will hold a Capital Markets Day close to ParisThe Capital Markets Day will include the Analysts Meeting of HELLA pursuant to sec. 55 of the Exchange Rules for the Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB).On November 4  FORVIA will hold a Sustainability Day close to ParisFaurecia and HELLA will present FORVIA’s Net Zero ambition  sustainability roadmap and action plan.Both events will take place at Dock Eiffel  50  avenue du Président Wilson  93210 Saint Denis (France).For further information  please contact: contact@cmd2022-forvia.com** *Faurecia's Q3 2022 sales presentation is also available on the Faurecia website: www.faurecia.comA webcast will be held today at 09:00am (Paris time).If you wish to follow the presentation using the webcast  please access the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/h2ppuyvqA replay will be available as soon as possible.

Sales growthFaurecia’s year-on-year sales evolution is made of three components:A “ Currency effect”   calculated by applying average currency rates for the period to the sales of the prior year A “Scope effect” (acquisition/divestment) And “Growth at constant currencies”.As “Scope effect”  Faurecia presents all acquisitions/divestments  whose sales on an annual basis amount to more than €250 million.Other acquisitions below this threshold are considered as “bolt-on acquisitions” and are included in “Growth at constant currencies”.In 2021  there was no effect from “bolt-on acquisitions”; as a result  “Growth at constant currencies” is equivalent to sales growth at constant scope and currencies also presented as organic growth.2. Operating incomeOperating income is the Faurecia group’s principal performance indicator. It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations;Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses;Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs;Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;Taxes.3. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).4. Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.5. Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).BREAKDOWN BY QUARTER OF FORVIA 2021 PROFORMA SALES(FY2021 proforma is presented in chapter 6 of Faurecia's 2021 Universal Registration Document)Sales in €m (unaudited) Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 FY 2021 Faurecia 2021 as released 4 005 3 778 3 426 4 409 15 618 HELLA 12/2020 - 11/2021 1 679 1 622 1 444 1 572 6 317 Reciprocal operations -9 -9 -9 -9 -36 FORVIA 2021 proforma 5 675 5 391 4 861 5 972 21 898Attachment",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.43,0.24,0.33,True,English,"['THIRD-QUARTER', 'SALES', 'S&P Global Mobility', 'UPGRADED FULL-YEAR 2022 SALES GUIDANCE', 'global automotive production', 'global auto production', 'worldwide automotive production', 'favorable comparable base', 'unfavorable geographic mix', 'regional automotive production', 'H1 2022 results announcement', 'three major objectives', 'selective order book', 'sustainable development roadmap', 'Michel de ROSEN', 'present press release', 'Net cash flow', '77 million light vehicles', 'main performance indicator', 'total acquisition cost', 'CAPITAL MARKETS DAY', '€1bn disposal program', 'short-term operating margin', 'Q3 scope effect', 'Faurecia stand-alone figures', 'Hella scope effect', 'strong sales growth', 'Markets Authority', 'constant scope', 'vehicles segment', 'SUSTAINABILITY DAY', 'main geographies', 'cash generation', 'next day', 'Operating income', 'organic growth', 'Currency effect', 'Change Sales', 'm units', 'IHS Markit', 'REPORTED BASIS', 'ORGANIC BASIS', '77m LVs', '74m LVs', 'HBPO JV', 'Plastic Omnium', 'combined amount', 'attractive conditions', 'current environment', 'Patrick KOLLER', 'semiconductor availability', 'North America', 'COVID-related lockdowns', 'key cities', 'past quarters', 'cautious outlook', 'new assumption', 'consolidated sales', '24.5 billion euros', '25.5 billion euros', 'previous expectation', '23 billion euros', '24 billion euros', 'macroeconomic environment', 'inflationary environment', 'unique combination', 'longer-term actions', 'business combinations', 'European Securities', 'strong growth', 'strong recovery', 'HELLA ACQUISITION', 'year growth', 'Q3 SALES', 'Adjusted EBITDA', 'EBITDA” ag', 'last year', 'full year', 'market outperformance', 'intangible assets', 'consolidation effect', 'currency evolution', 'third quarter', 'Nanterre', 'France', 'THIRD-QUARTER', 'THE', 'currencies', 'Feb.', 'October', 'FORVIA', '3m', 'Source', 'line', 'CAAM', 'China', 'BETWEEN', 'February', 'regions', 'estimation', 'breakeven', 'Story', 'TRACK', 'DELEVERAGING', 'REFINANCING', 'July', 'divestment', '33% stake', 'shareholder', 'remainder', 'Group', 'end', 'Financings', 'part', 'bridge', 'loan', 'NOVEMBER', 'CEO', 'terms', 'account', 'technologies', 'innovations', 'opportunity', 'priorities', 'event', 'Board', 'Directors', 'chairmanship', 'amortization', 'depreciation', 'ESMA', 'regulation', 'January', '→']",2022-10-21,2022-10-22,finance.yahoo.com

The increased cash outflow was primarily due to the PRIMAvera clinical trial in Europe for which the Company reached its enrolment target of 38 patients from its clinical sites in France  Germany  the UK  Spain  the Netherlands and Italy. Furthermore  the manufacturing of remote rehabilitation systems for patients in clinical trials as well as costs related to the preparation of financing options  lead to an increase in spending  which were partially offset by reduced expenses associated with the French and US feasibility studies.Until 30 September 2022  investments in fixed and intangible assets remained low leading to a net cash outflow from investment activities of €0.1 million.At 30 September 2022  net cash provided by financing activities totalled €4.2 million  following the drawdown of the first tranche of the convertible note (“ORNAN 2022”) signed with ESGO in July 2022 for a total of €5.5 million and for which the Company received a total amount of €4.6 million (in net proceeds).In total  at 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision’s cash position amounted to €8.5 million  compared to €16.9 million on 1 January 2022. Given its current cash position  the Company believes that it is able to finance its operations until middle of the second quarter 2023.Due to the constraints of its agreement with ESGO  Pixium Vision is currently not able to continue drawing further tranches and therefore the Company is exploring various avenues to enable it to secure its cash flow necessary to pursue its strategic ambitions.Key developments in the third quarter of 2022In the third quarter of 2022 Pixium Vision continued the positive momentum of its clinical development in completing the enrolment of the PRIMAvera study  the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials and has implemented a convertible note facility with a maximum nominal amount of €30 million with ESGO  including the drawdown of the first tranche of €5.5 million.On 14 July 2022  Pixium Vision announced the implementation of a financing of a maximum nominal amount of €30 million with ESGO  and the drawdown of a first tranche of €5.5 million.On 3 August 2022  Pixium Vision announced the regulatory approval of remote rehabilitation system for patients in clinical trials.On 19 September 2022  Pixium Vision announced reaching its enrolment target in the European pivotal trial PRIMAvera and confirmed the intention to complete all implantations by end 2022.Subsequent to the closing on 30 September 2022  Pixium Vision published peer-reviewed safety data of the Prima System in Dry AMD in the Journal of Neural Engineering was published.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

At the date of this communication 2 600 K€ are undrawn.Activity and outlookResumption of post-pandemic activityAlmost all the constraints linked to the pandemic have been lifted since this summer since when Orege has thus been able to resume the execution of two projects  both frozen for 2.5 years  one in Germany and the other in Japan. However  no revenue will be generated in 2022 from these two projects.Orège has been able to adapt to disrupted supply chainsThe global pressure on supply chains has increased in recent months (prices  delivery times  availability of certain electronic components and PLCs  etc.).Orege started planning for this challenge since the end of 2021 and has since then thus carried out a complete reorganization of its supply chains: recruitment of an experienced supply chain manager  new distributors  “opportunistic” purchases of component stocks  revisited PLC configurations in order to adapt to the context  etc.As a result  Orege does not anticipate any problem for the end of 2022  nor any significant constraint for 2023 on the basis of how things stand presently.Impact of the energy crisis on the businessIn a context where the energy crisis has a strong impact on many of our customers and partners  Orege considers that opportunities are created by proposing an improvement in the performance of ""anaerobic digesters"" which are most often found in large wastewater treatment plants.It should be remembered that the energy costs of wastewater treatment plants are a significant operating expense of these plants.Orege's solutions  which themselves consume little energy  enable operators to generate substantial financial savings  but also from now will enable operators to optimize biogas production.This dedicated commercial approach will enable Orege to refine its positioning in the sludge recovery chain.Projects signed and/or in the execution phase in the US and the UKOrders expected by the end of 2022The two projects signed with municipal utilities in Wisconsin (La Crosse) and in South Carolina (Easley) will be largely completed in 2022  which should generate revenue for the year of approximately 700 K€.A major project on an industrial wastewater treatment plant in Houston  initiated in collaboration with the Alfa Laval Group  is in progress.It should make a significant contribution to revenue for 2022.Orege has just signed a contract in October for the sale of 3 SLG-F thickening solutions with a new Water Utility in the UK. The 3 corresponding units could be implemented by the end of 2022 and generate around €1 million in revenue for the current financial year.Four orders (3 in the UK and 1 in the US) are expected by the end of 2022 for a total value of around €1.3 million. The Orege solutions for these 4 projects would be implemented by early 2023.Outlook 2023A detailed update the outlook for 2023 will be given during the Oddo BHF Forum which will take place on January 9 and 10  2023. The PowerPoint document which will serve as a framework for all investor meetings will be posted on the Orège website. from January 9  2023.Other information:The half year report will be published in French on the Company’s website ( www.orege.com) 21st October 2022.Orege has been listed on the regulated market Euronext – Paris since 5th July 2013 - ISIN FR0010609206 - OREGE.Contact Orege: Financial information – George GonsalvesGeorge.gonsalves@orege.com - mob: +33 6 08 03 50 72Attachment",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.35,0.24,0.41,True,English,"['orège Group activity', 'half year 2022 results', 'company total additional shareholder current account advances', 'industrial wastewater treatment plant', 'net foreign exchange gains', 'experienced supply chain manager', 'large wastewater treatment plants', 'sludge recovery chain', 'current financial year', 'Voisins Le Bretonneux', 'dedicated commercial approach', 'Oddo BHF Forum', 'Total operating expenses', 'HALF YEAR 2022 RESULTS', 'first half year', 'half year report', 'research tax credits', 'new Water Utility', 'substantial financial savings', 'Alfa Laval Group', '3 SLG-F thickening solutions', 'Orège website', 'Summary financial information', 'significant operating expense', 'Other operating expenses', 'The Orege solutions', 'total value', 'OREGE GROUP ACTIVITY', 'Net loss', 'Other information', 'Corporation tax', 'supply chains', 'new distributors', 'Payroll expenses', 'significant constraint', 'significant contribution', 'Operating result', 'Financial result', 'Press release', 'six months', 'consolidated accounts', 'interest cost', 'Eren Industries', 'global pressure', 'recent months', 'delivery times', 'electronic components', 'complete reorganization', 'opportunistic” purchases', 'component stocks', 'PLC configurations', 'energy crisis', 'anaerobic digesters', 'energy costs', 'little energy', 'biogas production', 'municipal utilities', 'La Crosse', 'South Carolina', 'major project', '3 corresponding units', 'detailed update', 'PowerPoint document', 'investor meetings', 'financial debt', 'post-pandemic activity', 'two projects', 'English French', 'financing requirements', 'strong impact', 'execution phase', 'Four orders', '21st October', 'cash equivalents', '4 projects', '19 October', 'Board', 'directors', 'K€', 'IFRS', 'June', 'Turnover', 'Depreciation', 'amortisation', '1 078 K', '790 K', 'increase', '736 K', 'H1', '31 December', '528 K', '30 825 K', 'respect', '26 631 K', 'CIR', '4 600 K', 'communication', 'Resumption', 'constraints', 'summer', '2.5 years', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'revenue', 'prices', 'availability', 'PLCs', 'challenge', 'end', 'recruitment', 'context', 'problem', 'basis', 'things', 'business', 'customers', 'partners', 'opportunities', 'improvement', 'performance', 'operators', 'positioning', 'UK', 'Wisconsin', 'Easley', '700 K', 'Houston', 'collaboration', 'progress', 'contract', 'sale', 'early', 'Outlook', 'place', 'January', 'framework', '740', '2023']",2022-10-21,2022-10-22,globenewswire.com

Bruno Le Maire declares: ""And we want France to be the European hub of the crypto-asset ecosystem.""He also said: ""Today  France has some of the most innovative DASPs in the world and can draw on an exceptional concentration of crypto skills  whether scientific  IT  financial  legal or commercial.""Artmarket.com is fully prepared to contribute to making France a Leader in crypto-assets in Europe and also in the world  in the specific field of Art NFTs  adopted by all historical players in the Art Market.As World Leader in Art Market Information and a pioneer on the Internet since 1987 with Group Serveur  Artprice by Artmarket (twice designated an ""innovative company"" by BPI France) has all the advantages  technological know-how  and expertise to give France a place as an international leader in the field of crypto art.Artmarket.com already has a permanent information feed on daily NFT news in 119 countries  as the world's leading press agency dedicated to the Art Market  NFTs  and Metaverse:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-artprice-and-cision-extend-their-alliance-to-119-countries-to-become-the-worlds-leading-press-agency-dedicated-to-the-art-market-nfts-and-the-metaverse-301431845.htmlArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that during the first half of 2022  the Art NFT phenomenon (Jeton Non Fongible in French) became a durable segment of the art market on all continents with acceleration in sales and volumes in the second half of 2022. This acceleration has been triggered primarily by a) the purge of cryptocurrencies and b) the introduction of much more favorable legislation in the USA. Meanwhile  Europe has introduced a regulatory framework that supervises and controls the cryptocurrency environment  thereby giving greater confidence to consumers  investors  and operators.This regulation is the subject of studies  colloquia  and proposals to major French and European government bodies by the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com remarks: ""in our various annual art market reports and our communications with investors  we have always included NFTs in our studies. And we have always said that one cannot understand this market with exponential growth without understanding the vital importance of Blockchains  cryptocurrencies  and their cultural origin within the Cypherpunk milieu (period of PGP-type data encryption in the early 1990s).""Indeed  OpenSea USA  the leading NFT platform  itself declares that 80% of the primary issues of Art NFTs are likely to impact the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced that it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. There is only one viable solution to this problem: the certification of the primary Art-NFT market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of Art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only one on the world market  taking into account all the underlying parameters and data  to be able to truly meet the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.This ability to certify primary issues of Art NFTs is based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the World Leader in Art Market Information and author for 25 years of its authoritative databases. These in turn contain the largest documentary collection in the world of notes  manuscripts  and catalogs of auction sales since 1700  guaranteeing in return the authenticity and the historical proof of its databases.Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive Art NFTs platform through its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and inevitable outcome of the NFT revolution.This Metaverse is the assurance of exponential and continuous growth of the Art Market by NFTs. It will be accompanied by its Blockchain and its smart contracts to allow fair remuneration for artists  with copyright societies such as ADAGP  of which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors  under the legal provisions of reproduction  for the support of artists.The Minister of the Economy adds ""In the immediate future  I am delighted with the transition from Ethereum to proof of stake  which consumes much less energy. ""This is in line with Artprice by Artmarket.com's Blockchain  which will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts  as announced in its recent press release  following the transition from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to ""Proof of Stake"" of Ethereum 2.0 on September 15  2022:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-with-a-99-95-reduction-in-energy-consumption-the-merge-is-a-historic-and-ecological-success-for-ethereum-the-reference-cryptocurrency-for-artprice-and-for-the-art-nft-market-301625211.htmlIndeed  Artmarket.com has been following very closely for the last 3 years the transition to ""The Merge"" for the decarbonized Blockchain Ethereum 2.0  in the context of the global energy crisis  which is only just beginning. According to its Founder Vitalik Buterin  thanks to ""The Merge""  after 7 years of development and successful beta tests)  the electricity consumption of the Blockchain ETH collapses by more than 99.95%  going from ""Proof of Work"" (PoW) to the ""Proof of Stake"" (PoS).The fact that Artprice anticipated three years earlier the Blockchain Ethereum and its smart contract as the reference in the Art Market for NFTs  is further reinforced by the official dispatch from Christie's on September 27  2022  with the launch announced of Christie's 3.0 which is based on the Blockchain Ethereum.According to an Artprice study:""All Market Makers in the Art Market and in particular the majority of Auction Houses worldwide now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Similarly  all the major structures in the museum industry and art galleries are starting to publish their own NFTs.Digital Art created in the 1980s is finally making its real revolution by impacting nearly half a billion Art NFT enthusiasts  at purchasing costs that are now very accessible.There are already more than 54 000 artists identified by Artprice who directly produce their NFTs for their buying public and this is only the very beginning of this paradigm shift.It is a major event that definitively modifies the structure of the Art Market and its actors  as known since 1950 according to sociologists  art historians  and analysts. This is also confirmed by the various departments of Artprice  particularly concerning the figures.""https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/29/artmarket_com-rapport-financier-s1-2022-les-capitaux-propres-depassent-les-30m-eur-rn-en-progression-record-ca-s1-mise-en-placeArtmarket.com will contribute to giving France and Europe a chance to counterbalance the Anglo-Saxon hegemony in the field of crypto-assets.

With this new assumption  and also taking into account the evolution of currencies  we are also revising upwards our expected consolidated sales for the year to between 24.5 billion euros and 25.5 billion euros  against a previous expectation of between 23 billion euros and 24 billion euros.In a macroeconomic environment that remains challenging  we are laser-focused on three major objectives:Finalize the refinancing of the HELLA acquisition and deleverage the Group Protect our short-term operating margin and our cash generation in a highly inflationary environment Continue to build a strong and selective order book  thanks to the unique combination of Faurecia and HELLA’s technologies and innovations.We will have the opportunity to detail these priorities as well as our short-term and longer-term actions during the Capital Markets Day that FORVIA will hold on November 3  followed on the next day by an event specifically dedicated to our sustainable development roadmap.”The Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN   met on October 2 0 and reviewed the present press release .“ Operating income ” presented as Faurecia’s main performance indicator is Operating income before amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.“ Adjusted EBITDA ” is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation   this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘ Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).“ Debt covenant ” is the ratio “ Net financial debt at the end of the period ” vs. “ Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months ” ; it is tested twice every year   at June 30 and at December 31.A ll other definitions are explained at the end of this Press Release  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) forecast dated October 2022 (vehicles segment in line with CAAM for China  i.e. excluding vehicles > 3.5t).MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE H1 2022 RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENTSince July 25  2022:On July 28  HELLA announced the divestment of its 33% stake in the HBPO JV to its co-shareholder Plastic Omnium for €290mThis is a further milestone reached by HELLA in sharpening its profile as a technology company with Lighting  Electronics and Lifecycle Solutions at its core. Closing expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.This is also the first step of the Group’s €1bn disposal program by end-2023  contributing to Group deleveraging after the acquisition of HELLA.On August 18  HELLA announced its outlook for the next 12-month period (June 2022 to May 2023) Sales in the range of €7.1bn to €7.6bn (vs. €6.3bn for FY 2021/2022) Adj. EBIT margin in the range of 5.5% to 7.0% (vs. 4.4% for FY 2021/2022)FORVIA’s order intake (Faurecia + HELLA) continued to develop at a sustained pace in the quarter  while maintaining selectivity on programs  with €24.5bn signed since the start of the yearMajor awards included a sizeable award of €2bn lifetime sales with Daimler for complete seats (1st and 2nd rows)  an award with a global long-haul truck leader for the first mass-production of hydrogen storage systems and awards to equip 8 different EVs from German premium manufacturers with multifunctional Front Phygital Shields (Lighting).New steps were achieved in the refinancing process of the acquisition of HELLANew financings for €0.5bn were signed in Q3 at attractive conditions. The remaining part of the bridge-to-loan (to be refinanced by mid-August 2023) is now €0.9bn. This will be refinanced through new financings and/or next divestments.Faurecia’s hydrogen activities  as well as those of Symbio (its 50/50 JV with Michelin)  were selected as being of common European interestThe European Commission has approved an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) to support research and innovation  in the first industrial deployment and construction of relevant infrastructure in the hydrogen value chain.This project  called “IPCEI Hy2Use” was jointly prepared and notified by thirteen Member States  including France. Faurecia and Symbio are among participants in the 10 projects supported by the French government in IPCEI.Effective on September 19  Faurecia was integrated into the ranking Euronext CAC 40 ESG® index

disposal program of €1bn by end-2023:HELLA announced on July 28 the sale of its 33.33% stake in HBPO to its co-shareholder  Plastic Omnium. The agreed purchase price is c. €290 million and closing of the transaction is expected take place in the fourth quarter of 2022.With this decision  HELLA is continuing its proven course of consistent portfolio management  further sharpening its profile as a focused technology company with Lighting  Electronics and Lifecycle Solutions at its core.This divestment marks a first significant step in the FORVIA Group’s non-strategic asset disposal program of €1 billion by end-2023  as part of the Group’s plan to reduce its consolidated net debt following the acquisition of HELLA. It represents close to 30% of the total target and confirms the program is on track as announced  both in terms of total amount and deadline.Refinancing of the HELLA acquisition:Since July  Faurecia further reduced by €500 million the remaining part of the bridge-to-loan to be refinanced post-HELLA acquisition  through a €300 million loan from the European Investment Bank and a USD210 million loan from Latin America banks.Since the announcement of the HELLA acquisition (August 2021)  Faurecia prefinanced and refinanced more than €3 billion of debt at an average cost below 3.25%.As the expected closing of the divestment of its stake in HBPO by HELLA will reduce the Group’s consolidated financial net debt by €290 million  the bridge-to-loan left to be refinanced by August 2023 amounts now to €900 million  that will be refinanced through a mix of new debt instruments and proceeds from next steps in the disposal program underway.Management of energy prices:The Group’s operations are not highly energy-intensive: in 2021 (“reference year”)  the total Faurecia + HELLA energy bill (electricity c. 70% + gas c. 30%) amounted to c. €170m  representing only 0.7% of sales.Very efficient historical hedging policies are in place that largely protect the Group’s energy bill from the current sharp rise in electricity and gas prices.On top of these hedging policies  energy savings measures have already been implemented  and self-production is accelerating:Energy savings measures should represent c. 22% (exit 2023)  including weekend and night flexingSelf-production through solar panels (120 GWh installed) should represent an additional 7% (exit 2023)As a result of efficient hedging policies and self-help measures  the Group’s energy bill should grow by only 1.8x in 2023 vs. the 2021 “reference year”  while energy prices in Europe have increased more than 10x.UPDATED FY 2022 GUIDANCE (Faurecia incl. 11 months of consolidation of HELLA) WITH SALES TARGET UPGRADED TO BETWEEN €24.5bn AND €25.5bn AND OPERATING MARGIN AND NET CASH FLOW TARGETS CONFIRMEDAt this stage of the year  Faurecia is revising upward its assumption for worldwide automotive production in 2022 to 77 million LVs  vs. 74 million previously. This new assumption nevertheless remains cautious vs. S&P Global Mobility’ latest forecast of 79.0 million LVs (dated October 2022).Reflecting:this revised assumption of 77 million LVs produced worldwide in 2022 updated currency assumptions (notably USD/€ now at 1.05 on average in 2022  vs. 1.13 previously) the Group’s sales guidance is upgraded to between €24.5 billion and €25.5 billion (vs. between €23 billion and €24 billion  previously).Operating margin and net cash flow targets for the year are confirmed.FY 2022 guidance is now:Sales between €24.5 billion and €25.5 billion (vs. between €23bn and €24bn  previously) (vs. between €23bn and €24bn  previously)  Operating margin confirmed between 4% and 5% of sales Net cash flow confirmed at breakeven (includes building of a safety stock at year-end to secure supplies given energy shortage risks in Europe).In addition  the Group confirms targeting Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio ≤ 3x at the end of 2022.The guidance is based on full-year average currency rates of 1.05 for USD/€ and of 7.07 for CNY/€. It assumes no major lockdown impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region in Q4 and takes into account the Group’s latest update of net impact from cost inflation.SAVE THE DATESOn November 3  FORVIA will hold a Capital Markets Day close to ParisThe Capital Markets Day will include the Analysts Meeting of HELLA pursuant to sec. 55 of the Exchange Rules for the Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB).On November 4  FORVIA will hold a Sustainability Day close to ParisFaurecia and HELLA will present FORVIA’s Net Zero ambition  sustainability roadmap and action plan.Both events will take place at Dock Eiffel  50  avenue du Président Wilson  93210 Saint Denis (France).For further information  please contact: contact@cmd2022-forvia.com** *Faurecia's Q3 2022 sales presentation is also available on the Faurecia website: www.faurecia.comA webcast will be held today at 09:00am (Paris time).If you wish to follow the presentation using the webcast  please access the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/h2ppuyvqA replay will be available as soon as possible.

Sales growthFaurecia’s year-on-year sales evolution is made of three components:A “ Currency effect”   calculated by applying average currency rates for the period to the sales of the prior year   calculated by applying average currency rates for the period to the sales of the prior year  A “Scope effect” (acquisition/divestment) (acquisition/divestment)  And “Growth at constant currencies”.As “Scope effect”  Faurecia presents all acquisitions/divestments  whose sales on an annual basis amount to more than €250 million.Other acquisitions below this threshold are considered as “bolt-on acquisitions” and are included in “Growth at constant currencies”.In 2021  there was no effect from “bolt-on acquisitions”; as a result  “Growth at constant currencies” is equivalent to sales growth at constant scope and currencies also presented as organic growth.2. Operating incomeOperating income is the Faurecia group’s principal performance indicator. It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations;Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses;Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs;Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;Taxes.3. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).4. Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.5.

11967,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forge-global-holdings-inc-nyse-143034312.html,Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE) most popular amongst individual investors who own 46% of the shares  institutions hold 26%,To get a sense of who is truly in control of Forge Global Holdings  Inc. ( NYSE:FRGE )  it is important to understand...,To get a sense of who is truly in control of Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE)  it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 46% ownership. That is  the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Meanwhile  institutions make up 26% of the company’s shareholders. Generally speaking  as a company grows  institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely  insiders often decrease their ownership over time.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Forge Global Holdings.View our latest analysis for Forge Global HoldingsWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Forge Global Holdings?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see  institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Forge Global Holdings. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Forge Global Holdings' earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Forge Global Holdings. The company's largest shareholder is Deutsche Boerse AG  Asset Management Arm  with ownership of 14%. Motive Capital Management  LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 8.2% of common stock  and Paul Luc Heyvaert holds about 6.0% of the company stock. In addition  we found that Kelly Rodriques  the CEO has 3.3% of the shares allocated to their name.After doing some more digging  we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company  suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company  it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock  but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage.Insider Ownership Of Forge Global HoldingsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries  but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably  sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However  on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Forge Global Holdings  Inc.. Insiders own US$42m worth of shares in the US$273m company. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently.General Public OwnershipWith a 46% ownership  the general public  mostly comprising of individual investors  have some degree of sway over Forge Global Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour  they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Equity OwnershipWith an ownership of 13%  private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some investors might be encouraged by this  since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively  those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight  we need to consider other information  too. Consider for instance  the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Forge Global Holdings (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)   and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me  you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

11972,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547325-coca-cola-europacific-partners-trading-at-strong-fcf-yield,Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Trading At A 7.4% FCF Yield (NASDAQ:CCEP),Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has a monopoly to produce and distribute Coca-Cola products in most West European countries as well as Australia and New Zealand. Read more here.,"Jeff Schear/Getty Images EntertainmentIntroductionCoca-Cola Europacific Partners (NASDAQ:CCEP) has been one of my favorite Coca-Cola bottlers as this company has the monopoly to produce  market and distribute Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) products for several regions with a high GDP per capita (Western Europe  two of the three Scandinavian countries - except for Denmark - and Australia and New Zealand. While CCEP was originally solely focusing on European countries  the acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil in 2021 has expanded its footprint which added the latter two countries.Data by YChartsCCEP has a very liquid listing in the US and in the Netherlands where it's also trading with CCEP as its ticker symbol on Euronext Amsterdam. As CCEP reports its financial results in Euro  I will use the EUR as base currency throughout this article  and refer to the company's Amsterdam-listed shares where the average daily volume is almost 30 000 shares per day. If you're looking for liquidity  the US is vastly superior though as the average daily volume in the USA comes in at approximately 1.4 million shares per day. There currently are approximately 457M shares outstanding  resulting in a market capitalization of 21.7B EUR.For a better understanding of the business model  I'd like to refer you to an older article as this article is meant as an update to previous coverage.A good set of results in the first half of the yearQ1 is usually the weakest  but Coca-Cola Europacific Partners was still able to report a revenue of almost 8.3B EUR  resulting in a gross profit of 2.99B EUR. That's an excellent result as the gross profit increased by approximately 44% although the revenue increased by ""just"" 40%. The other operating expenses increased at a pace lower than 40% as well  and that's why the operating profit came in at 967M EUR  an increase of almost 86% compared to the first half of last year. While this is the first year the Amatil acquisition is contributing for an entire financial year  it's the margin expansion that caught my interest.CCEP Investor RelationsThe Amatil-acquisition was fully paid for in cash and that had a negative impact on the gross debt level  the net debt level and of course also on the interest expenses. Despite this  the pre-tax income almost doubled and the bottom line shows a net income of 675M EUR of which 667M EUR was attributable to the common shareholders of CCCEP. This represents an EPS of 1.46 EUR per share as the share count barely changed (standing at 457 million shares).All my previous articles zoomed in on the cash flow performance of CCEP to try to determine how appealing the company is  and it only makes sense to have a closer look at the H1 cash flow statement as well.The reported operating cash flow was 1.65B EUR  but this included a contribution of 456M EUR (compared to just 101M EUR in H1 2021). So excluding working capital changes  CCEP's operating cash flow increased to 1.2B EUR coming from 1.01B EUR. From the 1.2B EUR  we still need to deduct the 80M EUR in lease payments as well as the 98M EUR in interest payments so on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was 1.02B EUR (compared to 886M EUR in H1 2021).CCEP Investor RelationsThe total capex was exactly 200M EUR. Higher than in H1 2021 but that's normal ass CCEP's asset base has expanded. The adjusted free cash flow in the first half of 2022 (accounting for taxes and the profit and cash flow attributable to non-controlling interests) was roughly 755M EUR  for a FCFPS of 1.66 EUR. That's higher than the reported net income as the company recorded 386M EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses while the total capex + lease payments were just 280M EUR.The free cash flow result is pretty much in line with the 1.6B EUR in free cash flow guidance provided by CCEP. This represents 3.5 EUR per share and basically means the stock is trading at a free cash flow yield of in excess of 7%.The recent acquisition of the Australasian activities will help to reduce the seasonal impactAs explained in a previous article  2022 will be the first full year the Amatil division will contribute to the consolidated results of Coca-Cola Europacific partners. Although CCEP paid a rather hefty price for Amatil (in excess of 12 times EBITDA before synergy benefits as the initial offer was increased to get the deal across the finish line)  the combined entity is still working towards realizing the potential synergy benefits (although there's not a whole lot of synergies to be unlocked as there's very little overlap).The one important benefit for CCEP is seeing how the Amatil acquisition will smoothen out the seasonality. In Europe  the summer months are the most important period for the sale of Coca-Cola products and Q2 and Q3 are traditionally the strongest with Q4 and Q1 posting pretty weak results. The Amatil acquisition will be helpful as the fourth quarter of the calendar year is its seasonal peak which means it's now really only Q1 that's left as the ""weak"" quarter across all divisions.CCEP is continuing its 50% dividend policy which means that based on the consensus estimates of 3.30 EUR in EPS for this year  the dividend will be 1.65 EUR per share. As the free cash flow of 3.50 EUR will be higher than the reported EPS  CCEP will retain approximately 845M EUR in free cash flow on its balance sheet and that will help to reduce the net debt which in turn will mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on the market.CCEP Investor RelationsThe balance sheet currently contains 2.05B EUR in cash and short-term investments but about 12.6B EUR in gross debt for a net debt level of approximately 10.5B EUR. So although retaining 845M EUR In free cash flow sounds like a lot of money  it really represents just 5% of the net debt level. Fortunately CCEP's debt mainly consists of fixed-rate bonds and the maturity dates are very well spread out. This means the company could likely just repay the bonds as they come due with the 800M+ EUR per year in annual retained free cash flow. This also means CCEP should be very well shielded from increasing interest rates. Just to give you an idea of how important this is: the six year bonds in EUR (the 0.20% bonds maturing in December 2028 shown on the image below) currently have a YTM of approximately 4.5%.CCEP Investor RelationsInvestment thesisCoca-Cola Europacific Partners remains an attractively priced defensive pick. Thanks to the long-standing relationship with Coca-Cola and the robust free cash flow  the net debt isn't too worrisome  and over the next five years  CCEP will likely retain about 4.5-5B EUR in net free cash flow which will help to rapidly reduce the net debt.The commitment to pay out 50% of the earnings as dividends also is interesting. Not in the least because the consensus estimates are using a FY 2024 EPS of 3.89 EUR per share which should result in a dividend of 1.94 EUR per share for a yield of 4.1% based on the current dividend policy. The anticipated EV/EBITDA ratio using the year-end 2023 assumptions (3.1B EUR EBITDA and a net debt of 9.5B EUR) is just 10 which makes the stock very reasonably valued at this point.I was hoping the share price would drop a little bit further during the recent turmoil on the markets but that could very well be ""waiting for Godot"" and I think I may enter a new long position in the next few weeks.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.5,0.14,0.36,True,English,"['Coca-Cola Europacific Partners', '7.4% FCF Yield', 'NASDAQ', 'CCEP', 'free cash flow guidance', 'free cash flow yield', 'free cash flow result', 'H1 cash flow statement', 'cash flow performance', 'operating cash flow', 'Getty Images Entertainment', 'average daily volume', 'working capital changes', 'three Scandinavian countries', 'latter two countries', 'one important benefit', 'Coca-Cola Europacific Partners', 'favorite Coca-Cola bottlers', 'gross debt level', 'net debt level', 'other operating expenses', 'potential synergy benefits', 'entire financial year', 'first full year', 'CCEP Investor Relations', 'The Amatil acquisition', 'excellent result', 'European countries', 'operating profit', 'The Amatil-acquisition', 'important period', 'Coca-Cola Amatil', 'first year', 'net income', 'amortization expenses', 'financial results', 'first half', 'last year', 'calendar year', 'gross profit', 'Jeff Schear', 'NYSE:KO', 'several regions', 'high GDP', 'New Zealand', 'liquid listing', 'ticker symbol', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'base currency', 'market capitalization', 'business model', 'previous coverage', 'good set', 'margin expansion', 'negative impact', 'interest expenses', 'pre-tax income', 'common shareholders', 'previous articles', 'closer look', 'lease payments', 'total capex', 'asset base', 'non-controlling interests', 'recent acquisition', 'Australasian activities', 'seasonal impact', 'Amatil division', 'hefty price', 'initial offer', 'combined entity', 'little overlap', 'summer months', 'fourth quarter', 'seasonal peak', 'weak"" quarter', '50% dividend policy', 'Coca-Cola products', 'Amsterdam-listed shares', '1.4 million shares', '457M shares', '457 million shares', 'consolidated results', 'weak results', 'bottom line', '1.2B EUR', '80M EUR', '98M EUR', 'interest payments', '1.6B EUR', 'finish line', 'Western Europe', 'older article', '30,000 shares', '3.5 EUR', 'Introduction', 'NASDAQ', 'company', 'Denmark', 'Australia', 'footprint', 'Data', 'YCharts', 'Netherlands', 'day', 'liquidity', 'USA', '21.7B', 'understanding', 'update', 'Q1', 'revenue', '8.3B', '2.99B', 'pace', '967M', 'increase', 'course', '667M', 'CCCEP', 'EPS', 'sense', 'contribution', '101M', '1.01B', 'basis', '886M', 'taxes', 'FCFPS', '386M', 'depreciation', 'stock', 'excess', '12 times', 'EBITDA', 'deal', 'lot', 'synergies', 'seasonality', 'sale', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'divisions', '1.46', '1.66']",2022-10-22,2022-10-22,seekingalpha.com
