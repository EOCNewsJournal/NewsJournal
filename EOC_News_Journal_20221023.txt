11967,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forge-global-holdings-inc-nyse-143034312.html,Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE) most popular amongst individual investors who own 46% of the shares  institutions hold 26%,To get a sense of who is truly in control of Forge Global Holdings  Inc. ( NYSE:FRGE )  it is important to understand...,To get a sense of who is truly in control of Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE)  it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 46% ownership. That is  the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Meanwhile  institutions make up 26% of the company’s shareholders. Generally speaking  as a company grows  institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely  insiders often decrease their ownership over time.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Forge Global Holdings.View our latest analysis for Forge Global HoldingsWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Forge Global Holdings?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see  institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Forge Global Holdings. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Forge Global Holdings' earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Forge Global Holdings. The company's largest shareholder is Deutsche Boerse AG  Asset Management Arm  with ownership of 14%. Motive Capital Management  LLC is the second largest shareholder owning 8.2% of common stock  and Paul Luc Heyvaert holds about 6.0% of the company stock. In addition  we found that Kelly Rodriques  the CEO has 3.3% of the shares allocated to their name.After doing some more digging  we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company  suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company  it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock  but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage.Insider Ownership Of Forge Global HoldingsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries  but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably  sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However  on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Forge Global Holdings  Inc.. Insiders own US$42m worth of shares in the US$273m company. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently.General Public OwnershipWith a 46% ownership  the general public  mostly comprising of individual investors  have some degree of sway over Forge Global Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour  they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Equity OwnershipWith an ownership of 13%  private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some investors might be encouraged by this  since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively  those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight  we need to consider other information  too. Consider for instance  the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Forge Global Holdings (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)   and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me  you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

11972,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547325-coca-cola-europacific-partners-trading-at-strong-fcf-yield,Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Trading At A 7.4% FCF Yield (NASDAQ:CCEP),Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has a monopoly to produce and distribute Coca-Cola products in most West European countries as well as Australia and New Zealand. Read more here.,"Jeff Schear/Getty Images EntertainmentIntroductionCoca-Cola Europacific Partners (NASDAQ:CCEP) has been one of my favorite Coca-Cola bottlers as this company has the monopoly to produce  market and distribute Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) products for several regions with a high GDP per capita (Western Europe  two of the three Scandinavian countries - except for Denmark - and Australia and New Zealand. While CCEP was originally solely focusing on European countries  the acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil in 2021 has expanded its footprint which added the latter two countries.Data by YChartsCCEP has a very liquid listing in the US and in the Netherlands where it's also trading with CCEP as its ticker symbol on Euronext Amsterdam. As CCEP reports its financial results in Euro  I will use the EUR as base currency throughout this article  and refer to the company's Amsterdam-listed shares where the average daily volume is almost 30 000 shares per day. If you're looking for liquidity  the US is vastly superior though as the average daily volume in the USA comes in at approximately 1.4 million shares per day. There currently are approximately 457M shares outstanding  resulting in a market capitalization of 21.7B EUR.For a better understanding of the business model  I'd like to refer you to an older article as this article is meant as an update to previous coverage.A good set of results in the first half of the yearQ1 is usually the weakest  but Coca-Cola Europacific Partners was still able to report a revenue of almost 8.3B EUR  resulting in a gross profit of 2.99B EUR. That's an excellent result as the gross profit increased by approximately 44% although the revenue increased by ""just"" 40%. The other operating expenses increased at a pace lower than 40% as well  and that's why the operating profit came in at 967M EUR  an increase of almost 86% compared to the first half of last year. While this is the first year the Amatil acquisition is contributing for an entire financial year  it's the margin expansion that caught my interest.CCEP Investor RelationsThe Amatil-acquisition was fully paid for in cash and that had a negative impact on the gross debt level  the net debt level and of course also on the interest expenses. Despite this  the pre-tax income almost doubled and the bottom line shows a net income of 675M EUR of which 667M EUR was attributable to the common shareholders of CCCEP. This represents an EPS of 1.46 EUR per share as the share count barely changed (standing at 457 million shares).All my previous articles zoomed in on the cash flow performance of CCEP to try to determine how appealing the company is  and it only makes sense to have a closer look at the H1 cash flow statement as well.The reported operating cash flow was 1.65B EUR  but this included a contribution of 456M EUR (compared to just 101M EUR in H1 2021). So excluding working capital changes  CCEP's operating cash flow increased to 1.2B EUR coming from 1.01B EUR. From the 1.2B EUR  we still need to deduct the 80M EUR in lease payments as well as the 98M EUR in interest payments so on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was 1.02B EUR (compared to 886M EUR in H1 2021).CCEP Investor RelationsThe total capex was exactly 200M EUR. Higher than in H1 2021 but that's normal ass CCEP's asset base has expanded. The adjusted free cash flow in the first half of 2022 (accounting for taxes and the profit and cash flow attributable to non-controlling interests) was roughly 755M EUR  for a FCFPS of 1.66 EUR. That's higher than the reported net income as the company recorded 386M EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses while the total capex + lease payments were just 280M EUR.The free cash flow result is pretty much in line with the 1.6B EUR in free cash flow guidance provided by CCEP. This represents 3.5 EUR per share and basically means the stock is trading at a free cash flow yield of in excess of 7%.The recent acquisition of the Australasian activities will help to reduce the seasonal impactAs explained in a previous article  2022 will be the first full year the Amatil division will contribute to the consolidated results of Coca-Cola Europacific partners. Although CCEP paid a rather hefty price for Amatil (in excess of 12 times EBITDA before synergy benefits as the initial offer was increased to get the deal across the finish line)  the combined entity is still working towards realizing the potential synergy benefits (although there's not a whole lot of synergies to be unlocked as there's very little overlap).The one important benefit for CCEP is seeing how the Amatil acquisition will smoothen out the seasonality. In Europe  the summer months are the most important period for the sale of Coca-Cola products and Q2 and Q3 are traditionally the strongest with Q4 and Q1 posting pretty weak results. The Amatil acquisition will be helpful as the fourth quarter of the calendar year is its seasonal peak which means it's now really only Q1 that's left as the ""weak"" quarter across all divisions.CCEP is continuing its 50% dividend policy which means that based on the consensus estimates of 3.30 EUR in EPS for this year  the dividend will be 1.65 EUR per share. As the free cash flow of 3.50 EUR will be higher than the reported EPS  CCEP will retain approximately 845M EUR in free cash flow on its balance sheet and that will help to reduce the net debt which in turn will mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on the market.CCEP Investor RelationsThe balance sheet currently contains 2.05B EUR in cash and short-term investments but about 12.6B EUR in gross debt for a net debt level of approximately 10.5B EUR. So although retaining 845M EUR In free cash flow sounds like a lot of money  it really represents just 5% of the net debt level. Fortunately CCEP's debt mainly consists of fixed-rate bonds and the maturity dates are very well spread out. This means the company could likely just repay the bonds as they come due with the 800M+ EUR per year in annual retained free cash flow. This also means CCEP should be very well shielded from increasing interest rates. Just to give you an idea of how important this is: the six year bonds in EUR (the 0.20% bonds maturing in December 2028 shown on the image below) currently have a YTM of approximately 4.5%.CCEP Investor RelationsInvestment thesisCoca-Cola Europacific Partners remains an attractively priced defensive pick. Thanks to the long-standing relationship with Coca-Cola and the robust free cash flow  the net debt isn't too worrisome  and over the next five years  CCEP will likely retain about 4.5-5B EUR in net free cash flow which will help to rapidly reduce the net debt.The commitment to pay out 50% of the earnings as dividends also is interesting. Not in the least because the consensus estimates are using a FY 2024 EPS of 3.89 EUR per share which should result in a dividend of 1.94 EUR per share for a yield of 4.1% based on the current dividend policy. The anticipated EV/EBITDA ratio using the year-end 2023 assumptions (3.1B EUR EBITDA and a net debt of 9.5B EUR) is just 10 which makes the stock very reasonably valued at this point.I was hoping the share price would drop a little bit further during the recent turmoil on the markets but that could very well be ""waiting for Godot"" and I think I may enter a new long position in the next few weeks.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.5,0.14,0.36,True,English,"['Coca-Cola Europacific Partners', '7.4% FCF Yield', 'NASDAQ', 'CCEP', 'free cash flow guidance', 'free cash flow yield', 'free cash flow result', 'H1 cash flow statement', 'cash flow performance', 'operating cash flow', 'Getty Images Entertainment', 'average daily volume', 'working capital changes', 'three Scandinavian countries', 'latter two countries', 'one important benefit', 'Coca-Cola Europacific Partners', 'favorite Coca-Cola bottlers', 'gross debt level', 'net debt level', 'other operating expenses', 'potential synergy benefits', 'entire financial year', 'first full year', 'CCEP Investor Relations', 'The Amatil acquisition', 'excellent result', 'European countries', 'operating profit', 'The Amatil-acquisition', 'important period', 'Coca-Cola Amatil', 'first year', 'net income', 'amortization expenses', 'financial results', 'first half', 'last year', 'calendar year', 'gross profit', 'Jeff Schear', 'NYSE:KO', 'several regions', 'high GDP', 'New Zealand', 'liquid listing', 'ticker symbol', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'base currency', 'market capitalization', 'business model', 'previous coverage', 'good set', 'margin expansion', 'negative impact', 'interest expenses', 'pre-tax income', 'common shareholders', 'previous articles', 'closer look', 'lease payments', 'total capex', 'asset base', 'non-controlling interests', 'recent acquisition', 'Australasian activities', 'seasonal impact', 'Amatil division', 'hefty price', 'initial offer', 'combined entity', 'little overlap', 'summer months', 'fourth quarter', 'seasonal peak', 'weak"" quarter', '50% dividend policy', 'Coca-Cola products', 'Amsterdam-listed shares', '1.4 million shares', '457M shares', '457 million shares', 'consolidated results', 'weak results', 'bottom line', '1.2B EUR', '80M EUR', '98M EUR', 'interest payments', '1.6B EUR', 'finish line', 'Western Europe', 'older article', '30,000 shares', '3.5 EUR', 'Introduction', 'NASDAQ', 'company', 'Denmark', 'Australia', 'footprint', 'Data', 'YCharts', 'Netherlands', 'day', 'liquidity', 'USA', '21.7B', 'understanding', 'update', 'Q1', 'revenue', '8.3B', '2.99B', 'pace', '967M', 'increase', 'course', '667M', 'CCCEP', 'EPS', 'sense', 'contribution', '101M', '1.01B', 'basis', '886M', 'taxes', 'FCFPS', '386M', 'depreciation', 'stock', 'excess', '12 times', 'EBITDA', 'deal', 'lot', 'synergies', 'seasonality', 'sale', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'divisions', '1.46', '1.66']",2022-10-22,2022-10-23,seekingalpha.com
