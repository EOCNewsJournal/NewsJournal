11994,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4548563-eni-q3-expectations,Eni Stock: Q3 Earnings Expectations (NYSE:E),Plenitude (Eni's renewable arm) is accelerating inorganic growth and is looking at the PLT Energia dossier. Click here to read our analysis of E stock.,bymuratdenizBefore going deeper into the Q3 expectations  it is important to report the latest company development. Plenitude  Eni's (NYSE:E) subsidiary active in renewable energy generation  which is planning for IPO in 2023  is also aiming for inorganic growth. According to rumors  Eni is in advance negotiation with PLT Energia  an old acquaintance of Euronext (the Italian stock exchange)  where it was delisted three years ago. PLT Energia's installed capacity is close to 300 megawatts of wind farms in operation  with a planned capacity expansion in Italy and also in Spain.The company is not only strengthening its renewable energy perimeter but is also announced the acquisition of two more gas fields in North Africa. This new acquisition has a strong rationale and further offsets the Russian gas European dependency. This transaction is subject to regulators' approval; however  since 1981  Eni has been present in Algeria and we are forecasting an easy green light from the competent authorities.Why are we positive?Macroeconomic environment deterioration is disrupting two years of strong positive earnings revisions within the sector. Despite this  here at the Lab  we remain constructive for three reasons: 1) strong balance sheets as European oils have taken advantage of strong cash generation to strengthen their balance sheet  2) resilient cash flows and capital discipline - we think the oil industry will continue to generate a 15% free cash flow in 2023 and 3) under-investment with lack of supply  assuming a structural decline in production in most non-OPEC countries and several OPEC countries.Eni's business is becoming increasingly high-yielding  driven by the successes of the exploration team  divestments  and a strong pipeline of start-up projects. Its variable dividend policy complemented by share buybacks is attractive to shareholders and offers an estimated return of around 13.5% in total in 2022.As already mentioned  concerning the valuation  we know that the Italian oil player is undervalued versus its closest EU comps. This is not a new piece of news  it has always been. More specifics  the company has a higher dividend yield and is currently trading at a lower EV/EBITDA  FCF yield  and P/E ratio.Our Q3 estimates and conclusionAhead of the three months accounts plan to report on the 28th of October  we have great expectations for Eni. We are forecasting an adj. EBIT at almost $4.9 billion compared to the $2.49 billion achieved in the same period last year. As for adj. net profit  our expectations set the numbers at $3.2 billion  more than twice versus the corresponding period of 2021. Growth will be driven by the best scenario for the oil price environment (Brent is up 36%)  higher refining margins  and dollar strengthening. Looking at the P&L  we are including in our calculation a higher tax rate (including the extraordinary taxes of $340 million for the oil companies)  $2.3 billion in CAPEX  the interim dividend payment of €0.22  buyback program (€1.5 billion) and the Saipem capital increase (€170 million). On a sequential basis  here at the Lab  we are reducing the peak reached in the second quarter of 2022 but we still expect strong growth on an annual basis in Eni's main financial indicators. Finally  the net financial position should be around €11.5 billion.Looking at the latest company disclosure on the buyback  Eni repurchased a total value of €147 million between the 10-14 of October. Since the start of the program  the company has bought nearly 130 million of its own shares (equal to 3.66% of its share capital)  for a total amount of approximately €1.5 billion. We have always been pessimistic about Eni but it is now time to revert our sentiment. One of the greatest Eni advantages has always been its Exploration teams and this imbalance between oil demand & supply could be a key catalyst for the Italian oil player. Despite a discount in Eni's dividend policy (and a country risk already priced in  the Italian Government is the principal company's shareholder)  Eni is trading at a P/E multiple of 3x versus the sector average of 7x. For the above reason  we increased our rating from neutral to buy with a target price of €16 per share.More News To Be Priced InSource: Mare Evidence Lab's previous publication,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,mixed,0.44,0.08,0.49,True,English,"['Q3 Earnings Expectations', 'Eni Stock', 'strong positive earnings revisions', 'Russian gas European dependency', 'renewable energy generation', 'renewable energy perimeter', 'easy green light', 'Macroeconomic environment deterioration', 'resilient cash flows', '15% free cash flow', 'closest EU comps', 'higher refining margins', 'higher tax rate', 'interim dividend payment', 'main financial indicators', 'net financial position', 'Italian stock exchange', 'strong cash generation', 'higher dividend yield', 'three months accounts', 'adj. net profit', 'Saipem capital increase', 'Italian oil player', 'strong balance sheets', 'several OPEC countries', 'variable dividend policy', 'oil price environment', 'latest company development', 'latest company disclosure', 'Mare Evidence Lab', 'greatest Eni advantages', 'gas fields', 'European oils', 'Italian Government', 'strong rationale', 'strong pipeline', 'three reasons', 'oil industry', 'FCF yield', 'adj.

Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings  is.now scheduled for 2023.FY 2023-24 targetsNACON Gaming anticipates a strong growth driven both by sales of games to be released at the end of FY 2022-23 which will thus feed the back catalogue  and by a qualitative and varied publishing output. This development of the back catalogue will automatically accelerate growth and have a positive impact on operating profitability.Banking on a growth expected to be sustained for NACON Gaming and on the BIGBEN Audiovideo/Telco business expected to remain buoyant in FY 2023-24  the Group expects a strong growth as from the next financial year and reaffirms its confidence in its medium-term prospects.Upcoming events:Half-year results 2022-2023Monday 28 November 2022 : Press release after close of the Paris stock exchangeTuesday 29 November 2022 : SFAF MeetingSALES 2021-22275.7 M€HEADCOUNTOver 1200 employeesINTERNATIONAL31 subsidiaries and a distribution networkin more than 100 countrieswww.bigben-group.comBigben Interactive is a European player in video game development and publishing  in design and distribution of smartphone and gaming accessories as well as in audio products.

Novozymes obtained proof of concept for a new manufacturing process that offers potential significant cost of goods and scaling advantages  thereby broadening the commercial potential of Evoca as a novel biofungicide.“Thanks to its leading protein fermentation expertise  Novozymes has been able to further increase the efficiency of production for Evoca ” said Patrice Sellès  the CEO of Biotalys. “We will now work on a deeper partnership with Novozymes and explore strategic supply and commercialization agreements for the future generation of Evoca while continuing our ongoing internal development activities.”Evoca is Biotalys’ first innovative protein-based biofungicide developed on the company’s AGROBODY Foundry™ platform. This technology platform allows Biotalys to discover and develop novel biological food protection solutions that combine high efficacy  consistency and safety  with new modes of action to fight resistance. Evoca helps sustainably control economically important fungal diseases such as Botrytis and powdery mildew in fruits and vegetables. Demonstrating strong performance across more than 600 independent and company-driven field and greenhouse trials across multiple regions  pathogens and crops  Evoca is expected to obtain approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in early 2023.Since entering into a partnership in June 2022  Novozymes has explored additional routes for the upscaling and production of the bioactive protein of Evoca by using production hosts additional to those currently used by Biotalys. Novozymes uncovered new ways to scale production and efficiency that could help Biotalys drive broader commercial reach for Evoca  both in the preliminary U.S. and E.U. fruits and vegetables markets currently in the commercialization plan  as well as in additional geographies  crops and diseases. Subject to confirmation of commercial scale-up  field trial performance and regulatory procedures  these results may help reduce time to a commercially attractive version of Evoca.“The results of this feasibility study with Biotalys will help pave the way for more cost-efficient  sustainable solutions for growers around the world ” noted Thomas Batchelor  Vice President  Agriculture Marketing and Strategy of Novozymes. “Now one step closer to large-scale production  Biotalys and Novozymes have successfully collaborated to provide the industry and growers new ways to safely control damaging pests and diseases and deliver our shared goal of providing highly effective solutions so growers can sustainably feed the world.”Successfully achieving this key milestone  the two companies are now entering into the next phase of their partnership and will explore strategic supply and commercialization agreements for the future generation of Evoca. Novozymes and Biotalys will also explore an R&D collaboration beyond Evoca to address the needs for effective and more sustainable protein-based biocontrols in novel markets and indications through both Novozymes’ solution portfolio and Biotalys’s pipeline of product candidates.* Evoca™: Pending Registration.

As in previous years  the Group is forecasting a stronger level of business in the fourth quarter.Consolidated revenues (unaudited)Revenues (€m) 2022 2021 Reported change Change at constant exchange rates First quarter 38.0 33.8 +12% +11% Second quarter 46.0 41.7 +10% +7% Third quarter 40.9 37.2 +10% +7% Nine months 124.9 112.6 +11% +8% of which Photonics 58.2 52.7 +11% +8% Medical 66.7 60.0 +11% +9%The LUMIBIRD Group’s consolidated revenues came to €124.9m at September 30  2022  up 8% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates. Due to the strong increase in the dollar over the period  revenue growth based on reported data rose to 11% for the first nine months of the year.Over nine months  the Photonics and Medical divisions both progressed at the same rate  with the third quarter seeing slightly quicker business growth for the Medical division (+11% to €21.3m) than Photonics (+9% to €19.6m).The increase in revenues for the Photonics division is linked to the third-quarter growth (+8% to €9.0m) for the Industrial and Scientific business (+4% over nine months to €26.3m)  while the Lidar business was stable in the third quarter (+2% to €5.4m) following a very strong second quarter (+29% over nine months to €16.4m)  and the third quarter’s growth (+18% to €5.2m) for the Defense / Space business (+6% over nine months to €15.4m). The integration of the Defense Rangefinder business (previously Saab) into Lumibird Photonics Sweden contributed €0.9m to revenues in the third quarter  with €1.2m since it was integrated at the end of May 2022.The Defense / Space business (with the phasing of contracts and the integration of Sweden) and the Lidar business will strongly support the Photonics division’s robust development in the fourth quarter of 2022.The Medical division is continuing to benefit from an acceleration in its sales across all the geographies. The strengthening of the sales and marketing teams  the extension of the product range to include buoyant markets  thanks in particular to the launch of CSTIM for dry eye treatment  and the achievement of several certifications and registrations support this positive trend.As each year at the same period  based on the order book and delivery schedule  fourth-quarter revenues are expected to be significantly higher than the previous three quarters.

12018,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/leaders-in-trading-2022-meet-the-nominees-for-outstanding-equities-trading-venue/,Leaders in Trading 2022: Meet the nominees for…. Outstanding Equities Trading Venue,Learn more about the five firms shortlisted for our Editors’ Choice Award for Outstanding Equities Trading Venue this year: including Aquis Exchange  Cboe Europe  Euronext  Nasdaq European Markets and Turquoise.,The TRADE is delighted to introduce the illustrious shortlist for one of the biggest awards of our Editors’ Choice range: the closely fought category of Outstanding Equities Trading Venue. In a competitive and crowded landscape  numerous players stand out and this year it was particularly hard to whittle down the longlist. The nominated venues have all stood out over the past year for their innovative approach and outstanding performance: read on to learn more about Aquis Exchange  Cboe Europe  Euronext  Nasdaq European Markets and Turquoise.Aquis ExchangeAquis has seen a year of strong growth  both on its lit platform and with its entry into the dark pool space  following on a promising 2021 performance – last year net revenue reached £16.2 million  representing a growth of 42% on the year prior.In April 2022  Aquis Exchange assumed the dark pool activities of UBS MTF  with the service now known as Aquis Matching Pool (AMP). Since then  the exchange has been focused on migrating AMP onto its in-house technology  with the migration concluding in September.The exchange has also enhanced its Auction on Demand (AoD) service on both the UK and EU platforms. AoD now supports mid-pegged orders  offers a choice of Day orders or ‘Good for Auction’  and allows members to specify a Minimum Acceptable Quantity.Meanwhile  the Market at Close (MaC) order type grew in market share  from constituting 3.4% of European closing auctions in July 2021 to 5.8% in July 2022.It has also grown its membership base  with new members such as Optiver and others joining; while in May this year it entered into a collaboration with BMLL to provide insights into market structure dynamics. Through the collaboration and use of BMLL’s Level 3 Data and analytics  Aquis is now able to monitor and evidence liquidity dynamics  and offer its members third-party  independent verification of passive liquidity’s availability on its own venues compared to other European exchange.Cboe EuropeThe past 12 months have been a landmark period for Cboe Europe. In equities  it became Europe’s largest stock exchange by market share in April 2022 for the first time since January 2019  and has been the largest stock exchange by market share every month since June 2022  with an overall European equities market share of 24.7% in July 2022 – its highest share since January 2016.EuroCCP  Cboe’s wholly owned pan-European clearing house  provides clearing services for CEDX. Beyond its diversification into equity derivatives clearing  EuroCCP has also demonstrated solid performance in cash equities  where it remains the most-connected CCP in Europe  offering equities clearing services to 47 trading venues. It has seen strong gains in preferred clearing  with over 14% of total cash equity volumes on Euronext’s exchanges in Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon and Paris cleared via EuroCCP through this model as of 30 June  up from 2% at the start of the year.Cboe Europe also deserves a mention for its thought-leadership role  supporting and advocating (often vocally) within the industry on a wide range of issues. It recently collaborated with trade associations on a statement of principles for establishing an EU equity consolidated tape  for example  an issue on which its supportive position is well-known.The exchange is also working to make pan-European market data more accessible. For example  making its own data available via the cloud  which means lower infrastructure costs for those consuming it. Other key developments throughout the year include the appointment of Nick Dutton  Cboe Europe’s Chief Regulatory Officer  to the FCA’s Secondary Markets Advisory Committee and the group’s membership of the Sustainable Trading initiative in May.EuronextThe biggest pan-European exchange  connecting seven markets across the continent  Euronext had a strong year over 2021-22 with surging trading volumes and a series of successful acquisitions.The group saw its trading revenue swell to €465.3 million in 2021  driven by its completed acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) in April. In its fourth quarter and full year results  the exchange operator confirmed a 27% growth of trading revenues  alongside yield management in cash trading offsetting lower volumes compared with 2020. Fixed income trading revenue also increased to €65.8 million driven by a 45% growth year-on-year in its MTS cash trading activities.The strong performance has continued – trading revenues more than doubled in the first quarter  despite the adverse geopolitical conditions  while the second quarter saw trading revenues jump a further 15% with robust performance across all asset classes.In June this year  Euronext also entered into an agreement with Nexi for the acquisition of the former’s technology businesses  which currently powers Euronext’s fixed-income trading platform MTS and Euronext Securities Milan. Thanks to the acquisition of Borsa Italiana Group  Euronext now also operates its own clearing house  Euronext Clearing (ex. CC&G)  that is planned to provide clearing services for all its markets starting from 2024  and added a fourth CSD (ex. Monte Titoli) to its network of CSDs  Euronext Securities  in a further move to leverage its integrated value chain.Nasdaq European MarketsNasdaq’s European Markets delivered a record year in 2021  solidifying Nasdaq’s position as a leading European listings hub with 219 new equity listings  including a record number of 174 IPOs  raising a total of €13.5 billion. Nasdaq has kept this position into 2022  and even strengthened it as its Swedish Growth Market First North overtook AIM as Europe’s hottest market for growth stocks with a strong participation by retail investors. A contributing factor to the success of the Nordic exchanges is Nasdaq´s ability to attract small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to go public on its First North markets  which enables them to grow and perform better and eventually transfer to one of the Main Markets (as around 95% of its listed growth companies do).On the trading side  building on the strong momentum of 2020  Nasdaq saw trading volumes hit all-time highs  with equity trading increasing 7.1% to a daily average of just under €4 billion across all markets in 2021. Throughout the turbulence of the pandemic  increasing geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine  Nasdaq has maintained a market share of 77% of lit and auction trading in its listed shares  while continuing to reinforce its leadership in the Nordic derivatives market  including Norway  where Nasdaq has achieved a 76% market share in single stock options and +50% on index options.Throughout 2021  Nasdaq launched a number of products and services to further support the trading community: including options on the OMXS30 ESG index  the world’s first Carbon Removal price Index with Puro.Earth  and Nasdaq Derivatives Academy  a free educational course aimed at retail investors keen in learning more about derivatives trading. Additionally  Nasdaq has entered numerous strategic partnerships – one of which is creating an exchange system simulation service based on Sequitor technology  enabling the trading community to back-test and optimise their systems in terms of both risk and performance in private sessions.TurquoiseTurquoise and its EU venue  Turquoise Europe  complement London’s primary markets with multiple additional execution channels and liquidity  offering a broad universe of more than 4 100 securities with access to enter prices and trade securities of 19 major European and emerging markets as well as US stocks  IOB Depositary Receipts  ETFs and European Rights Issues  through one interface to its LSEG data centre and membership.Turquoise Plato participants have traded more than €1.3 trillion of equities since its launch and continue to set new records. Average daily value traded in the first half of this year through Turquoise Plato neared €1.2 billion  and saw a record trade size of €27 million in December 2021 on Turquoise Plato Block Discovery.Turquoise has spear-headed in a number of innovations this year  together with its customersits customers. Turquoise CDS Plus was launched in partnership with Simudyne  with the aim to be a one-stop shop for next generation high fidelity market simulation and algo testing. For the first time  clients can perform fully interactive testing as if it were on the live market  focusing on robust and repeatable performance testing rather than backdated conformance testing. CDS Plus uses the previous day’s tick data from Turquoise  enriched with stylised facts  making use of next generation Agent Based models which can be used to improve algorithm development  testing and benchmarking.Turquoise is also collaborating with M-DAQ  a leading global FX specialist  on a new service for investors who  through their brokers  will be able to execute cross-currency securities transactions and settle in their currency of choice (subject to regulatory approval). M-DAQ will contribute its patented product Trading the Right Chart (TRC). This complements well the capabilities of Turquoise  removing the need for multilateral relationships and reduces FX operational risk faced by brokers  delivering further efficiencies to equity capital markets and better outcomes for end investors.Appital  the equity capital markets technology solution  and Turquoise have also launched Appital Turquoise BookBuilder. This is the first buyside to buyside bookbuilding platform to give institutional investors the opportunity to proactively source liquidity. By bringing a historically highly manual and opaque process into an automated  electronic platform  they gain control over the entire bookbuilding process. Buyside firms benefit from liquidity discovery and price formation opportunities for illiquid equity positions  as well as the ability to execute large volumes on the regulated Turquoise MTF  often in multiple days’ ADV  with minimal market impact or risk of price erosion. Turquoise also became the first venue to connect to OpenFin in September 2021  offering a direct data feed to the buy-side via its operating system.Recently  Turquoise expanded its service with a newly enlarged US segment  which will allow global investors to trade in a greater number of US stocks through one connection  alongside UK  Swiss and European securities. The new offering improves access for investors in Asia and other geographies around the globe. In August 2022  Turquoise also received Recognised Market Operator status from the Monetary Authority of Singapore  enabling firms located in Singapore to apply for TGHL membership and access TGHL trading service.The winner will be announced at the Leaders in Trading 2022 gala awards dinner at The Savoy Hotel on 3 November.
