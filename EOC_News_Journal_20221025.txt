Amendments to the instructionThe nomination committee shall evaluate this instruction and the work of the nomination committee on an ongoing basis and  when necessary  present a proposal to the annual general meeting for changes to this instruction that the nomination committee has deemed appropriate.Item 16 - Resolution on adoption of the remuneration reportThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting adopt the board of directors' report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).Item 17 - Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive program in the form of an issue of warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to issue not more than 1 262 500 warrants  within the scope of an incentive program for senior executives  other key individuals and employees within the AcadeMedia group in accordance with the following.In total  the incentive program will encompass not more than 124 individuals. The incentive program entails that senior executives  other key individuals and employees within the AcadeMedia group  which have entered into a right of first refusal agreement with the company  are offered to acquire warrants at market value according to the Black-Scholes valuation model.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the company at an exercise price equal to 110 per cent of the volume-weighted average price of the company's share during the period of five trading days falling immediately before the offer for subscription of the warrants (the ""Offer day"")  however as a minimum the quota value of the share. If  at the time of the subscription  the last paid price on Nasdaq Stockholm for the company's shares on the closing of the stock exchange on the trading day preceding the subscription of the new shares exceeds 200 per cent of the volume-weighted average price for the company's share during the period of five trading days falling immediately before the Offer day  the exercise price shall be increased with an amount corresponding to an amount of the paid price which exceeds 200 per cent of the mentioned average price. In accordance with customary conditions  the number of shares that each warrant entitles to will be recalculated should the company resolve on a share split  consolidation of shares  issue  etc.The warrant holder shall have the right  upon subscription of shares with the exercise of the warrants  to request the application of an alternative exercise model in accordance with the full terms and conditions. When applying the alternative subscription model  the subscription price for each share shall be equal to the quota value of the share and the warrants shall entitle the holder to a recalculated number of shares  which  as a starting point  shall be lower. However  the warrants shall not entitle the holder to more than one (1) share per warrant  subject to any recalculation in accordance with the full terms and conditions of the warrants. Assuming that the subscription price for the shares in the company for which warrants entitle to subscription is set at SEK 55  application of the alternative exercise model would have the following effects in the event of full new subscription on the basis of all 1 262 500 warrants and full exercise of the alternative exercise model at the share prices for the company's shares prior to the subscription period indicated below:Share price Total dilution Total number of new sharesSEK 60 0.10 per cent 106 992SEK 70 0.26 per cent 274 457SEK 80 0.38 per cent 399 525SEK 90 0.47 per cent 496 489Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in AcadeMedia AB (publ) during two periods  during two weeks from the day after publication of the interim report for the period 1 July 2025 - 31 December 2025 as well as during two weeks from the day after publication of the interim report for the period 1 July 2025 - 31 March 2026. Should the above mentioned subscription periods not be applicable  each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in AcadeMedia AB (publ) during the period 1 March - 15 March 2026 as well as the period 1 June - 15 June 2026.The price per warrant shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  as soon as possible after the average price as referred to above has been established  and correspond to the market value of the warrant calculated in accordance with the Black-Scholes valuation model. The full terms and conditions for the warrants have been resolved by the board of directors and are available to the shareholders for inspection in accordance with the below. The exercise price and number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscribe for may be subject to adjustments as set forth in section 8 of the terms and conditions of the warrants.Subscription of warrants shall take place from the time the price per warrant is established in accordance with the above  however no later than 16 February 2023. Payment shall be made in cash no later than 28 February 2023. However  the board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period and the payment period  respectively.The company will partially subsidize the participants' acquisition of warrants. The total subsidy shall  before any payroll tax for the participant  correspond to half of the participant's investment. The subsidy is paid in half in February 2025 and in half in February 2026. Thus  for an investment of SEK 100  a total gross amount of SEK 50 will be paid out  which however will be subject to any applicable payroll taxation. Participants' entitlement to a subsidy presupposes that at the time of payment of the respective part of the subsidy  the participant has not been dismissed  terminated its employment or otherwise announced the termination of his or her employment.The company shall  in connection with the allocation of the warrants to the participants in the program  and with certain exceptions  reserve a pre-emption right regarding the warrants if the participant's employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer its warrants prior to the warrants being exercisable.Allocation of warrantsNot more than 124 senior executives  other key individuals and employees in the AcadeMedia group shall  provided that they have entered into a pre-emption agreement with AcadeMedia AB (publ)  be entitled to subscribe for warrants up to the maximum number of warrants as set out in the allocation below.TOP Number2022/2026 ofwarrantsPosition Maximum Minimum Guaranteed Maximumnumber number of number of number ofof warrants warrants to warrantspersons to be be to besubscribed subscribed subscribedper person per person per personCEO and 9 0 37 500 75 000members ofthe groupmanagementMembers of a 35 0 15 000 30 000segmentmanagementgroup andwho are notmembers ofthe groupmanagementand membersof amanagementgroup foroperationsin Norwayand GermanyrespectivelyOther 80 0 5 000 10 000participantsIn total 124 0 1 262 500 1 262 500Each participant may subscribe for its guaranteed number of warrants as set out in the allocation above. Each participant can apply for over-allotment of the corresponding 200 per cent of the participant's guaranteed number of warrants to be subscribed  which constitutes each participant's maximum number of warrants to be subscribed. Over-allotment of warrants is first made to the CEO and is then distributed pro rata based on subscription between the participants downwards in the categories.Board members shall not be eligible to participate in the incentive program.Effects on important key ratios and dilutionWith an allotment of the maximum number of warrants to be subscribed and full new subscription based on all warrants  1 262 500 new ordinary shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.20 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  subject to any recalculation according to the warrant terms. The program thus gives employees the opportunity to increase their ownership in the company by the corresponding figure in the event that the alternative subscription model is not applied in whole or in part. As set out in the table in this proposal  the alternative exercise model entails more limited dilution effects  the extent being dependent on the share price at the end of the program and the number of warrants exercised under that model. Considering shares that can be issued in accordance with previously implemented incentive programs in the form of share matching program (2021/2025)  warrant program (2021/2025) and convertible program (2019/2023) in the company and in accordance with this proposal  the dilution effect is approximately 1.94 per cent.The company's profits per share is not affected by the introduction of the incentive program since the current value of exercise price is greater than the current market value of the company's share at the time of issuance.CostsThe total cost for the company for the incentive program is limited and is estimated not to exceed SEK 300 000 during the term of the program. The warrants will be transferred at market value and  therefore  no social security contributions are to be paid by the group in relation to the issue of the warrants.The warrant program will incur costs for the subsidy to which the participants are entitled and for any social security contributions for foreign participants upon exercise of the warrants. The total cost of the subsidy  based on a warrant value of SEK 5.31 and a subsidy before payroll tax of 50 per cent and social security contributions for foreign participants  is estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 5.2 million for the entire term of the warrant program  including social security contributions if all participants remain in the incentive program and the share price reaches the capped level. The warrant value has been estimated based on Black-Scholes' valuation model  assuming a share price of SEK 50  a risk-free interest rate of 2.29 per cent and a volatility of 28 per cent.The rationale for the incentive programThe rationale for the incentive program is to create opportunities to motivate and retain competent employees in the AcadeMedia group as well as to increase the motivation of meeting and exceeding the company's financial targets. The incentive program has been established as it is deemed desirable for senior executives  other key individuals and employees within the AcadeMedia group to be shareholders of the company. The board of directors considers that the adoption of the incentive program as described above is in the favour of the group and the shareholders in the company.Preparation of the proposalIn accordance with guidelines provided by the board of directors  the incentive program has been prepared by the company's management team in consultation with external advisors. In addition  the proposal has been prepared by the board of directors' remuneration committee and has been reviewed at meetings of the board of directors in September and October 2022.For a description of the company's other long-term incentive programs  please see AcadeMedia's annual report for 2021/2022  page 75 and note G5.Item 18 - Resolution on the proposal from the shareholder PRI PensionsgarantiPRI Pensionsgaranti  shareholder of Academedia  proposes that the board of directors is authorised to resolve on repurchase of own shares up to 10% of the share capital. PRI Pensionsgaranti proposes that the board of directors be authorised to repurchase own shares  as it is a good way of optimising the capital structure of the company on an ongoing basis.It is proposed that the board of directors be authorised  for the period until the annual general meeting 2023  to acquire  on such number of occasions as it deems appropriate  a maximum number of the company's shares so that the company's holdings at any time does not exceed 10% of all shares in the company. Acquisitions shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price per share within the price interval at the time of the acquisition. The purpose of the authorisation is to enable the board of directors to adjust the capital structure of the company until the next annual general meeting  after which PRI Pensionsgaranti intends to propose that the annual general meeting 2023 resolves on cancellation of the shares repurchased by the company. In addition  PRI Pensionsgaranti intends to submit a proposal to the same annual general meeting regarding a corresponding bonus issue in order to restore the reduced share capital.Item 19 - Resolution on authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on issues of ordinary sharesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorises the board to resolve  at one or several occasions and for the time period until the end of the next annual general meeting  to increase the company's share capital by new issues of ordinary shares  to the extent that it corresponds to a dilution of not more than 5 percent of the number of shares outstanding at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorisation  after full exercise of the proposed authorisation.New issues of ordinary shares may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The purpose of the authorisation is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the acting scope of the board. Should the board resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this must be to provide the company with new owners of strategic importance or in connection with acquisition agreements  or  alternatively  to raise capital for such acquisitions. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions. This authorisation to issue new shares may not be used for incentive programs in the company.The CEO is authorised to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the authorisation.____________________Majority requirementsResolutions in accordance with item 17 above require approval of at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.

GTT announces that it has received two Approvals in Principle (AiP) for its innovative three-tank LNG tanker design ,"GTTGTT unveils its innovative three-tank LNG carrier concept with two Approvals in PrincipleParis – October 25th  2022. GTT announces that it has received two Approvals in Principle (AiP) for its innovative three-tank LNG tanker design  from DNV and Bureau Veritas (BV). This cutting-edge technological solution is aimed at increasing the profitability and overall performance of the vessel.This three-tank LNG carrier concept permits a reduction in construction costs through the suppression of one cofferdam  one pump tower and all associated cryogenic equipment (liquid and gas domes  valves  piping  radars  etc.). The overall surface area of the containment system will also be reduced by about 2 000 m²  generating lower costs for the materials and vessel construction.At the same time  the improved ratio between the volume of LNG transported and the surface area of the cryogenic liner will make it possible to reduce the daily boil-off rate. As an example  GTT estimates that it will achieve a boil-off rate as low as 0.080% of tank volume per day with the Mark III Flex technology  compared to 0.085% of the volume per day with the LNG carriers currently in operation.This new design could also offer time-savings for shipyards and optimise their construction schedule.DNV and BV have issued an approval in principle for this innovative three-tank LNG carrier design for the Mark III and NO96 technologies developed by GTT.Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: ""For almost 60 years  the GTT Group has been constantly improving its technologies to offer its customers solutions that meet their requirements as well as those of the regulatory authorities. Thirty years ago  we upgraded LNG carriers from five to four tanks and we now hope to bring the market forward with a three-tank LNG carrier. We hope to see this concept become standard in future years.""Jean-Baptiste Boutillier  VP Development  Innovation and Technical Strategy at GTT  said: ""We are honored by the granting of these two approvals in principle for the design of the three-tank LNG carrier. We are convinced that this evolution will benefit all stakeholders by improving the performance of the LNG carrier while reducing its carbon footprint.""Story continuesAbout GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases. For over 50 years  GTT has been designing and providing cutting-edge technologies for a better energy performance  which combine operational efficiency and safety  to equip LNG carriers  floating terminals  land storage  and multi-gas carriers.

The original advisory committee meeting was scheduled for 31 October 2022. The FDA informed Ipsen that the postponement relates to an FDA request for new information on palovarotene clinical trial data and does not relate to the safety profile of palovarotene. The company is currently working to fulfil the request. We will work expediently with the FDA as we remain committed to bringing innovative treatment options to the Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva community.ENDSAbout IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen’s Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comStory continuesView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221025005735/en/ContactsFor further information:InvestorsCraig MarksVice President  Investor Relations+44 (0)7584 349 193Adrien Dupin de Saint-CyrInvestor Relations Manager+33 6 64 26 17 49MediaAnna GibbinsGlobal Head of Franchise Communications  Rare Disease+44 7717801900Rachel ReiffU.S. Head of Franchise Communications+1 908 616 1680,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.05,0.07,0.88,True,English,"['Palovarotene FDA Advisory Committee Meeting', 'Ipsen Statement', 'Updated Timeline', 'Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program', 'Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting', 'original advisory committee meeting', 'Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva community', 'currency exchange rate fluctuations', 'global, mid-sized biopharmaceutical company', 'palovarotene clinical trial data', 'Specialty Care sales', 'general economic factors', 'pharmaceutical industry regulation', 'differentiated technological platforms', 'reasonable macroeconomic conditions', 'general industry conditions', 'healthcare cost containment', 'early development phase', 'potential future acquisitions', 'innovative treatment options', 'necessary regulatory approvals', 'external growth assumptions', 'U.S. Food', 'future market conditions', 'interest rate', 'global trends', 'clinical trials', 'healthcare legislation', 'technological advances', 'investigational palovarotene', 'historical data', 'U.K.', 'development process', 'new-medicine development', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'international media', 'investor audiences', 'Drug Administration', 'later date', 'safety profile', 'Rare Disease', 'external-innovation strategy', 'leading biotechnological', 'life-science hubs', 'Forward-Looking Statements', 'management strategy', 'current views', 'Such statements', 'similar expressions', 'regulatory filings', 'market share', 'several stages', 'substantial risk', 'significant sums', 'effective nature', 'manufacturing difficulties', 'financial instability', 'international economies', 'sovereign risk', 'other protections', 'regulatory actions', 'third parties', 'actual results', 'favorable results', 'development efforts', 'underlying assumptions', 'future ability', 'future events', 'The FDA', 'transformative medicines', 'innovative medicines', 'patent litigation', 'promising medicine', 'generic medicine', 'new medicine', 'unknown risks', 'Other risks', 'new information', 'financial targets', 'commercial targets', 'competition reasons', 'FDA request', 'PARIS', 'October', 'Disclaimer', 'Ipsen', 'Euronext', 'IPN', 'ADR', 'IPSEY', 'decision', 'Endocrinologic', 'postponement', 'Oncology', 'Neuroscience', 'FY', '100 countries', 'research', 'heart', 'France', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'Shanghai', 'China', '5,000 colleagues', 'objectives', 'uncertainties', 'performance', 'Use', 'words', 'expects', 'expectations', 'determinations', 'document', 'account', 'parameters', 'facts', 'loss', 'regards', 'guarantees', 'impact', 'patents', 'competitors', 'challenges', 'delays', 'dependence', 'effectiveness', 'exposure']",2022-10-25,2022-10-25,yahoo.com

The new orders increased by 1% at constant currencies compared to the same period last year (8% as reported).Year-on-year revenue growth for the third quarter 2022 was 33% at constant currencies (41% as reported).Gross profit margin of 48.1% in the third quarter 2022 was slightly higher compared to 47.2% in the same quarter last year caused by a stronger mix.Operating result for the third quarter 2022 improved from €117 million last year to €160 million this year driven again by strong revenue growth  which was partly offset by an increase in operating expenses.Net earnings included a non-cash impairment charge of €321 million to account for the reduced market valuation of the stake in ASMPT.Normalized net earnings for the third quarter 2022 were €175 million  up from €132 million in Q3 last year  and included a translation gain of €25 million compared to a translation gain of €13 million in Q3 2021 and a translation gain of €26 million in Q2 2022.Story continuesCOMMENT“ASM continued its strong performance in the third quarter with again record-high revenue ” said Benjamin Loh  President and Chief Executive Officer of ASM International. “Revenue increased by 33% at constant currencies to €610 million in Q3 2022  slightly above the guided range of €570-600 million. Supply chain conditions remained challenging in Q3 and are expected to show moderate improvement in Q4. I want to thank the ASM team and our suppliers for their continued commitment and solid execution. Supported by a 36% increase in operating profit  we generated again a strong free cash flow of €122 million.We expect the new export regulations that were announced by the US government on October 7  2022  to negatively impact our business in China. Our equipment sales in China  at 16% of our total revenue in the first nine months of 2022  have been a growing part of our business with a strong contribution to group profitability. Based on a conservative scenario  we expect the new export restrictions will affect more than 40% of our sales in China.Taking a prudent view  we decided to reduce the Q3 bookings and related backlog with the impacted orders from China that were received in Q3 and prior quarters and still to be shipped in the coming quarters. Our total bookings dropped to €676 million in Q3 compared to a record level of €943 million in Q2. Excluding the reduction of impacted orders from China  the decrease in our Q3 orders compared to Q2 would have been much more moderate. The negative impact from new export regulations is also reflected in our guidance for Q4 sales.”Taking into account the guidance for Q4  ASM is on track for strong growth in 2022  its sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth  and is expected to clearly outperform the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market in 2022. During the third quarter  the semiconductor end-market further slowed down  with significant declines in the PC and smartphone segments. Combined with an expected deceleration in global economic growth WFE spending is forecasted to be down in 2023  in particular the memory segment. While it is too early to provide guidance for 2023  we believe our company is in good shape  on the back of an expected robust backlog by year-end  our strong position in the leading-edge logic/foundry segment  and solid traction with newly introduced products and applications.”OUTLOOKFor Q4  at constant currencies  we expect sales of €600-630 million  which includes a negative impact from the new US export regulations  as explained above. The revenue guidance for Q4 also includes the revenue contribution from LPE  following the closure of the acquisition on October 3  2022. Our expectation that we will finish the year with a continued elevated backlog is unchanged. WFE spending is now expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage in 2022.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.
