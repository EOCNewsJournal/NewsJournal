Election of chairman of the meetingThe board proposes that the lawyer Mats Dahlberg from Advokatfirman Delphi is elected as chairman of the annual general meeting.Item 2. Preparation and approval of voting listThe voting list that is proposed for resolution is the voting list that will be prepared by the Company  based on the shareholders‚Äô register prepared by Euroclear Sweden AB and postal votes received  verified and approved by persons approving the minutes.Item 4. Election of one or two persons to approve the minutesThe board of directors proposes that one person is elected to verify the minutes and to elect a shareholder  or a shareholder represented by a proxy  that is not a board member or employed by the Company in accordance with Rule 1.4 of the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and who participates in person at the EGM.Item 6. Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to decide on new issue and issue of warrants and/or convertible debenturesIn the light of the financing arrangement based on convertible debentures entered into between the Company and Negma Group Ltd  the board of directors proposes that the EGM resolves on a new authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a new issue of shares as well as on the issue of warrants and/or convertible debentures as set out below. For further information on the financing arrangement  please see the press release published on 26 October 2022.The board of directors proposes that the EGM resolves to authorize the board of directors to resolve  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  at one or more occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertible debentures for cash payment and/or with provision of non-cash consideration or set-off or otherwise.The number of shares  or warrants or convertible debentures that entitle subscription of a number of shares  that may be issued shall not exceed 20 per cent of the Company‚Äôs registered number of shares at the time of the board of director‚Äôs first resolution pursuant to the authorization. For subsequent resolutions pursuant to the authorization  the 20 per cent limit shall be based on (i) the number of shares issued pursuant to the authorization  and  with respect to warrants and convertible debentures issued pursuant to the authorization  (ii) the number of shares issued through subscription of issued warrants  and (iii) the number of shares issued through conversion of issued convertible debentures  provided that subscription/conversion of such warrants/convertible debentures have been completed.The authorization thus allows the board of directors to take into account  for example in relation to convertible debentures  the number of shares actually issued rather than the number of shares that could be issued based on the lowest conversion price of the convertible debenture  provided that conversion of previously issued convertible debentures under the authorization have been completed. The lowest conversion price for convertible debentures needs to be included in the resolution for registration purposes.Deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights shall be possible to  if needed  strengthen the Company‚Äôs financial position  broaden the ownership base and/or to increase the institutional ownership of the Company. New issue of shares and issue of warrants and/or convertible debentures shall  in the event of deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  be made at market conditions.This authorization replaces the current authorization resolved by the annual general meeting on 10 May 2022.The board of directors  the CEO or the person appointed by the board of directors shall be entitled to make the minor adjustments of the decision required in connection with the registration thereof.For the present resolution to be valid it is required that the proposal is approved by shareholders holding at least two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.SHARES AND VOTESAt the time of issuance of this notice  the total number of shares and votes in the Company amounts to 199 400 599. There is only one class of shares and the Company does not hold any treasury shares.SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONAccording to Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Companies Act  the board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors considers that this can be done without material damage to the Company  provide information on circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda.DOCUMENTATIONThe board of directors‚Äô complete proposal for resolution will be made available at the Company‚Äôs head office at the address V√§stra Tr√§dg√•rdsgatan 15 in Stockholm not later than three weeks prior to the meeting and will be sent to the shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy  and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Story continuesPetri Helsky  President & CEO:‚ÄúAfter a difficult first half of the year  Suominen‚Äôs result started to turn around in the third quarter. We reached all time high quarterly net sales in Q3 through improvement in both volumes and prices and tailwind from currencies. Our sales volumes increased in comparison to both Q3/2021 and Q2/2022 driven especially by improvement in North America. Margins were still lower than a year ago but improved slightly versus the previous quarter.Our net sales were EUR 131.9 million (98.7) in the third quarter. Sales volumes increased as did sales prices following the higher raw material prices. Currency impact was significantly positive at EUR +11.1 million. Our quarterly EBITDA improved to EUR 5.1 million (4.2). The higher sales and production volumes impacted the result positively but our sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs even despite the previously implemented energy surcharge in Europe. Other operating income was impacted positively by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.In August we announced surcharges on all our products in North America as a response to significant unexpected increases in raw materials  energy and freight costs. In September we announced a new energy surcharge on all our products in Europe as energy prices have continued to increase significantly after our first surcharge in March. Energy cost inflation is expected to continue during the autumn and winter months.In the third quarter Suominen completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Looking ahead  we expect the demand for our products in the US to continue recovering and we have already seen the raw material markets turn more favorable in early Q4. At the same time our own improvement actions are starting to bear fruit. All these are expected to contribute positively to our result in the fourth quarter.‚ÄùNET SALESJuly‚ÄìSeptember 2022In July‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales increased from the comparison period by 34% to EUR 131.9 million (98.7) as both volumes and sales prices increased. Currencies impacted the net sales positively by EUR 11.1 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 80.3 million (57.0) and net sales of the Europe business area to EUR 51.7 million (41.6).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022In January‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales improved from the comparison period by 10% and amounted to EUR 360.2 million (327.6). Volumes decreased while sales prices increased  with currencies impacting the net sales positively by EUR 23.7 million.Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 206.3 million (196.4) and net sales of the Europe business area to EUR 154.1 million (131.3).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTJuly‚ÄìSeptember 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 5.1 million (4.2). The increased sales and production volumes impacted the result positively while margins declined as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million. Other operating income was positively impacted by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.Operating profit increased from the comparison period and amounted to EUR 0.2 million (-0.8).Profit before income taxes was EUR 0.1 million (-1.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -0.4 million (-1.7). Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.5 million (0.1).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 10.3 million (38.1). The main drivers were lower sales and production volumes and lower margins as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material  energy  and freight costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million.Operating profit decreased and was EUR -4.0 million (23.1).Profit before income taxes was EUR -4.3 million (23.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -5.1 million (18.2).Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.8 million (-5.6).FINANCINGThe Group‚Äôs net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 65.8 million (48.2) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 39.9% (30.2%) and the equity ratio 39.8% (42.5%).In January‚ÄìSeptember  net financial expenses were EUR -0.3 million (+0.7)  or -0.1% (+0.2%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial expenses by EUR 4.4 million (in 2021  decreased by EUR 1.1 million).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021. The transaction impacted Suominen‚Äôs net financial expenses positively in 2021 by EUR 3.7 million. The effect on the cash flow in 2021 was EUR 11.6 million.Cash flow from operations in July‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -10.8 million (-8.9) and in January‚ÄìSeptember EUR -1.6 million (8.2)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR -0.03 (0.14). The decline in the cash flow from operations for January‚ÄìSeptember was driven by the weaker result.In the third quarter the change in net working capital was negative by EUR -13.9 million (-11.4). The change in net working capital in January‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -7.3 million (-23.2).In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn January‚ÄìSeptember  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 7.4 million (14.0) and the largest item was related to the growth investment initiatives in Nakkila  Finland. Other investments were mainly for maintenance.Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen‚Äôs strategy and supports company‚Äôs vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023.Depreciation and amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 14.3 million (15.0).PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYDuring the third quarter of 2022  we were awarded a silver level rating from the EcoVadis sustainability assessment. This was the first time that we completed the EcoVadis assessment and received a rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. By the end of September there has not been any LTA‚Äôs at Suominen sites.We systematically measure our employee engagement by conducting our engagement survey  Suominen Vibe  every year. During the year we have used the results from the survey conducted last year to plan and execute development actions. Now it is again time to collect feedback and this year‚Äôs Vibe survey is now ongoing.We are continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the third quarter we continued our actions towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. One example of our concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is our solar panels in our Alicante plant that have been in operation since August.We have a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens  and we continuously develop new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact. Our target is a 50% increase in sales of sustainable nonwovens by 2025 compared to 2019  and to have at least 10 sustainable product launches per year.Suominen reports progress in its key sustainability KPIs annually.As part of our Annual Report 2021 published on March 2  2022 we reported on the progress of our sustainability performance.

This can impact Suominen‚Äôs financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen‚Äôs business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen‚Äôs business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers‚Äô or our own plants due to virus infections. Despite the inflation and supply chain challenges caused by the pandemic straining the whole nonwovens industry and its value chain  we have not experienced more payment delays than usual by our customers and hence we do not see that our customer credit risks would have materially increased.Suominen‚Äôs other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen‚Äôs nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing the raw material markets turning more favorable from the fourth quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies. The statements also cover other central areas of corporate governance. The statements have been published on Suominen's website  separately from the Report of the Board of Directors  at www.suominen.fi.AUDIOCAST AND CONFERENCE CALLPetri Helsky  President & CEO  and Toni Tamminen  CFO  will present the result in English in an audiocast and a conference call for analyst  investors  and media on the same day at 11:00 a.m. (EEST).

ratios per share are either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)=Profit for the period adjusted with interest on hybrid bond  net of tax Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury shares Diluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -5 054 18 197 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 510 358 58 019 324 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.09 0.32 0.36 Diluted -0.09 0.31 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -1 553 8 192 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR -0.03 0.14 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 165 188 159 682 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.87 2.77 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.64 4.41 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 151.7 254.1 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 9 800 783 15 570 116 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 17.1 27.0 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2022 or 2021.EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses Comparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Operating profit -3 969 23 067 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 14 253 14 984 20 092 EBITDA 10 284 38 051 47 033Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 410 122 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 6 971 13 894 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 7 380 14 016 17 771Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 741 149 286 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 753 2 143 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -84 664 -103 182 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 65 830 48 247 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 741 149 286 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 753 2 143 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 150 494 151 429 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %Return on equity (ROE)  % = Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) x 100 Total equity (quarterly average)EUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) -2 516 25 491 20 734 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2021 / 30.9.2020 / 31.12.2020 159 682 144 074 145 882 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.12.2021 / 31.12.2020 / 31.3.2021 163 199 145 882 152 227 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2022 / 31.3.2021 / 30.6.2021 153 504 152 227 159 386 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2022 / 30.6.2021 / 30.9.2021 158 098 159 386 159 682 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2022 / 30.9.2021 / 31.12.2021 165 188 159 682 163 199 Average 159 934 152 250 156 075 Return on equity (ROE)  % -1.6 16.7 13.3Invested capitalInvested capital = Total equity + interest-bearing liabilities - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 165 188 159 682 163 199 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 741 149 286 149 134 Cash and cash equivalents -84 664 -103 182 -101 357 Invested capital 230 264 205 786 210 975The calculation formula for invested capital has been changed.

Income from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC was $5 million  or $0.01 per diluted share. These results included after-tax charges and credits totaling $7.7 million of expense  or $0.02 per share  which included the following (Exhibit 6):Impairment and other charges of $3.6 million; andRestructuring and other charges of $4.1 million.Adjusted income from continuing operations was $12.7 million  or $0.03 per diluted share (Exhibit 6).Adjusted EBITDA excludes pre-tax charges and credits. Adjusted EBITDA in the period also included a foreign exchange loss of $14.5 million. When excluding the foreign exchange loss  adjusted EBITDA was $200.1 million.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  ‚Äú Third quarter results reflect continued momentum in financial performance. Total Company revenue of $1.7 billion was a solid achievement given the currency headwind experienced during the period. Adjusted EBITDA was $200 million with a margin of 11.5% when excluding foreign exchange loss. Subsea and Surface Technologies both achieved sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin in the period.‚ÄùPferdehirt added  ‚Äú In Subsea  inbound was $1.4 billion  with year-to-date orders now totaling $5.2 billion  exceeding the level achieved in all of last year. Our Subsea Opportunities list remains at a record level. This strong project pipeline and the active dialogue with our large and expanded customer base give us continued confidence that our full-year Subsea orders will approach $7 billion  up as much as 40 percent versus the prior year. Extending the outlook into 2023  we believe orders over the next five quarters will be at least $9 billion.‚Äù‚Äú In Surface Technologies  inbound increased sequentially by approximately 65% to $449 million  representing a book-to-bill of 1.4. The strong order activity benefited from the acceleration of orders from Aramco  which was a significant achievement in the period. A large portion of these awards will result in revenue in future periods  providing us with increased visibility for continued growth in our international revenue in 2023.‚ÄùPferdehirt continued  ‚Äú We continue to see the potential for strong growth in EBITDA  cash flow and financial returns  as evidenced by our stated objective to achieve more than $1 billion of Subsea EBITDA by 2025. Further demonstrating our confidence in this outlook  we announced a new $400 million share buyback program in July  which we quickly put into action with the repurchase of $50 million of our ordinary shares in the third quarter.‚ÄùPferdehirt concluded  ‚Äú The next leg of growth in oil and gas will be fueled by offshore and the Middle East. The bold steps we took more than five years ago to create TechnipFMC have resulted in a pure-play technology company that is uniquely levered to both of these markets. Our portfolio of innovative products  solutions and disruptive commercial models has further strengthened our leadership position  and we are now taking full advantage of the market growth that lies ahead.‚ÄùOperational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial HighlightsReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.Three Months Ended Change (In millions) Sep. 30 2022 Jun. 30 2022 Sep. 30 2021 Sequential Year-over-Year Revenue $1 415.0 $1 414.6 $1 312.1 0.0% 7.8% Operating profit $105.0 $97.1 $23.5 8.1% 346.8% Adjusted EBITDA $183.8 $176.0 $146.5 4.4% 25.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin 13.0% 12.4% 11.2% 60 bps 180 bps Inbound orders $1 400.8 $1 928.0 $1 116.0 (27.3%) 25.5% Backlog1 2 3 $7 603.2 $7 926.3 $6 661.4 (4.1%) 14.1%Estimated Consolidated Backlog Scheduling(In millions) Sep. 30 2022 2022 (3 months) $996 2023 $3 747 2024 and beyond $2 860 Total $7 603 1 Backlog as of Sep. 30  2022 was reduced by a foreign exchange impact of $307 million. 2 Backlog does not capture all revenue potential for Subsea Services. 3 Backlog as of Sep. 30  2022 does not include total Company non-consolidated backlog of $509 million.Subsea reported third quarter revenue of $1 415 million  flat sequentially versus the second quarter.

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy  and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Petri Helsky  President & CEO:‚ÄúAfter a difficult first half of the year  Suominen‚Äôs result started to turn around in the third quarter. We reached all time high quarterly net sales in Q3 through improvement in both volumes and prices and tailwind from currencies. Our sales volumes increased in comparison to both Q3/2021 and Q2/2022 driven especially by improvement in North America. Margins were still lower than a year ago but improved slightly versus the previous quarter.Our net sales were EUR 131.9 million (98.7) in the third quarter. Sales volumes increased as did sales prices following the higher raw material prices. Currency impact was significantly positive at EUR +11.1 million. Our quarterly EBITDA improved to EUR 5.1 million (4.2). The higher sales and production volumes impacted the result positively but our sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs even despite the previously implemented energy surcharge in Europe. Other operating income was impacted positively by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.In August we announced surcharges on all our products in North America as a response to significant unexpected increases in raw materials  energy and freight costs. In September we announced a new energy surcharge on all our products in Europe as energy prices have continued to increase significantly after our first surcharge in March. Energy cost inflation is expected to continue during the autumn and winter months.In the third quarter Suominen completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Looking ahead  we expect the demand for our products in the US to continue recovering and we have already seen the raw material markets turn more favorable in early Q4. At the same time our own improvement actions are starting to bear fruit. All these are expected to contribute positively to our result in the fourth quarter.‚ÄùNET SALESJuly‚ÄìSeptember 2022In July‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales increased from the comparison period by 34% to EUR 131.9 million (98.7) as both volumes and sales prices increased. Currencies impacted the net sales positively by EUR 11.1 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 80.3 million (57.0) and net sales of the Europe business area to EUR 51.7 million (41.6).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022In January‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales improved from the comparison period by 10% and amounted to EUR 360.2 million (327.6).

The increased sales and production volumes impacted the result positively while margins declined as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million. Other operating income was positively impacted by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.Operating profit increased from the comparison period and amounted to EUR 0.2 million (-0.8).Profit before income taxes was EUR 0.1 million (-1.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -0.4 million (-1.7). Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.5 million (0.1).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 10.3 million (38.1). The main drivers were lower sales and production volumes and lower margins as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material  energy  and freight costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million.Operating profit decreased and was EUR -4.0 million (23.1).Profit before income taxes was EUR -4.3 million (23.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -5.1 million (18.2).Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.8 million (-5.6).FINANCINGThe Group‚Äôs net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 65.8 million (48.2) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 39.9% (30.2%) and the equity ratio 39.8% (42.5%).In January‚ÄìSeptember  net financial expenses were EUR -0.3 million (+0.7)  or -0.1% (+0.2%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial expenses by EUR 4.4 million (in 2021  decreased by EUR 1.1 million).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021. The transaction impacted Suominen‚Äôs net financial expenses positively in 2021 by EUR 3.7 million. The effect on the cash flow in 2021 was EUR 11.6 million.Cash flow from operations in July‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -10.8 million (-8.9) and in January‚ÄìSeptember EUR -1.6 million (8.2)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR -0.03 (0.14). The decline in the cash flow from operations for January‚ÄìSeptember was driven by the weaker result.In the third quarter the change in net working capital was negative by EUR -13.9 million (-11.4). The change in net working capital in January‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -7.3 million (-23.2).In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn January‚ÄìSeptember  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 7.4 million (14.0) and the largest item was related to the growth investment initiatives in Nakkila  Finland. Other investments were mainly for maintenance.Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen‚Äôs strategy and supports company‚Äôs vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023.Depreciation and amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 14.3 million (15.0).PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYDuring the third quarter of 2022  we were awarded a silver level rating from the EcoVadis sustainability assessment. This was the first time that we completed the EcoVadis assessment and received a rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. By the end of September there has not been any LTA‚Äôs at Suominen sites.We systematically measure our employee engagement by conducting our engagement survey  Suominen Vibe  every year. During the year we have used the results from the survey conducted last year to plan and execute development actions. Now it is again time to collect feedback and this year‚Äôs Vibe survey is now ongoing.We are continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the third quarter we continued our actions towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. One example of our concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is our solar panels in our Alicante plant that have been in operation since August.We have a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens  and we continuously develop new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact. Our target is a 50% increase in sales of sustainable nonwovens by 2025 compared to 2019  and to have at least 10 sustainable product launches per year.Suominen reports progress in its key sustainability KPIs annually.As part of our Annual Report 2021 published on March 2  2022 we reported on the progress of our sustainability performance.

This can impact Suominen‚Äôs financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen‚Äôs business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen‚Äôs business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers‚Äô or our own plants due to virus infections. Despite the inflation and supply chain challenges caused by the pandemic straining the whole nonwovens industry and its value chain  we have not experienced more payment delays than usual by our customers and hence we do not see that our customer credit risks would have materially increased.Suominen‚Äôs other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen‚Äôs nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing the raw material markets turning more favorable from the fourth quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

ratios per share are either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)=Profit for the period adjusted with interest on hybrid bond  net of tax Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury shares Diluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -5 054 18 197 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 510 358 58 019 324 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.09 0.32 0.36 Diluted -0.09 0.31 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -1 553 8 192 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR -0.03 0.14 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 165 188 159 682 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.87 2.77 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.64 4.41 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 151.7 254.1 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 9 800 783 15 570 116 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 17.1 27.0 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs.

The original advisory committee meeting was scheduled for 31 October 2022. The FDA informed Ipsen that the postponement relates to an FDA request for new information on palovarotene clinical trial data and does not relate to the safety profile of palovarotene. The company is currently working to fulfil the request. We will work expediently with the FDA as we remain committed to bringing innovative treatment options to the Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva community.ENDSAbout IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen‚Äôs Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen‚Äôs management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The name change will be implemented in the next few days. The Company stock ticker symbol will change from ‚ÄúBOTHE‚Äù to ‚ÄúBIOS‚Äù. The new corporate website will be www.biosenic.com.‚ÄúThe shareholders‚Äô approval of the combination of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics will create a diversified and innovative new company. BioSenic will be able to develop an expanded product portfolio across multiple therapeutic indications ‚Äù said Fran√ßois Rieger  newly appointed Chairman and CEO of BioSenic. ‚ÄúWe are excited to bring a new equity story to the market. Medsenic has been working for a decade on serious pathologies linked to systemic autoimmune diseases  such as cGvHD (chronic Graft versus Host Disease)  systemic lupus  and systemic sclerosis. Our programs are well advanced in the clinic and will bring value to the newly combined portfolio. Our technologies will now include a dedicated best-in-class autoimmune disease platform in addition to an allogeneic cell therapy platform. The widened expertise and IP of the new company will enable us to target both tissue inflammation and repair  as well as meet the needs of patients without currently effective treatments. We are also planning to meet current shareholders as well as potential new investors in order to present the new equity story.‚ÄùStory continues""There continues to be significant unmet medical needs across immunopathology and tissue repair. Combining Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics will provide significant opportunity for cross-pollination and allow therapies to reach patients more quickly. The combination of development portfolios also enables a significant derisk for investors and increases the potential for growth and value creation for all shareholders "" said Jean St√©phenne  Member of the Board of Directors  BioSenic. ""The new board of directors and management of BioSenic  under the direction of Prof. Fran√ßois Rieger  are particularly well placed to lead the merged company to delivering therapies for unmet medical needs.‚ÄùNew BioSenic Board of Directors and Executive leadership teamThe BioSenic‚Äô ESM also approved the appointment of a new board  consisting of a total of up to seven directors including Jean St√©phenne and Jean-Luc Vandebroek that are transitioning to the Biosenic Board  while all other Bone Therapeutics Board directors have terminated their mandate. Pr. Francois Rieger  chairman and CEO of Medsenic  has been appointed as chairman and CEO of BioSenic SA. Other board members are Ms V√©ronique Pomi-Schneiter  deputy CEO of Biosenic  formerly in charge of Medsenic operations  Mr Jean-Fran√ßois Rax  representing Cap Innovest  Ms Revital Rattenbach  independent director and Mr Terry Sadler  independent director.The Executive leadership team now consists of Fran√ßois Rieger (CEO)  V√©ronique Pomi-Schneiter (deputy CEO)  and Anne Leselbaum (CMO).Terms of the combinationFurther to the ESM  all Medsenic' shareholders have contributed fifty-one percent (51%) of the total outstanding share capital of Medsenic  valued at EUR 40 800 207  at a subscription price per share of EUR 0.45  which values Bone Therapeutics at EUR 10 million. In exchange for the in-kind contribution of 51% of Medsenic' shares  90 668 594 shares were issued by BioSenic to Medsenic shareholders. The parties have relied on the valuation carried out by an independent expert in order to determine the exchange ratio of one for four.The Medsenic shareholders have agreed to an initial lock-up of nine months as from the date of the ESM  provided that on February 28 2023  2% of the new shares held by each of V√©ronique Pomi-Schneiter and Fran√ßois Rieger shall be released from the lock-up.BioSenic will maintain its status as a Belgian listed company  while significantly broadening its diverse therapeutic portfolio.The ESM also approved the issue of 24 463 421 subscription rights allowing holders to subscribe for a new share of the company if the ALLOB interim Phase IIB results  a clinical trial focusing on the regenerative properties of proprietary ALLOB cells in cases of difficult  in risk of delayed-union  tibial fractures  are positive at a subscription price per share of EUR 0.45 (the ""ALLOB Subscription Rights""). One ALLOB Subscription Right was issued and granted to each outstanding share of BioSenic prior to completion of the transaction.No offering of the ALLOB Subscription Rights to the public was made or will be made in the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation 2017/1129 and no one has taken any action that would  or is intended to  permit such an offering in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for such purpose is required  including in Belgium  France or any other member state of the European Economic Area to which the Prospectus Regulation 2017/1129 applies. The ALLOB Subscription Rights have also not been  or will not be  registered under the U.S. Securities Act  or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction in the United States of America  and they may not be offered  sold  pledged or otherwise transferred in the United States of America except pursuant to a transaction that is exempt from  or not subject to  the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws.In the contribution agreement  the existing shareholders of Medsenic have agreed to contribute in kind the totality of the remaining Medsenic shares held by within the next 24 - 36 months from the completion of the combination  meaning that  in the medium to long run  all existing pipeline from both organizations will be directly or indirectly held by BioSenic.Outlook for the remainder of 2022 and 2023A Phase III study of cGvHD is currently anticipated to start in H1 2023 following the Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD (chronic GvH) positive results. A phase IIa clinical trial for Lupus had previously established proof of concept of safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease: a Phase IIb clinical trial for severe Lupus is in the planning stage. Also  positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase II clinical trial on systemic sclerosis.The Phase IIb trial of ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in the H1 2023.About BioSenicBioSenic has been formed to be a leading biotech company  focusing on the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) through its majority participation in Medsenic  from the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO platform. kKey programs include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic Lupus erythematesus (SLE) and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).BioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The original cutting-edge allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform from Bone Therapeutics  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic‚Äô scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform from Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO are best described by a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be soon eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in immuno-oncology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic has been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation which was granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SL)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown in a phase IIa study good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract).Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic  as preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.The recent acquisition by BioSenic of a majority participation in Medsenic brings together the strategic positionings and strengths of the two companies. As the result of this merger  Biosenic is adding to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP tissue repair protection an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations  all using the properties mastered by Medsenic of ATO/OATO with its original compelling immunomodulatory properties.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium.

The partnership  which expands their long-standing collaboration in life sciences and healthcare  will leverage virtual twin experiences to enable agile and flexible operations that advance Sanofi‚Äôs ambition to secure its product portfolio.Sanofi will use Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô ‚ÄúMade to Cure for BioPharma‚Äù industry solution experience based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to design  implement  qualify and operate modular production lines at the two ‚ÄúEVolutive Facilities.‚Äù These will rely on single-use technology and mobile equipment to manufacture up to four products simultaneously and sustainably by selecting the most advanced technologies to reduce their energy consumption. The platform provides a virtual environment for collaborative innovation and end-to-end data management across the life cycle. Sanofi can experience the manufacturing systems under development and their operation virtually and optimize scale up and industrialization processes before deploying them.‚ÄúWe want to improve people‚Äôs lives by giving them faster access to vaccines and treatments while minimizing the environmental impacts of our activities ‚Äù said Ana Alves  EVolutive Facility Global Project Head & Site Head of Neuville sur Saone  Sanofi. ‚ÄúDassault Syst√®mes delivers the technology we need to accelerate the introduction of new products in the facility by supporting the collaborative works of our teams and by strengthening the standardization of designs and models. It will also bring capabilities to reach our objective to produce several products in the EVF in an optimized schedule  thanks to the digital twin. Then  the 3DEXPERIENCE platform will help us to address the complexity of the product lifecycle management in a highly regulated environment and for the benefit of our patients.‚ÄùPharmaceutical manufacturers must qualify facilities  equipment and processes before production to ensure safety and quality. This can take weeks or months depending on the equipment configurations and process parameters for different product recipes. Virtual twins enable manufacturers to standardize modules  reduce this timeframe  and boost their ability to quickly and massively produce crucial therapies.With a virtual twin  Sanofi can visualize and simulate the recipe  equipment and consumables that a particular process requires  as well as the flow and activity of the modules and operators in the ‚Äúballroom‚Äù ‚Äì a flexible and adaptable area that enables manufacturers to quickly switch between processes. Sanofi can add  remove and replace functional elements and process steps as needed in a seamless way  and reconfigure the production lines for a fast changeover from one product to another one. It can also accelerate the main activities of the life cycle of new modules  processes and facilities more quickly and catalog them into its product life cycle management for reuse and faster product changeover.‚ÄúThe pandemic made it clear: BioPharmas must be able to maximize efficiency and quickly provide high-quality  innovative therapeutics to patients worldwide ‚Äù said Claire Biot  Vice President  Life Sciences & Healthcare Industry  Dassault Syst√®mes. ‚ÄúSanofi is responding to this challenge with next generation modular manufacturing that can transform the speed at which products reach patients. Thanks to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform  Sanofi will implement new products right the first time  with faster production ramp-ups and concurrent process production for built-in flexibility.

This open-access technology enables investment platforms  wealth managers  retail brokers  IFAs and fintechs across the UK and in the European Union to offer IPOs  placings and bonds directly to their retail investor customers.Connect represents a new stage of partnership with over 60 brokerage partners signed up to PrimaryBid  including the UK platforms AJ Bell  Hargreaves Lansdown and interactive investor and a number of discretionary wealth managers which collectively have contributed over ¬£500m in transaction demand through PrimaryBid since 2020. In the EU  Connect was launched in collaboration with PrimaryBid's strategic partner  Euronext  to facilitate pan-EU expansion and cross border capital formation. In France  Bourse Direct  Boursorama and EasyBourse are fully integrated into PrimaryBid's Connect API enabling at-scale automated distribution  and a number of leading EU retail intermediaries are in the process of completing integration.Investment in the PrimaryBid Connect platform reflects growing scrutiny on public companies from regulators and policymakers around the limited access everyday investors have to 'institutional-only' fundraisings. As an independently regulated company  PrimaryBid has the leading track-record in winning access for retail investors to IPOs and secondary fundraisings working alongside all major investment banks. PrimaryBid has completed over 200 deals since the start of 2020.For individual investors  PrimaryBid Connect brings deals directly into their chosen investment platform  maximising the opportunity to make use of tax-efficient wrappers such as ISAs or funds on account. Partners also have a choice over their preferred interface to PrimaryBid  including straight-through API processing for digital-first platforms. Other enhancements include shareholder verification and transaction audit functionality that meet emerging best practices around deal allocation and post-deal regulatory reporting.Story continuesJames Deal  PrimaryBid's Head of UK said: ""The launch of PrimaryBid Connect is an exciting milestone in our mission to deliver public inclusion in our capital markets through technology. In the UK  HM Treasury's recent capital raising review authored by Mark Austin stated clearly that retail investors should be included in all public company fundraisings. HM Treasury is also working to remove other practical barriers to public inclusion  including arbitrary limits on retail participation in the UK Prospectus regime  soon to be reformed through the Financial Services and Markets Bill.""The launch of Connect will enable corporate issuers and their advisers to efficiently execute on the new governance standards by accessing the broadest range of platforms and retail investors. PrimaryBid stands ready to unlock nearly ~¬£500 billion in retail capital for UK plc alongside our distribution partners: the PrimaryBid Connect platform is the next stage in our ambition to simplify and enhance this process.""Eric Low  PrimaryBid's Head of EU  added: ""Encouraging retail investor participation in the capital markets is a core feature of the European Commission's recent strategy and consultations. We are working with our European partners to simplify the capital formation process and deliver broad-based retail inclusion through technology  very much in the spirit of policymaker plans for Capital Markets Union.""Enquiries:Mike Coombes  VP Corporate Affairsmike.coombes@primarybid.com020 3026 4750Notes to Editors:Across the UK  France and Netherlands there is an average of 363 primary market transactions a year  with 291 placings and over 70 IPOs (Average number of deals  2017 to 2021 per Dealogic). Access to this area of the market is no longer reserved only for institutional investors  and issuers can tap into the vast pool of retail capital. In the UK alone  c.¬£400bn is held in stocks and shares ISAs  of which a material proportion is held as cash ready to be invested; this is in addition to the further c.¬£290bn held in cash ISAs (per ONS statistics  June 2022). PrimaryBid Connect comes in two forms - a 'ready-to-go' web-based application designed for wealth managers and smaller retail brokers  and an API solution that plugs directly into the systems of larger platforms and fintechs allowing for distribution of deals to retail investors at scale.

Some promising commercial negotiations are underway both in France and the USA. Difficulties related to price increases  in particular for energy and chemical products  are anticipated  with consequent negotiation of sales price increases.The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors met to approve the half-year financial results as of June 30  2022. As a reminder  on Euronext Growth  the half-year financial statements are not submitted to an audit by the statutory auditors (Euronext Growth Rules  art. 4.2.1). The financial statements presented below are not and will not be audited.The Egide Group's consolidated EBITDA (adjusted from IFRS16) for the six months ended June 30  2022  amounts to ‚Ç¨1.87 million.First-half Results consolidated P&L(In ‚Ç¨m)H1 2021As a percentage of revenuesH1 2022As a percentage of revenues Sales 16.60 16.02 Current EBITDA * 1.19 7% 1.87 11% Operating Income (Ebit) 0.52 3% (1.29) (8%) Net Income 0.24 1% (2.02) (13%)*Ebitda corrected from IFRS16CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS AS OF JUNE 30  2022The Egide group's consolidated revenues for the first half of 2022 were ‚Ç¨16.02 million  down 3.5% compared with the first half of 2021  despite a 4.5% increase in sales at Egide SA and a 4.9% increase at Santier  which did not fully offset the 20.5% decrease in sales at Egide USA  which was favorably impacted by an exchange rate effect  since in constant dollars the group's growth would have been negative 8.2% (In US$  Egide USA revenue is down 27.9% and Santier is down 4.8%).Story continuesThese results are mainly explained by the difficulties in recruiting personnel and supply that have disrupted US production. Measures have been taken to increase the salaries of the direct labor force  but the situation remains tense.In terms of business  with the replacement of the Boll√®ne facility manager and the Cambridge facility manager  the group continued to renew its management with the arrival of David Hien to manage the factory in Boll√®ne (France) and Terry Toh for the one in Cambridge (USA).Thus  the highlights of the activity of the 3 sites can be analyzed as follows:Egide SA continues to grow and consolidates its leadership position in the thermal imaging market in Europe (notably with the acquisition of new customers)  Asia (China and South Korea) and the Middle East. The strategy focused on the development of high quality packages for power  optronics and microwave applications continues to be successful with new projects  in line with the production tool modernization plan  currently being deployed.Egide USA has been heavily impacted by the labor shortage in the United States  despite adjusting salary schedules to above-market levels. As new employees were brought into the plant  training and ""rework"" affected operational efficiency. Despite these industrial difficulties  which are beginning to subside  business activity and order backlog are high  thanks in particular to the thermal battery and defense sectors. The order book is solid.Santier's business improved in the first half of the year  but like the Cambridge plant  San Diego is suffering from the same U.S. labor market and supply chain issues.Sales in dollars accounted for 52% of the group's total revenues in the first half of 2022.RESULTS AS OF JUNE 30  2022The split by entity of the consolidated operating result is as follows:Egide SA  (37k‚Ç¨)For Egide USA  (312k‚Ç¨)For Santier (879k‚Ç¨)  including (345k‚Ç¨) additional goodwill impairment.The results of the US companies are mainly impacted by the problems of the US labor market  supply difficulties and other inefficiencies related to the need to train incoming staff.The non-recurring operating income and expenses for the first half of 2022 mainly concern the sale of the Cambridge building. The accounting impact before IFRS treatment of this sale represents a capital gain of ‚Ç¨2 952k  however the IFRS 16 treatment of lease-back transactions is extremely restrictive and only recognizes a capital gain of ‚Ç¨160k. The major difference comes from the reclassification of ‚Ç¨2 450k in financial debt and not in profit. The subsequent corollary  during the entire term of the lease  will be an appreciation in loan repayment and interest of a large part of the rent.The immediate consequence is that  unlike what had been anticipated  the first-half losses of the American entities are not offset by the capital gain on the sale of the building.Beyond this initial impact  it was decided to recognize taxes on this capital gain in the amount of the remaining deferred tax asset  i.e.  ‚Ç¨534k.In addition  an impairment loss was recognized which led to the recognition of an additional impairment of the goodwill of Santier Inc. of ‚Ç¨345k.IFRS 16 has reclassified ‚Ç¨336k of rental income into ‚Ç¨242k of depreciation and ‚Ç¨68k of interest  over H1 2022.The consolidated net result was thus negative by K‚Ç¨ 2016.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JUNE 30  2022ACTIF PASSIF Dec 2021 June 2022 Dec 2021 June 2022 Non-current assets 12.85 11.05 Shareholders‚Äô Equity 11.57 10.32 Inventory  trade  and other receivables13.86 15.91 Financial debt and provisions 4.71 7.77 Cash 1.59 3.89 Trade and other payables. 12.02 12.76 TOTAL 28.30 30.85 TOTAL 28.30 30.85Capital expenditure for the half-year were ‚Ç¨483k  including ‚Ç¨245k at Egide SA  ‚Ç¨160k at Egide USA and ‚Ç¨78k at Santier. The working capital requirement (inventories + account receivables + other current assets ‚Äì accounts payable - other current liabilities) is 104 days of sales  compared to 95 days on June 30  2021.Financial debts are mainly composed of 3 PGE loans for ‚Ç¨1 142k from Egide SA  equipment loans for ‚Ç¨748k from Egide USA and Santier. It should be noted that these American loans do not comply with the Covenants and have therefore all been reclassified as short-term. Egide SA also has 615k‚Ç¨ of other loans  including 456k‚Ç¨ for financing the Research Tax Credit.The IFRS treatment of the factor has reintegrated the ‚Ç¨1 558k of financed receivables into debt and accounts receivable. On the other hand  two revolving credit facilities to finance working capital are used in the USA for ‚Ç¨1 129k and ‚Ç¨1 239k respectively by Egide USA and Santier. These two accounts receivable and inventory financing facilities were contracted with the Banc of California  which does not wish to continue its relationship with the group.REVIEW OF THE US ENTITY FINANCING SITUATION.In the USA  the need to replace the current banking partner (Banc of California) at its request was a major disruptive factor  causing a delay in the publication of the Group's 2021 annual reports and constituting a going concern risk. This risk has been greatly reduced thanks to a $6 million lease-back of the Cambridge building  in return for the repayment of the corresponding $1.2 million outstanding real estate loan. This refinancing operation should be a key point in the resolution of the group's financing problems in the USA.However  as of June 30  2022  and at the date of publication of these financial statements  the replacement for this American banking partner has not yet been finalized. Gibraltar  which had been presented as a potential successor  seems to have requirements difficult to meet and further talks have started with other players.The deadline has been extended with Banc of California  to December 31  2022  and the group's management is confident about the outcome of the current financing search.OUTLOOKThe Group expects some improvement in the second half of the year without any favorable or unfavorable events. Some promising commercial negotiations are underway both in France and in the USA  which would allow a return to healthy growth at least for 2023.In addition to the staffing problems already mentioned  the group will be facing difficulties linked to price increases  particularly for energy and chemicals. The energy situation has not yet changed much  as supply contracts are still running. Moreover  while energy prices have risen five or tenfold in Europe  they have ""only"" increased by 50% in the USA. The group is taking measures to negotiate price increases with its customers  including on multi-year orders.The objectives of modernizing the group's production tool are still valid  to which are now added more ecological objectives and drastic energy savings.Jim Collins  President  and CEO of Egide  comments: ""It has been a difficult recovery from the pandemic and the industrial fire at our Cambridge facility. In the United States  recruitment difficulties have had a negative impact on our business. The lack of an available skilled workforce has required us to hire entry-level workers while increasing the cost of our existing workforce to retain them. In addition  our metal component suppliers are experiencing the same labor issues  as well as limited availability of special metal materials. This has disrupted our supply chain for these components. The result is significant delays in delivery of existing orders. While the company is working to resolve recruitment and supply chain delays  our customer base remains loyal.""He concluded: ""Our Boll√®ne plant has stabilized at break-even in terms of profitability  a major improvement over the past years. The prospect of increased revenue is encouraging for continued improvement. At the Group level  new opportunities have appeared in all our market segments in Europe and the United States. We are therefore ready to take the necessary steps to seize these opportunities.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its third quarter 2022 operating results (unaudited).Q3 revenues at a new record high  Q3 orders impacted by new US export control regulationsFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSEUR million Q3 2021 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 New orders 624.5 942.7 675.5 YoY change % as reported / at constant currencies 206% / 209% 83% / 73% 8% / 1% Revenue 432.9 559.5 609.8 YoY change % as reported / at constant currencies 38% / 38% 36% / 30% 41% / 33% Gross profit margin % 47.2% 47.5% 48.1% Operating result 117.3 147.6 159.9 Operating result margin % 27.1% 26.4% 26.2% Share in income of investments in associates (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) 27.6 26.9 19.6 Amortization intangible assets (resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) (3.1) (3.4) (3.6) Impairment of investments in associates ‚Äî ‚Äî (321.4) Net earnings (losses) 128.9 160.4 (150.5) Normalized net earnings (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013 and impairment)132.0 163.8 174.6New orders of ‚Ç¨676 million for the third quarter 2022 have been adjusted to reflect the expected negative impact of the recent US export restrictions to China. The new orders increased by 1% at constant currencies compared to the same period last year (8% as reported).Year-on-year revenue growth for the third quarter 2022 was 33% at constant currencies (41% as reported).Gross profit margin of 48.1% in the third quarter 2022 was slightly higher compared to 47.2% in the same quarter last year caused by a stronger mix.Operating result for the third quarter 2022 improved from ‚Ç¨117 million last year to ‚Ç¨160 million this year driven again by strong revenue growth  which was partly offset by an increase in operating expenses.Net earnings included a non-cash impairment charge of ‚Ç¨321 million to account for the reduced market valuation of the stake in ASMPT.Normalized net earnings for the third quarter 2022 were ‚Ç¨175 million  up from ‚Ç¨132 million in Q3 last year  and included a translation gain of ‚Ç¨25 million compared to a translation gain of ‚Ç¨13 million in Q3 2021 and a translation gain of ‚Ç¨26 million in Q2 2022.COMMENT‚ÄúASM continued its strong performance in the third quarter with again record-high revenue ‚Äù said Benjamin Loh  President and Chief Executive Officer of ASM International. ‚ÄúRevenue increased by 33% at constant currencies to ‚Ç¨610 million in Q3 2022  slightly above the guided range of ‚Ç¨570-600 million. Supply chain conditions remained challenging in Q3 and are expected to show moderate improvement in Q4. I want to thank the ASM team and our suppliers for their continued commitment and solid execution. Supported by a 36% increase in operating profit  we generated again a strong free cash flow of ‚Ç¨122 million.We expect the new export regulations that were announced by the US government on October 7  2022  to negatively impact our business in China. Our equipment sales in China  at 16% of our total revenue in the first nine months of 2022  have been a growing part of our business with a strong contribution to group profitability. Based on a conservative scenario  we expect the new export restrictions will affect more than 40% of our sales in China.Taking a prudent view  we decided to reduce the Q3 bookings and related backlog with the impacted orders from China that were received in Q3 and prior quarters and still to be shipped in the coming quarters. Our total bookings dropped to ‚Ç¨676 million in Q3 compared to a record level of ‚Ç¨943 million in Q2. Excluding the reduction of impacted orders from China  the decrease in our Q3 orders compared to Q2 would have been much more moderate. The negative impact from new export regulations is also reflected in our guidance for Q4 sales.‚ÄùTaking into account the guidance for Q4  ASM is on track for strong growth in 2022  its sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth  and is expected to clearly outperform the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market in 2022. During the third quarter  the semiconductor end-market further slowed down  with significant declines in the PC and smartphone segments. Combined with an expected deceleration in global economic growth WFE spending is forecasted to be down in 2023  in particular the memory segment. While it is too early to provide guidance for 2023  we believe our company is in good shape  on the back of an expected robust backlog by year-end  our strong position in the leading-edge logic/foundry segment  and solid traction with newly introduced products and applications.‚ÄùOUTLOOKFor Q4  at constant currencies  we expect sales of ‚Ç¨600-630 million  which includes a negative impact from the new US export regulations  as explained above. The revenue guidance for Q4 also includes the revenue contribution from LPE  following the closure of the acquisition on October 3  2022. Our expectation that we will finish the year with a continued elevated backlog is unchanged. WFE spending is now expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage in 2022.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

This next-generation technology addresses the unmet needs for identifying patients with at-risk NASH using non-invasive tests (NITs) that are not impacted by critical patient characteristics. NIS2+‚Ñ¢ demonstrated strong clinical performance in detecting at-risk NASH  while its composite scores were not impacted by the status of important subpopulations such as Type-2 diabetes  age and sex. While NIS4¬Æ‚Äôs performance was compelling  the composite score distributions were significantly impacted in some subpopulations. In addition  the increased robustness and simplicity of NIS2+‚Ñ¢ technology (from a 4 to 2-biomarker panel) allows for a wider and easier application in clinical settings.The second poster demonstrates NIS2+‚Ñ¢ as an effective screening tool for the enrollment of patients with at-risk NASH in clinical trials  reducing liver biopsy failure rates and associated costs without inflating the number of patients to screen.The data in the third poster puts forward NIS2+‚Ñ¢ as a valuable prognostic tool for early detection of fibrosis progression in at-risk NASH patients with significant fibrosis (F2) towards advanced fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis (F4).In November 2021  NIS4¬Æ technology‚Äôs utility was validated in a Stage 1 study1 undertaken by the Non-Invasive Biomarkers of Metabolic Liver Disease (NIMBLE) initiative of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs Biomarkers Consortium as demonstrating a strong and unique performance in identifying patients with at-risk NASH.2Dr. Vlad Ratziu  Professor at Sorbonne University and Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in Paris  France commented: ‚ÄúThe timely diagnosis of patients with at-risk NASH constitutes a critical unmet medical need  and therefore we welcome this next-generation diagnostic tool. NIS2+‚Ñ¢ simplifies the analytical process with only two biomarkers  is more robust in terms of composite scores across critical subpopulations of interest and can be implemented widely in clinical practice. I anticipate that in clinical practice  NIS2+‚Ñ¢ will be a diagnostic test of choice to select NASH patients in need for pharmacotherapy  by bypassing the need for liver biopsy ‚Äì a real progress for patient management. Moreover  there is a need for non-invasive tests to facilitate enrollment in NASH clinical trials  so that the number of liver biopsies  with their many challenges  can be reduced.‚ÄùPOSTER PRESENTATIONSPoster Number 1: #2484Title: Derivation and Validation of the NIS2+‚Ñ¢ Blood-Based Biomarker Panel  An Improvement of NIS4¬Æ Technology for the Identification of At-Risk NASHAuthors: Harrison SA  Ratziu V et al.Poster Number 2: #2503Title: NIS2+‚Ñ¢ Technology as a Screening Tool for Enrollment of Patient with At-Risk NASH in Clinical TrialsAuthors: Ratziu V et al.Poster Number 3: #2522Title: NIS2+‚Ñ¢  an Improvement of NIS4¬Æ Technology for Early Detection of Fibrosis Progression in Patients with Liver Biopsy-Proven At-Risk NASH and F2Authors: Ratziu V et al.ABOUT THE LIVER MEETING¬ÆThe Liver Meeting¬Æ organized by the AASLD is one of the most important hepatology congresses for the medical and scientific community.

In 2021 and 2022  significant price increases have been implemented to offset the effects of purchase price inflation  and therefore the Group also measures the change in like-for-like sales including price adjustments in the CIS countries.Story continues1. Third quarter 2022 turnoverNet revenue for the Group was 1 005 million euros  up by +24.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Organic growth was +12.0% including the sales price increases in the CIS region implemented at the beginning of the year(1). The total effect of the sales price increases implemented across all segments is +11.9% on average compared to the third quarter of 2021.The EMEA segment achieved a turnover of 220 million euros  up +1.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021  including an unfavourable currency effect of -1.3% and +2.7% of organic growth. In an uncertain economic environment  the Group has seen a contraction in demand  amplified by inventory reductions across the value chain. Residential activity is significantly lower than in 2021  which was marked by a clear recovery. Commercial activity was also down in most categories with the exception of LVT tiles. However  sales price increases compensated for inflation in raw materials  transport and energy.The North America segment reported a revenue of 251 million euros  up +29.5% compared to the third quarter of 2021  reflecting solid like-for-like growth of +11.5% and a positive currency effect due to the appreciation of the dollar against the euro (+18.0%). Sales volumes and prices contributed to organic growth  which is well oriented in the Commercial Office  Healthcare and Education segments using carpet  accessories and vinyl or rubber flooring. The volume of activity in Residential is down in a market that is clearly slowing down.Revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to 191 million euros  up +16.5% compared to the third quarter of 2021  thanks to a positive currency effect mainly due to the appreciation of the rouble (+18.0%). The activity is slightly down organically (-1.5% including sales price increases in the CIS countries). In Russia  the market was penalised by the geopolitical context and Tarkett's activity was down by approximately -25% in volume compared to the previous year. Sales are higher than the previous year due to price increases and the appreciation of the rouble. At the end of September  sales in Russia represented approximately 9% of total Group sales. APAC and Latin America had an excellent quarter with strong volume growth and continued price increases.As expected  the Sport segment continues to show very strong growth for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was 343 million euros  up by +46.4% and including +30.5% organic growth compared to the third quarter of 2021. The market is extremely dynamic in North America for both artificial turf and athletic tracks  two segments where Tarkett benefits from its leadership.2. Outlook to end 2022 and short-term objectivesThe macroeconomic context poses significant uncertainties for activity at the end of this year and the beginning of 2023.In Europe  geopolitical tensions  inflation and uncertainty over gas and electricity supplies will continue to weigh on demand levels in a recessionary environment. The group expects business volumes in the fourth quarter to be lower than in the previous year.In North America  the significant rise in interest rates initially led to a slowdown in the residential market  to which the Group has only moderate exposure. Commercial activity has been better oriented so far  but could stall in a context of sluggish economic growth.The war in Ukraine will continue to weigh on the level of activity in the CIS area  although it is not possible at this stage to assess whether the market will stabilise at the current level (around -25% compared to 2021).The North American sports market is expected to continue to grow. The Group‚Äôs order book remains high and allows us to anticipate a good start to the year 2023.The slowdown in volumes in some of the Group's geographies will not generate all the expected productivity gains. They are estimated at between 5 to 10 million euros for the whole of 2022 (compared to the planned 15 to 20 million euros). To take account of the contraction in activity  the Group is taking immediate measures to reduce costs  particularly in Europe where most industrial sites have significantly reduced their production volumes.(1) Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency movements and are therefore excluded from the ‚Äúorganic growth‚Äù indicator. Excluding these price increases  organic growth was +9.7% (see Annexe 1)The purchase prices of the main raw materials are stabilising due to a slowdown in demand. Nevertheless  the sharp rise in energy prices will continue to fuel a high price level in the coming months. The Group confirms the estimate for 2022 of the negative effect of higher procurement costs: about 280 million euros more than in 2021.Since the beginning of the year  Tarkett has implemented significant sales price increases that will neutralise the effect of inflation over the whole year.The Group believes that the measures implemented will enable to achieve an Adjusted EBITDA level for the full year 2022 higher than that of 2021.This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

The exchange rate effect is obtained by applying the prior year‚Äôs exchange rate to sales for the current year and calculating the difference with sales for the current year. It also includes the effect of price adjustments in the CIS countries intended to offset the change in local currencies against the euro.The effect of changes in scope is composed of: current year sales by entities not included in the scope of consolidation in the same period of the prior year  until the anniversary of their consolidation; the reduction in sales related to divested businesses not included in the current year's scope of consolidation but included in sales for the same period in the previous year until the anniversary date of the divestiture.In millions of euros 2022 revenue 2021 revenue Change Of which volume Of which sales prices Of which CIS sales prices Of which exchange rate effect Of which effect of changes in scope Q1 Group Total 684.7 558.8 +22.5% +6.4% +8.8% +4.1% +3.3% - Of which organic growth +15.2% Of which sales price increases +12.9% Q2 Group Total 879.3 702.4 +25.2% +3.3% +9.3% +3.3% +9.3% +0.1% Of which organic growth +12.6% Of which sales price increases +12.6% S1 Group Total 1 564.0 1 261.2 +24.0% +4.6% +9.1% +3.6% +6.6% +0.1% Of which organic growth +13.8% Of which sales price increases +12.7% Q3 Group Total 1 005.4 809.4 +24.2% +0.1% +9.6% +2.3% +12.2% +0.1% Of which organic growth +9.7% Of which sales price increases +11.9% 9M Group Total 2 569.4 2 070.6 +24.1% +2.9% +9.2% +3.2% +8.7% +0.1% Of which organic growth +12.2% Of which sales price increases +12.4%Revenue in millions of euros 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change Of which organic growth Organic change including price changes in CIS (1) EMEA 707.4 662.6 +6.8% +7.7% +7.7% North America 702.2 546.5 +28.5% +14.4% +14.4% CIS  APAC & Latin America 482.1 418.7 +15.1% -11.5% +4.3% Sports 677.7 442.7 +53.1% +38.4% +38.4% Group Total 2 569.4 2 070.6 +24.1% +12.2% +15.3%2/ Bridges in millions of euros 2022Revenue by segmentQ3 2021 809.4 +/- EMEA +6.0 +/- North America +22.4 +/- CIS  APAC & Latin America -22.7 +/- Sports +70.0 Q3 2022 like-for-like scope and exchange rate 885.1 +/- Scope effect +1.4 +/- Currencies +74.6 +/- Lag effect in CIS +44.3 Q3 2022 1 005.49M 2021 2 070.6 +/- EMEA +49.8 +/- North America +78.6 +/- CIS  APAC & Latin America -48.0 +/- Sports +167.6 9M 2022 Like-for-Like 2 318.6 +/- Scope effect +2.6 +/- Currencies +148.9 +/- ‚ÄúLag effect‚Äù in CIS +99.3 9M 2022 2 569.4***Attachment,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,mixed,0.46,0.19,0.35,True,English,"['sales price increases', 'Q3 2022 revenue', 'Turnover growth', 'solid performance', 'Sports', 'The North America segment', 'The Supervisory Board', 'alternative performance indicators', 'uncertain economic environment', 'unfavourable currency effect', 'positive currency effect', 'Selling price adjustments', 'positive inflation balance', 'significant price increases', 'sales price increases', 'Third quarter 2022 results', 'third consecutive quarter', 'purchase price inflation', 'less dynamic market', 'The EMEA segment', 'Rising sales prices', 'organic growth‚Äù indicator', 'Moderate volume growth', 'Third quarter 2022 turnover', 'strong volume growth', 'Strong revenue growth', 'total Group sales', 'total effect', 'strong growth', 'price changes', 'currency movements', 'solid performance', 'The Group', 'Sport segment', 'significant uncertainties', 'recessionary environment', 'Sales volumes', 'excellent quarter', '+30.5% organic growth', 'Latin America', 'Turnover growth', 'continued growth', 'currency effects', 'distribution chain', 'first half', 'good level', 'inventory reductions', 'value chain', 'clear recovery', 'most categories', 'LVT tiles', 'raw materials', 'Commercial Office', 'rubber flooring', 'geopolitical context', 'artificial turf', 'athletic tracks', 'short-term objectives', 'macroeconomic context', 'geopolitical tensions', 'electricity supplies', 'business volumes', 'stable volume', '1,005 million euros', '220 million euros', '251 million euros', '191 million euros', 'energy prices', 'Euronext Paris', 'Net revenue', 'Education segments', 'previous year', 'two segments', 'Organic change', 'CIS countries', 'CIS region', 'Commercial activity', 'Q3 2022 revenue', 'Residential activity', 'demand levels', 'Tarkett', 'Sports', 'slowdown', 'destocking', 'Asia', 'TKTT', 'IFRS', 'detail', 'appendix', 'millions', 'APAC', 'Story', 'beginning', 'contraction', 'exception', 'transport', 'appreciation', 'dollar', 'Healthcare', 'carpet', 'accessories', 'vinyl', 'Russia', 'September', 'leadership', 'Outlook', 'Europe', 'uncertainty', 'gas', '2021']",2022-10-25,2022-10-26,finance.yahoo.com

Data from 40 patients implanted with the alfapump in the Pivotal Cohort met all primary effectiveness endpoints of the study with statistical significance and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations. These positive data will enable the Company to file a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023  intended to support the approval of the alfapump in the US.Professor Florence Wong  University of Toronto  Hepatologist at Toronto General Hospital  Ontario  Canada and Principal Investigator for the POSEIDON study  commented: ‚ÄúAscites imposes a significant health care burden and negative impact on quality of life for this large and growing patient population of patients with liver cirrhosis. These positive top-line results are very encouraging  indicating that the alfapump could provide great benefits to patients with cirrhosis and ascites  and dramatically reduce their visits to the hospital for paracentesis. The safety data regarding the primary safety endpoint are in line with expectations and reassuring for the potential of the alfapump as a long-term treatment in this patient population. I look forward to presenting these data at a scientific congress in due course to discuss this important innovation for a patient population that is in clear need of expanded treatment options.‚ÄùStory continuesIan Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer at Sequana Medical  added: ‚ÄúWe are delighted with these excellent results  and the team is focused on bringing the alfapump to this large and growing patient population. We are grateful to the patients  clinicians and their teams who participated in this landmark study. The third party market assessment highlights the large number of recurrent or refractory liver ascites patients  with strong forecast growth driven in part by the Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (‚ÄúNASH‚Äù) epidemic. We believe that there is a clear need for improved treatment options for this important patient group  and we are preparing to commercialize the alfapump through our focused commercial team.‚ÄùPositive top-line data from 40 patients in the Pivotal CohortForty patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis have been implanted with the alfapump in the Pivotal Cohort of the POSEIDON study. Over one third of these patients had NASH or combined NASH etiology.The primary effectiveness endpoint hypotheses include:1) median per-patient ratio of post-implant three-month observation period (month four to six) (‚ÄúPost-Implant Observation Period‚Äù) to the pre-implant three-month observation period (‚ÄúPre-Implant Observation Period‚Äù) with respect to number of therapeutic paracentesis (‚ÄúTP‚Äù) is less than 0.5 (or a median reduction of at least 50%); and2) at least 50% of patients achieve a 50% reduction in the requirement for TP in the same period.Data from the Pivotal Cohort patients substantially exceeded the pre-defined thresholds for study success as shown in the table below.Pivotal Cohort N=40 %i p-valueii 1) Frequency of TPa. median per-patient ratiob. mean per-patient ratio100% reduction82% reductionP<0.001-2) Proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in number of TP Post- vs Pre-Implant77% of patientsP<0.001Of the 40 patients implanted with the alfapump in the Pivotal Cohort  26 patients completed alfapump therapy through day 180 post-implantation. These 26 patients have a median reduction of 100% (mean reduction of 93%) in frequency of TP in the Post-Implant Observation Period vs Pre-Implant Observation Period and 92% of patients have at least a 50% reduction in number of TP in the same periodiii. Pre-specified imputation methods were used to calculate the primary effectiveness endpoints in the other 14 patients that had exited the study prior to completing the six months post-implantation period. Of these 14 patients  eight were due to reasons such as death or withdrawal due to unrelated adverse event or for liver transplant and six were due to alfapump system  procedure or therapy related reasons.The primary safety endpoint is the combined rate of i) open surgical re-intervention (requiring general anesthesia or laparotomy) due to pump system related adverse event or to restore pump functionality  ii) pump explant (without replacement) due to pump system related adverse event  or iii) pump system related death from time of pump implant through six months post-implantation as adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). There were six primary safety events in the 40 Pivotal Cohort patients  which is in line with Company expectations. Of the six primary safety events  three were explants due to wound or skin erosion  and three were explants due to patient-reported discomfort (all patient-reported discomfort events were adjudicated by the CEC as moderate severity). At the time of the primary endpoint analysis  no unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEiv) occurred during the course of the POSEIDON study.Additional secondary efficacy and safety endpoints are being analysed and detailed results from the POSEIDON study will be submitted for presentation at a forthcoming medical liver meeting in 2023.Poster presentation at AASLD The Liver MeetingData from the Roll-In Cohort of POSEIDONv have been selected for a poster presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting  taking place in Washington  DC from 4 to 8 November 2022. The poster  titled ‚ÄúAn Automatic Low Flow Ascites Pump Improves Ascites Control and Quality of Life In Patients with Cirrhosis and Recurrent Ascites‚Äù will be presented by Dr. Florence Wong  MD  FAASLD  University of Toronto on Sunday  November 6th between 1:00-2:00 pm EST. Sequana Medical management will attend The Liver Meeting from 4 to 6 November and is available to meet.Large and growing population of patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in North AmericaThe Company has commissioned a market analysis by an international consultancy group that is experienced in such work to assess the North American market of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Through a detailed analysis of claims from Medicare and multiple commercial payers  as well as a review of published literature  the analysis estimates there to be more than 60 000 patients in North America in 2022 with recurrent or refractory ascites. This population is forecast to grow at six to seven percent annually  reaching over 140 000 patients in 2032  with NASH being a major driver of this growth.C onference Call and WebcastSequana Medical will host a conference call with live webcast presentation today at 15:00 CET / 08:00 ET.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they are implanted with the alfapump and will be used for primary endpoint analysis. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in therapeutic paracentesis in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival.For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About fluid overload in liver cirrhosis (AKA ascites)Fluid accumulation in the abdomen is a significant and common complication of liver cirrhosis. Approximately 10% of these patients do not respond to diuretic drugs and most require recurrent external drainage (AKA paracentesis)  an invasive and painful procedure that only provides temporary benefit  require frequent hospitalizations and severely impacts their quality of life. The North American market for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is estimated at over 60 000 patients in 2022  and this number is expected to grow at 6-7% per annum  reaching over 140 000 patients in 2032 due to the dramatic growth of fatty liver disease / non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer.

Beyond 22-25   our new strategic plan  is a response to today‚Äôs new paradigm shaped by a disruptive change in work habits  the energy transition and the increasing digitization of the economy. As the everyday platform for people at work  we are seeking to further assert ourselves as a responsible player  promoting socially  economically and environmentally virtuous solutions. Our products create purchasing power for employees and provide employers with tools to increase employee engagement. They encourage healthy eating and support economic players as they transition to cleaner forms of transportation. They also generate business for our partner merchants and drive greater efficiency for businesses.Our strategic plan  Beyond 22-25   is designed to take full advantage of our B2B2C digital platform business model. We will continue to scale our core business by stepping up our investments in technology and capitalizing on our business excellence in markets that are still largely underpenetrated. We will extend our scope by accelerating the development of our solutions beyond meal benefits  beyond fuel cards and beyond payment solutions. We will also create new partnerships to distribute our solutions and aggregate third-party products on our own platform. We will further leverage the power of our data to create new sources of revenue. And we will explore new opportunities to expand in new markets. Our plan is based on sustained organic growth  but also on our ability to seize external growth opportunities. We are now in an ideal position to scale our platform advantage. That is why for the next three years we have set ourselves even bigger ambitions for sustainable and profitable growth than in our previous plans. And  based on these targets  we can reasonably aim for total revenue of around ‚Ç¨5 billion by 2030.‚ÄùEDENRED HAS PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMED ITS MARKETS SINCE 2016 BY SUCCESSFULLY DISRUPTING ITS BUSINESS MODELA disruption based on a four-pronged approachThe successful execution of the Fast Forward and Next Frontier strategic plans has enabled Edenred to disrupt its business model since 2016  positioning it as market leader today.The Group has considerably enhanced its business portfolio  notably with numerous Employee Benefits solutions other than meal benefits (Beyond Food) and the development of Fleet & Mobility Solutions other than fuel cards (Beyond Fuel). These solutions meet the needs of companies and employees  and are increasingly quick to adopt and easy to use. At the same time  Edenred has invested increasingly heavily in its technology assets to establish itself as an innovation leader. In still largely underpenetrated markets  Edenred has also developed a segmented and optimized go-to-market strategy  enabling it to strengthen its market leadership  particularly in the SME segment. Lastly  a commitment to ESG lies at the heart of the Group‚Äôs transformation  as notably expressed through its Ideal CSR policy launched in 2017 and reinforced by its solutions that encourage more virtuous behaviors.Today  Edenred benefits from the unique nature of its B2B2C platform  which connects 52 million users and more than 2 million merchants via approximately 950 000 corporate clients. With more than 250 digital programs in 45 countries  Edenred offers specific-purpose payment solutions and services in three business lines: Employee Benefits  notably for food (such as meal benefits) and incentives (such as gift cards and employee engagement platforms); Fleet & Mobility Solutions (such as multi-energy  maintenance  toll and parking solutions); and Complementary Solutions (such as corporate payments). True to the Group‚Äôs purpose  ‚ÄúEnrich connections. For good.‚Äù  these solutions have a positive impact for all of its stakeholders  enhancing users‚Äô well-being and purchasing power  improving companies‚Äô attractiveness and efficiency  and vitalizing the employment market and the local economy. They also foster access to healthier food  more environmentally friendly products and softer mobility.Financial results that reflect the Group‚Äôs successful transformationWith business volume of approximately ‚Ç¨35 billion  Edenred has reached another dimension. Thanks to its profound transformation  Edenred was able to generate sustainable and profitable growth over the 2016-2022 period2. In each of its businesses and geographies  the Group‚Äôs technology assets have been a key differentiating factor in outperforming its markets and generating new sources of growth. The Group‚Äôs total revenue was multiplied by 1.8 over this period  while EBITDA was almost doubled  reflecting the strong operating leverage available to the Group.BEYOND 22-25 : A PLAN TO BECOME THE GLOBAL PLATFORM OF CHOICE IN EXTENDED MARKETSIn an environment shaped by accelerating new structural trends such as changes in the working world  a new era of mobility and global ecosystem digitization  Edenred aims to become the global platform of choice in larger markets.A plan built around three priorities: Scale  Extend  ExpandEdenred operates in markets that are still largely underpenetrated and that therefore harbor considerable growth opportunities  reinforced by widespread adoption of new behaviors. Against this backdrop  the Group intends to leverage to the full its unique global platform advantage by developing a common approach in each of its business lines based on three priorities:Scale the Core ‚Äì grow further in its existing markets  which are still largely underpenetrated  notably by capitalizing on a segmented go-to-market strategy  cross-selling and up-selling in its client portfolio  and increasing user monetization.Extend Beyond ‚Äì accelerate the Beyond Food  Beyond Fuel and Beyond Payment strategies by launching and deploying more value-added services for its clients  partner merchants and users.Expand in New Businesses ‚Äì expand into promising new geographies  such as the United States  the world‚Äôs largest economy.In the larger addressable markets within each of its business lines  Edenred is ideally positioned to seize new growth opportunities thanks to its enriched business model. The Group can  for example  leverage its unique and flexible digital platform comprising four layers: stakeholder experiences  business applications  digital services and infrastructure. The platform is a truly differentiating technology asset and will be used to enable the Group to aggregate  orchestrate and distribute a wider range of B2B2C services  incorporating third-party solutions into the mix and extending the reach of Edenred solutions through indirect distribution channels.A unique platform serving an enriched business modelEdenred also intends to continue optimizing its unique business model based on low B2B2C acquisition costs  high levels of user engagement and data monetization. In this way  the Group will penetrate deeper into its markets  particularly the SME segment. At the same time  Edenred plans to further increase user engagement  thanks to a widespread mobile-first approach and the extensive use of satisfaction measurement tools. Lastly  the Group aims to step up sales of its data-powered solutions and services.BIGGER FINANCIAL AMBITIONS AND A COMMITMENT TO NET ZERO CARBON BY 2050The Beyond 22-25 strategic plan will drive sustainable and profitable growth and generate high levels of free cash flow over the 2022-2025 period. It is underpinned by an ambitious financial trajectory with higher annual financial targets than for the previous plan:Annual like-for-like EBITDA growth >+12%Annual free cash flowithEBITDA conversion rate >70%Edenred has also placed ESG at the heart of its Beyond 22-25 plan  announcing an acceleration in its extra-financial commitments. In line with SBTi targets  the Group has committed to net zero carbon by 2050. It has also stepped up the objectives of its Ideal CSR policy  with the aim of becoming  by 2030  an employer of choice and a true Company for Good through its solutions that encourage more virtuous and responsible behaviors.A BALANCED CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT POLICYThe Group will pursue an ambitious capital deployment policy over the 2022-2025 period based on a virtuous balance between technology investments  acquisitions and shareholder returns  while reaffirming its commitment to maintaining a Strong Investment Grade rating.Increased investmentsEdenred plans to continue investing in its platform to fuel the Group‚Äôs sustainable and profitable growth and maintain its technology leadership. It expects annual investment spend to represent between 7% and 8% of total revenue.A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions to enrich the Group‚Äôs portfolio of solutionsBuilding on its sound financial position  historically low level of debt and strong cash flow generation  Edenred intends to seize external growth opportunities while maintaining its Strong Investment Grade rating. The Group currently has M&A firepower of ‚Ç¨2 billion. The Group will therefore target opportunities in line with the strategic ambitions of its Beyond 22-25 plan ‚Äì namely Scale  Extend and Expand ‚Äì within its three business lines:In Employee Benefits: make bolt-on acquisitions to consolidate its position as world leader in this market and continue to enrich its Beyond Food solutions beyond organic development;In Fleet & Mobility Solutions: continue to extend its Beyond Fuel range of value-added services to become the global platform for greener B2B mobility;In Complementary Solutions: develop Corporate Payment Services by targeting new business segments and expand its offering along the value chain.A policy of progressive dividend growthLastly  the Beyond 22-25 plan will see the Group pursue a policy of progressive dividend growth over the period  resulting in an increase in absolute value each year.***The Capital Markets Day event will be webcast live on www.edenred.com starting at 10:15 a.m. (CEST).

(TSXV.DMI)(OTCQB:DMIFF)(FRA:DC3A)  (""Diamcor"" or  the ""Company"") today reported its quarterly financial statements and related management discussion and analysis for the quarter ended September 30  2022.HighlightsOperating results improved quarter over quarter with the tender and sale of 3 776.33 carats of rough diamonds for the interim period ended September 30  2022 (3 061.70 - June 30  2022)  generating increased revenue of (USD) $2 099 951.32 ($557 559.22 - June 30  2022)  resulting in an average price of (USD) $556.08 per carat ($182.11 - June 30  2022).

The Company has a well-established operation in South Africa with a proven history of supplying rough diamonds to the world market. Diamcor has established a long-term strategic alliance with world famous luxury retailer Tiffany & Co. and is now in the final stages of developing the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project co-located with De Beer's flagship Venetia mine.Story continuesAbout the Tiffany & Co. AllianceThe Company has established a long-term strategic alliance and first right of refusal with Tiffany & Co. Canada  a subsidiary of world famous New York based Tiffany & Co.  to purchase up to 100% of the future production of rough diamonds from the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project at then current prices to be determined by the parties on an ongoing basis. In conjunction with this first right of refusal  Tiffany & Co. Canada also provided the Company with financing to advance the Project. Tiffany & Co. is owned by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH)  a publicly traded company which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange (Euronext) under the symbol LVMH and on the OTC under the symbol LVMHF. For additional information on Tiffany & Co.  please visit their website at www.tiffany.com.About Krone-Endora at VenetiaIn February 2011  Diamcor acquired the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project from De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited  consisting of the prospecting rights over the farms Krone 104 and Endora 66  which represent a combined surface area of approximately 5 888 hectares directly adjacent to De Beers' flagship Venetia Diamond Mine in South Africa. On September 11  2014  the Company announced that the South African Department of Mineral Resources had granted a Mining Right for the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project encompassing 657.71 hectares of the Project's total area of 5 888 hectares. The Company has also submitted an application for a mining right over the remaining areas of the Project. The deposits which occur on the properties of Krone and Endora have been identified as a higher-grade ""Alluvial"" basal deposit which is covered by a lower-grade upper ""Eluvial"" deposit. The deposits are proposed to be the result of the direct-shift (in respect to the ""Eluvial"" deposit) and erosion (in respect to the ""Alluvial"" deposit) of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia Kimberlite areas. The deposits on Krone-Endora occur in two layers with a maximum total depth of approximately 15.0 metres from surface to bedrock  allowing for a very low-cost mining operation to be employed with the potential for near-term diamond production from a known high-quality source. Krone-Endora also benefits from the significant development of infrastructure and services already in place due to its location directly adjacent to the Venetia Mine.Qualified Person Statement:Mr. James P.

New business ramp-ups in Latin America  and particularly in the mining sector  more than offset the lack of new oil & gas projects and some contract losses in the Asia-Pacific region.Healthcare & SeniorsREVENUES BY REGION(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 RESTATED ORGANIC GROWTH North America 3 047 2 642 +6.1% Europe 2 106 1 838 +0.7% Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa 305 281 +8.5% HEALTHCARE & SENIORS TOTAL 5 459 4 762 +4.0%Healthcare & Seniors revenues amounted to 5.5 billion euros  up +4.0% organically.In North America  organic growth was +6.1%  boosted by cross-selling  progressive recovery in hospital retail sales and Senior occupancy and pricing  particularly in the last two quarters. The contribution of net new business remained slightly negative  as the signings during the year have not yet fed through into revenues.In Europe  organic growth was +0.7% impacted by the early closure of the Testing Centers in the UK at the end of March. This shortfall was compensated by the combination of pricing  new contracts in Seniors in France and some increase in volumes  especially in retail sales.In Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa  organic revenue growth was a solid +8.5%  resulting from increased volumes  pricing and some new business.EducationREVENUES BY REGION(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 RESTATED ORGANIC GROWTH North America 2 798 2 013 +27.9% Europe 769 963 +6.5% Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa 70 65 +24.0% EDUCATION TOTAL 3 637 3 041 +22.0%Fiscal 2022 revenues in Education were 3.6 billion euros  up +22.0% organically.In North America  organic growth was +27.9%  reflecting the reopening of schools and universities from the beginning of the 2021 academic year. However  events and special catering activities remained restricted due to staff shortages and ongoing fears of the pandemic. In the fourth quarter  summer camp and conference activity was solid and the 2022 start of the academic year was helped by an extra day and higher levels of staffing.In Europe  revenue was up +6.5% organically. All schools and Universities were fully opened. However  meal volumes were impacted by high levels of absenteeism due to Covid-19 waves.In Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa  organic growth was +24.0% reflecting reopening of schools and universities in China and India.BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICESFiscal 2022 Benefits & Rewards Services revenue amounted to 865 million euros  up +16.2%  helped by a +2.6% impact from currencies  offset somewhat by the impact of net disposals of -0.6%.

Financial revenues were also up strongly supported by rising interest rates  particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe.Services Diversification was down -1.3% organically for the year. Public Benefits fell back significantly during the year after a very strong Covid-linked performance  offsetting the solid growth in Mobility solutions in Latin America.REVENUES BY REGION(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 ORGANIC GROWTH Europe  USA and Asia 558 499 +14.4% Latin America 307 246 +13.8% BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 865 745 +14.2%Organic revenue growth was strong across all geographies  respectively +14.4% in Europe  USA and Asia  and +13.8% in Latin America  accelerating quarter by quarter.This performance was due to strong net new business in all key markets as well as sustained increase in face values.

The margin came out at 4.6% up +170 bps or +160 bps excluding currencies  helped by the strong dollar particularly in Healthcare and Education where the weight of North American revenues is the highest. The performance by segment at constant rates is as follows:Business & Administrations Underlying operating profit was multiplied by nearly four times  up +263.7%. As a result  the margin was up +230 bps to 3.5%. This improved performance reflects the flow-through of the significant improvement in the activity levels in Corporate Services and Sports & Leisure  operational efficiencies and strong price increases and mitigation to offset inflation.Underlying operating profit was multiplied by nearly four times  up +263.7%.

In Healthcare & Seniors   the +7.6% increase in Underlying operating profit resulted in a margin of 6.5%  down -10 bps  in a highly inflationary environment  particularly in North America.

In Education  Underlying operating profit was up +144.5% and the margin up +250 bps to 5.0% thanks to the flow-through of the revenue recovery  particularly in North America. High inflation and staff shortages have been offset by very significant mitigation efforts on the ground  as well as pricing in North America. Pricing has been more difficult in France where the national inflation index used in the Schools contracts has underperformed our input cost increases.Benefits & Rewards Services Underlying operating profit was up +33.2%  or +30.5% excluding the positive impact of currencies. The margin increased to 28.6% up +360 bps or +370 bps excluding currencies  helped by the strong acceleration in volumes and  in particular  the financial revenues from quarter to quarter throughout the year. While processing costs have remained stable relative to revenues  all other cost increases have been contained.The GET efficiency program has provided a significant improvement in profitability in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022. Half of the initiatives were aimed at protecting the gross profit margin by adapting on-site costs to the new post-Covid levels of activity and to compensate for the end of government aid. The other half of the program was aimed at structurally reducing SG&A for the long-term by simplifying the structures in the Group  to free up capacity to invest in growth and to enhance margins.Fiscal 2022 results benefited from the final tranche of cost savings of 164 million euros  of which 98 million euros in cost avoidance and 66 million euros in SG&A. The cash impact for the year was 73 million euros.GET PROGRAM FISCAL 2020 FISCAL 2021 FISCAL 2022 TARGET (in million euros) CUMULATED NUMBERS Total exceptional costs 158 312 322 350 Cash impact (75) (217) (290) (315) SG&A savings ‚Äî 91 157 175 Gross profit cost avoidance ‚Äî 127 225 175 Total savings ‚Äî 218 382 350 Savings/Costs 119% 100%Cumulated  the GET program has cost 322 million euros  generated 382 million euros of annual savings  with a cash impact of 290 million euros.

This significant reduction is due to the end of the GET program  with only 10 million euros of restructuring costs  a spill-over from Fiscal 2021  compared to 153 million euros in the previous year  and 117 million euros of gains related to the disposals program.As a result  the Operating Profit recovered to 1 054 million euros compared to 339 million euros in the previous year.(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 1 059 578 Net scope change impacts 50 (32) Restructuring and rationalization costs (10) (153) Amortization of purchased intangible assets (46) (33) Other 1 (21) Other Operating income and expenses (5) (239) OPERATING PROFIT 1 054 339Fiscal 2022 Net financial expenses decreased to 87 million euros against 106 million euros in the previous year. The reduction came from the net effect of the debt reimbursements and issuance in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022  an increase in interest income related to higher levels of activity and some positive currency impacts. The blended cost of debt at Fiscal 2022 year end was stable at 1.6% relative to year end Fiscal 2021.The tax charge was up significantly to 264 million euros  reflecting the higher pre-tax profit. However  the Effective tax rate on Pre-tax profit (excluding the share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method) of 960 million euros was 27.5%  back down to a more normal rate  against 43.9% last year.The share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method was stable at 8 million euros. Profit attributed to non-controlling interests was 9 million euros compared to the previous year amount of -2 million euros.As a result  Group net income was multiplied by five to reach 695 million euros  compared to 139 million euros in Fiscal 2021. Underlying net profit adjusted for Other operating income and expenses net of tax doubled to reach 699 million euros  compared to 346 million euros in Fiscal 2021.1.6 Earnings per sharePublished EPS was 4.75 euros against 0.95 euro in Fiscal 2021. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2022 was more or less stable at 146 295 576 compared to 146 004 484 shares for Fiscal 2021. As a result of much lower Other income and expenses  Underlying EPS was very close to the published number  amounting to 4.78 euros  double the previous year.1.7 Proposed dividendThe Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of 2.40‚Ç¨  up +20% compared to Fiscal 2021  in line with our policy of a pay-out ratio of 50% of Underlying net profit.2 Consolidated financial position2.1 Cash flowsCash flows for the period were as follows:(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 Operating cash flow 1 243 766 Change in working capital excluding change in BRS financial assets(1) (63) 171 IFRS 16 outflow (208) (242) Net capital expenditure (341) (211) Free cash flow(2) 631 483 Net acquisitions 14 (42) Share buy-backs (13) (11) Dividends paid to shareholders (294) ‚Äî Other changes (including scope and exchange rates) (128) (40) (Increase)/decrease in net debt 210 390(1) Excluding change in financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity of -145 million euros in Fiscal 2022versus 45 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Total change in working capital as reported in consolidated accounts:in Fiscal 2022: -208 million euros = -63 million euros - 145 million eurosand in Fiscal 2021: 216 million euros = 171 million euros + 45 million euros.(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group‚Äôs performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable).To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).Free cash flow  adjusted for IFRS 16  was 631 million euros against 483 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Operating cash flow of 1 243 million euros improved significantly compared to the previous year at 766 million euros  boosted by the strong recovery in Underlying operating profit and by the Benefits & Rewards Services indemnity from the Hungarian government related to closure of the business for 34 million euros.The Working capital outflow in Fiscal 2022 of 63 million euros was due to some significant exceptional items such as restructuring costs  a cash contribution to the UK pension found for 71 million euros  the unwinding of government Covid-linked payment delays for 117 million euros  the reimbursement of the Tokyo Olympics hospitality packages for 55 million euros and the Benefits & Rewards fine related to the dispute with the French competition authorities which is being paid monthly.Net capital expenditure  including client investments  increased to 341 million euros  and 1.6% of revenues  compared to 211 million euros in the preceding year  at 1.2% of revenues. Gross capex was 478 million euros  or 2.3% of revenues. Digital and IT investments accounted for 30% of the gross spend  with the remainder focused on client facing investments.Benefits & Rewards Services continued to invest heavily  at a rate of 9.1% of revenues  with 93% of its investments in IT and digital. The Business & Administrations gross capital expenditure to revenues ratio was at 1.3%  nearly double last year  linked to the recovery in Sports & Leisure activity. Healthcare was also at 1.5%  the highest level in many years  due to some significant investments in several hospitals in North America and Continental Europe. On the other hand  in Education  capex to sales was down -60 bps this year at 2.7% of revenues even though the euro amount remained stable.Cash conversion was 91%  below the normal level of 100%  but including 363 million euros of negative non-recurring elements.M&A activity restarted in Fiscal 2022 with acquisition spend of 70 million euros but was more than offset by disposals of 84 million euros.After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt decreased by 210 million euros ending the year to 1 268 million euros at August 31  2022.2.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFiscal 2022 has been an active year for closing numerous disposals of non-core activities and geographies:the On-site Services activities in Morocco  the Congo and Russia;Lido in France;Non-strategic account portfolios in Australia and the Czech Republic;Benefits & Rewards activities in Russia in December 2021  followed by the On-site activities in the second half;Benefits & Rewards sports cards in Germany  Romania and Spain;The Childcare activities  completed mid-March.On the other hand  further strategic acquisitions & investments have also been made:In the Advanced Food Model  Sodexo has acquired Frontline Food Services and VendEdge in North America and an off-site production unit in China.

Orange selected Edgecore switches to deliver cutting-edge connectivity solutions for Orange‚Äôs hundreds of access Points of Presence (PoP). These locations provide 1G  10G  and 100G access services to enterprise customers. The chosen switches have a robust  high-performance design that offers the high-availability features required for telecom network PoP deployment. The disaggregated Edgecore hardware platform comes pre-loaded with the ONIE (Open Network Install Environment) software installer for the automated loading of compatible open source or commercial network operating system offerings. Orange is installing its own SONiC distribution to run on the switches. Orange relies on its developers‚Äô expertise working in conjunction with Edgecore and the SONiC community  to which Orange actively contributes  to develop their own networking software solutions.Orange‚Äôs move towards disaggregation allows for more flexible and cost-effective designs  faster deployments with a simpler IT integration  and the ability to utilize a single operating system on networking equipment from different hardware vendors. This change also helps improve Orange‚Äôs network procurement lead times.Heimdall Siao  President of Edgecore said  ‚ÄúAs the leader in disaggregated open networking solutions  Edgecore is excited to be involved in this disaggregated and community SONiC networking project with Orange in a telecom use case. Edgecore‚Äôs switches running SONiC software provide the high-capacity throughput required for access networks. And  by utilizing Edgecore‚Äôs carrier grade and proven robust designs  Orange is able to deploy solutions in the most demanding of carrier networks. This successful experience in Orange‚Äôs network proves that disaggregated open networking solutions are robust and capable of handling the most demanding of network environments.‚ÄùJean Luc Vuillemin  Executive Vice President of Orange International Networks  said  ‚ÄúWe are pleased to team up with Edgecore to launch our network disaggregation transformation. This joint work enables us to drastically transform the way we build and upgrade our networks. It allows us to move away from off the shelf and locked-in solutions to in-house developed solutions relying on our network developers‚Äô expertise. Upskilling our teams to master our software allows us to regain full control of our networks and therefore manage upgrades in a fast  cost-effective and sovereign way  while providing an improved and reliable service to our customers.‚ÄùThe adoption of open  disaggregated architecture by Orange represents a bold step and is a decision that helps advance the Telecom Infra Project‚Äôs (TIP) goal of accelerating the pace of innovation in the telecom industry. Both Orange and Edgecore are participants in the Telecom Infra Project (TIP)  a community that includes hundreds of companies working together to create and deploy open  innovative  disaggregated solutions in telecom networks.About Edgecore NetworksEdgecore Networks Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Accton Technology Corporation  the leading networking ODM.

This enables Worldline to provide payment solutions that are adapted to all forms of commerce and serve the business ambitions of its clients.Story continuesThanks to this strong execution and a still solid level of transaction volumes  we confirm our 2022 annual guidance and continue to steadily establish Worldline as a premium global Paytech at the heart of the European payment system.‚ÄùQ3 2022 revenue by Global Business LineIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 828 729 +13.6% Financial Services 241 237 +1.5% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 89 86 +3.4% Worldline 1 158 1 053 +10.0%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline‚Äôs Q3 2022 revenue reached ‚Ç¨ 1 158 million  representing a strong +10.0% organic growth. This achievement was notably reached thanks to the strong commercial dynamics in Merchant Services posting a +13.6% revenue organic growth  fueled by market share gains and volumes growth. Mobility & e-Transactional Services also contributed to growth with a positive underlying trend on a high comparison basis. Financial Services was up by +1.5%  a performance in line with the trajectory anticipated for the full year.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services‚Äô revenue in Q3 2022 reached ‚Ç¨ 828 million  representing a solid organic growth of +13.6%  led by a steady growth in acquiring transaction volumes  up +17% year-on-year (+33% vs. Q3 2019). By division  the growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring showed a high-teens organic growth with almost all geographies and customer segments contributing  in particular SMBs and large retailers. The division also benefited from a strong performance from DCC products  and the solid trend experienced during the holiday period which boosted travel and hospitality verticals;Payment Acceptance also contributed to the growth of Merchant Services thanks to mid-single-digit organic growth. Growth was led by Global Sales & Vertical and digital customers with the recovery from the Travel vertical compensating for the stop of Russian activities in March. Excluding the Russian effect  Payment Acceptance activities would have been up low teens organically in Q3 2022; and Digital Services delivered a low-teens organic growth with contrasted situation per geography. The dynamic was particularly strong in Germany  France and the UK  more than offsetting the low performance in the digital healthcare market.During the third quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services has been strong with numerous wins for both Commercial Acquiring and Payment Acceptance  in-store and online with new client wins and upsells with clients such  as among others  Lufthansa  MSC Cruises  FIVE  Webhallen.com  or Eurowag.In Q3  Worldline continued to engage in promising signed partnerships such as:The payment app certification by Zebra of Worldline Tap-on-Mobile allowing specialized integrators and partners to add payment on their Android devices;The single API integration of UpStream Pay dedicated to e-commerce merchants allowing connection to a vast and full suite of payment methods boosting conversion rate; andWith BigCommerce  a global SaaS based shopping cart solution that will natively integrate Worldline‚Äô online solutions to its platform. This partnership will allow all BigCommerce merchants  from start-ups to enterprise sized merchants  to have access to Worldline‚Äôs pan-European acceptance and acquiring solutions.Financial ServicesQ3 2022 was still impacted by the price decrease on the large contracts with former Equens‚Äô shareholders. In this context  Financial Services performance was in line with the trajectory expected for the full year with good volumes and new commercial developments leading to a +1.5% organic growth in Q3 2022 with ‚Ç¨ 241 million revenue. The performance of each division continued to be contrasted:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing altogether) posted a positive organic growth driven by good dynamics in Asia-Pacific as well as improved transaction volumes  mainly in Belgium and Finland  compensating for the impact of price concessions of renewed large contracts;Account Payments delivered a soft organic growth with less project activity this quarter  but still good developments on the UniCredit contract  now in run phase;Digital Banking was led by the continuing increase of authentications volumes related to e-commerce transactions due to enforcement of the PSD2 regulation  as well as authentication services  mainly in France.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached ‚Ç¨ 89 million in Q3 2022  up +3.4% organically  with positive underlying growth on a high comparison basis  led by high project activity with existing and new customers and increasing transactional revenue. The performance by division was as follow:Trusted Digitization: Double-digit growth driven by new projects signed  increased volumes on Tax collection and Digital Healthcare and a good momentum on support and project activity on eHealth solutions.e-Ticketing: Double-digit growth fueled by increased volumes in transportation and higher fare collection in Latin America  coupled with several development projects.e-Consumer & Mobility: the ramp-up of newly signed contracts and increased activities for the new secure cloud solution partially offset the effect of the high comparison basis in Connected Living & Mobility and the re-insourcing of a Contact contract with a telco operator. The momentum of the WL Contact solution observed during the last periods remains strong  as illustrated by the win of the CNAF (Caisse Nationale des Allocations Familiales) public RFP to supply a call center solution. Worldline will set up and roll out the Contact solution for the management of incoming and outgoing calls of the French welfare national organization for a period of 8 years. The service will improve call processing through a strong and scalable infrastructure and provide user-friendly interfaces.Successful completion of the sale of TSS activities to Apollo FundsAs announced on October 3  2022  Worldline completed the sale and contribution of c. 85% of its Terminals  Solutions & Services (‚ÄúTSS‚Äù) business line to Apollo Funds with the sale of the remaining c. 15% to take place on January 1st  2023  in line with the contemplated timeline. The standalone company now operates exclusively as Ingenico. While this transaction is expected to support Ingenico in its transformation plan  it also marked an important milestone in Worldline‚Äôs strategy  simplifying the Group‚Äôs structure and further increasing its focus on core payment services. The proceeds from this disposal allows Worldline to further accelerate its development and anchors the Group‚Äôs leadership in payments services. This transaction also encompasses the entry into a partnership agreement cementing the strategic and long-term relationship between Worldline and Ingenico over the next 5 years.The total consideration for Worldline is based on a current fair enterprise value of c. ‚Ç¨ 2.3 billion under the terms of the transaction  including c. ‚Ç¨ 1.7 billion upfront value and up to ‚Ç¨ 0.9 billion in preferred shares. Net of the closing price adjustments and net of taxes  Worldline will receive in aggregate c. ‚Ç¨ 1.4 billion3 as net proceeds and will remain exposed to the future value creation of Ingenico through the preferred shares for an amount of up to ‚Ç¨ 0.9 billion (c. ‚Ç¨ 0.6 billion fair value at signing date).Enrichment of Worldline value proposition in both instore and onlineIn Q3 2022  Worldline significantly enriched its value proposition for both instore and online merchants  notably through the acquisition of a 40% stake in Online Payment Platform B.V. and 55% of SoftPos.eu.Online Payment Platform (OPP) is a Dutch online PSP focusing on digital payments for marketplaces and platforms with a specific focus in the C2C segment. OPP already serves over a hundred marketplaces and platforms  such as e-Bay Kleinanzeigen  Marktplaats (both part of Adevinta)  Gumtree  Royal FloraHolland and PayPal  leveraging a strong expertise in customer support for marketplaces  including fast merchant onboarding and dispute management.The transaction is perfectly in line with Worldline‚Äôs strategic roadmap as it expands its exposure into e-commerce and brings a proven technological brick with a unique solution built from the ground up. This enables Worldline to comprehensively target the C2C marketplaces‚Äô needs to outsource their payment requirements and to focus on significant growth opportunities in the B2B and B2C marketplaces segments with a market leading scalable technology.As part of its strategy to explore new adjacencies through technologies and products acquisitions  Worldline also closed the acquisition of a 55% stake in SoftPos.eu  a Warsaw-based fintech that converts Android devices into secure payment terminals  enabling merchants to accept card payments without the need for additional hardware. Worldline also acquired a call option to buy in 24 months the remaining 45% owned by the two founders and key stakeholders of the company.This acquisition fully embeds Worldline‚Äôs objective to provide payment solutions that are adapted to all forms of commerce and serve the business ambitions of its clients. Based on SoftPos.eu  Worldline launched a new product internationally: Worldline Tap on Mobile. This unique end-to-end solution based on Android application that allows all merchants ‚Äì from micro to large ‚Äì to accept payments using a smartphone  tablet  or enterprise device through one single tap. The solution is designed to accept small amounts simply by ‚Äútap‚Äù but also larger amounts with PIN entry on the screen.2022 objectives confirmedRevenue organic growth : +8% to +10%OMDA margin : +100 to +150 basis points improvement vs. estimated 2021 proforma OMDA marginFree cash flow: circa 45% OMDA conversion rateAppendices9M 2022 revenue performance per Global Business LineWorldline‚Äôs organic revenue evolution per Global Business Line for the first nine months of 2022 was as follows:In ‚Ç¨ million 9M 2022 9M 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 2 206 1 910 +15.6% Financial Services 698 682 +2.3% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 274 255 +7.3% Worldline 3 178 2 847 +11.6%* at constant scope and exchange ratesReconciliation of Q3 2021 statutory revenue with Q3 2021 revenue at constant scope and exchange ratesFor the analysis of the Group‚Äôs performance  revenue for Q3 2022 is compared to Q3 2021 revenue at constant scope and exchange rates as presented below per Global Business Lines:In ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2021 Scope effect** Exchange rates effect Q3 2021* Merchant Services 639 +80.4 +10.4 729 Financial Services 234 +2.8 237 Mobility & e-Transactional Services 88 -1.1 86 Worldline 960 +80.4 +12.1 1 053* at constant scope and September 2022 YTD average exchange rates** at December 2021 YTD average exchange ratesExchanges rates effect in Q3 is mainly due to the Euro depreciation vs the Swiss franc.

The company's installed capacity increased to 14.3 GW (10% interannual gain). EDPR has already managed to hit 40% of the 20 GW target set for its installed capacity for 2021-2025 via ‚Ä¶,Houston  Texas  Oct. 26  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR)  the world‚Äôs fourth largest producer of wind and solar energy  has reported its end-of-third-quarter results  carrying on showing solid growth owing to its larger installed capacity  greater strengthening of renewable resources and average sales price recovery. The result of all of this is an EBITDA of 1.482 billion euros and a net profit of 416 million euros.EDPR is well and truly on target with its ambitious growth plan owing to its record 4 GW renewable energy capacity under construction in 15 markets around the world  likewise  providing the company with broader technological diversification. In parallel to all of this  gross investments in the amount of 4.4 billion euros have enabled EDPR to increase its international presence across 28 different national markets via acquisitions such as that of Sunseap. Additionally  EPPR has been able to carry on generating value via its asset rotation program  closing three transactions in Spain  Poland  and Italy  which have contributed to the creation of 264 million in profit.Operating results are also posting growth due to the increased installed capacity and strengthening of renewable energy products. This installed capacity of up to 14.3 GW has led to stable operating performances. Of note  EDPR has  as of the date of this press release  managed to hit 10.8 GW of the additional 20 GW goal set for the 2021-2025 period (so 55% achieved)  with over 40% of this goal either already installed or under construction. Furthermore  the company carried out its asset rotation ahead of schedule  with 3.4 billion euros of the 8-billion-euro income goal already achieved via agreements generating twice the per MW value compared to what was set out in the Business Plan.In the words of Miguel Stilwell d‚ÄôAndrade  CEO of EDP: ‚ÄúEDPR is in a very strong position to deal with all the challenges presented by the energy transition  and we have already achieved 55% of the renewables capacity we set out to develop for the 2021 to 2025 horizon. During the first nine months of this year and even given the bumpy business context the energy sector finds itself in we were able to invest over 4 billion euros in renewable energy projects‚Äù.Financial resultsFor the first nine months of 2022 EDPR‚Äôs EBITDA increased to 1.482 billion euros (a 62% interannual gain) due to solid business line results underpinned by a 10% gain in installed capacity and a 14% gain in renewable energy generation.Elsewhere on the balance sheet operating income increased to 331 million euros (a 129 million interannual gain)  which was mainly derived from asset rotation transactions closed in Poland  Spain  and Italy.Lastly  net profit increased to 416 million euros (a 181% interannual gain)  which was partially offset by higher net financial costs  which went up in the amount of 296 million euros (up 58% interannually) due to increased debt  the foreign exchange rate  and the cost of debt.EDPR is as committed as it has ever been to its Business Plan as well as leading the energy transition in those markets where they maintain a presence.About EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA)EDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)  its affiliates  and its subsidiaries develop  construct  own  and operate wind farms and solar parks throughout North America.

GTT announces that it has received two Approvals in Principle (AiP) for its innovative three-tank LNG tanker design  from DNV and Bureau Veritas (BV). This cutting-edge technological solution is aimed at increasing the profitability and overall performance of the vessel.This three-tank LNG carrier concept permits a reduction in construction costs through the suppression of one cofferdam  one pump tower and all associated cryogenic equipment (liquid and gas domes  valves  piping  radars  etc.). The overall surface area of the containment system will also be reduced by about 2 000 m¬≤  generating lower costs for the materials and vessel construction.At the same time  the improved ratio between the volume of LNG transported and the surface area of the cryogenic liner will make it possible to reduce the daily boil-off rate. As an example  GTT estimates that it will achieve a boil-off rate as low as 0.080% of tank volume per day with the Mark III Flex technology  compared to 0.085% of the volume per day with the LNG carriers currently in operation.This new design could also offer time-savings for shipyards and optimise their construction schedule.DNV and BV have issued an approval in principle for this innovative three-tank LNG carrier design for the Mark III and NO96 technologies developed by GTT.Philippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: ""For almost 60 years  the GTT Group has been constantly improving its technologies to offer its customers solutions that meet their requirements as well as those of the regulatory authorities. Thirty years ago  we upgraded LNG carriers from five to four tanks and we now hope to bring the market forward with a three-tank LNG carrier. We hope to see this concept become standard in future years.""Jean-Baptiste Boutillier  VP Development  Innovation and Technical Strategy at GTT  said: ""We are honored by the granting of these two approvals in principle for the design of the three-tank LNG carrier. We are convinced that this evolution will benefit all stakeholders by improving the performance of the LNG carrier while reducing its carbon footprint.""About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases. For over 50 years  GTT has been designing and providing cutting-edge technologies for a better energy performance  which combine operational efficiency and safety  to equip LNG carriers  floating terminals  land storage  and multi-gas carriers.

The name change will be implemented in the next few days. The Company stock ticker symbol will change from ‚ÄúBOTHE‚Äù to ‚ÄúBIOS‚Äù. The new corporate website will be www.biosenic.com.‚ÄúThe shareholders‚Äô approval of the combination of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics will create a diversified and innovative new company. BioSenic will be able to develop an expanded product portfolio across multiple therapeutic indications ‚Äù said Fran√ßois Rieger  newly appointed Chairman and CEO of BioSenic. ‚ÄúWe are excited to bring a new equity story to the market. Medsenic has been working for a decade on serious pathologies linked to systemic autoimmune diseases  such as cGvHD (chronic Graft versus Host Disease)  systemic lupus  and systemic sclerosis.

The combination of development portfolios also enables a significant derisk for investors and increases the potential for growth and value creation for all shareholders "" said Jean St√©phenne  Member of the Board of Directors  BioSenic. ""The new board of directors and management of BioSenic  under the direction of Prof. Fran√ßois Rieger  are particularly well placed to lead the merged company to delivering therapies for unmet medical needs.‚ÄùNew BioSenic Board of Directors and Executive leadership teamThe BioSenic‚Äô ESM also approved the appointment of a new board  consisting of a total of up to seven directors including Jean St√©phenne and Jean-Luc Vandebroek that are transitioning to the Biosenic Board  while all other Bone Therapeutics Board directors have terminated their mandate.

In exchange for the in-kind contribution of 51% of Medsenic' shares  90 668 594 shares were issued by BioSenic to Medsenic shareholders. The parties have relied on the valuation carried out by an independent expert in order to determine the exchange ratio of one for four.The Medsenic shareholders have agreed to an initial lock-up of nine months as from the date of the ESM  provided that on February 28 2023  2% of the new shares held by each of V√©ronique Pomi-Schneiter and Fran√ßois Rieger shall be released from the lock-up.BioSenic will maintain its status as a Belgian listed company  while significantly broadening its diverse therapeutic portfolio.The ESM also approved the issue of 24 463 421 subscription rights allowing holders to subscribe for a new share of the company if the ALLOB interim Phase IIB results  a clinical trial focusing on the regenerative properties of proprietary ALLOB cells in cases of difficult  in risk of delayed-union  tibial fractures  are positive at a subscription price per share of EUR 0.45 (the ""ALLOB Subscription Rights""). One ALLOB Subscription Right was issued and granted to each outstanding share of BioSenic prior to completion of the transaction.No offering of the ALLOB Subscription Rights to the public was made or will be made in the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation 2017/1129 and no one has taken any action that would  or is intended to  permit such an offering in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for such purpose is required  including in Belgium  France or any other member state of the European Economic Area to which the Prospectus Regulation 2017/1129 applies. The ALLOB Subscription Rights have also not been  or will not be  registered under the U.S. Securities Act  or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction in the United States of America  and they may not be offered  sold  pledged or otherwise transferred in the United States of America except pursuant to a transaction that is exempt from  or not subject to  the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws.In the contribution agreement  the existing shareholders of Medsenic have agreed to contribute in kind the totality of the remaining Medsenic shares held by within the next 24 - 36 months from the completion of the combination  meaning that  in the medium to long run  all existing pipeline from both organizations will be directly or indirectly held by BioSenic.Outlook for the remainder of 2022 and 2023A Phase III study of cGvHD is currently anticipated to start in H1 2023 following the Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD (chronic GvH) positive results. A phase IIa clinical trial for Lupus had previously established proof of concept of safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease: a Phase IIb clinical trial for severe Lupus is in the planning stage. Also  positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase II clinical trial on systemic sclerosis.The Phase IIb trial of ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in the H1 2023.About BioSenicBioSenic has been formed to be a leading biotech company  focusing on the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) through its majority participation in Medsenic  from the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO platform. kKey programs include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic Lupus erythematesus (SLE) and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).BioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The original cutting-edge allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform from Bone Therapeutics  with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) which can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic‚Äô scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform from Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO are best described by a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be soon eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in immuno-oncology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic has been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation which was granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SL)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown in a phase IIa study good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract).Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic  as preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.The recent acquisition by BioSenic of a majority participation in Medsenic brings together the strategic positionings and strengths of the two companies. As the result of this merger  Biosenic is adding to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP tissue repair protection an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations  all using the properties mastered by Medsenic of ATO/OATO with its original compelling immunomodulatory properties.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium.

This open-access technology enables investment platforms  wealth managers  retail brokers  IFAs and fintechs across the UK and in the European Union to offer IPOs  placings and bonds directly to their retail investor customers.Connect represents a new stage of partnership with over 60 brokerage partners signed up to PrimaryBid  including the UK platforms AJ Bell  Hargreaves Lansdown and interactive investor and a number of discretionary wealth managers which collectively have contributed over ¬£500m in transaction demand through PrimaryBid since 2020. In the EU  Connect was launched in collaboration with PrimaryBid's strategic partner  Euronext  to facilitate pan-EU expansion and cross border capital formation. In France  Bourse Direct  Boursorama and EasyBourse are fully integrated into PrimaryBid's Connect API enabling at-scale automated distribution  and a number of leading EU retail intermediaries are in the process of completing integration.Investment in the PrimaryBid Connect platform reflects growing scrutiny on public companies from regulators and policymakers around the limited access everyday investors have to 'institutional-only' fundraisings. As an independently regulated company  PrimaryBid has the leading track-record in winning access for retail investors to IPOs and secondary fundraisings working alongside all major investment banks. PrimaryBid has completed over 200 deals since the start of 2020.For individual investors  PrimaryBid Connect brings deals directly into their chosen investment platform  maximising the opportunity to make use of tax-efficient wrappers such as ISAs or funds on account. Partners also have a choice over their preferred interface to PrimaryBid  including straight-through API processing for digital-first platforms. Other enhancements include shareholder verification and transaction audit functionality that meet emerging best practices around deal allocation and post-deal regulatory reporting.James Deal  PrimaryBid's Head of UK said: ""The launch of PrimaryBid Connect is an exciting milestone in our mission to deliver public inclusion in our capital markets through technology. In the UK  HM Treasury's recent capital raising review authored by Mark Austin stated clearly that retail investors should be included in all public company fundraisings. HM Treasury is also working to remove other practical barriers to public inclusion  including arbitrary limits on retail participation in the UK Prospectus regime  soon to be reformed through the Financial Services and Markets Bill.""The launch of Connect will enable corporate issuers and their advisers to efficiently execute on the new governance standards by accessing the broadest range of platforms and retail investors. PrimaryBid stands ready to unlock nearly ~¬£500 billion in retail capital for UK plc alongside our distribution partners: the PrimaryBid Connect platform is the next stage in our ambition to simplify and enhance this process.""Eric Low  PrimaryBid's Head of EU  added: ""Encouraging retail investor participation in the capital markets is a core feature of the European Commission's recent strategy and consultations. We are working with our European partners to simplify the capital formation process and deliver broad-based retail inclusion through technology  very much in the spirit of policymaker plans for Capital Markets Union.""Enquiries:Mike Coombes  VP Corporate Affairsmike.coombes@primarybid.com020 3026 4750Notes to Editors:Across the UK  France and Netherlands there is an average of 363 primary market transactions a year  with 291 placings and over 70 IPOs (Average number of deals  2017 to 2021 per Dealogic). Access to this area of the market is no longer reserved only for institutional investors  and issuers can tap into the vast pool of retail capital. In the UK alone  c.¬£400bn is held in stocks and shares ISAs  of which a material proportion is held as cash ready to be invested; this is in addition to the further c.¬£290bn held in cash ISAs (per ONS statistics  June 2022). PrimaryBid Connect comes in two forms - a 'ready-to-go' web-based application designed for wealth managers and smaller retail brokers  and an API solution that plugs directly into the systems of larger platforms and fintechs allowing for distribution of deals to retail investors at scale.

This performance includes a robust +11.4% increase due to the price-mix effect  in line with the Group‚Äôs value-driven strategy  and a +9.7% rise in sales volume. Reported data puts sales up by +34.4%  including a very strong +13.3% contribution from currency translation linked primarily to the strength of the US dollar and the renminbi.All regions contributed to R√©my Cointreau‚Äôs very strong first-half organic performance. The Americas generated growth of +21.1% despite an exceptionally high basis for comparison. APAC was up +21.7%  driven by a sharp marked rally in China in the second quarter. And EMEA saw robust momentum over the summer  gaining +19.9%.Sales by division:‚Ç¨m(April-September 2022) H12022-23 H12021-22 Change asreported Organicchange Cognac 638.1 464.6 +37.3% +22.4% Liqueurs & Spirits 214.5 164.1 +30.7% +20.7% Sub-total: Group Brands 852.6 628.7 +35.6% +22.0% Partner Brands 14.5 16.6 -12.5% -13.0% Total 867.1 645.3 +34.4% +21.1%CognacThe Cognac division had a very good first half despite a high basis for comparison. Organic growth in sales came to +22.4%  with all regions contributing. The US saw double-digit growth  driven primarily by sales in Q1. By contrast  China‚Äôs contribution rallied sharply in Q2  with a strong performance from the Mid-Autumn Festival in a market still unsettled by on-again/off-again pandemic restrictions. R√©my Martin CLUB turned in a particularly remarkable performance. Lastly  in the EMEA  Group sales maintained strong momentum in most key regions in Q2.R√©my Cointreau continued to deploy a robust investment policy within the Cognac division. In the US  we teamed up with Usher for a multitude of marketing activations centered on a Taste of Passion  with the entire limited-edition bottle and NFT selling out in two seconds on BlockBar.com.In China  the Mid-Autumn Festival was a successful springboard for a range of initiatives promoting Group brands and brand recognition. Banquets featured prominently  notably for R√©my Martin XO  the official partner of Michelin.Liqueurs & SpiritsFirst-half organic sales at our Liqueurs & Spirits division were up +20.7%. A very strong performance in the United States reflected robust trends at Bruichladdich distillery and Cointreau  the latter once again teaming up with American actor Dan Levy on social media. The EMEA region had a very good summer season  including a strong showing by Cointreau  now rolling out its new bottle; Metaxa  underpinned by a new cocktails campaign; and St-R√©my  pursuing an up-trading strategy with St-R√©my Signature and XO. In China  single-malt whiskies remain very popular and did particularly well at the Mid-Autumn Festival.Partner BrandsOrganic sales of Partner Brands decreased by -13.0% in the first half  affected by a high basis of comparison in Europe  particularly in the Benelux.2022-23 outlook: FY targets confirmedIdeally positioned to take advantage of new consumption trends and buoyed by its advance on roll-out of its strategic plan  R√©my Cointreau is looking to 2022-2023 with confidence.The Group intends to continue to gain market share value in the exceptional spirits sector. It expects another year of strong organic growth  including normalization of consumption trends in the second half on the heels of two outstanding years.More specifically  as life ‚Äúreturns to normal‚Äù in most regions  overall consumption from H2 on is likely to settle in at ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù levels that are well above those observed in 2019/20. At the same time  growth should be tempered by high bases of comparison.The Group intends to continue implementing its strategy focused on medium-term brand development and underpinned by a policy of sustained investment in marketing and communications  particularly in the second half of the year.As a result  organic COP margin improvement will be driven by gross margin resilience despite the inflationary environment and by tight control of overhead costs.Taking into account the impact of phasing effects on sales trends and marketing/communication spends  organic COP margin improvement will be primarily driven by H1.The full-year impact of currency should be positive for:sales : +‚Ç¨ 110/120m (vs +‚Ç¨90/100m previously): +‚Ç¨ 110/120m (vs +‚Ç¨90/100m previously) COP: +‚Ç¨55/60m (vs +‚Ç¨50/60m previously)About R√©my CointreauAll around the world  there are clients seeking exceptional experiences; clients for whom a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavors.

The Group‚Äôs management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand its performance. These indicators should be considered as supplementing those including in the consolidated financial statements and resulting movements.Organic sales growth:Organic growth excludes the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals.The impact of exchange rate fluctuations is calculated by converting sales for the current financial year using average exchange rates from the prior financial year.For current-year acquisitions  sales of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For prior-year acquisitions  sales of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year  but are only included in current-year organic growth with effect from the actual date of acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5 (which reclassifies entities disposed of under ‚ÄúNet earnings from discontinued operations‚Äù for the current and prior financial year). It thus focuses on Group performance common to both financial years  over which local management has more direct influence.Regulated information related to this press release can be found at www.remy-cointreau.com.,positive,1.0,0.0,0.0,mixed,0.71,0.17,0.11,True,English,"['R√©my Cointreau', 'First Half', 'American actor Dan Levy', 'R√©my Martin CLUB', 'organic COP margin improvement', 'R√©my Martin XO', 'strong first-half organic performance', 'gross margin resilience', 'sharp marked rally', 'R√©my Cointreau', 'new cocktails campaign', 'new normal‚Äù levels', 'St-R√©my Signature', 'entire limited-edition bottle', 'two outstanding years', 'medium-term brand development', 'good summer season', 'market share value', 'family-owned French Group', 'First-half organic sales', 'good first half', 'new consumption trends', 'most key regions', 'exceptional spirits sector', 'strong organic growth', 'The EMEA region', 'robust investment policy', 'The Cognac division', 'new bottle', 'strong performance', 'two seconds', 'brand recognition', 'robust trends', 'sustained investment', 'exceptional experiences', 'strong momentum', 'strong showing', 'The Americas', 'The Group', 'overall consumption', 'robust +11.4% increase', 'robust momentum', 'most regions', 'remarkable performance', 'second half', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'second quarter', 'high basis', 'price-mix effect', 'Group Brands', 'Partner Brands', 'The US', 'Mid-Autumn Festival', 'pandemic restrictions', 'BlockBar.com', 'successful springboard', 'official partner', 'United States', 'Bruichladdich distillery', 'social media', 'single-malt whiskies', 'FY targets', 'strategic plan', 'high bases', 'inflationary environment', 'tight control', 'overhead costs', 'phasing effects', 'marketing/communication spends', 'exacting standards', 'honed skills', 'strong +13.3% contribution', 'double-digit growth', 'sales trends', 'Spirits division', 'value-driven strategy', 'US dollar', 'trading strategy', 'sales volume', 'Group sales', 'organic1 rise', 'currency translation', 'marketing activations', 'same time', 'full-year impact', 'wide range', 'XO.', '+9.7% rise', 'PARIS', 'RCO', 'top', 'H1', 'line', 'data', 'strength', 'renminbi', 'APAC', 'China', 'September', 'change', 'Liqueurs', 'Q1.', 'contrast', 'Q2.', 'Usher', 'multitude', 'Taste', 'Passion', 'NFT', 'initiatives', 'Banquets', 'Michelin', 'Metaxa', 'Europe', 'Benelux', 'advantage', 'advance', 'roll-out', 'confidence', 'normalization', 'heels', 'life', 'H2', 'communications', 'result', 'account', 'world', 'clients', 'terroirs', 'variety', 'flavors', 'expertise', 'generation', 'products', 'tribute', 'women']",2022-10-25,2022-10-26,businesswire.com

This performance reflects a strong momentum in Europe  notably thanks to the success of collections with local clients and the return of tourists  as well as in the United States where demand remains significant  in line with preceding quarters. In Mainland China  our sales remained impacted by the fall in shop traffic due to Covid-related restrictions. We nevertheless observed an improvement in our performance this quarter. We have equally pursued our full price strategy with success by substantially lowering the discount rate. We registered more and more qualitative digital sales in a context of a normalization of the share of digital sales. Finally  we have accelerated the implementation of our CSR strategy. In view of our performance in the first nine months of the year  and provided that the international situation does not deteriorate further in the final quarter  we confirm our full-year guidance.‚ÄùStory continues‚Ç¨m except %Unaudited figures Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Organicchange Reportedchange 9M 2021 9M 2022 Organicchange Reported change Sales by region France 88.4 99 1 +13 5% +11 9% 230.3 293 8 +30 2% +27 5% EMEA 81.3 98 6 +20 4% +21 4% 195.3 272 0 +37 9% +39 3% Americas 37.8 49 0 +12 5% +29 9% 96.9 132 1 +22 1% +36 4% APAC 64.2 61 6 -11 8% -4 1% 202.6 175 8 -20 1% -13 2% Sales by Brand Sandro 131 5 150.2 +9 5% +14 2% 343.5 416 9 +17 0% +21 4% Maje 106 5 119.9 +8 0% +12 6% 289.4 343 8 +14 7% +18 8% Other brands1 33 8 38.3 +13 9% +13 5% 92.1 113 0 +23 8% +22 8% TOTAL 271 7 308.4 +9 4% +13 5% 725.0 873 8 +17 0% +20 5%SALES BY REGIONIn France  9-month sales reached ‚Ç¨294m  +30% on an organic basis vs 2021 supported by like-for-like points of sales.The third quarter saw a double-digit growth with a basis of comparison higher than in H1.The solid performance is based on the success of the four brands‚Äô collections and on good tourism flows during the summer (coming from Americas  Middle East  Europe  and some APAC nationalities). The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -8pp vs. 2021 YTD.In EMEA (Europe excluding France and Middle East)  SMCP delivered an excellent performance with 9-month sales of ‚Ç¨272m  +38% on an organic basis vs 2021 of which +51% like-for-like  coming from brick-and-mortar and digital retail (own websites and e-partners). Third quarter sales were up +20% on an organic basis benefiting  as in France  from success with both local customers and tourists in most European countries. The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -5pp vs. 2021 YTD.In APAC  9-month sales (‚Ç¨176m) were down -13% on a reported basis and -20% on an organic basis vs 2021. Performance continued to be impacted by Covid resurgences in Mainland China with sporadic store closures and reduced footfall. However  the APAC trend is of gradual improvement and the gap vs 2021 reduced significantly in Q3 compared to H1 (-12% organic vs Q3 2021). APAC excluding China delivered a good progression vs 2021 in Q3  supported by the strong performances of Korea  Singapore  Malaysia and Australia.In North America  despite a high comparison basis  SMCP delivered a strong performance with 9-month sales of ‚Ç¨132m  +36% on a reported basis and +22% on an organic basis vs 2021 (LFL progressing double-digits: +23% in a nearly stable network). The third quarter trend (+30% on a reported basis and +12% on an organic basis vs 2021) is close to the Q2 trend  sustained by both B&M and Digital. All markets (USA  Canada and Mexico) recorded an excellent momentum. The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -8pp vs. 2021 YTD.Q3 HIGHLIGHTSDuring the third quarter  SMCP intensified its CSR commitments. For example  the number of traceable references in the Fall-Winter collection now exceeds 100 per brand. Initiatives in favor of the circular economy are increasing  including in particular the gradual deployment of second-hand products  which will be extended to other countries in the coming months.The Group has made several targeted openings in its key markets  and the third quarter saw the opening of a major flagship store for Sandro on the mythical Champs-Elys√©es Avenue. More generally  SMCP is pursuing its strategy of qualitative and selective network development: opening and renovation of Fursac stores in Europe  new physical and digital points of sale in Asia for Sandro  Maje and Claudie Pierlot  and strengthening of strategic retail partners networks (e.g. in the Middle East).Finally  each brand continued to develop the desirability of its collections and communications: the Believe campaign for Sandro and Taylor Hill for Maje  the reaffirmation of the Parisian style for Claudie Pierlot through iconic pieces in the Fall-Winter collection and communication campaign  and artistic and know-how-based collaborations for Fursac.CONCLUSIONThanks to the desirability of its brands and the attractiveness of its collections  Group sales benefited from a strong momentum across all geographies except Mainland China  due to Covid-related restrictions.All brands of the portfolio contributed to the growth  enabling SMCP to book a record level of sales  despite an unprecedented level of macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainty.PERSPECTIVESIn the fourth quarter 2022  the Group will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of the economic  geopolitical  health and social context.Based on the strong performance on a 9-month basis and provided the international situation does not deteriorate further during the rest of the year  SMCP confirms its 2022 full-year financial guidance.A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.APPENDICESBreakdown of DOSNumber of DOS Q3-21 2021 H1-22 Q3-22 Var Q3 22vs. H1 22 Var Q3 22 vs. FY 21 Var Q3 22 vs. Q3 21 By region France 474 472 462 455 -7 -17 -19 EMEA 404 402 394 392 -2 -10 -12 Americas 168 166 167 167 - +1 -1 APAC 250 252 251 258 +7 +6 +8 By brand Sandro 552 552 546 547 +1 -5 -5 Maje 456 455 453 453 - -2 -3 Claudie Pierlot 211 211 206 203 -3 -8 -8 Suite 341 11 10 2 2 - -8 -9 Fursac 66 64 67 67 - +3 +1 Total DOS 1 296 1 292 1 274 1 272 -2 -20 -24Breakdown of POSNumber of POS Q3-21 2021 H1-22 Q3-22 Var Q3 22vs. H1 22 Var Q3 22 vs. FY 21 Var Q3 22 vs. Q3 21 By region France 475 473 463 456 -7 -17 -19 EMEA 551 548 542 544 +2 -4 +7 Americas 197 195 195 198 +3 +3 +1 APAC 461 468 470 472 +2 +4 +11 By brand Sandro 743 745 742 745 +3 - +2 Maje 618 620 620 620 - - +2 Claudie Pierlot 246 245 239 236 -3 -9 -10 Suite 341 11 10 2 2 - -8 -9 Fursac 66 64 67 67 - +3 +1 Total POS 1 684 1 684 1 670 1 670 - -14 -14 o/w Partners POS 388 392 396 398 +2 +6 +10FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSNumber of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group‚Äôs points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year.

Based on this robust performance  we confirm our full-year objectives  with revenue growth now expected in the upper half of the previously indicated range. In the meantime  we achieved important milestones in Q3 towards the envisioned separation. We finalized a ‚Ç¨2.7 billion financing providing the means to execute our transformation until separation while ensuring the Group‚Äôs liquidity. We launched the works councils consultation process and made tangible progress in carve-out preparation workstreams. The separation project is well on track to be completed in H2 2023 as initially planned. Atos is resolutely pursuing its in-depth transformation: the whole organization is mobilized and committed to the successful execution of our strategic plan  which we are convinced will create significant value for all Atos‚Äô stakeholders.‚ÄùIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change Change at constant currency Evidian Perimeter revenue 1 278 1 191 +7.3% +2.1% Tech Foundations perimeter revenue 1 540 1 475 +4.4% +0.3% Group revenue 2 818 2 666 +5.7% +1.1%Revenue growth at constant currency turning positive in Q3Group revenue was ‚Ç¨2 818 million in Q3 2022  up +5.7% year-on-year. Growth at constant currency turned positive in Q3  at +1.1%  while organic growth stabilized  at -0.1%  showing a strong sequential improvement compared to previous quarters (-1.9% in Q2 and -2.4% in Q1). This positive momentum reflects the continued improvement in operational performance brought by the Group‚Äôs new organization and management team. Acquisitions contributed +1.2% to the Group‚Äôs revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed +4.6%  mainly reflecting the appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro over the period.Evidian‚Äôs revenue was up +2.1% at constant currency in Q3. Digital recorded a solid growth  driven by buoyant trends on digital transformation markets  as well as by the contribution from recent acquisitions. Q3 activity was supported by a good level of fertilization of existing customers. Cybersecurity continued to benefit from market leadership and strong customer demand. Revenue growth was affected by Advanced Computing  with a low level of HPC revenue  expected to ramp up from Q4 onwards based on the very high order entry recorded in Q2.Tech Foundations‚Äô revenue stabilized in Q3  at +0.3% at constant currency (+0.5% excluding UCC). This positive top line momentum is a clear sign of an earlier-than-anticipated improvement of the business line‚Äôs performance  resulting from renewed management focus under the Group‚Äôs new organization and strategic project. The core infrastructure business reported a much more contained decline than in 2021  while professional services grew strongly. Digital workplace services and UCC recorded a slight contraction due to persisting supply chain tensions.Significant progress achieved in separation projectThe Group is making significant progress in its separation project and confirms that it is well on track to complete it within the previously announced 12 to 18 months timeline1.The Group successfully signed a new ‚Ç¨2.7 billion bank debt financing on July 29  2022  ensuring the interim period leading to the envisioned separation is fully financed. The syndication of this new debt package was finalized in a short timeframe and received very strong support from the Group's historical lenders. This unsecured debt package includes a ‚Ç¨1.5 billion term loan with very satisfactory tenure and pricing conditions  a ‚Ç¨0.9bn revolving credit facility supporting the Group‚Äôs liquidity  and a ‚Ç¨0.3 billion bridge loan to be repaid out of the expected proceeds from the Group‚Äôs non-core businesses disposal program. Financial covenant was reset to 3.75x net debt to OMDA2  tested at year-end.On September 7  2022  the information and consultation process of Atos European works council (SEC)  regarding the Group‚Äôs envisioned separation into two listed entities  was launched in line with the project timetable. In parallel  social dialogue has also started at country level.All separation workstreams are mobilized and progressing according to plan  across four pillars: (i) go-to-market and commercial continuity  (ii) carve-out operations covering tax and legal structuring  strategic agreements and preparation of carve-out financial statements  as well as Day-1 operational readiness  (iii) operating model and support functions set-up and (iv) program coordination.Atos is convinced that this project is the most value-creating for all its stakeholders. Evidian will emerge as a global digital pure player fully focused on growing markets and combining a unique set of highly synergistic areas of expertise. Tech Foundations‚Äô turnaround is already underway and showing encouraging signs of earlier-than-anticipated recovery. Once turned-around  Tech Foundations will take a fresh start as an end-to-end orchestrator of digital infrastructure  leveraging its core operations to deliver solid margins and cash generation.Moving ahead with disposal programOn June 14  2022  Atos announced a disposal program of non-core businesses representing ‚Ç¨700 million of expected proceeds  as part of the financing of its transformation plan. On the same day  the Group completed the sale of its remaining 2.5% stake in Worldline  for net proceeds of c. ‚Ç¨220 million. The remaining ‚Ç¨480 million expected proceeds pertain to the disposal of non-core businesses mostly within the Evidian perimeter.This disposal program is progressing as planned  with several disposal processes currently ongoing  including 2 small-sized transactions already signed  indicating market interest for the businesses selected by Atos as part of its disposal program  as well as the Group‚Äôs ability to execute swiftly  only four months after the disposal program was set up.CSR: outstanding external recognitionIn September 2022  for the third year in a row  Atos was awarded the EcoVadis Platinum Award for its Corporate Social Responsibility performance  with the highest score ever received by the Group  at 84 points out of 100. Atos therefore confirms its position in the top 1% companies assessed by EcoVadis within its sector.In October 2022  Atos was upgraded to the highest rating available (the AAA rating) in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) ESG rating 2022  ranking it among the top 7% of companies in the ‚ÄúSoftware and Service‚Äù industry with a good performance in Sustainability measured through the Environmental  Social and Governance dimensions. MSCI highlighted Atos‚Äô leadership in clean technology initiatives  as well as the Group‚Äôs strengthened governance. Since the beginning of the year  Atos‚Äô Board of directors has welcomed five new members: Ren√© Proglio  Astrid Stange  Elizabeth Tinkham  Caroline Ruellan and Katrina Hopkins  who collectively bring a wealth of experience in digital  finance  human resources and corporate governance.Commercial activityOrder entry was ‚Ç¨ 2.0 billion in Q3 2022  representing a book-to-bill ratio of 71%.For the Evidian perimeter  the book-to-bill ratio was 85%  impacted by fluctuations in the HPC deal flow  following a very high order intake in Q2  as well as a lower number of large application management services contracts.On the Tech Foundations perimeter  the book-to-bill ratio was 58%  while Tech Foundations is in the process of gradually re-building a strong commercial pipeline and enhancing its sales capabilities. However  positive evolutions were noted in Q3  with a significant increase in order entry from new logos  and the benefits from a higher contract selectivity.Book-to-bill ratio is expected to recover significantly across both perimeters in Q4.At the end of September 2022  the Group‚Äôs full backlog reached ‚Ç¨ 21.8 billion  down ‚Ç¨0.8 billion compared to the end of June 2022. It represented 1.9 year of revenue.The full qualified pipeline amounted to ‚Ç¨ 7.1 billion at the end of September 2022  stable compared to the end of June 2022  representing 7.5 months of revenue.Human resourcesTotal headcount was 112 344 at the end of September 2022  broadly stable compared to the end of June 2022 (112 180).In Q3 2022  Atos hired 8 367 new employees (gross)  of which 64% are located in offshore and nearshore countries.In September 2022  Atos was listed for the first time by Great Place to Work¬Æ as one of ‚ÄòEurope‚Äôs Best Workplaces‚Äô in the 2022 annual list. It is ranked 21st position in the multinational company category.2022 full-year objectives confirmed and refinedBased on its robust Q3 performance  Atos refines its revenue growth objective for the full year  while operating margin and free cash flow objectives are unchanged. For the full year  the Group expects:Revenue growth at constant currency in the upper half of the -0.5% to +1.5% range;Operating margin at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range;Free cash flow at the lower end of the ‚Ç¨-150 million to ‚Ç¨200 million range excluding additional impacts of the envisioned transformation plan. Such additional impacts are estimated around ‚Ç¨-250 million  including the cost of financing  in line with information communicated at Atos Capital Markets Day in June.Marks of interest receivedAs indicated on September 29  2022  Atos received  on September 27  an unsolicited letter of intent from Onepoint  in association with private equity firm ICG  related to the potential acquisition of the Evidian perimeter  for an indicative enterprise value of ‚Ç¨4.2 billion. Following the thorough examination of this preliminary and non-binding mark of interest  and upon the recommendation of its ad hoc committee  the Board of Directors convened and unanimously concluded that it was not in the interest of the Company and its stakeholders  and therefore decided not to proceed.In addition  as indicated on October 24  2022  since the presentation of its separation project at the CMD on June 14  Atos has been approached by several players interested in the Tech Foundations business. The Board of Directors reiterates that it is its duty to examine all marks of interest  and it will do so for the Tech Foundations business with regard to the Company‚Äôs corporate interest and value creation for its stakeholders.Atos is fully mobilized on the progress of the separation project within the planned timetable  which remains the Group's priority.Analyst and investor conference callAtos Management invites analysts and investors to a conference call on the Group 2022 third quarter revenue  on Wednesday  October 26  2022  at 08:00 am (CET ‚Äì Paris).You can join the webcast of the conference:via the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/nh2xut9fby telephone with the dial-in  10 minutes prior the starting time.

A robust growth in Digital  in particular with a new logo in decarbonization  as well as in BDS  was mitigated by a decrease in Tech Foundations activities.Northern Europe & APAC revenue grew by +2.6% at constant currency. In addition to the contribution of Cloudreach  Digital activities were driven by strong demand in application services  in particular from the public sector. Tech Foundations activities continued to improve  while BDS was impacted by fluctuations in the Advanced Computing business.Central Europe revenue decreased by -1.2% at constant currency  as growth in digital applications  particularly in public sector  TMT and energy  and cybersecurity was offset by a decline in Tech Foundations‚Äô activities  partly driven by the UCC business  and by lower hardware and software resale.Southern Europe revenue decreased by -2.2% at constant currency primarily due to lower HPC sales  coming from a very high level in FY21  and to the continued deliberate decline of hardware and software resale. Digital activities benefitted from a good momentum in applications and public cloud services  while Tech Foundations activities were slightly up  driven by professional services.Others and global structures encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group‚Äôs global delivery centers and global structures. Revenue grew strongly  by +12.4% at constant currency  supported by the acquisition of Ipsotek in 2021  as well as a good performance in Africa and in Turkey.Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates reconciliationIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 % change Statutory revenue 2 818 2 666 +5.7% Exchange rates effect 122 Revenue at constant exchange rates 2 818 2 788 +1.1% Scope effect 31 Exchange rates effect on acquired/disposed perimeters 3 Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates 2 818 2 821 -0.1%Currency exchange rates effects positively contributed to revenue growth for ‚Ç¨+122 million.

NFL Biosciences patent registered in China and South KoreaPartnership with Themis Medicare to develop NFL-101 in IndiaPartnership with Athena Pharmaceutiques for the global development of NFL-301Recruitment of a Finance DirectorNFL BIOSCIENCES (Euronext Growth Paris ‚Äì FR0014003XT0 ‚Äì ALNFL)  a biopharmaceutical company that is developing botanical drugs for the treatment of addictions  is reporting its results for the first half of 2022  approved by the Board of Directors on October 24  2022. The half-year financial statements at June 30  2022 were subject to a limited review by the Company‚Äôs Statutory Auditors. NFL Biosciences  listed on the stock market since July 2021  continues to make progress in the development of NFL-101  its drug candidate for smoking cessation.NFL-101 phase II/III clinical trial continues to move forward  with the participation of eight clinical centers in FranceIn recent months  the CESTO II phase II/III clinical trial assessing the efficacy and dosing of its drug candidate NFL-101 has been rolled out at eight clinical centers in France: the CHU teaching hospital centers in Bordeaux  Clermont-Ferrand  Dijon  Marseille  Montpellier  Poitiers and Rennes  and the Eurofins-Optimed research institute in Grenoble  which is also the contract research organization (CRO) of the study.The clinical trial is targeting men or women aged 18 to 70 who smoke more than 11 cigarettes per day and are genuinely committed to stopping smoking. The trial includes three arms (two dose arms and one placebo arm) and will monitor patients over 12 months. CESTO II‚Äôs primary objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo. The main criterion for assessment is the subject‚Äôs continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA)) criterion). The main secondary criterion for assessment is the subjects‚Äôs continued abstinence for six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) criterion). Many other secondary criteria will also be assessed  including the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving. The biomarkers used to confirm abstinence are exhaled carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine.Considering the rate of recruitment of the eight clinical centers  in the absence of events that are beyond the Company‚Äôs control or linked to economic and geopolitical developments  subject recruitment is expected to be completed during the first half of 2023.Co-development agreement for NFL-301  a drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumptionIn February 2022  NFL Biosciences set up a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader in the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  in order to jointly develop and manufacture NFL-301  a natural drug candidate originated at NFL Biosciences. NFL-301 is indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption.The development of the formulation  launched during the first quarter of 2022  is still underway. The Company will then establish dialogue with the European and American regulatory agencies (EMA and FDA) for the product‚Äôs clinical development.Intellectual property extended with an NFL Biosciences patent registered in China and South KoreaNFL Biosciences is continuing to move forward with its knowledge management and protection strategy. This has resulted in the filing of two patent families granting it exclusive rights to its drug candidate NFL-101. This product patent  initially registered and approved in France  concerns an ‚Äúaqueous extract of tobacco leaves and its use for the treatment of dependence‚Äù. The innovation that NFL-101 is based on is therefore protected through to 2036 in France  the United States  and now also in China (300 million smokers) since April 2022 and in South Korea (9 million smokers) since May 2022.National registration applications are still in the review phase in the following regions and countries: Japan  Canada  Australia  Europe  Brazil  India  Indonesia  Philippines  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates and Nigeria.Partnership with Themis Medicare to develop NFL-101 in IndiaIn October 2022  NFL Biosciences set up a partnership with Themis Medicare Ltd to develop NFL-101 for the Indian market. Themis Medicare  a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Mumbai with a legacy of over 50 years of making new treatment options available to patients  submitted an investigational new drug (IND) application for a phase II / III clinical trial to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO)  India‚Äôs national regulatory authority (NRA).India has approximately 267 million smokers  and their options for smoking cessation are very limited. Once the study is approved  the clinical trial will be conducted in India  targeting 334 smokers. The cost of the process  from submission to completion of the study  will be paid for by Themis Medicare. Themis will purchase the NFL-101 active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from NFL Biosciences. NFL Biosciences will also receive double-digit royalties on sales.Recruitment of a Finance DirectorDuring the first half of 2022  the Company further strengthened its team by recruiting a Finance Director. Guillaume Audema has spent six years with an audit firm  where he became a manager. He joined NFL Biosciences after an initial experience as finance director in another company.2022 first-half earnings (January 1 ‚Äì June 30  2022)The accounts for the first half of 2022  prepared in accordance with French GAAP  were approved by the Board of Directors during its meeting on October 24  2022. The limited review of the half-year financial statements has been completed and the financial report for the first half of 2022 will be made available on October 26  2022; it can be consulted on www.nflbiosciences.com  under ‚ÄúInvestors‚Äù and ‚ÄúDocuments‚ÄùThe initial public offering on Euronext Growth Paris in July 2022 led to a ‚Ç¨4 960 724.34 issue premium  with a gross total of ‚Ç¨5m received (‚Ç¨4.2m net). Since then  NFL Biosciences has rolled out its business plan in line with the strategy presented at the time of its IPO  while further strengthening its organization to accompany these new steps forward in the development of its botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions  and particularly NFL-101.First-half EBIT totaled ‚Ç¨(1 301)K  compared with ‚Ç¨(978)K in 2022  reflecting the costs incurred for the CESTO II clinical trial  the strengthening of the teams from the third quarter of 2021  the manufacturing of batches of active ingredients  the intellectual property costs  and the payments to different CROs. Following the decision taken to recruit patients in France  the subsidiary in Australia will be dissolved during the second half of this year. This decision to recruit all of the patients in France was taken thanks to: (i) the good pace of recruitment in the various French CHU centers  and (ii) the significantly lower cost of clinical trials in France compared with Australia.The ramping up of the clinical trial is reflected in the increase in accounts payables to ‚Ç¨534K for the first half of this year  compared with ‚Ç¨120K at December 31  2021  primarily including accrued invoices. The Company still has an ‚Ç¨85K government-backed loan  with repayments based on one quarter per year to start up in 2023. A previous financing line dependent on the success of the NFL-101 phase I trial  recorded in quasi-equity  is currently being repaid based on ‚Ç¨18K per quarter and will be paid back in full by December 2023.Cash and cash equivalents at June 30  2022 totaled ‚Ç¨2 044 267 and do not include the research tax credit  worth ‚Ç¨100 670 for the first half of this year and ‚Ç¨159 447 for 2021  which had not yet been received by the Company as of June 30  2022.NFL Biosciences operates with a very low level of fixed costs and overheads  outsourcing activities to various industrial firms. This strategic choice enables more flexibility with the deployment of its financial resources with a view to advancing its development programs. The majority of free cash is allocated to its clinical programs.Requests for funding submitted to BPI France are currently at an advanced review stage  with repayments subject to the success of the projects: (i) a ‚Ç¨1.8m request concerning the CESTO2 study  for an initial total of ‚Ç¨1.3m  revised upwards following the decision to recruit patients exclusively in France  thus increasing the level of eligible expenses; (ii) a ‚Ç¨245K request concerning the formulation and clinical trial approval for NFL-301  a drug candidate for reducing alcohol consumption. The applications are currently being reviewed by BPI France  with a response expected over the coming weeks.The Company is continuously looking into the various financing options available in France and other countries  with a prefernce for non-dilutive financing.Corporate accounts (‚Ç¨) Jun 30  2022(6 months) Dec 31  2021(12 months) Jun 30  2021(6 months) Net revenues - - - Total operating income 5 39 0 EBIT (1 300 816) (901 867) (221 051) Financial income (expense) 107 829 (217 643) (354) Non-recurring income (expense) - - - Corporate income tax -121 632 -141 266 - Net income (1 071 354) (978 243) (221 405) Shareholders‚Äô equity 2 216 127 3 287 481 (71 380) Intangible assets (patents) 139 577 124 034 120 566 Liabilities 736 661 270 749 1 247 447 Cash and cash equivalents 2 044 267 3 039 570 175 972 Balance sheet total 3 043 765 3 685 207 1 428 067Outlook for 2022Dr Ignacio Faus  NFL Biosciences CEO: ‚ÄúNFL Biosciences is continuing to roll out the phase II/III clinical trial for NFL-101 (smoking cessation)  in addition to developing NFL-201 (cannabis addiction) and NFL-301(reducing alcohol consumption). As control over manufacturing know-how is a key element in the NFL-101 value chain  the production of GMP batches of the product is underway and a clinically ready batch is expected in 2023. We are also continuing to look for partners for NFL-101 outside of Europe and the United States  in low or mid-income countries. A first partnership has already been set up in India‚Äù.Progress with the NFL-301 product  the second pillar of the Company‚Äôs global strategy  is moving forward in partnership with the French firm Athena Pharmaceutiques. NFL Biosciences hopes to obtain a first usable formulation in early 2023.In line with its international development strategy  NFL Biosciences will be ramping up its initiatives enabling the development of NFL-101 and NFL-301 in the United States and other countries. Within this framework  various meetings are being scheduled with the US FDA  focused primarily on ensuring that the development plan for the drug candidates and the future clinical trials are acceptable for the FDA In the United States.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

The financial statements presented below are not and will not be audited.The Egide Group's consolidated EBITDA (adjusted from IFRS16) for the six months ended June 30  2022  amounts to ‚Ç¨1.87 million.First-half Results consolidated P&L(In ‚Ç¨m)H1 2021As a percentage of revenuesH1 2022As a percentage of revenues Sales 16.60 16.02 Current EBITDA * 1.19 7% 1.87 11% Operating Income (Ebit) 0.52 3% (1.29) (8%) Net Income 0.24 1% (2.02) (13%)*Ebitda corrected from IFRS16CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS AS OF JUNE 30  2022The Egide group's consolidated revenues for the first half of 2022 were ‚Ç¨16.02 million  down 3.5% compared with the first half of 2021  despite a 4.5% increase in sales at Egide SA and a 4.9% increase at Santier  which did not fully offset the 20.5% decrease in sales at Egide USA  which was favorably impacted by an exchange rate effect  since in constant dollars the group's growth would have been negative 8.2% (In US$  Egide USA revenue is down 27.9% and Santier is down 4.8%).These results are mainly explained by the difficulties in recruiting personnel and supply that have disrupted US production. Measures have been taken to increase the salaries of the direct labor force  but the situation remains tense.In terms of business  with the replacement of the Boll√®ne facility manager and the Cambridge facility manager  the group continued to renew its management with the arrival of David Hien to manage the factory in Boll√®ne (France) and Terry Toh for the one in Cambridge (USA).Thus  the highlights of the activity of the 3 sites can be analyzed as follows:Egide SA continues to grow and consolidates its leadership position in the thermal imaging market in Europe (notably with the acquisition of new customers)  Asia (China and South Korea) and the Middle East. The strategy focused on the development of high quality packages for power  optronics and microwave applications continues to be successful with new projects  in line with the production tool modernization plan  currently being deployed.Egide USA has been heavily impacted by the labor shortage in the United States  despite adjusting salary schedules to above-market levels. As new employees were brought into the plant  training and ""rework"" affected operational efficiency. Despite these industrial difficulties  which are beginning to subside  business activity and order backlog are high  thanks in particular to the thermal battery and defense sectors. The order book is solid.Santier's business improved in the first half of the year  but like the Cambridge plant  San Diego is suffering from the same U.S. labor market and supply chain issues.Sales in dollars accounted for 52% of the group's total revenues in the first half of 2022.RESULTS AS OF JUNE 30  2022The split by entity of the consolidated operating result is as follows:Egide SA  (37k‚Ç¨)For Egide USA  (312k‚Ç¨)For Santier (879k‚Ç¨)  including (345k‚Ç¨) additional goodwill impairment.The results of the US companies are mainly impacted by the problems of the US labor market  supply difficulties and other inefficiencies related to the need to train incoming staff.The non-recurring operating income and expenses for the first half of 2022 mainly concern the sale of the Cambridge building. The accounting impact before IFRS treatment of this sale represents a capital gain of ‚Ç¨2 952k  however the IFRS 16 treatment of lease-back transactions is extremely restrictive and only recognizes a capital gain of ‚Ç¨160k. The major difference comes from the reclassification of ‚Ç¨2 450k in financial debt and not in profit. The subsequent corollary  during the entire term of the lease  will be an appreciation in loan repayment and interest of a large part of the rent.The immediate consequence is that  unlike what had been anticipated  the first-half losses of the American entities are not offset by the capital gain on the sale of the building.Beyond this initial impact  it was decided to recognize taxes on this capital gain in the amount of the remaining deferred tax asset  i.e.  ‚Ç¨534k.In addition  an impairment loss was recognized which led to the recognition of an additional impairment of the goodwill of Santier Inc. of ‚Ç¨345k.IFRS 16 has reclassified ‚Ç¨336k of rental income into ‚Ç¨242k of depreciation and ‚Ç¨68k of interest  over H1 2022.The consolidated net result was thus negative by K‚Ç¨ 2016.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JUNE 30  2022ACTIF PASSIF Dec 2021 June 2022 Dec 2021 June 2022 Non-current assets 12.85 11.05 Shareholders‚Äô Equity 11.57 10.32 Inventory  trade  and other receivables13.86 15.91 Financial debt and provisions 4.71 7.77 Cash 1.59 3.89 Trade and other payables. 12.02 12.76 TOTAL 28.30 30.85 TOTAL 28.30 30.85Capital expenditure for the half-year were ‚Ç¨483k  including ‚Ç¨245k at Egide SA  ‚Ç¨160k at Egide USA and ‚Ç¨78k at Santier. The working capital requirement (inventories + account receivables + other current assets ‚Äì accounts payable - other current liabilities) is 104 days of sales  compared to 95 days on June 30  2021.Financial debts are mainly composed of 3 PGE loans for ‚Ç¨1 142k from Egide SA  equipment loans for ‚Ç¨748k from Egide USA and Santier. It should be noted that these American loans do not comply with the Covenants and have therefore all been reclassified as short-term. Egide SA also has 615k‚Ç¨ of other loans  including 456k‚Ç¨ for financing the Research Tax Credit.The IFRS treatment of the factor has reintegrated the ‚Ç¨1 558k of financed receivables into debt and accounts receivable. On the other hand  two revolving credit facilities to finance working capital are used in the USA for ‚Ç¨1 129k and ‚Ç¨1 239k respectively by Egide USA and Santier. These two accounts receivable and inventory financing facilities were contracted with the Banc of California  which does not wish to continue its relationship with the group.REVIEW OF THE US ENTITY FINANCING SITUATION.In the USA  the need to replace the current banking partner (Banc of California) at its request was a major disruptive factor  causing a delay in the publication of the Group's 2021 annual reports and constituting a going concern risk. This risk has been greatly reduced thanks to a $6 million lease-back of the Cambridge building  in return for the repayment of the corresponding $1.2 million outstanding real estate loan. This refinancing operation should be a key point in the resolution of the group's financing problems in the USA.However  as of June 30  2022  and at the date of publication of these financial statements  the replacement for this American banking partner has not yet been finalized. Gibraltar  which had been presented as a potential successor  seems to have requirements difficult to meet and further talks have started with other players.The deadline has been extended with Banc of California  to December 31  2022  and the group's management is confident about the outcome of the current financing search.OUTLOOKThe Group expects some improvement in the second half of the year without any favorable or unfavorable events. Some promising commercial negotiations are underway both in France and in the USA  which would allow a return to healthy growth at least for 2023.In addition to the staffing problems already mentioned  the group will be facing difficulties linked to price increases  particularly for energy and chemicals. The energy situation has not yet changed much  as supply contracts are still running. Moreover  while energy prices have risen five or tenfold in Europe  they have ""only"" increased by 50% in the USA. The group is taking measures to negotiate price increases with its customers  including on multi-year orders.The objectives of modernizing the group's production tool are still valid  to which are now added more ecological objectives and drastic energy savings.Jim Collins  President  and CEO of Egide  comments: ""It has been a difficult recovery from the pandemic and the industrial fire at our Cambridge facility. In the United States  recruitment difficulties have had a negative impact on our business. The lack of an available skilled workforce has required us to hire entry-level workers while increasing the cost of our existing workforce to retain them. In addition  our metal component suppliers are experiencing the same labor issues  as well as limited availability of special metal materials. This has disrupted our supply chain for these components. The result is significant delays in delivery of existing orders. While the company is working to resolve recruitment and supply chain delays  our customer base remains loyal.""He concluded: ""Our Boll√®ne plant has stabilized at break-even in terms of profitability  a major improvement over the past years. The prospect of increased revenue is encouraging for continued improvement. At the Group level  new opportunities have appeared in all our market segments in Europe and the United States. We are therefore ready to take the necessary steps to seize these opportunities. The result will be increased revenue and profitability.""FINANCIAL CALENDARHalf Year 2021 Results presentation to analysts & Investors ‚Äì Video Conference October 25  2022 ‚Äì 11 :30 am Paris TimeAvailability of the 2022 Half-Year Financial ReportOctober 26  20222022 full year salesJanuary 26  2023CONTACTSEGIDE ‚Äì Luc Ardon ‚Äì CFO - +33 4 90 30 35 94 ‚Äì luc.ardon@fr.egide-group.comFIN‚ÄôEXTENSO ‚Äì Press Relations - Isabelle Aprile - +33 1 39 97 61 22 ‚Äì i.aprile@finextenso.frAbout Egide - www.egide-group.comEgide is a group with an international dimension  specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

In 2021 and 2022  significant price increases have been implemented to offset the effects of purchase price inflation  and therefore the Group also measures the change in like-for-like sales including price adjustments in the CIS countries.1. Third quarter 2022 turnoverNet revenue for the Group was 1 005 million euros  up by +24.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Organic growth was +12.0% including the sales price increases in the CIS region implemented at the beginning of the year(1). The total effect of the sales price increases implemented across all segments is +11.9% on average compared to the third quarter of 2021.The EMEA segment achieved a turnover of 220 million euros  up +1.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021  including an unfavourable currency effect of -1.3% and +2.7% of organic growth. In an uncertain economic environment  the Group has seen a contraction in demand  amplified by inventory reductions across the value chain. Residential activity is significantly lower than in 2021  which was marked by a clear recovery. Commercial activity was also down in most categories with the exception of LVT tiles. However  sales price increases compensated for inflation in raw materials  transport and energy.The North America segment reported a revenue of 251 million euros  up +29.5% compared to the third quarter of 2021  reflecting solid like-for-like growth of +11.5% and a positive currency effect due to the appreciation of the dollar against the euro (+18.0%). Sales volumes and prices contributed to organic growth  which is well oriented in the Commercial Office  Healthcare and Education segments using carpet  accessories and vinyl or rubber flooring. The volume of activity in Residential is down in a market that is clearly slowing down.Revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to 191 million euros  up +16.5% compared to the third quarter of 2021  thanks to a positive currency effect mainly due to the appreciation of the rouble (+18.0%). The activity is slightly down organically (-1.5% including sales price increases in the CIS countries). In Russia  the market was penalised by the geopolitical context and Tarkett's activity was down by approximately -25% in volume compared to the previous year. Sales are higher than the previous year due to price increases and the appreciation of the rouble. At the end of September  sales in Russia represented approximately 9% of total Group sales. APAC and Latin America had an excellent quarter with strong volume growth and continued price increases.As expected  the Sport segment continues to show very strong growth for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was 343 million euros  up by +46.4% and including +30.5% organic growth compared to the third quarter of 2021. The market is extremely dynamic in North America for both artificial turf and athletic tracks  two segments where Tarkett benefits from its leadership.2. Outlook to end 2022 and short-term objectivesThe macroeconomic context poses significant uncertainties for activity at the end of this year and the beginning of 2023.In Europe  geopolitical tensions  inflation and uncertainty over gas and electricity supplies will continue to weigh on demand levels in a recessionary environment. The group expects business volumes in the fourth quarter to be lower than in the previous year.In North America  the significant rise in interest rates initially led to a slowdown in the residential market  to which the Group has only moderate exposure. Commercial activity has been better oriented so far  but could stall in a context of sluggish economic growth.The war in Ukraine will continue to weigh on the level of activity in the CIS area  although it is not possible at this stage to assess whether the market will stabilise at the current level (around -25% compared to 2021).The North American sports market is expected to continue to grow. The Group‚Äôs order book remains high and allows us to anticipate a good start to the year 2023.The slowdown in volumes in some of the Group's geographies will not generate all the expected productivity gains. They are estimated at between 5 to 10 million euros for the whole of 2022 (compared to the planned 15 to 20 million euros). To take account of the contraction in activity  the Group is taking immediate measures to reduce costs  particularly in Europe where most industrial sites have significantly reduced their production volumes.(1) Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency movements and are therefore excluded from the ‚Äúorganic growth‚Äù indicator. Excluding these price increases  organic growth was +9.7% (see Annexe 1)The purchase prices of the main raw materials are stabilising due to a slowdown in demand. Nevertheless  the sharp rise in energy prices will continue to fuel a high price level in the coming months. The Group confirms the estimate for 2022 of the negative effect of higher procurement costs: about 280 million euros more than in 2021.Since the beginning of the year  Tarkett has implemented significant sales price increases that will neutralise the effect of inflation over the whole year.The Group believes that the measures implemented will enable to achieve an Adjusted EBITDA level for the full year 2022 higher than that of 2021.This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

The exchange rate effect is obtained by applying the prior year‚Äôs exchange rate to sales for the current year and calculating the difference with sales for the current year. It also includes the effect of price adjustments in the CIS countries intended to offset the change in local currencies against the euro.The effect of changes in scope is composed of: current year sales by entities not included in the scope of consolidation in the same period of the prior year  until the anniversary of their consolidation; the reduction in sales related to divested businesses not included in the current year's scope of consolidation but included in sales for the same period in the previous year until the anniversary date of the divestiture.In millions of euros 2022 revenue 2021 revenue Change Of which volume Of which sales prices Of which CIS sales prices Of which exchange rate effect Of which effect of changes in scope Q1 Group Total 684.7 558.8 +22.5% +6.4% +8.8% +4.1% +3.3% - Of which organic growth +15.2% Of which sales price increases +12.9% Q2 Group Total 879.3 702.4 +25.2% +3.3% +9.3% +3.3% +9.3% +0.1% Of which organic growth +12.6% Of which sales price increases +12.6% S1 Group Total 1 564.0 1 261.2 +24.0% +4.6% +9.1% +3.6% +6.6% +0.1% Of which organic growth +13.8% Of which sales price increases +12.7% Q3 Group Total 1 005.4 809.4 +24.2% +0.1% +9.6% +2.3% +12.2% +0.1% Of which organic growth +9.7% Of which sales price increases +11.9% 9M Group Total 2 569.4 2 070.6 +24.1% +2.9% +9.2% +3.2% +8.7% +0.1% Of which organic growth +12.2% Of which sales price increases +12.4%Revenue in millions of euros 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change Of which organic growth Organic change including price changes in CIS (1) EMEA 707.4 662.6 +6.8% +7.7% +7.7% North America 702.2 546.5 +28.5% +14.4% +14.4% CIS  APAC & Latin America 482.1 418.7 +15.1% -11.5% +4.3% Sports 677.7 442.7 +53.1% +38.4% +38.4% Group Total 2 569.4 2 070.6 +24.1% +12.2% +15.3%2/ Bridges in millions of euros 2022Revenue by segmentQ3 2021 809.4 +/- EMEA +6.0 +/- North America +22.4 +/- CIS  APAC & Latin America -22.7 +/- Sports +70.0 Q3 2022 like-for-like scope and exchange rate 885.1 +/- Scope effect +1.4 +/- Currencies +74.6 +/- Lag effect in CIS +44.3 Q3 2022 1 005.49M 2021 2 070.6 +/- EMEA +49.8 +/- North America +78.6 +/- CIS  APAC & Latin America -48.0 +/- Sports +167.6 9M 2022 Like-for-Like 2 318.6 +/- Scope effect +2.6 +/- Currencies +148.9 +/- ‚ÄúLag effect‚Äù in CIS +99.3 9M 2022 2 569.4***Attachment,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.0,mixed,0.44,0.17,0.4,True,English,"['sales price increases', 'Q3 2022 revenue', 'Turnover growth', 'solid performance', 'Sports', 'The North America segment', 'The Supervisory Board', 'alternative performance indicators', 'uncertain economic environment', 'unfavourable currency effect', 'positive currency effect', 'Selling price adjustments', 'positive inflation balance', 'significant price increases', 'sales price increases', 'Third quarter 2022 results', 'third consecutive quarter', 'purchase price inflation', 'less dynamic market', 'The EMEA segment', 'Rising sales prices', 'organic growth‚Äù indicator', 'Moderate volume growth', 'Third quarter 2022 turnover', 'strong volume growth', 'Strong revenue growth', 'total Group sales', 'total effect', 'strong growth', 'price changes', 'currency movements', 'solid performance', 'The Group', 'Sport segment', 'significant uncertainties', 'recessionary environment', 'Sales volumes', 'excellent quarter', '+30.5% organic growth', 'Latin America', 'Turnover growth', 'continued growth', 'currency effects', 'English French', 'distribution chain', 'first half', 'good level', 'inventory reductions', 'value chain', 'clear recovery', 'most categories', 'LVT tiles', 'raw materials', 'Commercial Office', 'rubber flooring', 'geopolitical context', 'artificial turf', 'athletic tracks', 'short-term objectives', 'macroeconomic context', 'geopolitical tensions', 'electricity supplies', 'business volumes', 'fourth q', 'stable volume', '1,005 million euros', '220 million euros', '251 million euros', '191 million euros', 'energy prices', 'Euronext Paris', 'Net revenue', 'Education segments', 'previous year', 'two segments', 'Organic change', 'CIS countries', 'CIS region', 'Commercial activity', 'Q3 2022 revenue', 'Residential activity', 'demand levels', 'Sports', 'slowdown', 'destocking', 'Asia', 'Tarkett', 'TKTT', 'IFRS', 'detail', 'appendix', 'millions', 'APAC', 'beginning', 'contraction', 'exception', 'transport', 'appreciation', 'dollar', 'Healthcare', 'carpet', 'accessories', 'vinyl', 'Russia', 'September', 'leadership', 'Outlook', 'Europe', 'uncertainty', 'gas', '2021']",2022-10-25,2022-10-26,globenewswire.com

Beyond 22-25   our new strategic plan  is a response to today‚Äôs new paradigm shaped by a disruptive change in work habits  the energy transition and the increasing digitization of the economy. As the everyday platform for people at work  we are seeking to further assert ourselves as a responsible player  promoting socially  economically and environmentally virtuous solutions. Our products create purchasing power for employees and provide employers with tools to increase employee engagement. They encourage healthy eating and support economic players as they transition to cleaner forms of transportation. They also generate business for our partner merchants and drive greater efficiency for businesses.Our strategic plan  Beyond 22-25   is designed to take full advantage of our B2B2C digital platform business model. We will continue to scale our core business by stepping up our investments in technology and capitalizing on our business excellence in markets that are still largely underpenetrated. We will extend our scope by accelerating the development of our solutions beyond meal benefits  beyond fuel cards and beyond payment solutions. We will also create new partnerships to distribute our solutions and aggregate third-party products on our own platform. We will further leverage the power of our data to create new sources of revenue. And we will explore new opportunities to expand in new markets. Our plan is based on sustained organic growth  but also on our ability to seize external growth opportunities. We are now in an ideal position to scale our platform advantage. That is why for the next three years we have set ourselves even bigger ambitions for sustainable and profitable growth than in our previous plans. And  based on these targets  we can reasonably aim for total revenue of around ‚Ç¨5 billion by 2030.‚ÄùEDENRED HAS PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMED ITS MARKETS SINCE 2016 BY SUCCESSFULLY DISRUPTING ITS BUSINESS MODELA disruption based on a four-pronged approachThe successful execution of the Fast Forward and Next Frontier strategic plans has enabled Edenred to disrupt its business model since 2016  positioning it as market leader today.The Group has considerably enhanced its business portfolio  notably with numerous Employee Benefits solutions other than meal benefits (Beyond Food) and the development of Fleet & Mobility Solutions other than fuel cards (Beyond Fuel). These solutions meet the needs of companies and employees  and are increasingly quick to adopt and easy to use. At the same time  Edenred has invested increasingly heavily in its technology assets to establish itself as an innovation leader. In still largely underpenetrated markets  Edenred has also developed a segmented and optimized go-to-market strategy  enabling it to strengthen its market leadership  particularly in the SME segment. Lastly  a commitment to ESG lies at the heart of the Group‚Äôs transformation  as notably expressed through its Ideal CSR policy launched in 2017 and reinforced by its solutions that encourage more virtuous behaviors.Today  Edenred benefits from the unique nature of its B2B2C platform  which connects 52 million users and more than 2 million merchants via approximately 950 000 corporate clients. With more than 250 digital programs in 45 countries  Edenred offers specific-purpose payment solutions and services in three business lines: Employee Benefits  notably for food (such as meal benefits) and incentives (such as gift cards and employee engagement platforms); Fleet & Mobility Solutions (such as multi-energy  maintenance  toll and parking solutions); and Complementary Solutions (such as corporate payments). True to the Group‚Äôs purpose  ‚ÄúEnrich connections. For good.‚Äù  these solutions have a positive impact for all of its stakeholders  enhancing users‚Äô well-being and purchasing power  improving companies‚Äô attractiveness and efficiency  and vitalizing the employment market and the local economy. They also foster access to healthier food  more environmentally friendly products and softer mobility.Financial results that reflect the Group‚Äôs successful transformationWith business volume of approximately ‚Ç¨35 billion  Edenred has reached another dimension. Thanks to its profound transformation  Edenred was able to generate sustainable and profitable growth over the 2016-2022 period2. In each of its businesses and geographies  the Group‚Äôs technology assets have been a key differentiating factor in outperforming its markets and generating new sources of growth. The Group‚Äôs total revenue was multiplied by 1.8 over this period  while EBITDA was almost doubled  reflecting the strong operating leverage available to the Group.BEYOND 22-25 : A PLAN TO BECOME THE GLOBAL PLATFORM OF CHOICE IN EXTENDED MARKETSIn an environment shaped by accelerating new structural trends such as changes in the working world  a new era of mobility and global ecosystem digitization  Edenred aims to become the global platform of choice in larger markets.A plan built around three priorities: Scale  Extend  ExpandEdenred operates in markets that are still largely underpenetrated and that therefore harbor considerable growth opportunities  reinforced by widespread adoption of new behaviors. Against this backdrop  the Group intends to leverage to the full its unique global platform advantage by developing a common approach in each of its business lines based on three priorities:Scale the Core ‚Äì grow further in its existing markets  which are still largely underpenetrated  notably by capitalizing on a segmented go-to-market strategy  cross-selling and up-selling in its client portfolio  and increasing user monetization.‚Äì grow further in its existing markets  which are still largely underpenetrated  notably by capitalizing on a segmented go-to-market strategy  cross-selling and up-selling in its client portfolio  and increasing user monetization.

Expand in New Businesses ‚Äì expand into promising new geographies  such as the United States  the world‚Äôs largest economy.In the larger addressable markets within each of its business lines  Edenred is ideally positioned to seize new growth opportunities thanks to its enriched business model. The Group can  for example  leverage its unique and flexible digital platform comprising four layers: stakeholder experiences  business applications  digital services and infrastructure. The platform is a truly differentiating technology asset and will be used to enable the Group to aggregate  orchestrate and distribute a wider range of B2B2C services  incorporating third-party solutions into the mix and extending the reach of Edenred solutions through indirect distribution channels.A unique platform serving an enriched business modelEdenred also intends to continue optimizing its unique business model based on low B2B2C acquisition costs  high levels of user engagement and data monetization. In this way  the Group will penetrate deeper into its markets  particularly the SME segment. At the same time  Edenred plans to further increase user engagement  thanks to a widespread mobile-first approach and the extensive use of satisfaction measurement tools. Lastly  the Group aims to step up sales of its data-powered solutions and services.BIGGER FINANCIAL AMBITIONS AND A COMMITMENT TO NET ZERO CARBON BY 2050The Beyond 22-25 strategic plan will drive sustainable and profitable growth and generate high levels of free cash flow over the 2022-2025 period. It is underpinned by an ambitious financial trajectory with higher annual financial targets than for the previous plan:Annual like-for-like EBITDA growth >+12%Annual free cash flowithEBITDA conversion rate >70%Edenred has also placed ESG at the heart of its Beyond 22-25 plan  announcing an acceleration in its extra-financial commitments. In line with SBTi targets  the Group has committed to net zero carbon by 2050. It has also stepped up the objectives of its Ideal CSR policy  with the aim of becoming  by 2030  an employer of choice and a true Company for Good through its solutions that encourage more virtuous and responsible behaviors.A BALANCED CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT POLICYThe Group will pursue an ambitious capital deployment policy over the 2022-2025 period based on a virtuous balance between technology investments  acquisitions and shareholder returns  while reaffirming its commitment to maintaining a Strong Investment Grade rating.Increased investmentsEdenred plans to continue investing in its platform to fuel the Group‚Äôs sustainable and profitable growth and maintain its technology leadership. It expects annual investment spend to represent between 7% and 8% of total revenue.A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions to enrich the Group‚Äôs portfolio of solutionsBuilding on its sound financial position  historically low level of debt and strong cash flow generation  Edenred intends to seize external growth opportunities while maintaining its Strong Investment Grade rating. The Group currently has M&A firepower of ‚Ç¨2 billion. The Group will therefore target opportunities in line with the strategic ambitions of its Beyond 22-25 plan ‚Äì namely Scale  Extend and Expand ‚Äì within its three business lines:In Employee Benefits: make bolt-on acquisitions to consolidate its position as world leader in this market and continue to enrich its Beyond Food solutions beyond organic development;In Fleet & Mobility Solutions: continue to extend its Beyond Fuel range of value-added services to become the global platform for greener B2B mobility;In Complementary Solutions: develop Corporate Payment Services by targeting new business segments and expand its offering along the value chain.A policy of progressive dividend growthLastly  the Beyond 22-25 plan will see the Group pursue a policy of progressive dividend growth over the period  resulting in an increase in absolute value each year.***The Capital Markets Day event will be webcast live on www.edenred.com starting at 10:15 a.m. (CEST).

Data from 40 patients implanted with the alfapump in the Pivotal Cohort met all primary effectiveness endpoints of the study with statistical significance and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectations. These positive data will enable the Company to file a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023  intended to support the approval of the alfapump in the US.Professor Florence Wong  University of Toronto  Hepatologist at Toronto General Hospital  Ontario  Canada and Principal Investigator for the POSEIDON study  commented: ‚ÄúAscites imposes a significant health care burden and negative impact on quality of life for this large and growing patient population of patients with liver cirrhosis. These positive top-line results are very encouraging  indicating that the alfapump could provide great benefits to patients with cirrhosis and ascites  and dramatically reduce their visits to the hospital for paracentesis. The safety data regarding the primary safety endpoint are in line with expectations and reassuring for the potential of the alfapump as a long-term treatment in this patient population. I look forward to presenting these data at a scientific congress in due course to discuss this important innovation for a patient population that is in clear need of expanded treatment options.‚ÄùIan Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer at Sequana Medical  added: ‚ÄúWe are delighted with these excellent results  and the team is focused on bringing the alfapump to this large and growing patient population. We are grateful to the patients  clinicians and their teams who participated in this landmark study. The third party market assessment highlights the large number of recurrent or refractory liver ascites patients  with strong forecast growth driven in part by the Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (‚ÄúNASH‚Äù) epidemic. We believe that there is a clear need for improved treatment options for this important patient group  and we are preparing to commercialize the alfapump through our focused commercial team.‚ÄùPositive top-line data from 40 patients in the Pivotal CohortForty patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis have been implanted with the alfapump in the Pivotal Cohort of the POSEIDON study. Over one third of these patients had NASH or combined NASH etiology.The primary effectiveness endpoint hypotheses include:1) median per-patient ratio of post-implant three-month observation period (month four to six) (‚ÄúPost-Implant Observation Period‚Äù) to the pre-implant three-month observation period (‚ÄúPre-Implant Observation Period‚Äù) with respect to number of therapeutic paracentesis (‚ÄúTP‚Äù) is less than 0.5 (or a median reduction of at least 50%); and2) at least 50% of patients achieve a 50% reduction in the requirement for TP in the same period.Data from the Pivotal Cohort patients substantially exceeded the pre-defined thresholds for study success as shown in the table below.Pivotal Cohort N=40 %i p-valueii 1) Frequency of TPa. median per-patient ratiob. mean per-patient ratio100% reduction82% reductionP<0.001-2) Proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in number of TP Post- vs Pre-Implant77% of patientsP<0.001Of the 40 patients implanted with the alfapump in the Pivotal Cohort  26 patients completed alfapump therapy through day 180 post-implantation. These 26 patients have a median reduction of 100% (mean reduction of 93%) in frequency of TP in the Post-Implant Observation Period vs Pre-Implant Observation Period and 92% of patients have at least a 50% reduction in number of TP in the same periodiii. Pre-specified imputation methods were used to calculate the primary effectiveness endpoints in the other 14 patients that had exited the study prior to completing the six months post-implantation period. Of these 14 patients  eight were due to reasons such as death or withdrawal due to unrelated adverse event or for liver transplant and six were due to alfapump system  procedure or therapy related reasons.The primary safety endpoint is the combined rate of i) open surgical re-intervention (requiring general anesthesia or laparotomy) due to pump system related adverse event or to restore pump functionality  ii) pump explant (without replacement) due to pump system related adverse event  or iii) pump system related death from time of pump implant through six months post-implantation as adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). There were six primary safety events in the 40 Pivotal Cohort patients  which is in line with Company expectations. Of the six primary safety events  three were explants due to wound or skin erosion  and three were explants due to patient-reported discomfort (all patient-reported discomfort events were adjudicated by the CEC as moderate severity). At the time of the primary endpoint analysis  no unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEiv) occurred during the course of the POSEIDON study.Additional secondary efficacy and safety endpoints are being analysed and detailed results from the POSEIDON study will be submitted for presentation at a forthcoming medical liver meeting in 2023.Poster presentation at AASLD The Liver MeetingData from the Roll-In Cohort of POSEIDONv have been selected for a poster presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting  taking place in Washington  DC from 4 to 8 November 2022. The poster  titled ‚ÄúAn Automatic Low Flow Ascites Pump Improves Ascites Control and Quality of Life In Patients with Cirrhosis and Recurrent Ascites‚Äù will be presented by Dr. Florence Wong  MD  FAASLD  University of Toronto on Sunday  November 6th between 1:00-2:00 pm EST. Sequana Medical management will attend The Liver Meeting from 4 to 6 November and is available to meet.Large and growing population of patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in North AmericaThe Company has commissioned a market analysis by an international consultancy group that is experienced in such work to assess the North American market of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Through a detailed analysis of claims from Medicare and multiple commercial payers  as well as a review of published literature  the analysis estimates there to be more than 60 000 patients in North America in 2022 with recurrent or refractory ascites. This population is forecast to grow at six to seven percent annually  reaching over 140 000 patients in 2032  with NASH being a major driver of this growth.C onference Call and WebcastSequana Medical will host a conference call with live webcast presentation today at 15:00 CET / 08:00 ET.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they are implanted with the alfapump and will be used for primary endpoint analysis. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in therapeutic paracentesis in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival.For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About fluid overload in liver cirrhosis (AKA ascites)Fluid accumulation in the abdomen is a significant and common complication of liver cirrhosis. Approximately 10% of these patients do not respond to diuretic drugs and most require recurrent external drainage (AKA paracentesis)  an invasive and painful procedure that only provides temporary benefit  require frequent hospitalizations and severely impacts their quality of life. The North American market for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is estimated at over 60 000 patients in 2022  and this number is expected to grow at 6-7% per annum  reaching over 140 000 patients in 2032 due to the dramatic growth of fatty liver disease / non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer.

This was driven by ongoing growth in Energy & Resources and Government & Agencies  the recovery of Sports & Leisure in the second half as events and conventions picked up strongly and Corporate Services benefiting from a solid return to the office. The trend in the last two months of the year was in line with our Work from Home estimates made in 2020 and we anticipate further improvement. In Healthcare & Seniors   organic growth was +4.0%. Our performance was driven by pricing  cross-selling and the progressive recovery of hospital retail sales and Seniors‚Äô occupancy. This was partially offset by the early closure of the Testing centers in the UK at the end of March. In Education   organic growth was +22.0%  following the strong post-Covid recovery in activity in Universities and Schools in North America  China and India.Significant improvement in key performance indicators: Client retention rate was 94.5%  +140 bps higher than the previous year. This record performance was the result of an improvement in almost all regions  especially in North America. In France  difficult inflation negotiations  particularly in public sector Schools  led to some contract exits.New sales development was up +150 bps at 7.5%  with a solid contribution from all segments. Total development  including cross-selling  was 1.5 billion euros. The year ended strongly with the win of the Ardent healthcare services contract to supply patient and staff dining  nutrition counselling  retail and environmental services (incl.

Employee benefits organic growth was +18.7% and accelerated sequentially through the year  reaching +23.1% in the fourth quarter. Issue volume increased +16.2%  boosted by strong net new business leveraging digital products and enhanced sales efficiency  as well as face value increases. Financial revenues were also up strongly supported by rising interest rates  particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe.Underlying operating profit was 1 059 million euros  up +83.3%.Underlying operating margin was 5.0%  up +170 bps. This significant improvement was a result of the strong recovery in volumes  the benefit of the GET efficiency program  and effective actions to mitigate inflation through indexation  contract renegotiations and productivity. The improvement was across both On-Site  up +160 bps to 4.6%  and Benefits & Rewards up +370 bps to 28.6%.Other operating expenses (net) amounted to 5 million euros in Fiscal 2022  compared to 239 million euros in the previous year. Restructuring costs fell to 10 million euros and gains on the sale of assets more than off-set losses.The Effective tax rate returned to a more normal level of 27.5% compared to 43.9% in the previous year.Net income Group share multiplied by five to reach 695 million euros  versus 139 million euros in Fiscal 2021.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the Underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1‚Ç¨= AVERAGE RATE FY 2022 AVERAGE RATE FY 2021 AVERAGE RATE FY 2022VS.

As a result  the margin was up +230 bps to 3.5%. This improved performance reflects the flow-through of the significant improvement in the activity levels in Corporate Services and Sports & Leisure  operational efficiencies and strong price increases and mitigation to offset inflation.In Healthcare & Seniors   the +7.6% increase in Underlying operating profit resulted in a margin of 6.5%  down -10 bps  in a highly inflationary environment  particularly in North America. Pricing has also been strong in this segment; the teams have been very active in rolling out their mitigation actions and the results of the portfolio clean-up of the preceding years is now coming through.In Education  Underlying operating profit was up +144.5% and the margin up +250 bps to 5.0% thanks to the flow-through of the revenue recovery  particularly in North America. High inflation and staff shortages have been offset by very significant mitigation efforts on the ground  as well as pricing in North America. Pricing has been more difficult in France where the national inflation index used in the Schools contracts has underperformed our input cost increases.Benefits & Rewards Services Underlying operating profit was up +33.2%  or +30.5% excluding the positive impact of currencies. The margin increased to 28.6% up +360 bps or +370 bps excluding currencies  helped by the strong acceleration in volumes and  in particular  the financial revenues from quarter to quarter throughout the year. While processing costs have remained stable relative to revenues  all other cost increases have been contained.The GET efficiency program has provided a significant improvement in profitability in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022. Half of the initiatives were aimed at protecting the gross profit margin by adapting on-site costs to the new post-Covid levels of activity and to compensate for the end of government aid. The other half of the program was aimed at structurally reducing SG&A for the long-term by simplifying the structures in the Group  to free up capacity to invest in growth and to enhance margins.Fiscal 2022 results benefited from the final tranche of cost savings of 164 million euros  of which 98 million euros in cost avoidance and 66 million euros in SG&A. The cash impact for the year was 73 million euros.GET PROGRAM FISCAL 2020 FISCAL 2021 FISCAL 2022 TARGET (in million euros) CUMULATED NUMBERS Total exceptional costs 158 312 322 350 Cash impact (75) (217) (290) (315) SG&A savings ‚Äî 91 157 175 Gross profit cost avoidance ‚Äî 127 225 175 Total savings ‚Äî 218 382 350 Savings/Costs 119% 100%Cumulated  the GET program has cost 322 million euros  generated 382 million euros of annual savings  with a cash impact of 290 million euros. As a result  the program exceeded the target cost savings by 32 million euros with a ratio of savings to costs of 119%  also above the target of 100%.1.5 Group net profitOther operating income and expenses amounted to 5 million euros compared to 239 million euros in the previous year. This significant reduction is due to the end of the GET program  with only 10 million euros of restructuring costs  a spill-over from Fiscal 2021  compared to 153 million euros in the previous year  and 117 million euros of gains related to the disposals program.As a result  the Operating Profit recovered to 1 054 million euros compared to 339 million euros in the previous year.(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 1 059 578 Net scope change impacts 50 (32) Restructuring and rationalization costs (10) (153) Amortization of purchased intangible assets (46) (33) Other 1 (21) Other Operating income and expenses (5) (239) OPERATING PROFIT 1 054 339Fiscal 2022 Net financial expenses decreased to 87 million euros against 106 million euros in the previous year. The reduction came from the net effect of the debt reimbursements and issuance in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022  an increase in interest income related to higher levels of activity and some positive currency impacts. The blended cost of debt at Fiscal 2022 year end was stable at 1.6% relative to year end Fiscal 2021.The tax charge was up significantly to 264 million euros  reflecting the higher pre-tax profit. However  the Effective tax rate on Pre-tax profit (excluding the share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method) of 960 million euros was 27.5%  back down to a more normal rate  against 43.9% last year.The share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method was stable at 8 million euros. Profit attributed to non-controlling interests was 9 million euros compared to the previous year amount of -2 million euros.As a result  Group net income was multiplied by five to reach 695 million euros  compared to 139 million euros in Fiscal 2021. Underlying net profit adjusted for Other operating income and expenses net of tax doubled to reach 699 million euros  compared to 346 million euros in Fiscal 2021.1.6 Earnings per sharePublished EPS was 4.75 euros against 0.95 euro in Fiscal 2021. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2022 was more or less stable at 146 295 576 compared to 146 004 484 shares for Fiscal 2021. As a result of much lower Other income and expenses  Underlying EPS was very close to the published number  amounting to 4.78 euros  double the previous year.1.7 Proposed dividendThe Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of 2.40‚Ç¨  up +20% compared to Fiscal 2021  in line with our policy of a pay-out ratio of 50% of Underlying net profit.2 Consolidated financial position2.1 Cash flowsCash flows for the period were as follows:(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 Operating cash flow 1 243 766 Change in working capital excluding change in BRS financial assets(1) (63) 171 IFRS 16 outflow (208) (242) Net capital expenditure (341) (211) Free cash flow(2) 631 483 Net acquisitions 14 (42) Share buy-backs (13) (11) Dividends paid to shareholders (294) ‚Äî Other changes (including scope and exchange rates) (128) (40) (Increase)/decrease in net debt 210 390(1) Excluding change in financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity of -145 million euros in Fiscal 2022versus 45 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Total change in working capital as reported in consolidated accounts:in Fiscal 2022: -208 million euros = -63 million euros - 145 million eurosand in Fiscal 2021: 216 million euros = 171 million euros + 45 million euros.(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group‚Äôs performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable).To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).Free cash flow  adjusted for IFRS 16  was 631 million euros against 483 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Operating cash flow of 1 243 million euros improved significantly compared to the previous year at 766 million euros  boosted by the strong recovery in Underlying operating profit and by the Benefits & Rewards Services indemnity from the Hungarian government related to closure of the business for 34 million euros.The Working capital outflow in Fiscal 2022 of 63 million euros was due to some significant exceptional items such as restructuring costs  a cash contribution to the UK pension found for 71 million euros  the unwinding of government Covid-linked payment delays for 117 million euros  the reimbursement of the Tokyo Olympics hospitality packages for 55 million euros and the Benefits & Rewards fine related to the dispute with the French competition authorities which is being paid monthly.Net capital expenditure  including client investments  increased to 341 million euros  and 1.6% of revenues  compared to 211 million euros in the preceding year  at 1.2% of revenues. Gross capex was 478 million euros  or 2.3% of revenues. Digital and IT investments accounted for 30% of the gross spend  with the remainder focused on client facing investments.Benefits & Rewards Services continued to invest heavily  at a rate of 9.1% of revenues  with 93% of its investments in IT and digital. The Business & Administrations gross capital expenditure to revenues ratio was at 1.3%  nearly double last year  linked to the recovery in Sports & Leisure activity. Healthcare was also at 1.5%  the highest level in many years  due to some significant investments in several hospitals in North America and Continental Europe. On the other hand  in Education  capex to sales was down -60 bps this year at 2.7% of revenues even though the euro amount remained stable.Cash conversion was 91%  below the normal level of 100%  but including 363 million euros of negative non-recurring elements.M&A activity restarted in Fiscal 2022 with acquisition spend of 70 million euros but was more than offset by disposals of 84 million euros.After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt decreased by 210 million euros ending the year to 1 268 million euros at August 31  2022.2.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFiscal 2022 has been an active year for closing numerous disposals of non-core activities and geographies:the On-site Services activities in Morocco  the Congo and Russia;Lido in France;Non-strategic account portfolios in Australia and the Czech Republic;Benefits & Rewards activities in Russia in December 2021  followed by the On-site activities in the second half;Benefits & Rewards sports cards in Germany  Romania and Spain;The Childcare activities  completed mid-March.On the other hand  further strategic acquisitions & investments have also been made:In the Advanced Food Model  Sodexo has acquired Frontline Food Services and VendEdge in North America and an off-site production unit in China. Sodexo has also increased its participation in the digital food services company  Meican.In the GPO space  three investments have been made to strengthen the position of Entegra Europe.In the Healthcare segment  we have acquired a technical equipment management activity in Asia-Pacific.Overall disposals net of acquisitions amounted to 14 million euros.2.3 Condensed consolidated statement of financial position at August 31  2022(in million euros) AUGUST 31  2022 AUGUST 31  2021 (in million euros) AUGUST 31  2022 AUGUST 31  2021 Non-current assets 10 785 9 360 Shareholders‚Äô equity 4 415 3 168 Current assets excluding cash 5 653 5 030 Non-controlling interests 10 7 Restricted cash Benefits & Rewards 960 773 Non-current liabilities 7 223 6 962 Financial assets Benefits & Rewards 297 289 Current liabilities 9 272 8 854 Cash 3 225 3 539 TOTAL ASSETS 20 920 18 991 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS‚Äô EQUITY 20 920 18 991 Borrowings 5 742 6 072 Net debt 1 268 1 478 Gearing 28.7% 46.6% Net debt ratio 1.0x 1.7xThe increase in shareholders‚Äô equity was due to several factors: the currency translation adjustment of some currencies such as US dollar and the Brazilian real  as well as the revaluation of financial assets under IFRS 9.As of August 31  2022  net debt fell to 1 268 million euros  representing a gearing of 28.7%  and a net debt ratio of 1x  at the bottom of the target range of between 1x and 2x.In October 2021  Sodexo reimbursed by anticipation a 600 million euros bond due to mature in January 2022.At year end  the Group's gross debt of 5.7 billion euros was 71% euro-denominated  22% dollar-denominated and 6% sterling denominated  with an average maturity of 4.8 years  96% at fixed rates and 100% covenant-free.By the end of Fiscal 2022  Operating cash reached a total of 4 474 million euros  including 960 million euros of restricted cash and 297 million euros of financial assets of Benefits & Rewards Services. The Benefits & Rewards Services activity asset to liability coverage is at 121% compared to 113% as at August 31  2021  with operating cash of 2 764 million euros and client receivables of 1 482 million euros  compared to voucher liabilities of 3 509 million euros. The rest of the Group also had a significant operating cash position of 1 710 million euros.At the year end  unused credit lines totaled 2.0 billion euros.2.4 Subsequent eventsNo major events have occurred since the closing of the accounts.2.5 Alternative Performance Measure definitionsBlended cost of debtThe blended cost of debt is calculated at period end and is the weighted blended financing rate on borrowings (including derivative financial instruments and commercial papers) and cash pooling balances at period end.Free cash flowPlease refer to the section entitled Consolidated financial position.Growth excluding currency effectThe currency effect is determined by applying the previous year‚Äôs average exchange rates to the current year figures except in hyper-inflationary economies where all figures are converted at the latest closing rate for both periods when the impact is significant.Issue volumeIssue volume corresponds to the total face value of service vouchers  cards and digitally delivered services issued by Benefits & Rewards Services for beneficiaries on behalf of clients.Net debtNet debt is defined as Group borrowing at the balance sheet date  less operating cash.Organic growthOrganic growth corresponds to the increase in revenue for a given period (the ‚Äúcurrent period‚Äù) compared to the revenue reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year  calculated using the exchange rate for the prior fiscal year; and excluding the impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments  as follows:for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Underlying Net profitUnderlying Net profit presents a net income excluding significant unusual and/or infrequent elements. Therefore  it corresponds to the Net Income Group share excluding Other Income and Expense and significant non-recurring elements in both Net Financial Expense and Income Tax Expense where relevant.Underlying Net profit per shareUnderlying Net profit per share presents the Underlying net profit divided by the average number of shares.Underlying operating profit marginThe underlying operating profit margin corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues.Underlying operating profit margin at constant ratesThe underlying operating profit margin at constant rates corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues  calculated by converting 2022 figures at Fiscal 2021 rates  except for countries with hyperinflationary economies.2Fiscal 2022 Consolidated financial statementsNotes to the Financial Statements will be found in the Universal Registration Documentto be published on November 9  20221.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Syst√®mes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group‚Äôs actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù section 1.9 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document (‚ÄòDocument d'enregistrement universel‚Äô) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2022  available on the Group‚Äôs website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor ‚ÄúUncertain Global Economic Environment‚Äù in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:‚ÄúIn light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô solutions may represent a large portion of a customer‚Äôs investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers‚Äô revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Syst√®mes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô diversification efforts in new industries;current inflation forecasts  as well as uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of this trend  could adversely affect the financial condition of Dassault Syst√®mes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô products ‚Äì already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers ‚Äì could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises ‚Äì health and geopolitical crises in particular ‚Äì could have consequences for the health and safety of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô employees. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing capabilities of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Syst√®mes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company‚Äôs business results.‚ÄùIn preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.05 per ‚Ç¨1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY139.0 to ‚Ç¨1.00  before hedging for the fourth quarter 2022. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.06 per ‚Ç¨1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY136.7 to ‚Ç¨1.00  before hedging for the full year 2022. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group‚Äôs results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

We believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business. Therefore  we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed by us ‚Äúin constant currencies‚Äù  the results of the ‚Äúprior‚Äù period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  we are including this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates are expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (‚Äúorganic growth‚Äù)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group‚Äôs scope  Dassault Syst√®mes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Syst√®mes‚Äô Industries develop Solution Experiences  industry-focused offerings that deliver specific value to companies and users in a particular industry.

This reflects the combination of a 28% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter and a positive currency impact of 11%1.Pierre Barnab√©  Soitec‚Äôs CEO  commented: ‚ÄúAfter several months in Soitec  I am thrilled and proud to announce this quarterly revenue. The Q2‚Äô23 performance reflects the strong dynamics in each of our three markets and a robust industrial execution. Mobile communications growth continued to be driven by radiofrequency applications that are supported by the growing 5G deployment. For the second consecutive quarter  we recorded a strong surge in FD-SOI wafer sales across our three end markets  confirming the solid momentum on its adoption. With this H1‚Äô23 performance  we do confirm our outlook for the full year.‚ÄùSecond quarter FY‚Äô23 consolidated revenue (unaudited)As indicated during the presentation of its full-year results in June 2022  Soitec is  from now on  reporting its revenue by end market instead of breaking it down by wafer size. This decision was made in order to better reflect the way Soitec is conducting and monitoring its business2.Q2‚Äô22 Q2‚Äô23 Q2‚Äô23/Q2‚Äô22 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 142 189 +32% +22% Automotive & Industrial 17 34 +96% +80% Smart devices 33 45 +37% +28% Total revenue 193 268 +39% +28%Soitec recorded a 28% total revenue increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23 compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22. Performance was driven by sustained growth in each of the three end markets: Mobile communications  Automotive & Industrial and Smart Devices.Mobile communicationsGrowth in Mobile communications continues to be supported by the adoption of 5G smartphones and WiFi6  as well as the deployment of 5G infrastructure.In the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  Mobile communications revenue reached 189 million Euros  a 22% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22  mainly reflecting an increase in volumes.RF-SOI wafer sales continue to be boosted by the increase in RF content in every 5G smartphone and higher penetration of high-end phones. In the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  Soitec enjoyed further growth in RF-SOI 200-mm and sharp growth in RF-SOI 300-mm  enabled by the ongoing ramp-up in production at its Singapore facility.FD-SOI wafer sales continue to demonstrate the value for 5G front end modules both on mmWaves and Sub 6 GHz.Regarding POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters for 5G smartphones  while several customers are confirming the value of POI products  they are going through the adoption phase  a process that will continue in the coming quarters.Automotive & IndustrialDemand from the automotive industry is increasingly supported by the growing needs for multimedia content (infotainment)  by the trends towards more autonomous driving and functional safety  as well as by the shift to greener vehicles powered by electric and hybrid engines.Automotive & Industrial revenue reached 34 million Euros in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  a 17 million Euros increase compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22. Growth essentially reflects an increase in volumes.In the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  growth in Automotive & Industrial revenue mostly came from FD-SOI wafers dedicated to automotive applications. Sales of Power-SOI wafers also recorded a significant increase.Smart devicesThe demand from the smart devices market is driven by the need for more complex sensors  higher connectivity functionalities and embedded intelligence  leading to more powerful and efficient edge artificial intelligence chips.Smart devices revenue reached 45 million Euros in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  a 28% increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22. This performance reflects higher volumes.Sales of both Imager-SOI wafers  which allow improved imager performance in 3D Imaging Applications  and Photonics-SOI wafers for data transceivers  recorded strong growth compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22.The increase in sales of FD-SOI wafers was also very strong  confirming structural demand for Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors.First half FY‚Äô23 consolidated revenue (unaudited)H1‚Äô22 H1‚Äô23 H1‚Äô23/H1‚Äô22 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 277 341 +23% +14% Automotive & Industrial 33 57 +72% +59% Smart devices 63 73 +17% +10% Total revenue 373 471 +26% +18%In the first quarter of FY‚Äô23  production at Bernin site was affected during a few days in April by a power outage  then by a strike action during another few days in June. As expected  Soitec has been able to progressively make up for the lost production (around 10 days). Combined with higher demand  growth was therefore much stronger in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  reaching 28% at constant exchange rates and perimeter.Overall  consolidated revenue reached 471 million Euros in the first half of FY‚Äô23  up 26% on a reported basis compared to 373 million Euros in the first half of FY‚Äô22. This reflects an 18% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter combined with a positive currency impact of 9%3.Confirmed FY‚Äô23 outlookSoitec continues to anticipate FY‚Äô23 revenue to grow around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter  and FY‚Äô23 EBITDA1 margin2 to reach around 36%.Key events of the quarterSTMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries to advance FD-SOI ecosystem with new 300mm manufacturing facility in FranceOn July 11th  2022  STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries announced the creation of a new  jointly-operated 300-mm semiconductor manufacturing facility adjacent to ST‚Äôs existing site in Crolles  France.

As part of our strategy to explore new adjacencies through technologies and products acquisitions  we also closed the acquisition of a 55% stake in SoftPos.eu  a fintech that converts Android devices into secure payment terminals  enabling merchants to accept card payments without the need for additional hardware. This enables Worldline to provide payment solutions that are adapted to all forms of commerce and serve the business ambitions of its clients.Thanks to this strong execution and a still solid level of transaction volumes  we confirm our 2022 annual guidance and continue to steadily establish Worldline as a premium global Paytech at the heart of the European payment system.‚ÄùQ3 2022 revenue by Global Business LineIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 828 729 +13.6% Financial Services 241 237 +1.5% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 89 86 +3.4% Worldline 1 158 1 053 +10.0%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline‚Äôs Q3 2022 revenue reached ‚Ç¨ 1 158 million  representing a strong +10.0% organic growth. This achievement was notably reached thanks to the strong commercial dynamics in Merchant Services posting a +13.6% revenue organic growth  fueled by market share gains and volumes growth. Mobility & e-Transactional Services also contributed to growth with a positive underlying trend on a high comparison basis. Financial Services was up by +1.5%  a performance in line with the trajectory anticipated for the full year.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services‚Äô revenue in Q3 2022 reached ‚Ç¨ 828 million  representing a solid organic growth of +13.6%  led by a steady growth in acquiring transaction volumes  up +17% year-on-year (+33% vs. Q3 2019). By division  the growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring showed a high-teens organic growth with almost all geographies and customer segments contributing  in particular SMBs and large retailers. The division also benefited from a strong performance from DCC products  and the solid trend experienced during the holiday period which boosted travel and hospitality verticals;Payment Acceptance also contributed to the growth of Merchant Services thanks to mid-single-digit organic growth. Growth was led by Global Sales & Vertical and digital customers with the recovery from the Travel vertical compensating for the stop of Russian activities in March. Excluding the Russian effect  Payment Acceptance activities would have been up low teens organically in Q3 2022; and Digital Services delivered a low-teens organic growth with contrasted situation per geography. The dynamic was particularly strong in Germany  France and the UK  more than offsetting the low performance in the digital healthcare market.During the third quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services has been strong with numerous wins for both Commercial Acquiring and Payment Acceptance  in-store and online with new client wins and upsells with clients such  as among others  Lufthansa  MSC Cruises  FIVE  Webhallen.com  or Eurowag.In Q3  Worldline continued to engage in promising signed partnerships such as:The payment app certification by Zebra of Worldline Tap-on-Mobile allowing specialized integrators and partners to add payment on their Android devices;The single API integration of UpStream Pay dedicated to e-commerce merchants allowing connection to a vast and full suite of payment methods boosting conversion rate; andWith BigCommerce  a global SaaS based shopping cart solution that will natively integrate Worldline‚Äô online solutions to its platform. This partnership will allow all BigCommerce merchants  from start-ups to enterprise sized merchants  to have access to Worldline‚Äôs pan-European acceptance and acquiring solutions.Financial ServicesQ3 2022 was still impacted by the price decrease on the large contracts with former Equens‚Äô shareholders. In this context  Financial Services performance was in line with the trajectory expected for the full year with good volumes and new commercial developments leading to a +1.5% organic growth in Q3 2022 with ‚Ç¨ 241 million revenue. The performance of each division continued to be contrasted:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing altogether) posted a positive organic growth driven by good dynamics in Asia-Pacific as well as improved transaction volumes  mainly in Belgium and Finland  compensating for the impact of price concessions of renewed large contracts;Account Payments delivered a soft organic growth with less project activity this quarter  but still good developments on the UniCredit contract  now in run phase;Digital Banking was led by the continuing increase of authentications volumes related to e-commerce transactions due to enforcement of the PSD2 regulation  as well as authentication services  mainly in France.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached ‚Ç¨ 89 million in Q3 2022  up +3.4% organically  with positive underlying growth on a high comparison basis  led by high project activity with existing and new customers and increasing transactional revenue. The performance by division was as follow:Trusted Digitization: Double-digit growth driven by new projects signed  increased volumes on Tax collection and Digital Healthcare and a good momentum on support and project activity on eHealth solutions.e-Ticketing: Double-digit growth fueled by increased volumes in transportation and higher fare collection in Latin America  coupled with several development projects.e-Consumer & Mobility: the ramp-up of newly signed contracts and increased activities for the new secure cloud solution partially offset the effect of the high comparison basis in Connected Living & Mobility and the re-insourcing of a Contact contract with a telco operator. The momentum of the WL Contact solution observed during the last periods remains strong  as illustrated by the win of the CNAF (Caisse Nationale des Allocations Familiales) public RFP to supply a call center solution. Worldline will set up and roll out the Contact solution for the management of incoming and outgoing calls of the French welfare national organization for a period of 8 years. The service will improve call processing through a strong and scalable infrastructure and provide user-friendly interfaces.Successful completion of the sale of TSS activities to Apollo FundsAs announced on October 3  2022  Worldline completed the sale and contribution of c. 85% of its Terminals  Solutions & Services (‚ÄúTSS‚Äù) business line to Apollo Funds with the sale of the remaining c. 15% to take place on January 1st  2023  in line with the contemplated timeline. The standalone company now operates exclusively as Ingenico. While this transaction is expected to support Ingenico in its transformation plan  it also marked an important milestone in Worldline‚Äôs strategy  simplifying the Group‚Äôs structure and further increasing its focus on core payment services. The proceeds from this disposal allows Worldline to further accelerate its development and anchors the Group‚Äôs leadership in payments services. This transaction also encompasses the entry into a partnership agreement cementing the strategic and long-term relationship between Worldline and Ingenico over the next 5 years.The total consideration for Worldline is based on a current fair enterprise value of c. ‚Ç¨ 2.3 billion under the terms of the transaction  including c. ‚Ç¨ 1.7 billion upfront value and up to ‚Ç¨ 0.9 billion in preferred shares. Net of the closing price adjustments and net of taxes  Worldline will receive in aggregate c. ‚Ç¨ 1.4 billion3 as net proceeds and will remain exposed to the future value creation of Ingenico through the preferred shares for an amount of up to ‚Ç¨ 0.9 billion (c. ‚Ç¨ 0.6 billion fair value at signing date).Enrichment of Worldline value proposition in both instore and onlineIn Q3 2022  Worldline significantly enriched its value proposition for both instore and online merchants  notably through the acquisition of a 40% stake in Online Payment Platform B.V. and 55% of SoftPos.eu.Online Payment Platform (OPP) is a Dutch online PSP focusing on digital payments for marketplaces and platforms with a specific focus in the C2C segment. OPP already serves over a hundred marketplaces and platforms  such as e-Bay Kleinanzeigen  Marktplaats (both part of Adevinta)  Gumtree  Royal FloraHolland and PayPal  leveraging a strong expertise in customer support for marketplaces  including fast merchant onboarding and dispute management.The transaction is perfectly in line with Worldline‚Äôs strategic roadmap as it expands its exposure into e-commerce and brings a proven technological brick with a unique solution built from the ground up. This enables Worldline to comprehensively target the C2C marketplaces‚Äô needs to outsource their payment requirements and to focus on significant growth opportunities in the B2B and B2C marketplaces segments with a market leading scalable technology.As part of its strategy to explore new adjacencies through technologies and products acquisitions  Worldline also closed the acquisition of a 55% stake in SoftPos.eu  a Warsaw-based fintech that converts Android devices into secure payment terminals  enabling merchants to accept card payments without the need for additional hardware. Worldline also acquired a call option to buy in 24 months the remaining 45% owned by the two founders and key stakeholders of the company.This acquisition fully embeds Worldline‚Äôs objective to provide payment solutions that are adapted to all forms of commerce and serve the business ambitions of its clients. Based on SoftPos.eu  Worldline launched a new product internationally: Worldline Tap on Mobile. This unique end-to-end solution based on Android application that allows all merchants ‚Äì from micro to large ‚Äì to accept payments using a smartphone  tablet  or enterprise device through one single tap. The solution is designed to accept small amounts simply by ‚Äútap‚Äù but also larger amounts with PIN entry on the screen.2022 objectives confirmedRevenue organic growth : +8% to +10%: +8% to +10% OMDA margin : +100 to +150 basis points improvement vs. estimated 2021 proforma OMDA margin: +100 to +150 basis points improvement vs. estimated 2021 proforma OMDA margin Free cash flow: circa 45% OMDA conversion rateAppendices9M 2022 revenue performance per Global Business LineWorldline‚Äôs organic revenue evolution per Global Business Line for the first nine months of 2022 was as follows:In ‚Ç¨ million 9M 2022 9M 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 2 206 1 910 +15.6% Financial Services 698 682 +2.3% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 274 255 +7.3% Worldline 3 178 2 847 +11.6%* at constant scope and exchange ratesReconciliation of Q3 2021 statutory revenue with Q3 2021 revenue at constant scope and exchange ratesFor the analysis of the Group‚Äôs performance  revenue for Q3 2022 is compared to Q3 2021 revenue at constant scope and exchange rates as presented below per Global Business Lines:In ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2021 Scope effect** Exchange rates effect Q3 2021* Merchant Services 639 +80.4 +10.4 729 Financial Services 234 +2.8 237 Mobility & e-Transactional Services 88 -1.1 86 Worldline 960 +80.4 +12.1 1 053* at constant scope and September 2022 YTD average exchange rates** at December 2021 YTD average exchange ratesExchanges rates effect in Q3 is mainly due to the Euro depreciation vs the Swiss franc.

An IoT market disrupted by heightened environmental requirements and the arrival of new technological and economic trends Kerlink Group has decided to implement an ambitious strategic plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in a market undergoing profound changes with heightened requirements around: Energy efficiency   requiring enhanced monitoring and management of raw materials and energy production and consumption.  requiring enhanced monitoring and management of raw materials and energy production and consumption. Reduction of greenhouse gases  requiring energy performance monitoring and stricter controls on the use of resources to reduce human activities environmental footprint.requiring energy performance monitoring and stricter controls on the use of resources to reduce human activities environmental footprint. Combating the effects of global warming  requiring increased efforts around the monitoring and protection of natural resources (water  soil  plant cover  wildlife  etc.).requiring increased efforts around the monitoring and protection of natural resources (water  soil  plant cover  wildlife  etc.). Increased regulatory constraints and fiscal pressure in a more difficult and volatile economic and geopolitical environment. www.kerlink.com kerlink @kerlink_news Kerlink Alongside developments to meet these requirements  new technological solutions are emerging  and different business models are helping to reshape the IoT landscape and speed up its transformation  with new opportunities that the Group is now in a position to reach. Among these myriad opportunities  the Group is particularly focused on: The advent and anticipated growth of Blockchain   which has led to the monetisation of data concurrent with their ""notarization"" (verification of evidence of electronic exchange and archiving in order to make data authentic and auditable). The progress of Edge Computing (optimisation method that involves processing data on the periphery of the network  as close as possible to the data source) to limit the impact of data transmission and storage and thus reduce the carbon footprint of cloud computing. Greater segmentation of IoT protocols with the increased adoption of LoRaWAN ¬Æ   a protocol around which the Group has developed specific expertise since 2013  giving it a leading edge on the market. The emergence of this unique type of "" unlicensed LPWAN "" technology should support the expansion of the IoT market by stimulating the use and interoperability of the different networks. Confirmation of the ramp-up of private networks (businesses  industries  cities  local authorities  etc.) with specific requirements  a market on which Kerlink achieved a successful strategic pivot in 2019. Kerlink is now ideally positioned to take full advantage of these changes. The Group will be able to draw on its technological expertise and partnerships  and its extensive market reach  with locations around the world. In this context  the launch of the ""Serve IoT 2025"" plan should enable the Group to begin a development cycle that will help it to double its revenue. Serve IoT 2025 Under this plan  the Group will focus from an R&D and commercial perspective on three priority verticals: Smart Cities & Quality of Life   combining multiple market segments such as smart energy meters  smart building management  public lighting management systems  waste management  parking space administration  air quality measurement and pollution prevention  remote infrastructure supervision and management  and more.Set to account for more than 70% of the world's population in the near future (1)   cities are already facing new challenges. With more than 55% of greenhouse gas emissions (2) and increasing pressure on water resources  the issue of the fitness for habitation of megacities implies an increasing availability of services offered by municipalities.Considering this  safety applications  as well as those aimed at optimising waste and domestic refuse treatment and the monitoring of pollution and sanitation  will become increasingly important in the investments of the local authorities and the private sector concerned. Kerlink already has a portfolio of proven solutions to address these issues.

With nearly 10 billion inhabitants by 2050 (4)   pressure on agricultural resources is expected to intensify  favouring the deployment of targeted solutions. To seize the growth opportunities of these different markets  the ""Serve IoT 2025"" plan is built around three strategic pillars: Free the Internet of Things by adopting technologies and best practices to densify cellular networks through Edge Networking. The aim of this strategic focus is to position Kerlink's new generation of equipment as an active component of the IoT infrastructure covering the final kilometres and  thus  granting the flexible connectivity needs for targeted applications. This evolution in the network architecture model will also add further value to this equipment (with embedded data processing capacity) that should lead to in an increase in recurring revenues generated by these services.by adopting technologies and best practices to densify cellular networks through Edge Networking.

Strengthen the Group's activity with ""private network"" customers by offering ready-to-use solutions and user-friendly deployment and supervision operations. This will reduce decision-making cycles and increase the number of projects. Ambition for 2025: Increase revenue to double the 2021 level and obtain EBITDA of 15% The implementation of the plan will help Kerlink to consolidate its position as a leading global IoT player. Its forward integration in the value chain as part of this new strategy should also support future growth  increase the contribution of recurring revenues and bolster profitability. By 2025  the Group aims to make more than ‚Ç¨40m in revenue  or average annual growth of nearly 19%. Entirely through organic means  this growth should come jointly with a strong increase in operating profitability  to give an EBITDA target of 15% of revenue by 2025. These ambitions do not incorporate the revenue potential associated with crypto-based solutions  given the reduced visibility currently on the growth prospects of this market. As it embarks on this new growth cycle  Kerlink has a well-managed financial position  which was recently strengthened by new four-year bank loans signed with five partner banks for a total amount of ‚Ç¨6m.

The investments and innovation that the Group aims to achieve are based on organic and profitable growth  driven notably by the development of our distribution network. Revenue in the year to end-September up 20% In the year to end-September  sales came to ‚Ç¨13m versus ‚Ç¨10.8m  up 20% on the same period in 2021. This incorporates the third quarter revenue contribution of ‚Ç¨2.9m versus ‚Ç¨3.2m in the third quarter of 2021. This quarterly change is mainly due to the decline in orders in the Americas  in connection with the collapse of the crypto market. As a reminder  the third quarter of 2021 had seen strong sales of equipment intended for the deployment of the Helium network. The fourth quarter is expected to show a high level of activity  enabling the Group to achieve its full-year revenue target of more than ‚Ç¨20m  up from its 2021 level.

The GRI increase is primarily due to the absence of COVID-19 rent relief  indexation  strong leasing activity as well as higher Sales Based Rents  Commercial Partnerships and parking income. The growth was also supported by a positive FX contribution from the strength of the US Dollar and asset deliveries  partly offset by disposals.Increased GRI was recorded in all regions except Nordics. Spain benefitted from dynamic leasing activity and a termination indemnity  while performance in Austria and Poland  beyond operating performance  reflected the fact that rents and service charges were not legally due during lockdown periods in 2021. The Netherlands benefitted from the delivery of Westfield Mall of the Netherlands in March 2021  while the GRI for the Nordics was down slightly reflecting the planned disposal of Solna Centrum in February 2022 as well as negative FX impact. In the US  the performance was positive  even when offset by US foreclosures and disposals carried out as part of wider deleveraging effort  mainly thanks to a positive FX impact  dynamic leasing activity and vacancy reduction.GRI for the Offices & Others division improved by +7.2% in 9M-2022 compared to 9M-2021  driven by the leasing of Trinity  which is 74% let as of the end of Q3-2022  the deliveries of the Pullman Montparnasse hotel  offices and parking at Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√©  while also taking into consideration the impact of the disposals carried out as part of the Group‚Äôs European disposal programme.Convention & Exhibition GRI increased from ‚Ç¨53.8 Mn in 9M-2021 to ‚Ç¨128.4 Mn in 9M-2022.

This is in line with the Group‚Äôs strategy presented at its Investor Day in March to grow revenues from media advertising  brand experience and data partnerships  turning significant footfall across its European assets into a qualified audience  while also leveraging the Westfield brand‚Äôs significant value to retailers.URW expects to generate ‚Ç¨75 Mn in annual net revenues11 in Europe by 2024 for the Media  Brand & Data Partnerships activity  a +‚Ç¨45 Mn increase compared to 2021  with strong growth potential beyond the plan horizon.As announced in May  URW rolled out the Westfield brand to three new Flagship centres in Europe  including Westfield Parquesur in Madrid  Westfield T√§by Centrum in Stockholm  and Westfield Mokot√≥w in Warsaw.5. New OpeningsLes Ateliers Ga√Æt√© is a sustainable mixed-use redevelopment that integrates residential  offices and a hotel alongside new community-oriented retail and amenities that meet the needs of local residents and workers  as well as a wide range of restaurant and entertainment options ‚Äì including the first Food Society food hall in Paris with 15 kiosks and 3 bars. The development also incorporates 62 social housing units which will be owned by the City of Paris and triples the area dedicated to public services  including a new municipal library and a childcare centre.After the successful delivery of the refurbishment of the 52 000 sqm Pullman Montparnasse hotel  operated by Accor  in H2-2021  and a 13 000 sqm office project in H1-2022  fully let to Accor Group‚Äôs co-working operator Wojo  the Group inaugurated the final part of Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© project  a three-floor 28 800 sqm shopping and lifestyle destination  over 90% let.6. DisposalsIn July 2022  URW completed the disposal of Gera Arcaden  closed the sale of Almere Centrum  Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc and URW‚Äôs partner in Aupark exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake. On September 30  2022  URW completed the sale of Villeneuve 2.With these transactions  URW has completed ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn of its ‚Ç¨4.0 Bn European disposals programme. The Group remains in active discussions with potential buyers on mature office and retail assets that are not core to its strategy. Given current market conditions  the Group now expects to complete the European disposals programme in 2023.In the US  URW announced the sale of Westfield Santa Anita  a regional shopping centre  in August for $537.5 Mn (at 100%  URW share 49%).The Group is in active discussions in relation to its regional assets and continues to work actively on its Flagship assets. Turnover  leasing and vacancy metrics reinforce the desirability and intrinsic value of these assets.URW is committed to completing its deleveraging programme through the radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US. The performance of the Group‚Äôs assets  as well as its strong liquidity position  will allow URW to pursue this plan in an organised and timely manner.7. Financial resourcesAs at September 30  2022  the Group‚Äôs net financial debt12 decreased to ‚Ç¨23.3 Bn (from ‚Ç¨24.1 Bn as at June 30  2022) and the cash on hand13 increased to ‚Ç¨3.0 Bn (from ‚Ç¨2.4 Bn as at June 30  2022)  supported by the disposals achieved in Q3-2022.Since end of September  the Group has signed ‚Ç¨550 Mn of sustainability-linked term loans with a 5-year maturity (including the refinancing of ‚Ç¨150 Mn debt maturing in January 2023).This additional liquidity will further strengthen the Group‚Äôs cash position to ‚Ç¨3.4 Bn13. This compares with ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn of debt maturing by December 2024 and ‚Ç¨4.5 Bn including the hybrid with a 2023 call date.In addition  as at September 30  2022  the Group‚Äôs credit lines fully undrawn position amounted to ‚Ç¨10.0 Bn including ‚Ç¨3.7 Bn maturing over the next twelve months. URW is considering opportunities to extend or renew part of these lines.Taking into account this liquidity and undrawn credit facilities and thanks to its long-dated debt maturity  the Group has secured more than 36 months of financing needs14 (assuming the reinstatement of a dividend for fiscal year 2023 and the reimbursement of the 2023 hybrid).Thanks to improved operational performance and debt reduction  the Net debt/EBITDA ratio15/16 improved from 11.0x on June 30  2022 to 10.4x on September 30  2022. The ICR16 remained stable between H1-2022 and 9M-2022 at 4.5x.Furthermore  the Group‚Äôs debt is fully hedged for the coming years  with hedging instruments and fixed debt of more than ‚Ç¨20.0 Bn over 2022-2025 and of over ‚Ç¨15 Bn in 2026.8. ESGThe sustainability leadership of URW has been recognised externally by its long-term presence in the top quartile of all ESG ratings. URW ranks 1st in the entire Real Estate sector17 according to Sustainalytics. In Q3-2022  URW renewed its AAA from MSCI ESG rating  consistently since 2014  and received for the 11th time a ‚Äò5 Star‚Äô rating in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)  which recognises entities placed in the top 20%.The company has already achieved a -27% reduction of its total carbon footprint since 201518  and is on track to achieve its target of a -50% reduction by 2030 by implementing a range of initiatives such as the supply of its assets with renewable electricity for common use. With a 15% reduction of its energy intensity globally since 2015  URW is also on track to reach its target of permanently reducing its total energy intensity by -30%. In the context of the current energy crisis  URW has announced it will improve its energy efficiency in Europe by an additional -15%. This includes a -20% reduction for France  beyond requirements  and further increased its energy-saving approach across all of its shopping centres to support wider government and private sector efforts to address the European energy crisis.19The recent delivery of Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© represents a living example of URW‚Äôs sustainability ambition  demonstrating strong performance with a 40% reduction in energy used for heating. This will result in 880 tonnes of avoided CO 2 emissions each year.9. OutlookBased on the performance of the first nine months of 2022  including a strong Q3 that confirms the positive trend seen in H1  the Group is upgrading its 2022 AREPS guidance from at least ‚Ç¨8.90 to at least ‚Ç¨9.10 per share.The Group assumes no major COVID-19 or energy-related restrictions  or any major disruption to the macro-economic environment.10.

Today  Lectra‚Äôs Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022  which have not been reviewed by the Statutory Auditors.To facilitate the analysis of the Group‚Äôs results  the financial statements are compared to those published in 2021 and to the 2021 pro forma financial statement (""2021 Pro forma"")  prepared by integrating the three acquisitions made in 2021 ‚Äì Gerber Technology (‚ÄúGerber‚Äù)  Neteven  and Gemini CAD Systems (‚ÄúGemini‚Äù) ‚Äì as if they had been consolidated from January 1  2021  whereas they have been consolidated since June 1  July 28 and September 27  2021 respectively.GREAT RESILIENCY IN A DEGRADED ENVIRONMENTThe first nine months of the year were significantly marked by the war in Ukraine and its consequences. As soon as the conflict began  the Company decided to cease its operations in Russia  by suspending the activity of its subsidiary Lectra Russia and stopping all deliveries of products or services. The Group's direct exposure to Ukraine and Russia is low; the contribution of these two countries in 2021 accounted for less than 1 percent of revenues.This war has accelerated price increases  energy shortfalls and shortages in some raw materials. However  their impact on the Group's financial statements was limited due to its low exposure to energy costs and a limited dependency on those raw materials affected the most.The Group also adjusted sale prices to compensate for the increase in its production costs in January and in July.In addition  the lockdown periods in China had a negative impact on the amount of orders and revenues in this country.The climate of uncertainty since the year began has been intensified more recently by growing fears of recession in many countries.These situations have led some of the Group‚Äôs customers to reduce their investment budgets to cope with cost increases  shortages  or potential reductions in activity  while others are postponing purchasing decisions until their business environment and visibility improve.Finally  since the beginning of 2022  the dollar has significantly strengthened against the euro. With an average exchange rate of $1.06/‚Ç¨1 in the first nine months of 2022  the dollar was up 12% compared to the first nine months of 2021. This change and other currency changes mechanically increased revenues by roughly 7%.In this environment  the Group has once again demonstrated its resiliency  with strong earnings growth.Q3 2022In a particularly difficult macroeconomic environment  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (46.6 million euros) decreased by 2% compared to the Q3 2021 Pro forma. The annual value of new software subscription orders amounted to 2.0 million euros  up 1%.Q3 revenues (141.2 million euros) increased by 22% (+22% compared to the 2021 Pro forma as well). In Q3  the Group fully caught up with any delays in deliveries of equipment and accompanying software caused by the long lockdown in China during Q2.EBITDA before non-recurring items (29.7 million euros) increased by 47% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 21.0% (+3.5 percentage points). Compared to the 2021 Pro forma  EBITDA increased by 49% and the EBITDA margin by 3.8 percentage points.Net income (15.2 million euros) was multiplied by 1.9 compared to Q3 2021.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 16.9 million euros (19.3 million euros in Q3 2021  which included the 4.5-million-euro outstanding balance of the research tax credit for 2017).FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2022The first nine months revenues (392.1 million euros) were up 50%.EBITDA before non-recurring items (74.9 million euros) increased by 73% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 19.1%.Income from operations before non-recurring items (52.8 million euros) was up 78%. This includes an 8.7-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of Gerber  Neteven and Gemini  and of the activity of Glengo Teknoloji.Net income (35.4 million euros) was multiplied by 2.1.Free cash flow before non-recurring items was 31.6 million euros  down slightly compared to the first nine months of 2021 and lower than the net income of the same period due to a temporary increase in working capital requirement.Comparison to the 2021 Pro formaThe first nine months orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (153.7 million euros) were up 5% compared to the amount of 2021 Pro forma orders. The annual value of new software subscription orders (6.2 million euros) increased by 21%.Despite the negative impact of the war in Ukraine and the lockdown measures in China  revenues (392.1 million euros) increased by 14% compared to the 2021 Pro forma. Revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (160.0 million euros) increased by 16%  those from recurring contracts (123.9 million euros) by 13% and those from consumables and parts (108.2 million euros) by 14%.EBITDA before non-recurring items increased by 46% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items by 4.1 percentage points.Balance sheet at September 30  2022At September 30  2022  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders‚Äô equity of 475.2 million euros (400.8 million euros at December 31  2021) and a positive net cash position of 3.8 million euros.The working capital requirement at September 30  2022 was a negative 13.4 million euros.ASSESSMENT OF THE 2020-2022 STRATEGIC ROADMAPThe Lectra 4.0 strategy was launched in 2017 with the aim of positioning the Group as a key Industry 4.0 player in its markets before 2030. It has been implemented to date through two consecutive strategic roadmaps. The second roadmap  for 2020-2022  was designed to enable Lectra to capture the full potential of its new offers for Industry 4.0  while delivering sustainable  profitable business growth.The 2020-2022 strategic roadmap has been conducted with success despite the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Thanks to the acquisition made during this period  Lectra‚Äôs corporate profile has changed compared to 2019  with a stronger than ever financial structure  an extended global reach  an enlarged customer base  a reinforced product portfolio incorporating more and more 4.0 technologies and a revamped brand image. These major advances give Lectra a new dimension with increased opportunities for continued growth.For the detailed assessment of the strategic roadmap refer to the financial report at September 30  2022  published on October 25  2022.BUSINESS TRENDS IN 2022In its 2021 Financial Report  published February 9  2022  the Group indicated that the acquisitions made in 2021  and particularly the acquisition of Gerber  give the Group a new dimension and open new perspectives.It further explained that uncertainties persist regarding the evolution of the pandemic and its impacts on the macroeconomic environment and could continue to weigh on investment decisions by the Group‚Äôs customers. To those uncertainties have been added the consequences of the war in Ukraine and of the strict lockdown measures implemented in China in H1.At the beginning of 2022  the Group set itself objectives of achieving  in the current fiscal year  revenues in the range of 508 to 556 million euros (+31% to +43%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 92 to 104 million euros (+41% to +60%). These objectives had been prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on December 31  2021  and particularly $1.13 to the euro.On July 28  2022  Lectra finetuned its objectives for 2022: revenues in the range of 514 to 534 million euros (+33% to +38%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 95 to 102 million euros (+46% to +57%)  established on the basis of the actual exchange rates in H1  and the rates on June 30  2022  particularly $1.04/‚Ç¨1  for H2 2022.The third quarter results enable Lectra to confirm the revised targets announced on July 28.The 2021 Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for the first nine months of 2022 are available on lectra.com.

Jackson Women's Health Organization  overturning the right to an abortion at the federal level  and in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency  a ruling that breathed new life into the Major Questions Doctrine  a principle that significantly limits a federal agency's ability to make regulations. In its current term  the high Court will again consider paring down the EPA's authority in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency  a case where the agency's authority to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act is being challenged.In a new Strategic Perspective piece entitled ""Supreme Court impacts ESG issues and is poised to do so again""  Wolters Kluwer Senior Legal Analyst Cathleen Calhoun surveys how the high Court's recent pivotal decisions have impacted the discussion around ESG issues  and explores how its ruling in another high profile case now being considered might further affect the ESG landscape.Who: Cathleen Calhoun  J.D.

Over the first 9 months  the Group recorded a strong performance with ‚Ç¨874m of sales  +17% on an organic basis and +20.5% on a reported basisEurope and North America continue to benefit from a very good momentum in Q3. APAC is still affected by Covid restrictions in Mainland China but the Q3 trend is of gradual improvementSolid Q3 performance across all brandsStrong performance benefiting from like-for-like point of sales (+19% in 9 months) and dynamic digital sales (21% of total sales)The dynamic of the four brands and the success of the collections enable SMCP to successfully continue the average discount rate reduction strategy  with a reduction of 5 points in 9 months (of which 2.5pp in Q3)Full-year financial guidance confirmedCommenting on these results  Isabelle Guichot  CEO of SMCP  stated: ‚ÄúThe group registered record sales in Q3 based on the solid growth of all brands. This performance reflects a strong momentum in Europe  notably thanks to the success of collections with local clients and the return of tourists  as well as in the United States where demand remains significant  in line with preceding quarters. In Mainland China  our sales remained impacted by the fall in shop traffic due to Covid-related restrictions. We nevertheless observed an improvement in our performance this quarter. We have equally pursued our full price strategy with success by substantially lowering the discount rate. We registered more and more qualitative digital sales in a context of a normalization of the share of digital sales. Finally  we have accelerated the implementation of our CSR strategy. In view of our performance in the first nine months of the year  and provided that the international situation does not deteriorate further in the final quarter  we confirm our full-year guidance.‚Äù‚Ç¨m except %Unaudited figures Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Organicchange Reportedchange 9M 2021 9M 2022 Organicchange Reported change Sales by region France 88.4 99 1 +13 5% +11 9% 230.3 293 8 +30 2% +27 5% EMEA 81.3 98 6 +20 4% +21 4% 195.3 272 0 +37 9% +39 3% Americas 37.8 49 0 +12 5% +29 9% 96.9 132 1 +22 1% +36 4% APAC 64.2 61 6 -11 8% -4 1% 202.6 175 8 -20 1% -13 2% Sales by Brand Sandro 131 5 150.2 +9 5% +14 2% 343.5 416 9 +17 0% +21 4% Maje 106 5 119.9 +8 0% +12 6% 289.4 343 8 +14 7% +18 8% Other brands1 33 8 38.3 +13 9% +13 5% 92.1 113 0 +23 8% +22 8% TOTAL 271 7 308.4 +9 4% +13 5% 725.0 873 8 +17 0% +20 5%SALES BY REGIONIn France  9-month sales reached ‚Ç¨294m  +30% on an organic basis vs 2021 supported by like-for-like points of sales.The third quarter saw a double-digit growth with a basis of comparison higher than in H1.The solid performance is based on the success of the four brands‚Äô collections and on good tourism flows during the summer (coming from Americas  Middle East  Europe  and some APAC nationalities). The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -8pp vs. 2021 YTD.In EMEA (Europe excluding France and Middle East)  SMCP delivered an excellent performance with 9-month sales of ‚Ç¨272m  +38% on an organic basis vs 2021 of which +51% like-for-like  coming from brick-and-mortar and digital retail (own websites and e-partners). Third quarter sales were up +20% on an organic basis benefiting  as in France  from success with both local customers and tourists in most European countries. The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -5pp vs. 2021 YTD.In APAC  9-month sales (‚Ç¨176m) were down -13% on a reported basis and -20% on an organic basis vs 2021. Performance continued to be impacted by Covid resurgences in Mainland China with sporadic store closures and reduced footfall. However  the APAC trend is of gradual improvement and the gap vs 2021 reduced significantly in Q3 compared to H1 (-12% organic vs Q3 2021). APAC excluding China delivered a good progression vs 2021 in Q3  supported by the strong performances of Korea  Singapore  Malaysia and Australia.In North America  despite a high comparison basis  SMCP delivered a strong performance with 9-month sales of ‚Ç¨132m  +36% on a reported basis and +22% on an organic basis vs 2021 (LFL progressing double-digits: +23% in a nearly stable network). The third quarter trend (+30% on a reported basis and +12% on an organic basis vs 2021) is close to the Q2 trend  sustained by both B&M and Digital. All markets (USA  Canada and Mexico) recorded an excellent momentum. The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -8pp vs. 2021 YTD.Q3 HIGHLIGHTSDuring the third quarter  SMCP intensified its CSR commitments. For example  the number of traceable references in the Fall-Winter collection now exceeds 100 per brand. Initiatives in favor of the circular economy are increasing  including in particular the gradual deployment of second-hand products  which will be extended to other countries in the coming months.The Group has made several targeted openings in its key markets  and the third quarter saw the opening of a major flagship store for Sandro on the mythical Champs-Elys√©es Avenue. More generally  SMCP is pursuing its strategy of qualitative and selective network development: opening and renovation of Fursac stores in Europe  new physical and digital points of sale in Asia for Sandro  Maje and Claudie Pierlot  and strengthening of strategic retail partners networks (e.g. in the Middle East).Finally  each brand continued to develop the desirability of its collections and communications: the Believe campaign for Sandro and Taylor Hill for Maje  the reaffirmation of the Parisian style for Claudie Pierlot through iconic pieces in the Fall-Winter collection and communication campaign  and artistic and know-how-based collaborations for Fursac.CONCLUSIONThanks to the desirability of its brands and the attractiveness of its collections  Group sales benefited from a strong momentum across all geographies except Mainland China  due to Covid-related restrictions.All brands of the portfolio contributed to the growth  enabling SMCP to book a record level of sales  despite an unprecedented level of macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainty.PERSPECTIVESIn the fourth quarter 2022  the Group will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of the economic  geopolitical  health and social context.Based on the strong performance on a 9-month basis and provided the international situation does not deteriorate further during the rest of the year  SMCP confirms its 2022 full-year financial guidance.A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.APPENDICESBreakdown of DOSNumber of DOS Q3-21 2021 H1-22 Q3-22 Var Q3 22vs. H1 22 Var Q3 22 vs. FY 21 Var Q3 22 vs. Q3 21 By region France 474 472 462 455 -7 -17 -19 EMEA 404 402 394 392 -2 -10 -12 Americas 168 166 167 167 - +1 -1 APAC 250 252 251 258 +7 +6 +8 By brand Sandro 552 552 546 547 +1 -5 -5 Maje 456 455 453 453 - -2 -3 Claudie Pierlot 211 211 206 203 -3 -8 -8 Suite 341 11 10 2 2 - -8 -9 Fursac 66 64 67 67 - +3 +1 Total DOS 1 296 1 292 1 274 1 272 -2 -20 -24Breakdown of POSNumber of POS Q3-21 2021 H1-22 Q3-22 Var Q3 22vs. H1 22 Var Q3 22 vs. FY 21 Var Q3 22 vs. Q3 21 By region France 475 473 463 456 -7 -17 -19 EMEA 551 548 542 544 +2 -4 +7 Americas 197 195 195 198 +3 +3 +1 APAC 461 468 470 472 +2 +4 +11 By brand Sandro 743 745 742 745 +3 - +2 Maje 618 620 620 620 - - +2 Claudie Pierlot 246 245 239 236 -3 -9 -10 Suite 341 11 10 2 2 - -8 -9 Fursac 66 64 67 67 - +3 +1 Total POS 1 684 1 684 1 670 1 670 - -14 -14 o/w Partners POS 388 392 396 398 +2 +6 +10FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSNumber of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group‚Äôs points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year.

Based on this robust performance  we confirm our full-year objectives  with revenue growth now expected in the upper half of the previously indicated range. In the meantime  we achieved important milestones in Q3 towards the envisioned separation. We finalized a ‚Ç¨2.7 billion financing providing the means to execute our transformation until separation while ensuring the Group‚Äôs liquidity. We launched the works councils consultation process and made tangible progress in carve-out preparation workstreams. The separation project is well on track to be completed in H2 2023 as initially planned. Atos is resolutely pursuing its in-depth transformation: the whole organization is mobilized and committed to the successful execution of our strategic plan  which we are convinced will create significant value for all Atos‚Äô stakeholders.‚ÄùIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change Change at constant currency Evidian Perimeter revenue 1 278 1 191 +7.3% +2.1% Tech Foundations perimeter revenue 1 540 1 475 +4.4% +0.3% Group revenue 2 818 2 666 +5.7% +1.1%Revenue growth at constant currency turning positive in Q3Group revenue was ‚Ç¨2 818 million in Q3 2022  up +5.7% year-on-year. Growth at constant currency turned positive in Q3  at +1.1%  while organic growth stabilized  at -0.1%  showing a strong sequential improvement compared to previous quarters (-1.9% in Q2 and -2.4% in Q1). This positive momentum reflects the continued improvement in operational performance brought by the Group‚Äôs new organization and management team. Acquisitions contributed +1.2% to the Group‚Äôs revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed +4.6%  mainly reflecting the appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro over the period.Evidian‚Äôs revenue was up +2.1% at constant currency in Q3. Digital recorded a solid growth  driven by buoyant trends on digital transformation markets  as well as by the contribution from recent acquisitions. Q3 activity was supported by a good level of fertilization of existing customers. Cybersecurity continued to benefit from market leadership and strong customer demand. Revenue growth was affected by Advanced Computing  with a low level of HPC revenue  expected to ramp up from Q4 onwards based on the very high order entry recorded in Q2.Tech Foundations‚Äô revenue stabilized in Q3  at +0.3% at constant currency (+0.5% excluding UCC). This positive top line momentum is a clear sign of an earlier-than-anticipated improvement of the business line‚Äôs performance  resulting from renewed management focus under the Group‚Äôs new organization and strategic project. The core infrastructure business reported a much more contained decline than in 2021  while professional services grew strongly. Digital workplace services and UCC recorded a slight contraction due to persisting supply chain tensions.Significant progress achieved in separation projectThe Group is making significant progress in its separation project and confirms that it is well on track to complete it within the previously announced 12 to 18 months timeline1.The Group successfully signed a new ‚Ç¨2.7 billion bank debt financing on July 29  2022  ensuring the interim period leading to the envisioned separation is fully financed. The syndication of this new debt package was finalized in a short timeframe and received very strong support from the Group's historical lenders. This unsecured debt package includes a ‚Ç¨1.5 billion term loan with very satisfactory tenure and pricing conditions  a ‚Ç¨0.9bn revolving credit facility supporting the Group‚Äôs liquidity  and a ‚Ç¨0.3 billion bridge loan to be repaid out of the expected proceeds from the Group‚Äôs non-core businesses disposal program. Financial covenant was reset to 3.75x net debt to OMDA2  tested at year-end.On September 7  2022  the information and consultation process of Atos European works council (SEC)  regarding the Group‚Äôs envisioned separation into two listed entities  was launched in line with the project timetable. In parallel  social dialogue has also started at country level.All separation workstreams are mobilized and progressing according to plan  across four pillars: (i) go-to-market and commercial continuity  (ii) carve-out operations covering tax and legal structuring  strategic agreements and preparation of carve-out financial statements  as well as Day-1 operational readiness  (iii) operating model and support functions set-up and (iv) program coordination.Atos is convinced that this project is the most value-creating for all its stakeholders. Evidian will emerge as a global digital pure player fully focused on growing markets and combining a unique set of highly synergistic areas of expertise. Tech Foundations‚Äô turnaround is already underway and showing encouraging signs of earlier-than-anticipated recovery. Once turned-around  Tech Foundations will take a fresh start as an end-to-end orchestrator of digital infrastructure  leveraging its core operations to deliver solid margins and cash generation.Moving ahead with disposal programOn June 14  2022  Atos announced a disposal program of non-core businesses representing ‚Ç¨700 million of expected proceeds  as part of the financing of its transformation plan. On the same day  the Group completed the sale of its remaining 2.5% stake in Worldline  for net proceeds of c. ‚Ç¨220 million. The remaining ‚Ç¨480 million expected proceeds pertain to the disposal of non-core businesses mostly within the Evidian perimeter.This disposal program is progressing as planned  with several disposal processes currently ongoing  including 2 small-sized transactions already signed  indicating market interest for the businesses selected by Atos as part of its disposal program  as well as the Group‚Äôs ability to execute swiftly  only four months after the disposal program was set up.CSR: outstanding external recognitionIn September 2022  for the third year in a row  Atos was awarded the EcoVadis Platinum Award for its Corporate Social Responsibility performance  with the highest score ever received by the Group  at 84 points out of 100. Atos therefore confirms its position in the top 1% companies assessed by EcoVadis within its sector.In October 2022  Atos was upgraded to the highest rating available (the AAA rating) in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) ESG rating 2022  ranking it among the top 7% of companies in the ‚ÄúSoftware and Service‚Äù industry with a good performance in Sustainability measured through the Environmental  Social and Governance dimensions. MSCI highlighted Atos‚Äô leadership in clean technology initiatives  as well as the Group‚Äôs strengthened governance. Since the beginning of the year  Atos‚Äô Board of directors has welcomed five new members: Ren√© Proglio  Astrid Stange  Elizabeth Tinkham  Caroline Ruellan and Katrina Hopkins  who collectively bring a wealth of experience in digital  finance  human resources and corporate governance.Commercial activityOrder entry was ‚Ç¨ 2.0 billion in Q3 2022  representing a book-to-bill ratio of 71%.For the Evidian perimeter  the book-to-bill ratio was 85%  impacted by fluctuations in the HPC deal flow  following a very high order intake in Q2  as well as a lower number of large application management services contracts.On the Tech Foundations perimeter  the book-to-bill ratio was 58%  while Tech Foundations is in the process of gradually re-building a strong commercial pipeline and enhancing its sales capabilities. However  positive evolutions were noted in Q3  with a significant increase in order entry from new logos  and the benefits from a higher contract selectivity.Book-to-bill ratio is expected to recover significantly across both perimeters in Q4.At the end of September 2022  the Group‚Äôs full backlog reached ‚Ç¨ 21.8 billion  down ‚Ç¨0.8 billion compared to the end of June 2022. It represented 1.9 year of revenue.The full qualified pipeline amounted to ‚Ç¨ 7.1 billion at the end of September 2022  stable compared to the end of June 2022  representing 7.5 months of revenue.Human resourcesTotal headcount was 112 344 at the end of September 2022  broadly stable compared to the end of June 2022 (112 180).In Q3 2022  Atos hired 8 367 new employees (gross)  of which 64% are located in offshore and nearshore countries.In September 2022  Atos was listed for the first time by Great Place to Work¬Æ as one of ‚ÄòEurope‚Äôs Best Workplaces‚Äô in the 2022 annual list. It is ranked 21st position in the multinational company category.2022 full-year objectives confirmed and refinedBased on its robust Q3 performance  Atos refines its revenue growth objective for the full year  while operating margin and free cash flow objectives are unchanged. For the full year  the Group expects:Revenue growth at constant currency in the upper half of the -0.5% to +1.5% range;Operating margin at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range;Free cash flow at the lower end of the ‚Ç¨-150 million to ‚Ç¨200 million range excluding additional impacts of the envisioned transformation plan. Such additional impacts are estimated around ‚Ç¨-250 million  including the cost of financing  in line with information communicated at Atos Capital Markets Day in June.Marks of interest receivedAs indicated on September 29  2022  Atos received  on September 27  an unsolicited letter of intent from Onepoint  in association with private equity firm ICG  related to the potential acquisition of the Evidian perimeter  for an indicative enterprise value of ‚Ç¨4.2 billion. Following the thorough examination of this preliminary and non-binding mark of interest  and upon the recommendation of its ad hoc committee  the Board of Directors convened and unanimously concluded that it was not in the interest of the Company and its stakeholders  and therefore decided not to proceed.In addition  as indicated on October 24  2022  since the presentation of its separation project at the CMD on June 14  Atos has been approached by several players interested in the Tech Foundations business. The Board of Directors reiterates that it is its duty to examine all marks of interest  and it will do so for the Tech Foundations business with regard to the Company‚Äôs corporate interest and value creation for its stakeholders.Atos is fully mobilized on the progress of the separation project within the planned timetable  which remains the Group's priority.Analyst and investor conference callAtos Management invites analysts and investors to a conference call on the Group 2022 third quarter revenue  on Wednesday  October 26  2022  at 08:00 am (CET ‚Äì Paris).You can join the webcast of the conference:via the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/nh2xut9fby telephone with the dial-in  10 minutes prior the starting time.

A robust growth in Digital  in particular with a new logo in decarbonization  as well as in BDS  was mitigated by a decrease in Tech Foundations activities.Northern Europe & APAC revenue grew by +2.6% at constant currency. In addition to the contribution of Cloudreach  Digital activities were driven by strong demand in application services  in particular from the public sector. Tech Foundations activities continued to improve  while BDS was impacted by fluctuations in the Advanced Computing business.Central Europe revenue decreased by -1.2% at constant currency  as growth in digital applications  particularly in public sector  TMT and energy  and cybersecurity was offset by a decline in Tech Foundations‚Äô activities  partly driven by the UCC business  and by lower hardware and software resale.Southern Europe revenue decreased by -2.2% at constant currency primarily due to lower HPC sales  coming from a very high level in FY21  and to the continued deliberate decline of hardware and software resale. Digital activities benefitted from a good momentum in applications and public cloud services  while Tech Foundations activities were slightly up  driven by professional services.Others and global structures encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group‚Äôs global delivery centers and global structures. Revenue grew strongly  by +12.4% at constant currency  supported by the acquisition of Ipsotek in 2021  as well as a good performance in Africa and in Turkey.Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates reconciliationIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 % change Statutory revenue 2 818 2 666 +5.7% Exchange rates effect 122 Revenue at constant exchange rates 2 818 2 788 +1.1% Scope effect 31 Exchange rates effect on acquired/disposed perimeters 3 Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates 2 818 2 821 -0.1%Currency exchange rates effects positively contributed to revenue growth for ‚Ç¨+122 million.

Overall  the research uncovered that U.S. businesses still aren't doing enough to protect their organizations from cyber threats by not providing proper cyber awareness training and education.In collaboration with research company Ipsos  Terranova Security surveyed 1 500 U.S. employees and found that the level of concern over cyber risks was alarmingly low. Just over a third (35%) of employees express little-to-no concern about data theft at work  and 20% believe they can't be targeted at all by cyber criminals.The research shows there is still confusion among employees over who is responsible for protecting company data  despite human error being the cause of 95% of cyber issues. More than three-quarters (76%) of U.S. employees believe it's the IT department's responsibility to protect company data  compared to just 53% who understand they play an essential role.These findings come at a time when the danger from a breach is at an all-time high. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center  294 million people were impacted by data breaches in 2021.The research highlights that U.S. businesses are failing to provide employees with enough education on common cyber threats and security best practices. Only 41% of employees say they work in a company where cyber security awareness training is mandatory. 43% haven't participated in any cyber security training  and nearly a third (31%) indicated that their company doesn't offer any relevant training at all.These low training rates aren't due to a lack of interest from employees  as 77% believe cyber security training is interesting  and 57% have started or completed the training when it's offered to them.""The research shows that there's some work to do on educating people about the important role they play in protecting data at work  but the responsibility doesn't just fall on them "" said Theo Zafirakos  Chief Information Security Officer  Terranova Security. ""It's clear that security awareness training fell by the wayside for many American businesses  even though cyber crime is rising  and that's a concern. But employees also have an appetite for learning more about it. These people are the first line of defense against any cyber attack. By investing more in education and building a culture around data security within the business  companies will set up a powerful barrier against any cyber threats.""Read the full Ipsos report and learn more about Terranova Security here.About Terranova SecurityTerranova Security  part of the HelpSystems solution ecosystem  has been transforming the world's end users into cyber heroes for more than 20 years.

Organic increase was 8.7%. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 7.3%.Half of the portfolio (Buildings & Infrastructure and Industry) was up 10.8% organically on average  benefiting from strong trends for both Opex and Capex activities. More than a third of the portfolio (Agri-Food & Commodities  Certification and Marine & Offshore) delivered a 9.0% average organic revenue growth. Less than a sixth of the portfolio (Consumer Products Services) grew at 0.6% organically  after being particularly strong in Q3 2021  impacted by some regional lockdown measures in China and the weakening of consumer spending overall.By geography  activities in the Americas strongly outperformed the rest of the Group (29% of revenue; up 15.0% organically)  led by a 9.5% increase in North America (Buildings & Infrastructure driven) and by a 25.3% increase in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). The activity in Asia Pacific (31% of revenue; up 4.6% organically) benefited from robust growth in Australia as well as strong growth in South-East Asian countries (notably Vietnam). Europe (31% of revenue) delivered homogeneous growth across the board; up 6.0% organically  with above average performance in Italy and France  notably. Finally  in Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue)  business increased by 16.2% on an organic basis  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 1.3%  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized since the beginning of 2022  alongside those of the prior year.Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 7.0%  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies.DISCIPLINED BOLT-ON M&A IN 2022 YEAR-TO-DATEDisciplined and selective bolt-on M&A in the first nine months of 2022During the first nine months  Bureau Veritas continued to pursue its bolt-on M&A  completing four transactions in strategic areas  representing circa EUR 67 million in annualized revenue (or 1.3% of FY2021 Group revenue).

Bureau Veritas had EUR 1.4 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines.On September 30  2022  Bureau Veritas successfully raised EUR 200 million on the US Private Placement market through a bilateral 10-year issuance at 3.6%. Bureau Veritas is a repeat issuer on this market since 2008. With this issuance  the Group seizes attractive market conditions to early partially refinance its 2023 bond and lengthens the maturity of its debt from an average of 3.7 years to 4.2 years post operation.Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% of fixed debt.2022 OUTLOOK CONFIRMEDBased on the year-to-date performance  the significant growth opportunities related to its sustainability range of services and solutions  and excluding the full year impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns in China  Bureau Veritas still expects for 2022 to:Achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;Improve the adjusted operating margin;Generate sustained strong cash flow  with a cash conversion6 above 90%.Q3 2022 BUSINESS REVIEWMARINE & OFFSHOREIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 104.7 92.3 +13.4% +9.7% - +3.7% 9M revenue 309.2 281.5 +9.8% +7.2% - +2.6%The Marine & Offshore business delivered a strong 9.7% organic revenue increase in the third quarter with the following trends:Low double-digit organic revenue growth in New Construction (40% of divisional revenue)  primarily fueled by Asia  with China and South Korea leading the way. This reflected the acceleration in the new order intake in the prior year (considering the lead time).Low double-digit organic revenue growth in the Core In-service activity (45% of divisional revenue). This is a combination of: a continuous increased level of occasional surveys; the growth in the fleet; some price increases; and a favorable timing of inspections by ship owners  which are not expected to be continue in the fourth quarter. At end-September  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 591 ships  representing 142.4 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)  up 0.5% year on year (based on the number of ships).Low single-digit revenue drop for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore)  after the significant catch up recorded in the Offshore Oil & Gas market in Q3 2021  notably for the loss adjusting business  as well as some contract completions. The non-classification services (including consulting services related to energy efficiency) continued to contribute to the divisional growth.The New Build market remained well oriented in the third quarter of the year. Bureau Veritas new orders  particularly for LNG fueled ships  bulk  container ships and specialized vessels  reached 6.7 million gross tons in September 2022  slightly up compared to the prior-year period. As a result  the order book stood at 18.9 million gross tons at the end of the quarter  up 16.2% compared to 16.3 million gross tons in December 2021. This gives highly positive outlook for the New Build activity for the next 2 years.Sustainability achievementsThe Group continued to address the challenges of sustainability and energy transition by providing rules and guidelines on safety  risks and performance requirements for innovation in future fuels and propulsion systems. The Group also supported its customers in complying with environmental regulations  implementing sustainable solutions on board  and measuring progress in decarbonization.In the third quarter of 2022  the Group released a new ‚ÄúBIOFUEL READY‚Äù notation to support the wider deployment of biofuels in the shipping industry. This notation will help the maritime industry address the main challenges related to the use of biofuels  providing requirements to ensure ship safety and environmental compliance.The Group has also been awarded an Approval in Principle (AIP) for a LNG dual fueled and ammonia fuel prepared very large crude carrier (VLCC). This AIP is the result of the successful cooperation between China Merchants Energy Shipping Co.  Ltd.  TotalEnergies  Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Co.  Ltd.  and GTT. The project evaluated the environmental  financial  technical and regulatory implications of a LNG dual fueled VLCC design being prepared for a later conversion to an ammonia dual fueled VLCC.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 323.9 273.1.1 +18.6% +9.6% - +9.0% 9M revenue 911.9 791.1 +15.3% +9.0% (0.2)% +6.5%The Agri-Food & Commodities business recorded a 9.6% organic revenue growth in the third quarter  primarily led by strong markets for Metal & Minerals  Oil & Petrochemicals and Government services. In the first nine months of 2022  the Group organic revenue increased by 9.0%.The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P  31% of divisional revenue) achieved low double-digit organic growth led by both Upstream and Trade related activities. The O&P Trade market further improved as it benefits from higher fuel consumption  notably for aviation fuel/gasoline  low inventories and price increase initiatives. All regions grew apart from Asia (impacted by China). Growth was particularly strong in the US and in the Middle East. The Russia/Ukraine war has triggered trade flow route changes that has benefited to new locations  such as the Americas and the Middle East  as new supply hubs to Europe. In the quarter  Bureau Veritas continued to further reposition its portfolio towards new services (such as laboratory outsourcing) and value-added segments (Oil Condition Monitoring  Carbon 14 traceability for Biofuels).The Metals & Minerals (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) delivered high single-digit organic growth overall  led by both segments. Upstream (nearly two-thirds of M&M) recorded mid-single-digit revenue growth  led by most geographies  and notably the Americas (Canada  Chile and Peru). The growth slowed against very challenging comparables and slowing of growth in ‚Äògreenfields‚Äô exploration  on the back of tightening financial conditions for junior ‚Äògreenfields‚Äô explorers. In mining related testing  the growth outlook remains solid driven by demand for metals to support the energy transition. The Group‚Äôs successful strategy for on-site laboratories (with key wins including iron ore mines in Australia) continued to contribute to the growth and increase revenue predictability. Trade activities reported double-digit organic revenue growth led by all geographies. It was fueled by the main metals and coal which remained in high demand in Asia and other large markets as a substitute for natural gas. Copper and base metals trade activity continued to be strong  notably driven by electrification trends in many economies.Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter led by Agricultural products. The Agri Upstream business delivered solid growth led by the Brazilian operations with strong activity levels for cotton testing fueled by record crops. The agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  primarily led by Brazil as well  which notably benefited from a record level of export of maize crop. In Europe  business improved although it was still disrupted by the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war on Black Sea exports. The Food business recorded a slight organic revenue decline  reflecting the various geographical environments: strong growth in the US and in the Middle East and Africa supported by new greenfield / brownfield labs opening  while weak growth in Canada and lower growth in Asia Pacific than in 2021 (mobility restrictions). In Australia  which is weighted towards dairy products  the Group has accelerated its diversification towards pet food  meat and retail markets.Government services (14% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth in the third quarter across all geographies. Strong growth was recorded in Africa particularly led by the strong development of VOC (Verification of Conformity) in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  Nigeria  Tanzania  Zimbabwe  Ghana  and Single Window contracts in DRC. This segment continued to benefit from the increased value of inspected goods on existing contracts  led by high commodities prices. In the Middle East  the activity showed marked improvement with the ramp-up of a contract in Iraq.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter  within Government services  the Group has been selected by the Ivory Coast government to support its Ministry of Hydraulics  Sanitation and Health as a control office on behalf of the National Agency for Waste Management (ANAGED). Through an eco-citizen approach  Bureau Veritas participates in the achievement of cleanliness objectives for 21 cities in the country and in the preservation of the environment and improvement of population‚Äôs living conditions. The Group has also been awarded a contract with Tanzania to ensure collection of an eco-levy fee on all imported electronic communication equipment on behalf of the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 306.0 259.1 +18.1% +10.6% (0.7)% +8.2% 9M revenue 870.3 746.3 +16.6% +10.7% (0.6)% +6.5%Industry was amongst the best performing businesses within the Group‚Äôs portfolio in the third quarter with organic growth of 10.6%  across the board. This performance was driven by strong business activity in the Power & Utilities segment (including renewables) alongside the recovery of Oil & Gas markets. In the first nine months of 2022  Industry organic revenue increased by 10.7%.By geography  most regions delivered strong growth in the third quarter with Latin America and Asia Pacific leading the way alongside Europe. Growth was less pronounced in both North America and Middle East and Africa.By market  the Power & Utilities segment (14% of divisional revenue) remained a significant growth driver with a double-digit organic performance during Q3  primarily supported by the Opex services. The activity was particularly strong in Latin America (Argentina  Chile and Colombia notably) with the continued ramp-up of large contract wins with various Power Distribution clients  combined with volume increases on existing contracts and price renegotiations. Europe also delivered a very robust revenue performance in most countries  notably in the UK  Spain and France. Similarly to the first half  France and the UK continued to benefit from high activity levels in nuclear power plants (the EPR Flamanville 3 project in France). Nuclear power generation has regained traction in the current context of energy crisis  which provides attractive growth opportunities for the Group  which has a recognized expertise in the field.In Renewable Power Generation (solar  wind  hydrogen)  the Group continues to see significant opportunities  as well as for power grids  e-mobility and Power-to-X technologies to build a low-carbon transport sector. Several contracts have been awarded during the quarter. In the US  the supply chain difficulties related to shortage of components have started to ease. This has driven stronger sales at Bradley Construction Management (acquired early 2021)  which focuses on solar energy construction projects. Overall  the sales pipeline is continuing to increase and includes Oil & Gas actors that are rolling out their transitions to low carbon by reducing emissions and changing the energy mix.In Oil & Gas (32% of divisional revenue)  double-digit organic revenue growth continued as in previous quarters. This reflected the conversion of a solid sales pipeline. While Capex projects are well oriented  triggered by rising oil prices and the consequences of the Russian/Ukraine war  the bulk of the growth came from the Opex-related activities  representing two-thirds of the Oil & Gas business. Sales were essentially driven by Latin America and  in particular  Brazil (market share gains) and Argentina (volume and price led)  followed by the Middle East (outsourcing monitoring activities) and Europe (asset Integrity Management  in Spain  Germany and Italy). In Canada  the site assessment and remediation activities strongly contributed to the growth. Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services  recorded high single-digit organic revenue growth  primarily led by Asia Pacific (China and Australia essentially) and the Middle East alongside North America. In the US  the drilling activity benefited from the continued increase in the number of rigs.Elsewhere  the aerospace business saw a revenue stream decline following the decision to exit the business in Russia  and the automotive business (4% of divisional revenue) remained impacted by supply chain disruption.Sustainability achievementsThrough the BV Green Line of services and solutions dedicated to Sustainability  the Group is supporting its clients notably in the transition towards a better use of natural resources  the reduction of their carbon footprint  and the promotion of more sustainable practices. In the third quarter  the Group was awarded the project supervision and support Quality Assurance of the largest green hydrogen and green power solar project in China. It also ensured failure investigation and inspection services of a large project in Australia for a large Danish wind farm manufacturer.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 426.2 357.0.0 +19.4% +11.0% +2.3% +6.1% 9M revenue 1 202.1 1 066.2 +12.7% +6.2% +1.8% +4.7%Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) was the best performing business within the Group‚Äôs portfolio in the third quarter  with organic growth of 11.0%  primarily driven by the Americas  and Middle East and Africa. In the first nine months of 2022  B&I organic revenue increased by 6.2%.Double-digit organic revenue growth was delivered in Construction-related activities (58% of divisional revenue) and high single-digit growth in Buildings In-service activities (42% of divisional revenue).The Americas region (28% of divisional revenue) delivered a stellar performance (up 29.4% organically). It was primarily led by the US across most segments: data center commissioning services (related to commercial property sectors)  where the Group has a leading expertise; project management assistance for Opex-related services  essentially in the Retail market; technical control and station product conformity services for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS)  where the Group continues to experience a strong momentum. The integration of the latest acquisitions  PreScience and CAP  focusing on transportation infrastructure  are progressing as planned. CAP is expected to see some uptick due to Hurricane Ian recovery work. In Latin America  the activity continued to be supported by the very strong recovery of Brazil (primarily led by Capex-related services) thanks to the ramp-up of large contracts for industrial and steel facilities  alongside Argentina.Growth in Europe (46% of divisional revenue) was robust overall. Double-digit organic revenue performance was achieved in Italy (ramp-up of large contract wins on the motorway network) while Spain grew high single-digit led by Opex services. France  the largest contributor (36% of divisional revenue) delivered a steady 5.8% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Momentum continued in the In-service activity (around three quarters of the French operations)  mostly regulatory driven. Bureau Veritas Solutions (technical assistance  consulting services) maintained a double-digit revenue growth led by the increase in headcount and fueled by energy efficiency works (including the white certificates for eligible projects). Conversely  Capex-related works remained muted in a declining New Build market. The Group benefits from a diversified mix by end markets with limited exposure to residential buildings  and a higher weighting towards infrastructure and public works  which were backed by an increasing pipeline. The pipeline of sales related to the numerous investment programs in the EU (of which the Green Deal and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France) continued to grow.The Asia Pacific region (22% of divisional revenue) recorded a mid-single-digit organic revenue increase overall. In China  business was slightly up  still impacted by the government‚Äôs ‚Äòzero covid policy‚Äô  as the Group continued to operate in a stop and go situation with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid arose. Following the regional lockdown measures which occurred in Q2  the construction sites have restarted slower than expected  which impacted Bureau Veritas‚Äô operations. This is likely to last into the fourth quarter. Elsewhere  the activity grew strongly in Japan (led by code compliance services)  India (up 18.2% organically) and Australia.Lastly  the Middle East & Africa region (4% of divisional revenue) experienced very high double-digit growth. It was primarily led by Saudi Arabia and by the United Arab Emirates which continued to benefit from the development of numerous projects triggered by the rebound in oil prices.Sustainability achievementsIn Q3  the Group was awarded a contract in Colombia to validate compliance with sustainable construction standard of the Casa Colombia model in the design and construction stages. Casa Colombia is a tool developed for the national context from globally accepted standards and with international support. The development is based on the Quality Assurance Guide for Green Building Rating Tools of the World Green Building Council.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 101.2 92.4 +9.5% +6.6% - +2.90% 9M revenue 310.4 288.9 +7.5% +4.9% +0.1% +2.5%The Certification business recorded organic growth of 6.6% in the third quarter. In the first nine months of 2022  Certification organic revenue increased by 4.9%.The growth was supported by both volume and robust price increases across most geographies. Latin America  Africa and Asia Pacific performed above the divisional average  fueled by a solid commercial development and overall strong traction for sustainability driven solutions. The countries where the business mix has been significantly diversified (shift from traditional schemes towards new services) grew the most. This is illustrated by Brazil  Australia  Vietnam and the UK (sustainability driven) and China (CSR)  which all saw double-digit organic growth in the quarter.Overall  business remained driven by the rising client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. Within the Group‚Äôs portfolio  double-digit growth was achieved in Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability  Enterprise Risks (led by Cybersecurity and IT Management Systems Solutions) and Training & Personnel services; and high single-digit growth was achieved in Food certification (fueled by Food Product Certification  Food Safety and Food Sustainability). Conversely  revenue slightly declined in QHSE and Transportation  after several recertification schemes in 2021 (three-year cycle for ISO 9001  14001 and Transportation schemes as well as the transition of OSHAS 18001 scheme towards ISO 45001)  which implied an increase of the man days.During the third quarter  Bureau Veritas‚Äô sustainability-related services for Certification grew organically by 15%  still driven by buoyant demand for verification of carbon emissions  supply chain audits on ESG topics  Assurance of Sustainability Reporting and Wood Management Systems Certification.The benefits for portfolio diversification continued to drive growth with strong momentum on Sustainability services  alongside solutions dedicated to Anti-bribery  Asset Management  IT Service Management Information Security  and Business Continuity. In the quarter  the Cybersecurity offering delivered a 31.6% organic revenue growth  led by a rising demand for more transparency and control on IT and security systems. The Group has won an international contract for Anti-bribery audits (ISO 37001) to be delivered in 12 European countries for a Japanese electronics company.In addition  the commercial deployment of Clarity  launched in December 2021  continued. With this solution  the Group supports companies in managing their ESG strategy roadmap  measuring their performance and tracking their implementation. The commercial pipeline is healthy  with recent wins in different sectors  including Food & Beverage  Industry  Retail and Hospitality.Sustainability achievementsDuring the third quarter of 2022  Bureau Veritas was awarded numerous contracts in the sustainability field. These ranged from carbon footprint verification services for a French sugar company to food safety services for a large US food retail chain.One example of them is the contract with Verkor  a European pioneer in electric vehicle batteries  alongside its partner OPTEL  to guarantee full traceability of Verkor‚Äôs batteries and bring greater transparency and sustainability to its entire supply chain. This relies on on-site audits based on health and safety  environment and biodiversity  and social and human rights criteria.CONSUMER PRODUCTS SERVICESIN EUR MILLIONS 2022 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Q3 revenue 195.1 171.8 +13.6% +0.6% +5.4% +7.6% 9M revenue 546.6 490.1 +11.5% +3.0% +2.1% +6.4%The Consumer Products Services business delivered an organic revenue growth of 0.6% in the third quarter  following the significant recovery recorded in 2021 particularly in China  which was negatively impacted by regional lockdowns in Q3 of this year. In the first nine months of 2022  Consumer Products Services organic revenue increased by 3.0%.By geography  the growth was primarily led by South-East Asian countries (Vietnam in particular). Turkey  Latin America and Mexico also delivered very strong growth and illustrated the benefit of the Group‚Äôs geographic diversification strategy. Conversely  activity levels were under pressure in Eastern Asia (including China  Japan and South Korea)  with China facing the impacts of new regional lockdowns measures and weakening of consumer spending overall.Softlines (32% of divisional revenue) performed slightly better than the divisional average  marked by a contrasted performance by geography: strong momentum in South-East Asia (Vietnam  Thailand and Sri Lanka essentially)  which continued to benefit from a structural sourcing shift out of China; strong activity in Turkey  still supported by nearshoring patterns from European retailers; declining revenue in China as a result of the combined effect of regional lockdowns on some manufacturing sites  and the reduction of testing demand due to high inventories from retail clients impacting notably the inspection business. During the quarter  the Group continued to focus on diversification by accelerating share in sportswear segment and shift from retail to brand through growth in Supply Chain Due Diligence  Sustainable Claims and Sustainable Chemical Management wins.Hardlines/Toys/Health & Beauty (36% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average. The Hardlines business  including small appliances and do-it-yourself products  was impacted by a high level of inventories and less product launches  which notably impacted the Chinese operations. Toys grew ahead of the Christmas period driven across the board (apart from China). While Cosmetics  Health & Beauty performed less well  luxury products continued to be solid driven by Italy. Inspections & Audit services recorded double-digit organic growth  led by a strong demand for Social & CSR audits across most geographies (and notably in Asia). In Q3  the acquisition of Galbraith Laboratories Inc. in the US  focusing on Healthcare analytical testing solutions to a wide range of industry segments  will enable the Group to accelerate its geographic diversification and move into new services.Lastly  Technology7 (32% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average  with double-digit organic performance in automotive (reliability testing and homologation services  notably fueled by China) while Electrical & Electronics and Wireless testing activities were weaker. The growth in Wireless Testing (wireless technologies/Internet of Things (IoT) products) was impacted by the China‚Äôs Covid-19 shutdowns and by project delays in both South Korea and Taiwan. The activity is expected to remain subdued into the fourth quarter of 2022 due to replanning of clients‚Äô product launches. In China  the activity on the domestic market contributed to the growth. The Group continued to develop projects to strengthen its local exposure.Sustainability achievementsIn the third quarter of 2022  the Group opened a Health  Beauty and Environmental laboratory in Xi‚Äôan  in the Shaanxi province located in Central Western China. It specializes in domestic Health product personal care and plant-based beauty products testing services.The Group was also awarded a Sustainable Chemical Management contract with a large European sportswear retailer. This further demonstrates its leading position in sustainable chemical management (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals).PRESENTATION Q3 2022 revenue will be presented on Wednesday  October 26  2022  at 6:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group‚Äôs budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group‚Äôs performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (‚ÄúTIC‚Äù) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes ‚Äúorganic‚Äù revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group‚Äôs operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas‚Äô control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group‚Äôs performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations ‚Äì in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendix 4 of this press release.2 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).3 Proportion of women on the Executive Committee in Band II (internal grade corresponding to an executive management position) in the Group

In the EU  Connect was launched in collaboration with PrimaryBid's strategic partner  Euronext  to facilitate pan-EU expansion and cross border capital formation. In France  Bourse Direct  Boursorama and EasyBourse are fully integrated into PrimaryBid's Connect API enabling at-scale automated distribution  and a number of leading EU retail intermediaries are in the process of completing integration.Investment in the PrimaryBid Connect platform reflects growing scrutiny on public companies from regulators and policymakers around the limited access everyday investors have to 'institutional-only' fundraisings. As an independently regulated company  PrimaryBid has the leading track-record in winning access for retail investors to IPOs and secondary fundraisings working alongside all major investment banks. PrimaryBid has completed over 200 deals since the start of 2020.For individual investors  PrimaryBid Connect brings deals directly into their chosen investment platform  maximising the opportunity to make use of tax-efficient wrappers such as ISAs or funds on account. Partners also have a choice over their preferred interface to PrimaryBid  including straight-through API processing for digital-first platforms. Other enhancements include shareholder verification and transaction audit functionality that meet emerging best practices around deal allocation and post-deal regulatory reporting.James Deal  PrimaryBid's Head of UK said: ""The launch of PrimaryBid Connect is an exciting milestone in our mission to deliver public inclusion in our capital markets through technology. In the UK  HM Treasury's recent capital raising review authored by Mark Austin stated clearly that retail investors should be included in all public company fundraisings. HM Treasury is also working to remove other practical barriers to public inclusion  including arbitrary limits on retail participation in the UK Prospectus regime  soon to be reformed through the Financial Services and Markets Bill.""The launch of Connect will enable corporate issuers and their advisers to efficiently execute on the new governance standards by accessing the broadest range of platforms and retail investors. PrimaryBid stands ready to unlock nearly ~¬£500 billion in retail capital for UK plc alongside our distribution partners: the PrimaryBid Connect platform is the next stage in our ambition to simplify and enhance this process.""Eric Low  PrimaryBid's Head of EU  added: ""Encouraging retail investor participation in the capital markets is a core feature of the European Commission's recent strategy and consultations. We are working with our European partners to simplify the capital formation process and deliver broad-based retail inclusion through technology  very much in the spirit of policymaker plans for Capital Markets Union.""",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['pan-European Connect platform', 'PrimaryBid', 'cross border capital formation', 'pan-European B2B ""Connect"" platform', 'leading EU retail intermediaries', 'emerging best practices', 'post-deal regulatory reporting', 'scale automated distribution', 'straight-through API processing', 'transaction audit functionality', 'other practical barriers', 'new governance standards', 'recent capital raising', 'retail investor customers', 'capital markets fintech', 'discretionary wealth managers', 'major investment banks', 'capital formation process', 'broad-based retail inclusion', 'UK Prospectus regime', 'retail investor participation', 'Capital Markets Union', 'public company fundraisings', 'PrimaryBid Connect platform', 'retail capital', 'leading track-record', 'investment platform', 'retail participation', 'public inclusion', 'interactive investor', 'Connect API', 'retail brokers', 'European Union', 'new stage', 'transaction demand', 'retail investors', 'Other enhancements', 'recent strategy', 'public companies', 'Markets Bill', 'secondary fundraisings', 'distribution partners', 'individual investors', 'AJ Bell', 'Hargreaves Lansdown', 'strategic partner', 'pan-EU expansion', 'Bourse Direct', 'growing scrutiny', 'everyday investors', 'tax-efficient wrappers', 'preferred interface', 'shareholder verification', 'deal allocation', 'James Deal', 'exciting milestone', 'HM Treasury', 'Mark Austin', 'arbitrary limits', 'Financial Services', 'corporate issuers', 'broadest range', 'next stage', 'Eric Low', 'core feature', 'European Commission', 'policymaker plans', '60 brokerage partners', 'digital-first platforms', 'European partners', 'UK plc', 'limited access', 'UK platforms', 'open-access technology', 'Source', 'launch', 'IFAs', 'fintechs', 'IPOs', 'placings', 'bonds', 'partnership', 'number', 'collaboration', 'Euronext', 'France', 'Boursorama', 'EasyBourse', 'integration', 'regulators', 'policymakers', 'institutional', '200 deals', 'start', 'opportunity', 'use', 'ISAs', 'funds', 'account', 'choice', 'Head', 'advisers', 'ambition', 'consultations', 'spirit']",2022-10-25,2022-10-26,finextra.com

""These interim financial statements were signed off prior to our initial public offering ‚Äù says Adrien Haller  founder and Chairman and CEO of Charwood Energy  ‚ÄúHowever  they show how strong our business momentum is at present  with revenue growth of 40% in the first half of the year  and investments already under way to support our future growth. On foot of these very satisfactory interim results  we are very confident that we will achieve our financial and strategic targets for 2022 and beyond.‚Äù Note that as of 30 June 2022  the closing date of the interim financial statements  Charwood Energy had not yet recognised the proceeds of its IPO on Euronext Growth¬Æ  which took place on 13 July 2022. However  those statements partly include prepaid expenses related to the planned IPO and Eiffel Gaz Vert‚Äôs subscription on 12 May 2022 for a bond issued for a nominal amount of ‚Ç¨7 million. Business growth of 40% in H1 2022 In the first half of 2022  Charwood Energy posted revenue of ‚Ç¨3.2 million  entirely generated by services carried out for third parties. Driven by strong momentum  particularly in France  its priority market  business in H1 grew by 40% compared to H1 2021. The results incorporate key investments to fuel the Group's future growth Expenses increased over the first six months of the year compared to the first half of 2021  reflecting the ongoing structuring of the teams to support the Group's future growth and the ramp-up of projects to be delivered in the second half of the year and beyond.
