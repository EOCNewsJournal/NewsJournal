Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to decide on new issue and issue of warrants and/or convertible debenturesIn the light of the financing arrangement based on convertible debentures entered into between the Company and Negma Group Ltd  the board of directors proposes that the EGM resolves on a new authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a new issue of shares as well as on the issue of warrants and/or convertible debentures as set out below. For further information on the financing arrangement  please see the press release published on 26 October 2022.The board of directors proposes that the EGM resolves to authorize the board of directors to resolve  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  at one or more occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertible debentures for cash payment and/or with provision of non-cash consideration or set-off or otherwise.The number of shares  or warrants or convertible debentures that entitle subscription of a number of shares  that may be issued shall not exceed 20 per cent of the Company‚Äôs registered number of shares at the time of the board of director‚Äôs first resolution pursuant to the authorization. For subsequent resolutions pursuant to the authorization  the 20 per cent limit shall be based on (i) the number of shares issued pursuant to the authorization  and  with respect to warrants and convertible debentures issued pursuant to the authorization  (ii) the number of shares issued through subscription of issued warrants  and (iii) the number of shares issued through conversion of issued convertible debentures  provided that subscription/conversion of such warrants/convertible debentures have been completed.The authorization thus allows the board of directors to take into account  for example in relation to convertible debentures  the number of shares actually issued rather than the number of shares that could be issued based on the lowest conversion price of the convertible debenture  provided that conversion of previously issued convertible debentures under the authorization have been completed. The lowest conversion price for convertible debentures needs to be included in the resolution for registration purposes.Deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights shall be possible to  if needed  strengthen the Company‚Äôs financial position  broaden the ownership base and/or to increase the institutional ownership of the Company. New issue of shares and issue of warrants and/or convertible debentures shall  in the event of deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  be made at market conditions.This authorization replaces the current authorization resolved by the annual general meeting on 10 May 2022.The board of directors  the CEO or the person appointed by the board of directors shall be entitled to make the minor adjustments of the decision required in connection with the registration thereof.For the present resolution to be valid it is required that the proposal is approved by shareholders holding at least two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.SHARES AND VOTESAt the time of issuance of this notice  the total number of shares and votes in the Company amounts to 199 400 599. There is only one class of shares and the Company does not hold any treasury shares.SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONAccording to Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Companies Act  the board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors considers that this can be done without material damage to the Company  provide information on circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda.DOCUMENTATIONThe board of directors‚Äô complete proposal for resolution will be made available at the Company‚Äôs head office at the address V√§stra Tr√§dg√•rdsgatan 15 in Stockholm not later than three weeks prior to the meeting and will be sent to the shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy  and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Story continuesPetri Helsky  President & CEO:‚ÄúAfter a difficult first half of the year  Suominen‚Äôs result started to turn around in the third quarter. We reached all time high quarterly net sales in Q3 through improvement in both volumes and prices and tailwind from currencies. Our sales volumes increased in comparison to both Q3/2021 and Q2/2022 driven especially by improvement in North America. Margins were still lower than a year ago but improved slightly versus the previous quarter.Our net sales were EUR 131.9 million (98.7) in the third quarter. Sales volumes increased as did sales prices following the higher raw material prices. Currency impact was significantly positive at EUR +11.1 million. Our quarterly EBITDA improved to EUR 5.1 million (4.2). The higher sales and production volumes impacted the result positively but our sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs even despite the previously implemented energy surcharge in Europe. Other operating income was impacted positively by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.In August we announced surcharges on all our products in North America as a response to significant unexpected increases in raw materials  energy and freight costs. In September we announced a new energy surcharge on all our products in Europe as energy prices have continued to increase significantly after our first surcharge in March. Energy cost inflation is expected to continue during the autumn and winter months.In the third quarter Suominen completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Looking ahead  we expect the demand for our products in the US to continue recovering and we have already seen the raw material markets turn more favorable in early Q4. At the same time our own improvement actions are starting to bear fruit. All these are expected to contribute positively to our result in the fourth quarter.‚ÄùNET SALESJuly‚ÄìSeptember 2022In July‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales increased from the comparison period by 34% to EUR 131.9 million (98.7) as both volumes and sales prices increased. Currencies impacted the net sales positively by EUR 11.1 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 80.3 million (57.0) and net sales of the Europe business area to EUR 51.7 million (41.6).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022In January‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales improved from the comparison period by 10% and amounted to EUR 360.2 million (327.6).

The increased sales and production volumes impacted the result positively while margins declined as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million. Other operating income was positively impacted by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.Operating profit increased from the comparison period and amounted to EUR 0.2 million (-0.8).Profit before income taxes was EUR 0.1 million (-1.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -0.4 million (-1.7). Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.5 million (0.1).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 10.3 million (38.1). The main drivers were lower sales and production volumes and lower margins as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material  energy  and freight costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million.Operating profit decreased and was EUR -4.0 million (23.1).Profit before income taxes was EUR -4.3 million (23.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -5.1 million (18.2).Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.8 million (-5.6).FINANCINGThe Group‚Äôs net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 65.8 million (48.2) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 39.9% (30.2%) and the equity ratio 39.8% (42.5%).In January‚ÄìSeptember  net financial expenses were EUR -0.3 million (+0.7)  or -0.1% (+0.2%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial expenses by EUR 4.4 million (in 2021  decreased by EUR 1.1 million).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021. The transaction impacted Suominen‚Äôs net financial expenses positively in 2021 by EUR 3.7 million. The effect on the cash flow in 2021 was EUR 11.6 million.Cash flow from operations in July‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -10.8 million (-8.9) and in January‚ÄìSeptember EUR -1.6 million (8.2)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR -0.03 (0.14). The decline in the cash flow from operations for January‚ÄìSeptember was driven by the weaker result.In the third quarter the change in net working capital was negative by EUR -13.9 million (-11.4). The change in net working capital in January‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -7.3 million (-23.2).In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn January‚ÄìSeptember  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 7.4 million (14.0) and the largest item was related to the growth investment initiatives in Nakkila  Finland. Other investments were mainly for maintenance.Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen‚Äôs strategy and supports company‚Äôs vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023.Depreciation and amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 14.3 million (15.0).PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYDuring the third quarter of 2022  we were awarded a silver level rating from the EcoVadis sustainability assessment. This was the first time that we completed the EcoVadis assessment and received a rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. By the end of September there has not been any LTA‚Äôs at Suominen sites.We systematically measure our employee engagement by conducting our engagement survey  Suominen Vibe  every year. During the year we have used the results from the survey conducted last year to plan and execute development actions. Now it is again time to collect feedback and this year‚Äôs Vibe survey is now ongoing.We are continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the third quarter we continued our actions towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. One example of our concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is our solar panels in our Alicante plant that have been in operation since August.We have a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens  and we continuously develop new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact. Our target is a 50% increase in sales of sustainable nonwovens by 2025 compared to 2019  and to have at least 10 sustainable product launches per year.Suominen reports progress in its key sustainability KPIs annually.As part of our Annual Report 2021 published on March 2  2022 we reported on the progress of our sustainability performance.

This can impact Suominen‚Äôs financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen‚Äôs business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen‚Äôs business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers‚Äô or our own plants due to virus infections. Despite the inflation and supply chain challenges caused by the pandemic straining the whole nonwovens industry and its value chain  we have not experienced more payment delays than usual by our customers and hence we do not see that our customer credit risks would have materially increased.Suominen‚Äôs other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen‚Äôs nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing the raw material markets turning more favorable from the fourth quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

ratios per share are either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)=Profit for the period adjusted with interest on hybrid bond  net of tax Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury shares Diluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -5 054 18 197 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 510 358 58 019 324 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.09 0.32 0.36 Diluted -0.09 0.31 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -1 553 8 192 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR -0.03 0.14 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 165 188 159 682 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.87 2.77 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.64 4.41 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 151.7 254.1 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 9 800 783 15 570 116 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 17.1 27.0 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure.

Income from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC was $5 million  or $0.01 per diluted share. These results included after-tax charges and credits totaling $7.7 million of expense  or $0.02 per share  which included the following (Exhibit 6):Impairment and other charges of $3.6 million; andRestructuring and other charges of $4.1 million.Adjusted income from continuing operations was $12.7 million  or $0.03 per diluted share (Exhibit 6).Adjusted EBITDA excludes pre-tax charges and credits. Adjusted EBITDA in the period also included a foreign exchange loss of $14.5 million. When excluding the foreign exchange loss  adjusted EBITDA was $200.1 million.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  ‚Äú Third quarter results reflect continued momentum in financial performance. Total Company revenue of $1.7 billion was a solid achievement given the currency headwind experienced during the period. Adjusted EBITDA was $200 million with a margin of 11.5% when excluding foreign exchange loss. Subsea and Surface Technologies both achieved sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin in the period.‚ÄùPferdehirt added  ‚Äú In Subsea  inbound was $1.4 billion  with year-to-date orders now totaling $5.2 billion  exceeding the level achieved in all of last year. Our Subsea Opportunities list remains at a record level. This strong project pipeline and the active dialogue with our large and expanded customer base give us continued confidence that our full-year Subsea orders will approach $7 billion  up as much as 40 percent versus the prior year. Extending the outlook into 2023  we believe orders over the next five quarters will be at least $9 billion.‚Äù‚Äú In Surface Technologies  inbound increased sequentially by approximately 65% to $449 million  representing a book-to-bill of 1.4. The strong order activity benefited from the acceleration of orders from Aramco  which was a significant achievement in the period. A large portion of these awards will result in revenue in future periods  providing us with increased visibility for continued growth in our international revenue in 2023.‚ÄùPferdehirt continued  ‚Äú We continue to see the potential for strong growth in EBITDA  cash flow and financial returns  as evidenced by our stated objective to achieve more than $1 billion of Subsea EBITDA by 2025. Further demonstrating our confidence in this outlook  we announced a new $400 million share buyback program in July  which we quickly put into action with the repurchase of $50 million of our ordinary shares in the third quarter.‚ÄùPferdehirt concluded  ‚Äú The next leg of growth in oil and gas will be fueled by offshore and the Middle East. The bold steps we took more than five years ago to create TechnipFMC have resulted in a pure-play technology company that is uniquely levered to both of these markets. Our portfolio of innovative products  solutions and disruptive commercial models has further strengthened our leadership position  and we are now taking full advantage of the market growth that lies ahead.‚ÄùOperational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial HighlightsReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.Three Months Ended Change (In millions) Sep. 30 2022 Jun. 30 2022 Sep. 30 2021 Sequential Year-over-Year Revenue $1 415.0 $1 414.6 $1 312.1 0.0% 7.8% Operating profit $105.0 $97.1 $23.5 8.1% 346.8% Adjusted EBITDA $183.8 $176.0 $146.5 4.4% 25.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin 13.0% 12.4% 11.2% 60 bps 180 bps Inbound orders $1 400.8 $1 928.0 $1 116.0 (27.3%) 25.5% Backlog1 2 3 $7 603.2 $7 926.3 $6 661.4 (4.1%) 14.1%Estimated Consolidated Backlog Scheduling(In millions) Sep. 30 2022 2022 (3 months) $996 2023 $3 747 2024 and beyond $2 860 Total $7 603 1 Backlog as of Sep. 30  2022 was reduced by a foreign exchange impact of $307 million. 2 Backlog does not capture all revenue potential for Subsea Services. 3 Backlog as of Sep. 30  2022 does not include total Company non-consolidated backlog of $509 million.Subsea reported third quarter revenue of $1 415 million  flat sequentially versus the second quarter.

We are unable to provide a reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because of the unpredictability of the individual components of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and the variability of items excluded from each such measure. Such information may have a significant  and potentially unpredictable  impact on our future financial results.TeleconferenceThe Company will host a teleconference on Thursday  October 27  2022 to discuss the third quarter 2022 financial results.

Net income  excluding charges and credits  as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS  excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted Operating profit""); Depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted EBITDA""); and Adjusted EBITDA  excluding foreign exchange gains or losses); and net debt) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Net income  excluding charges and credits  as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS  excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted Operating profit""); Depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted EBITDA""); and Adjusted EBITDA  excluding foreign exchange gains or losses); and net debt) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy  and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Petri Helsky  President & CEO:‚ÄúAfter a difficult first half of the year  Suominen‚Äôs result started to turn around in the third quarter. We reached all time high quarterly net sales in Q3 through improvement in both volumes and prices and tailwind from currencies. Our sales volumes increased in comparison to both Q3/2021 and Q2/2022 driven especially by improvement in North America. Margins were still lower than a year ago but improved slightly versus the previous quarter.Our net sales were EUR 131.9 million (98.7) in the third quarter. Sales volumes increased as did sales prices following the higher raw material prices. Currency impact was significantly positive at EUR +11.1 million. Our quarterly EBITDA improved to EUR 5.1 million (4.2). The higher sales and production volumes impacted the result positively but our sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs even despite the previously implemented energy surcharge in Europe. Other operating income was impacted positively by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.In August we announced surcharges on all our products in North America as a response to significant unexpected increases in raw materials  energy and freight costs. In September we announced a new energy surcharge on all our products in Europe as energy prices have continued to increase significantly after our first surcharge in March. Energy cost inflation is expected to continue during the autumn and winter months.In the third quarter Suominen completed the EcoVadis sustainability assessment for the first time and received a silver level rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.Looking ahead  we expect the demand for our products in the US to continue recovering and we have already seen the raw material markets turn more favorable in early Q4. At the same time our own improvement actions are starting to bear fruit. All these are expected to contribute positively to our result in the fourth quarter.‚ÄùNET SALESJuly‚ÄìSeptember 2022In July‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales increased from the comparison period by 34% to EUR 131.9 million (98.7) as both volumes and sales prices increased. Currencies impacted the net sales positively by EUR 11.1 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 80.3 million (57.0) and net sales of the Europe business area to EUR 51.7 million (41.6).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022In January‚ÄìSeptember 2022  Suominen‚Äôs net sales improved from the comparison period by 10% and amounted to EUR 360.2 million (327.6). Volumes decreased while sales prices increased  with currencies impacting the net sales positively by EUR 23.7 million.Net sales of the Americas business area amounted to EUR 206.3 million (196.4) and net sales of the Europe business area to EUR 154.1 million (131.3).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTJuly‚ÄìSeptember 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 5.1 million (4.2). The increased sales and production volumes impacted the result positively while margins declined as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material and energy costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million. Other operating income was positively impacted by one-time tax credits and incentives in Brazil and Italy.Operating profit increased from the comparison period and amounted to EUR 0.2 million (-0.8).Profit before income taxes was EUR 0.1 million (-1.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -0.4 million (-1.7). Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.5 million (0.1).January‚ÄìSeptember 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) was EUR 10.3 million (38.1). The main drivers were lower sales and production volumes and lower margins as sales price increases could not fully compensate for the higher raw material  energy  and freight costs. Currency impact on EBITDA was EUR +0.3 million.Operating profit decreased and was EUR -4.0 million (23.1).Profit before income taxes was EUR -4.3 million (23.8)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -5.1 million (18.2).Income taxes for the period were EUR -0.8 million (-5.6).FINANCINGThe Group‚Äôs net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 65.8 million (48.2) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 39.9% (30.2%) and the equity ratio 39.8% (42.5%).In January‚ÄìSeptember  net financial expenses were EUR -0.3 million (+0.7)  or -0.1% (+0.2%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial expenses by EUR 4.4 million (in 2021  decreased by EUR 1.1 million).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021. The transaction impacted Suominen‚Äôs net financial expenses positively in 2021 by EUR 3.7 million. The effect on the cash flow in 2021 was EUR 11.6 million.Cash flow from operations in July‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -10.8 million (-8.9) and in January‚ÄìSeptember EUR -1.6 million (8.2)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR -0.03 (0.14). The decline in the cash flow from operations for January‚ÄìSeptember was driven by the weaker result.In the third quarter the change in net working capital was negative by EUR -13.9 million (-11.4). The change in net working capital in January‚ÄìSeptember was EUR -7.3 million (-23.2).In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn January‚ÄìSeptember  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 7.4 million (14.0) and the largest item was related to the growth investment initiatives in Nakkila  Finland. Other investments were mainly for maintenance.Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen‚Äôs strategy and supports company‚Äôs vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023.Depreciation and amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 14.3 million (15.0).PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYDuring the third quarter of 2022  we were awarded a silver level rating from the EcoVadis sustainability assessment. This was the first time that we completed the EcoVadis assessment and received a rating. This result places us in the top 8% of companies in the manufacture of other textiles industry rated by EcoVadis.We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. By the end of September there has not been any LTA‚Äôs at Suominen sites.We systematically measure our employee engagement by conducting our engagement survey  Suominen Vibe  every year. During the year we have used the results from the survey conducted last year to plan and execute development actions. Now it is again time to collect feedback and this year‚Äôs Vibe survey is now ongoing.We are continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the third quarter we continued our actions towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019.

This can impact Suominen‚Äôs financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen‚Äôs business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen‚Äôs business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers‚Äô or our own plants due to virus infections. Despite the inflation and supply chain challenges caused by the pandemic straining the whole nonwovens industry and its value chain  we have not experienced more payment delays than usual by our customers and hence we do not see that our customer credit risks would have materially increased.Suominen‚Äôs other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen‚Äôs nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing the raw material markets turning more favorable from the fourth quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen‚Äôs comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies. The statements also cover other central areas of corporate governance. The statements have been published on Suominen's website  separately from the Report of the Board of Directors  at www.suominen.fi.AUDIOCAST AND CONFERENCE CALLPetri Helsky  President & CEO  and Toni Tamminen  CFO  will present the result in English in an audiocast and a conference call for analyst  investors  and media on the same day at 11:00 a.m. (EEST).

ratios per share are either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen‚Äôs Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)=Profit for the period adjusted with interest on hybrid bond  net of tax Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury shares Diluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -5 054 18 197 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 510 358 58 019 324 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.09 0.32 0.36 Diluted -0.09 0.31 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -1 553 8 192 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR -0.03 0.14 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 165 188 159 682 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.87 2.77 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 480 727 57 624 558 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.64 4.41 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 151.7 254.1 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 9 800 783 15 570 116 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 425 760 57 601 008 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 17.1 27.0 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2022 or 2021.EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses Comparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Operating profit -3 969 23 067 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 14 253 14 984 20 092 EBITDA 10 284 38 051 47 033Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 410 122 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 6 971 13 894 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 7 380 14 016 17 771Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 741 149 286 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 753 2 143 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -84 664 -103 182 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 65 830 48 247 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 741 149 286 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 753 2 143 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 150 494 151 429 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %Return on equity (ROE)  % = Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) x 100 Total equity (quarterly average)EUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) -2 516 25 491 20 734 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2021 / 30.9.2020 / 31.12.2020 159 682 144 074 145 882 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.12.2021 / 31.12.2020 / 31.3.2021 163 199 145 882 152 227 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2022 / 31.3.2021 / 30.6.2021 153 504 152 227 159 386 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2022 / 30.6.2021 / 30.9.2021 158 098 159 386 159 682 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2022 / 30.9.2021 / 31.12.2021 165 188 159 682 163 199 Average 159 934 152 250 156 075 Return on equity (ROE)  % -1.6 16.7 13.3Invested capitalInvested capital = Total equity + interest-bearing liabilities - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 30.9.2022 30.9.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 165 188 159 682 163 199 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 741 149 286 149 134 Cash and cash equivalents -84 664 -103 182 -101 357 Invested capital 230 264 205 786 210 975The calculation formula for invested capital has been changed.

Organized as part of the Silicon Day Data  the Silicon Data Awards recognize the best data projects  solutions and innovations in the IT and tech world. These awards once again recognize Kalray‚Äôs unique technology  which also won an award at the Flash Memory Summit last August.Kalray's DPU: A New Type of Processor in the Spotlight""We are delighted to have won these awards  it is a recognition of our innovative technology but also of the whole project delivered by Kalray to revolutionize the way data will be processed and managed in the future. DPU processors are going to play a crucial role in tomorrow's industries and are attracting increasing interest. Processors designed for yesterday's needs  such as CPUs and GPUs  cannot always efficiently analyze the huge amounts of data generated by today's applications. Kalray's teams have developed a technology that can exploit the full potential of a world that now relies on massive and disparate data to be processed as quickly as possible: the MPPA¬Æ DPU""  explains Eric Baissus  Kalray CEO.With its patented 80-core architecture  Kalray's DPU processor manages multiple data streams in parallel and without bottlenecks. It enables applications exploiting massive amounts of data to be more intelligent  efficient and energy-saving. Kalray‚Äôs DPU is a low-power  high-performance programmable processor dedicated to data-intensive applications for fast-growing markets such as the data center  AI  edge computing  5G  automotive ...‚ÄúInnovation has been at the heart of VMware's DNA for more than twenty years. Through these Silicon Data Awards  I am delighted to see the dynamism of our ecosystem and the quality of the projects presented. The prizes awarded to Kalray recognize an innovative and unique technology through its DPU processor  and demonstrate the ability of our ecosystem to innovate in both hardware and software for more efficient data processing and management ‚Äù comments Marc Dollois  Vice-President and General Manager of VMware France and member of the Silicon Data Awards jury.Kalray  the Only Player in Europe to Offer a DPU ProcessorA spin-off from CEA Leti  one of the most advanced laboratories in the field of semiconductors  Kalray has developed a technological lead that enables it to offer a highly competitive alternative to the mainly American and Chinese players  and is the only player in Europe to offer this type of processor - an asset for the technological sovereignty of France and Europe.The company has already been selected by Cloud customers such as Clever Cloud in France and is collaborating with Dell Technologies  the world leader in storage  through a strategic partnership. The company is also involved in a number of European collaborative projects such as the European Initiative Processor (EPI)  PIRANA and 5G-OPERA projects around 5G. In a recent joint press release  Kalray  2CRSi  Clever Cloud and Vates also announced their collaboration to equip data centers with innovative and sovereign hardware: a project to develop solutions for Cloud and Edge data center infrastructures around Kalray's DPU processor and its partners' innovative virtualization and software technologies.Become a Major Player in Intelligent Data Processing and ManagementKalray aims to become a global leader in intelligent processing and data management. To this end  the company acquired Arcapix Holdings Ltd  a UK-based software company specializing in data storage and management solutions for computationally intensive applications  in March 2022.""Although the semiconductor industry is dominated by a handful of players the emergence of new uses and new technologies is reshuffling the deck. With each technological breakthrough  we have seen new players emerge who have subsequently become leaders in their field because they have been able to provide a technological response to new needs that existing solutions could not fully satisfy. I am convinced that Kalray's technology can help us do just that.With the acquisition of Arcapix  we can now also offer highly complementary software solutions to meet the evolving needs in the world of data-intensive storage and processing  and accelerate the time-to-market of our technology. This acquisition strengthens our position in the storage market and is perfectly in line with Kalray's development strategy and ambition  complementing our products  teams  expertise and markets  and eventually making Kalray a world leader in intelligent processing and data management""  concludes Eric Baissus.ABOUT KALRAYKalray (Euronext Growth Paris - ALKAL) is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies for high-performance  data-centric computing markets  from cloud to edge.

The partnership  which expands their long-standing collaboration in life sciences and healthcare  will leverage virtual twin experiences to enable agile and flexible operations that advance Sanofi‚Äôs ambition to secure its product portfolio.Sanofi will use Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô ‚ÄúMade to Cure for BioPharma‚Äù industry solution experience based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to design  implement  qualify and operate modular production lines at the two ‚ÄúEVolutive Facilities.‚Äù These will rely on single-use technology and mobile equipment to manufacture up to four products simultaneously and sustainably by selecting the most advanced technologies to reduce their energy consumption. The platform provides a virtual environment for collaborative innovation and end-to-end data management across the life cycle. Sanofi can experience the manufacturing systems under development and their operation virtually and optimize scale up and industrialization processes before deploying them.‚ÄúWe want to improve people‚Äôs lives by giving them faster access to vaccines and treatments while minimizing the environmental impacts of our activities ‚Äù said Ana Alves  EVolutive Facility Global Project Head & Site Head of Neuville sur Saone  Sanofi. ‚ÄúDassault Syst√®mes delivers the technology we need to accelerate the introduction of new products in the facility by supporting the collaborative works of our teams and by strengthening the standardization of designs and models. It will also bring capabilities to reach our objective to produce several products in the EVF in an optimized schedule  thanks to the digital twin. Then  the 3DEXPERIENCE platform will help us to address the complexity of the product lifecycle management in a highly regulated environment and for the benefit of our patients.‚ÄùPharmaceutical manufacturers must qualify facilities  equipment and processes before production to ensure safety and quality. This can take weeks or months depending on the equipment configurations and process parameters for different product recipes. Virtual twins enable manufacturers to standardize modules  reduce this timeframe  and boost their ability to quickly and massively produce crucial therapies.With a virtual twin  Sanofi can visualize and simulate the recipe  equipment and consumables that a particular process requires  as well as the flow and activity of the modules and operators in the ‚Äúballroom‚Äù ‚Äì a flexible and adaptable area that enables manufacturers to quickly switch between processes. Sanofi can add  remove and replace functional elements and process steps as needed in a seamless way  and reconfigure the production lines for a fast changeover from one product to another one. It can also accelerate the main activities of the life cycle of new modules  processes and facilities more quickly and catalog them into its product life cycle management for reuse and faster product changeover.‚ÄúThe pandemic made it clear: BioPharmas must be able to maximize efficiency and quickly provide high-quality  innovative therapeutics to patients worldwide ‚Äù said Claire Biot  Vice President  Life Sciences & Healthcare Industry  Dassault Syst√®mes. ‚ÄúSanofi is responding to this challenge with next generation modular manufacturing that can transform the speed at which products reach patients. Thanks to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform  Sanofi will implement new products right the first time  with faster production ramp-ups and concurrent process production for built-in flexibility. Ergonomics on the shop floor can be simulated and improved.‚Äù###FOR MORE INFORMATIONSanofi‚Äôs ‚ÄúEVolutive Facilities‚Äù in France and Singapore: https://www.sanofi.com/en/your-health/vaccines/productionDassault Syst√®mes‚Äô industry solution experiences for the Life Science & Healthcare Industry: https://ifwe.3ds.com/life-sciences-and-healthcare-solutionsDassault Syst√®mes‚Äô 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comSHARE THIS ON TWITTERNew partnership between @sanofi @Dassault3DS aims to optimize production at Sanofi‚Äôs future facilities in France and Singapore #3DEXPERIENCEABOUT DASSAULT SYST√àMESDassault Syst√®mes  the 3DEXPERIENCE Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

The Company has a well-established operation in South Africa with a proven history of supplying rough diamonds to the world market. Diamcor has established a long-term strategic alliance with world famous luxury retailer Tiffany & Co. and is now in the final stages of developing the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project co-located with De Beer's flagship Venetia mine.Story continuesAbout the Tiffany & Co. AllianceThe Company has established a long-term strategic alliance and first right of refusal with Tiffany & Co. Canada  a subsidiary of world famous New York based Tiffany & Co.  to purchase up to 100% of the future production of rough diamonds from the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project at then current prices to be determined by the parties on an ongoing basis. In conjunction with this first right of refusal  Tiffany & Co. Canada also provided the Company with financing to advance the Project. Tiffany & Co. is owned by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH)  a publicly traded company which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange (Euronext) under the symbol LVMH and on the OTC under the symbol LVMHF. For additional information on Tiffany & Co.  please visit their website at www.tiffany.com.About Krone-Endora at VenetiaIn February 2011  Diamcor acquired the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project from De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited  consisting of the prospecting rights over the farms Krone 104 and Endora 66  which represent a combined surface area of approximately 5 888 hectares directly adjacent to De Beers' flagship Venetia Diamond Mine in South Africa. On September 11  2014  the Company announced that the South African Department of Mineral Resources had granted a Mining Right for the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project encompassing 657.71 hectares of the Project's total area of 5 888 hectares. The Company has also submitted an application for a mining right over the remaining areas of the Project. The deposits which occur on the properties of Krone and Endora have been identified as a higher-grade ""Alluvial"" basal deposit which is covered by a lower-grade upper ""Eluvial"" deposit. The deposits are proposed to be the result of the direct-shift (in respect to the ""Eluvial"" deposit) and erosion (in respect to the ""Alluvial"" deposit) of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia Kimberlite areas. The deposits on Krone-Endora occur in two layers with a maximum total depth of approximately 15.0 metres from surface to bedrock  allowing for a very low-cost mining operation to be employed with the potential for near-term diamond production from a known high-quality source. Krone-Endora also benefits from the significant development of infrastructure and services already in place due to its location directly adjacent to the Venetia Mine.Qualified Person Statement:Mr. James P.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the Underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1‚Ç¨= AVERAGE RATE FY 2022 AVERAGE RATE FY 2021 AVERAGE RATE FY 2022VS.

This record performance was the result of an improvement in almost all regions  and particularly in North America. In France  difficult inflation negotiations  particularly in public sector Schools led to some contract exits.new sales development was up +150 bps at 7.5%  with a solid contribution from all segments. Total development  including cross-selling  was 1.5 billion euros.As a result  the net new business signed during the year was more than 300 million euros.

Growth slowed progressively during the year. This was due to a higher comparative base each quarter as the Covid recovery had come through earlier in Europe  as well as the end of the Testing Centers in the UK from the end of March.Asia-Pacific  Latin America  Middle East and Africa (18% of On-site Services revenues) ended the year up +11.5%  with strong post-Covid recovery in India and solid demand and new business in Energy & Resources  in particular in the mining sector in Latin America. The impact of the multiple lockdowns in China was relatively limited as activity tended to be higher on industrial sites partially compensating the effect of the closure of tertiary offices.

The trend in the last two months of the year confirms our WFH estimates made in 2020  even though we are convinced that there is still further improvement to come.Organic growth in North America was +45.1%  with a progressive return to the office quarter on quarter and a strong recovery in all the Sports & Leisure activities  firstly in the stadiums and then in the convention centers. The Government & Agencies and Energy & Resources segments were both up thanks to new business and a gradual return of office workers on-site  neither having been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Although slower than in other regions  the return to the office gathered pace during the year. Many clients chose to enhance their on-site food services to attract their staff back into the office. The new food offers  providing more flexible  more healthy and sustainable meals grew significantly.In Europe  revenues were up +20.3% organically  driven by the progressive return to the office  strong recovery in the Sports & Leisure activities  first in the sporting events  and then in corporate entertaining and tourism in the second half.

The margin came out at 4.6% up +170 bps or +160 bps excluding currencies  helped by the strong dollar particularly in Healthcare and Education where the weight of North American revenues is the highest. The performance by segment at constant rates is as follows:Business & Administrations Underlying operating profit was multiplied by nearly four times  up +263.7%. As a result  the margin was up +230 bps to 3.5%. This improved performance reflects the flow-through of the significant improvement in the activity levels in Corporate Services and Sports & Leisure  operational efficiencies and strong price increases and mitigation to offset inflation.Underlying operating profit was multiplied by nearly four times  up +263.7%.

In Education  Underlying operating profit was up +144.5% and the margin up +250 bps to 5.0% thanks to the flow-through of the revenue recovery  particularly in North America. High inflation and staff shortages have been offset by very significant mitigation efforts on the ground  as well as pricing in North America. Pricing has been more difficult in France where the national inflation index used in the Schools contracts has underperformed our input cost increases.Benefits & Rewards Services Underlying operating profit was up +33.2%  or +30.5% excluding the positive impact of currencies. The margin increased to 28.6% up +360 bps or +370 bps excluding currencies  helped by the strong acceleration in volumes and  in particular  the financial revenues from quarter to quarter throughout the year. While processing costs have remained stable relative to revenues  all other cost increases have been contained.The GET efficiency program has provided a significant improvement in profitability in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022. Half of the initiatives were aimed at protecting the gross profit margin by adapting on-site costs to the new post-Covid levels of activity and to compensate for the end of government aid. The other half of the program was aimed at structurally reducing SG&A for the long-term by simplifying the structures in the Group  to free up capacity to invest in growth and to enhance margins.Fiscal 2022 results benefited from the final tranche of cost savings of 164 million euros  of which 98 million euros in cost avoidance and 66 million euros in SG&A.

This significant reduction is due to the end of the GET program  with only 10 million euros of restructuring costs  a spill-over from Fiscal 2021  compared to 153 million euros in the previous year  and 117 million euros of gains related to the disposals program.As a result  the Operating Profit recovered to 1 054 million euros compared to 339 million euros in the previous year.(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 1 059 578 Net scope change impacts 50 (32) Restructuring and rationalization costs (10) (153) Amortization of purchased intangible assets (46) (33) Other 1 (21) Other Operating income and expenses (5) (239) OPERATING PROFIT 1 054 339Fiscal 2022 Net financial expenses decreased to 87 million euros against 106 million euros in the previous year. The reduction came from the net effect of the debt reimbursements and issuance in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022  an increase in interest income related to higher levels of activity and some positive currency impacts. The blended cost of debt at Fiscal 2022 year end was stable at 1.6% relative to year end Fiscal 2021.The tax charge was up significantly to 264 million euros  reflecting the higher pre-tax profit. However  the Effective tax rate on Pre-tax profit (excluding the share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method) of 960 million euros was 27.5%  back down to a more normal rate  against 43.9% last year.The share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method was stable at 8 million euros. Profit attributed to non-controlling interests was 9 million euros compared to the previous year amount of -2 million euros.As a result  Group net income was multiplied by five to reach 695 million euros  compared to 139 million euros in Fiscal 2021. Underlying net profit adjusted for Other operating income and expenses net of tax doubled to reach 699 million euros  compared to 346 million euros in Fiscal 2021.1.6 Earnings per sharePublished EPS was 4.75 euros against 0.95 euro in Fiscal 2021. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2022 was more or less stable at 146 295 576 compared to 146 004 484 shares for Fiscal 2021. As a result of much lower Other income and expenses  Underlying EPS was very close to the published number  amounting to 4.78 euros  double the previous year.1.7 Proposed dividendThe Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of 2.40‚Ç¨  up +20% compared to Fiscal 2021  in line with our policy of a pay-out ratio of 50% of Underlying net profit.2 Consolidated financial position2.1 Cash flowsCash flows for the period were as follows:(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 Operating cash flow 1 243 766 Change in working capital excluding change in BRS financial assets(1) (63) 171 IFRS 16 outflow (208) (242) Net capital expenditure (341) (211) Free cash flow(2) 631 483 Net acquisitions 14 (42) Share buy-backs (13) (11) Dividends paid to shareholders (294) ‚Äî Other changes (including scope and exchange rates) (128) (40) (Increase)/decrease in net debt 210 390(1) Excluding change in financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity of -145 million euros in Fiscal 2022versus 45 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Total change in working capital as reported in consolidated accounts:in Fiscal 2022: -208 million euros = -63 million euros - 145 million eurosand in Fiscal 2021: 216 million euros = 171 million euros + 45 million euros.(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group‚Äôs performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable).To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).Free cash flow  adjusted for IFRS 16  was 631 million euros against 483 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Operating cash flow of 1 243 million euros improved significantly compared to the previous year at 766 million euros  boosted by the strong recovery in Underlying operating profit and by the Benefits & Rewards Services indemnity from the Hungarian government related to closure of the business for 34 million euros.The Working capital outflow in Fiscal 2022 of 63 million euros was due to some significant exceptional items such as restructuring costs  a cash contribution to the UK pension found for 71 million euros  the unwinding of government Covid-linked payment delays for 117 million euros  the reimbursement of the Tokyo Olympics hospitality packages for 55 million euros and the Benefits & Rewards fine related to the dispute with the French competition authorities which is being paid monthly.Net capital expenditure  including client investments  increased to 341 million euros  and 1.6% of revenues  compared to 211 million euros in the preceding year  at 1.2% of revenues.

The Business & Administrations gross capital expenditure to revenues ratio was at 1.3%  nearly double last year  linked to the recovery in Sports & Leisure activity. Healthcare was also at 1.5%  the highest level in many years  due to some significant investments in several hospitals in North America and Continental Europe. On the other hand  in Education  capex to sales was down -60 bps this year at 2.7% of revenues even though the euro amount remained stable.Cash conversion was 91%  below the normal level of 100%  but including 363 million euros of negative non-recurring elements.M&A activity restarted in Fiscal 2022 with acquisition spend of 70 million euros but was more than offset by disposals of 84 million euros.After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt decreased by 210 million euros ending the year to 1 268 million euros at August 31  2022.2.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFiscal 2022 has been an active year for closing numerous disposals of non-core activities and geographies:the On-site Services activities in Morocco  the Congo and Russia;Lido in France;Non-strategic account portfolios in Australia and the Czech Republic;Benefits & Rewards activities in Russia in December 2021  followed by the On-site activities in the second half;Benefits & Rewards sports cards in Germany  Romania and Spain;The Childcare activities  completed mid-March.On the other hand  further strategic acquisitions & investments have also been made:In the Advanced Food Model  Sodexo has acquired Frontline Food Services and VendEdge in North America and an off-site production unit in China.

Orange selected Edgecore switches to deliver cutting-edge connectivity solutions for Orange‚Äôs hundreds of access Points of Presence (PoP). These locations provide 1G  10G  and 100G access services to enterprise customers. The chosen switches have a robust  high-performance design that offers the high-availability features required for telecom network PoP deployment. The disaggregated Edgecore hardware platform comes pre-loaded with the ONIE (Open Network Install Environment) software installer for the automated loading of compatible open source or commercial network operating system offerings. Orange is installing its own SONiC distribution to run on the switches. Orange relies on its developers‚Äô expertise working in conjunction with Edgecore and the SONiC community  to which Orange actively contributes  to develop their own networking software solutions.Orange‚Äôs move towards disaggregation allows for more flexible and cost-effective designs  faster deployments with a simpler IT integration  and the ability to utilize a single operating system on networking equipment from different hardware vendors. This change also helps improve Orange‚Äôs network procurement lead times.Heimdall Siao  President of Edgecore said  ‚ÄúAs the leader in disaggregated open networking solutions  Edgecore is excited to be involved in this disaggregated and community SONiC networking project with Orange in a telecom use case. Edgecore‚Äôs switches running SONiC software provide the high-capacity throughput required for access networks. And  by utilizing Edgecore‚Äôs carrier grade and proven robust designs  Orange is able to deploy solutions in the most demanding of carrier networks. This successful experience in Orange‚Äôs network proves that disaggregated open networking solutions are robust and capable of handling the most demanding of network environments.‚ÄùJean Luc Vuillemin  Executive Vice President of Orange International Networks  said  ‚ÄúWe are pleased to team up with Edgecore to launch our network disaggregation transformation. This joint work enables us to drastically transform the way we build and upgrade our networks. It allows us to move away from off the shelf and locked-in solutions to in-house developed solutions relying on our network developers‚Äô expertise. Upskilling our teams to master our software allows us to regain full control of our networks and therefore manage upgrades in a fast  cost-effective and sovereign way  while providing an improved and reliable service to our customers.‚ÄùThe adoption of open  disaggregated architecture by Orange represents a bold step and is a decision that helps advance the Telecom Infra Project‚Äôs (TIP) goal of accelerating the pace of innovation in the telecom industry.

The company's installed capacity increased to 14.3 GW (10% interannual gain). EDPR has already managed to hit 40% of the 20 GW target set for its installed capacity for 2021-2025 via ‚Ä¶,Houston  Texas  Oct. 26  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR)  the world‚Äôs fourth largest producer of wind and solar energy  has reported its end-of-third-quarter results  carrying on showing solid growth owing to its larger installed capacity  greater strengthening of renewable resources and average sales price recovery. The result of all of this is an EBITDA of 1.482 billion euros and a net profit of 416 million euros.EDPR is well and truly on target with its ambitious growth plan owing to its record 4 GW renewable energy capacity under construction in 15 markets around the world  likewise  providing the company with broader technological diversification. In parallel to all of this  gross investments in the amount of 4.4 billion euros have enabled EDPR to increase its international presence across 28 different national markets via acquisitions such as that of Sunseap. Additionally  EPPR has been able to carry on generating value via its asset rotation program  closing three transactions in Spain  Poland  and Italy  which have contributed to the creation of 264 million in profit.Operating results are also posting growth due to the increased installed capacity and strengthening of renewable energy products. This installed capacity of up to 14.3 GW has led to stable operating performances. Of note  EDPR has  as of the date of this press release  managed to hit 10.8 GW of the additional 20 GW goal set for the 2021-2025 period (so 55% achieved)  with over 40% of this goal either already installed or under construction. Furthermore  the company carried out its asset rotation ahead of schedule  with 3.4 billion euros of the 8-billion-euro income goal already achieved via agreements generating twice the per MW value compared to what was set out in the Business Plan.In the words of Miguel Stilwell d‚ÄôAndrade  CEO of EDP: ‚ÄúEDPR is in a very strong position to deal with all the challenges presented by the energy transition  and we have already achieved 55% of the renewables capacity we set out to develop for the 2021 to 2025 horizon. During the first nine months of this year and even given the bumpy business context the energy sector finds itself in we were able to invest over 4 billion euros in renewable energy projects‚Äù.Financial resultsFor the first nine months of 2022 EDPR‚Äôs EBITDA increased to 1.482 billion euros (a 62% interannual gain) due to solid business line results underpinned by a 10% gain in installed capacity and a 14% gain in renewable energy generation.Elsewhere on the balance sheet operating income increased to 331 million euros (a 129 million interannual gain)  which was mainly derived from asset rotation transactions closed in Poland  Spain  and Italy.Lastly  net profit increased to 416 million euros (a 181% interannual gain)  which was partially offset by higher net financial costs  which went up in the amount of 296 million euros (up 58% interannually) due to increased debt  the foreign exchange rate  and the cost of debt.EDPR is as committed as it has ever been to its Business Plan as well as leading the energy transition in those markets where they maintain a presence.About EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA)EDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)  its affiliates  and its subsidiaries develop  construct  own  and operate wind farms and solar parks throughout North America.

The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -8pp vs. 2021 YTD.In EMEA (Europe excluding France and Middle East)  SMCP delivered an excellent performance with 9-month sales of ‚Ç¨272m  +38% on an organic basis vs 2021 of which +51% like-for-like  coming from brick-and-mortar and digital retail (own websites and e-partners). Third quarter sales were up +20% on an organic basis benefiting  as in France  from success with both local customers and tourists in most European countries. The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -5pp vs. 2021 YTD.In APAC  9-month sales (‚Ç¨176m) were down -13% on a reported basis and -20% on an organic basis vs 2021. Performance continued to be impacted by Covid resurgences in Mainland China with sporadic store closures and reduced footfall. However  the APAC trend is of gradual improvement and the gap vs 2021 reduced significantly in Q3 compared to H1 (-12% organic vs Q3 2021). APAC excluding China delivered a good progression vs 2021 in Q3  supported by the strong performances of Korea  Singapore  Malaysia and Australia.In North America  despite a high comparison basis  SMCP delivered a strong performance with 9-month sales of ‚Ç¨132m  +36% on a reported basis and +22% on an organic basis vs 2021 (LFL progressing double-digits: +23% in a nearly stable network). The third quarter trend (+30% on a reported basis and +12% on an organic basis vs 2021) is close to the Q2 trend  sustained by both B&M and Digital. All markets (USA  Canada and Mexico) recorded an excellent momentum. The reduction of discount rate continued and reached -8pp vs. 2021 YTD.Q3 HIGHLIGHTSDuring the third quarter  SMCP intensified its CSR commitments. For example  the number of traceable references in the Fall-Winter collection now exceeds 100 per brand. Initiatives in favor of the circular economy are increasing  including in particular the gradual deployment of second-hand products  which will be extended to other countries in the coming months.The Group has made several targeted openings in its key markets  and the third quarter saw the opening of a major flagship store for Sandro on the mythical Champs-Elys√©es Avenue. More generally  SMCP is pursuing its strategy of qualitative and selective network development: opening and renovation of Fursac stores in Europe  new physical and digital points of sale in Asia for Sandro  Maje and Claudie Pierlot  and strengthening of strategic retail partners networks (e.g. in the Middle East).Finally  each brand continued to develop the desirability of its collections and communications: the Believe campaign for Sandro and Taylor Hill for Maje  the reaffirmation of the Parisian style for Claudie Pierlot through iconic pieces in the Fall-Winter collection and communication campaign  and artistic and know-how-based collaborations for Fursac.CONCLUSIONThanks to the desirability of its brands and the attractiveness of its collections  Group sales benefited from a strong momentum across all geographies except Mainland China  due to Covid-related restrictions.All brands of the portfolio contributed to the growth  enabling SMCP to book a record level of sales  despite an unprecedented level of macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainty.PERSPECTIVESIn the fourth quarter 2022  the Group will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of the economic  geopolitical  health and social context.Based on the strong performance on a 9-month basis and provided the international situation does not deteriorate further during the rest of the year  SMCP confirms its 2022 full-year financial guidance.A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.APPENDICESBreakdown of DOSNumber of DOS Q3-21 2021 H1-22 Q3-22 Var Q3 22vs. H1 22 Var Q3 22 vs. FY 21 Var Q3 22 vs. Q3 21 By region France 474 472 462 455 -7 -17 -19 EMEA 404 402 394 392 -2 -10 -12 Americas 168 166 167 167 - +1 -1 APAC 250 252 251 258 +7 +6 +8 By brand Sandro 552 552 546 547 +1 -5 -5 Maje 456 455 453 453 - -2 -3 Claudie Pierlot 211 211 206 203 -3 -8 -8 Suite 341 11 10 2 2 - -8 -9 Fursac 66 64 67 67 - +3 +1 Total DOS 1 296 1 292 1 274 1 272 -2 -20 -24Breakdown of POSNumber of POS Q3-21 2021 H1-22 Q3-22 Var Q3 22vs. H1 22 Var Q3 22 vs. FY 21 Var Q3 22 vs. Q3 21 By region France 475 473 463 456 -7 -17 -19 EMEA 551 548 542 544 +2 -4 +7 Americas 197 195 195 198 +3 +3 +1 APAC 461 468 470 472 +2 +4 +11 By brand Sandro 743 745 742 745 +3 - +2 Maje 618 620 620 620 - - +2 Claudie Pierlot 246 245 239 236 -3 -9 -10 Suite 341 11 10 2 2 - -8 -9 Fursac 66 64 67 67 - +3 +1 Total POS 1 684 1 684 1 670 1 670 - -14 -14 o/w Partners POS 388 392 396 398 +2 +6 +10FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSNumber of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group‚Äôs points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year.

Based on this robust performance  we confirm our full-year objectives  with revenue growth now expected in the upper half of the previously indicated range. In the meantime  we achieved important milestones in Q3 towards the envisioned separation. We finalized a ‚Ç¨2.7 billion financing providing the means to execute our transformation until separation while ensuring the Group‚Äôs liquidity. We launched the works councils consultation process and made tangible progress in carve-out preparation workstreams. The separation project is well on track to be completed in H2 2023 as initially planned. Atos is resolutely pursuing its in-depth transformation: the whole organization is mobilized and committed to the successful execution of our strategic plan  which we are convinced will create significant value for all Atos‚Äô stakeholders.‚ÄùIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change Change at constant currency Evidian Perimeter revenue 1 278 1 191 +7.3% +2.1% Tech Foundations perimeter revenue 1 540 1 475 +4.4% +0.3% Group revenue 2 818 2 666 +5.7% +1.1%Revenue growth at constant currency turning positive in Q3Group revenue was ‚Ç¨2 818 million in Q3 2022  up +5.7% year-on-year. Growth at constant currency turned positive in Q3  at +1.1%  while organic growth stabilized  at -0.1%  showing a strong sequential improvement compared to previous quarters (-1.9% in Q2 and -2.4% in Q1). This positive momentum reflects the continued improvement in operational performance brought by the Group‚Äôs new organization and management team. Acquisitions contributed +1.2% to the Group‚Äôs revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed +4.6%  mainly reflecting the appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro over the period.Evidian‚Äôs revenue was up +2.1% at constant currency in Q3. Digital recorded a solid growth  driven by buoyant trends on digital transformation markets  as well as by the contribution from recent acquisitions. Q3 activity was supported by a good level of fertilization of existing customers. Cybersecurity continued to benefit from market leadership and strong customer demand. Revenue growth was affected by Advanced Computing  with a low level of HPC revenue  expected to ramp up from Q4 onwards based on the very high order entry recorded in Q2.Tech Foundations‚Äô revenue stabilized in Q3  at +0.3% at constant currency (+0.5% excluding UCC). This positive top line momentum is a clear sign of an earlier-than-anticipated improvement of the business line‚Äôs performance  resulting from renewed management focus under the Group‚Äôs new organization and strategic project. The core infrastructure business reported a much more contained decline than in 2021  while professional services grew strongly. Digital workplace services and UCC recorded a slight contraction due to persisting supply chain tensions.Significant progress achieved in separation projectThe Group is making significant progress in its separation project and confirms that it is well on track to complete it within the previously announced 12 to 18 months timeline1.The Group successfully signed a new ‚Ç¨2.7 billion bank debt financing on July 29  2022  ensuring the interim period leading to the envisioned separation is fully financed. The syndication of this new debt package was finalized in a short timeframe and received very strong support from the Group's historical lenders. This unsecured debt package includes a ‚Ç¨1.5 billion term loan with very satisfactory tenure and pricing conditions  a ‚Ç¨0.9bn revolving credit facility supporting the Group‚Äôs liquidity  and a ‚Ç¨0.3 billion bridge loan to be repaid out of the expected proceeds from the Group‚Äôs non-core businesses disposal program. Financial covenant was reset to 3.75x net debt to OMDA2  tested at year-end.On September 7  2022  the information and consultation process of Atos European works council (SEC)  regarding the Group‚Äôs envisioned separation into two listed entities  was launched in line with the project timetable. In parallel  social dialogue has also started at country level.All separation workstreams are mobilized and progressing according to plan  across four pillars: (i) go-to-market and commercial continuity  (ii) carve-out operations covering tax and legal structuring  strategic agreements and preparation of carve-out financial statements  as well as Day-1 operational readiness  (iii) operating model and support functions set-up and (iv) program coordination.Atos is convinced that this project is the most value-creating for all its stakeholders. Evidian will emerge as a global digital pure player fully focused on growing markets and combining a unique set of highly synergistic areas of expertise. Tech Foundations‚Äô turnaround is already underway and showing encouraging signs of earlier-than-anticipated recovery. Once turned-around  Tech Foundations will take a fresh start as an end-to-end orchestrator of digital infrastructure  leveraging its core operations to deliver solid margins and cash generation.Moving ahead with disposal programOn June 14  2022  Atos announced a disposal program of non-core businesses representing ‚Ç¨700 million of expected proceeds  as part of the financing of its transformation plan. On the same day  the Group completed the sale of its remaining 2.5% stake in Worldline  for net proceeds of c. ‚Ç¨220 million. The remaining ‚Ç¨480 million expected proceeds pertain to the disposal of non-core businesses mostly within the Evidian perimeter.This disposal program is progressing as planned  with several disposal processes currently ongoing  including 2 small-sized transactions already signed  indicating market interest for the businesses selected by Atos as part of its disposal program  as well as the Group‚Äôs ability to execute swiftly  only four months after the disposal program was set up.CSR: outstanding external recognitionIn September 2022  for the third year in a row  Atos was awarded the EcoVadis Platinum Award for its Corporate Social Responsibility performance  with the highest score ever received by the Group  at 84 points out of 100. Atos therefore confirms its position in the top 1% companies assessed by EcoVadis within its sector.In October 2022  Atos was upgraded to the highest rating available (the AAA rating) in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) ESG rating 2022  ranking it among the top 7% of companies in the ‚ÄúSoftware and Service‚Äù industry with a good performance in Sustainability measured through the Environmental  Social and Governance dimensions. MSCI highlighted Atos‚Äô leadership in clean technology initiatives  as well as the Group‚Äôs strengthened governance. Since the beginning of the year  Atos‚Äô Board of directors has welcomed five new members: Ren√© Proglio  Astrid Stange  Elizabeth Tinkham  Caroline Ruellan and Katrina Hopkins  who collectively bring a wealth of experience in digital  finance  human resources and corporate governance.Commercial activityOrder entry was ‚Ç¨ 2.0 billion in Q3 2022  representing a book-to-bill ratio of 71%.For the Evidian perimeter  the book-to-bill ratio was 85%  impacted by fluctuations in the HPC deal flow  following a very high order intake in Q2  as well as a lower number of large application management services contracts.On the Tech Foundations perimeter  the book-to-bill ratio was 58%  while Tech Foundations is in the process of gradually re-building a strong commercial pipeline and enhancing its sales capabilities. However  positive evolutions were noted in Q3  with a significant increase in order entry from new logos  and the benefits from a higher contract selectivity.Book-to-bill ratio is expected to recover significantly across both perimeters in Q4.At the end of September 2022  the Group‚Äôs full backlog reached ‚Ç¨ 21.8 billion  down ‚Ç¨0.8 billion compared to the end of June 2022. It represented 1.9 year of revenue.The full qualified pipeline amounted to ‚Ç¨ 7.1 billion at the end of September 2022  stable compared to the end of June 2022  representing 7.5 months of revenue.Human resourcesTotal headcount was 112 344 at the end of September 2022  broadly stable compared to the end of June 2022 (112 180).In Q3 2022  Atos hired 8 367 new employees (gross)  of which 64% are located in offshore and nearshore countries.In September 2022  Atos was listed for the first time by Great Place to Work¬Æ as one of ‚ÄòEurope‚Äôs Best Workplaces‚Äô in the 2022 annual list. It is ranked 21st position in the multinational company category.2022 full-year objectives confirmed and refinedBased on its robust Q3 performance  Atos refines its revenue growth objective for the full year  while operating margin and free cash flow objectives are unchanged. For the full year  the Group expects:Revenue growth at constant currency in the upper half of the -0.5% to +1.5% range;Operating margin at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range;Free cash flow at the lower end of the ‚Ç¨-150 million to ‚Ç¨200 million range excluding additional impacts of the envisioned transformation plan. Such additional impacts are estimated around ‚Ç¨-250 million  including the cost of financing  in line with information communicated at Atos Capital Markets Day in June.Marks of interest receivedAs indicated on September 29  2022  Atos received  on September 27  an unsolicited letter of intent from Onepoint  in association with private equity firm ICG  related to the potential acquisition of the Evidian perimeter  for an indicative enterprise value of ‚Ç¨4.2 billion. Following the thorough examination of this preliminary and non-binding mark of interest  and upon the recommendation of its ad hoc committee  the Board of Directors convened and unanimously concluded that it was not in the interest of the Company and its stakeholders  and therefore decided not to proceed.In addition  as indicated on October 24  2022  since the presentation of its separation project at the CMD on June 14  Atos has been approached by several players interested in the Tech Foundations business. The Board of Directors reiterates that it is its duty to examine all marks of interest  and it will do so for the Tech Foundations business with regard to the Company‚Äôs corporate interest and value creation for its stakeholders.Atos is fully mobilized on the progress of the separation project within the planned timetable  which remains the Group's priority.Analyst and investor conference callAtos Management invites analysts and investors to a conference call on the Group 2022 third quarter revenue  on Wednesday  October 26  2022  at 08:00 am (CET ‚Äì Paris).You can join the webcast of the conference:via the following link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/nh2xut9fby telephone with the dial-in  10 minutes prior the starting time.

A robust growth in Digital  in particular with a new logo in decarbonization  as well as in BDS  was mitigated by a decrease in Tech Foundations activities.Northern Europe & APAC revenue grew by +2.6% at constant currency. In addition to the contribution of Cloudreach  Digital activities were driven by strong demand in application services  in particular from the public sector. Tech Foundations activities continued to improve  while BDS was impacted by fluctuations in the Advanced Computing business.Central Europe revenue decreased by -1.2% at constant currency  as growth in digital applications  particularly in public sector  TMT and energy  and cybersecurity was offset by a decline in Tech Foundations‚Äô activities  partly driven by the UCC business  and by lower hardware and software resale.Southern Europe revenue decreased by -2.2% at constant currency primarily due to lower HPC sales  coming from a very high level in FY21  and to the continued deliberate decline of hardware and software resale. Digital activities benefitted from a good momentum in applications and public cloud services  while Tech Foundations activities were slightly up  driven by professional services.Others and global structures encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group‚Äôs global delivery centers and global structures. Revenue grew strongly  by +12.4% at constant currency  supported by the acquisition of Ipsotek in 2021  as well as a good performance in Africa and in Turkey.Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates reconciliationIn ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 % change Statutory revenue 2 818 2 666 +5.7% Exchange rates effect 122 Revenue at constant exchange rates 2 818 2 788 +1.1% Scope effect 31 Exchange rates effect on acquired/disposed perimeters 3 Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates 2 818 2 821 -0.1%Currency exchange rates effects positively contributed to revenue growth for ‚Ç¨+122 million.

Growth in Benefits & Rewards Services accelerated and On-site Services margins improved  despite the inflationary backdrop. Net new business was strong  and retention was at an all-time high. Our balance sheet has also been strengthened significantly.Good progress has been made on the priorities I set out at the beginning of the year: North America generated strong growth  improved profitability and its retention and development improved significantly. We accelerated the transformation of our food models through several organic and external investments while also actively managing our portfolio of activities. The transfer of P&L responsibility to regions and countries  fully effective from October 1  2022  will simplify the organization.Story continuesI warmly thank our teams for their impressive engagement and performance in the field with our clients and our suppliers in these challenging times.We expect that our financial performance will return to Fiscal 2019 levels this year. I am confident that for Fiscal 2023  we can achieve +8 to +10% organic growth and a margin close to 5.5%.‚ÄùHighlights of Fiscal 2022Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenues reached 21.1 billion euros  up +21.2% year-on-year  driven by organic growth of +16.9%  a net contribution from acquisitions and disposals of -1.2% and a strong positive currency impact of +5.5%.On-site Services organic revenue growth was up +17.0%. The recovery continued sequentially throughout the year  leading to a return to 99% of Fiscal 2019 level in the fourth quarter  with Business & Administrations back to over 100%.The key elements of the year were: In Business & Administrations   organic growth was +22.7% . This was driven by ongoing growth in Energy & Resources and Government & Agencies  the recovery of Sports & Leisure in the second half as events and conventions picked up strongly and Corporate Services benefiting from a solid return to the office. The trend in the last two months of the year was in line with our Work from Home estimates made in 2020 and we anticipate further improvement. In Healthcare & Seniors   organic growth was +4.0%. Our performance was driven by pricing  cross-selling and the progressive recovery of hospital retail sales and Seniors‚Äô occupancy. This was partially offset by the early closure of the Testing centers in the UK at the end of March. In Education   organic growth was +22.0%  following the strong post-Covid recovery in activity in Universities and Schools in North America  China and India.Significant improvement in key performance indicators: Client retention rate was 94.5%  +140 bps higher than the previous year. This record performance was the result of an improvement in almost all regions  especially in North America. In France  difficult inflation negotiations  particularly in public sector Schools  led to some contract exits.New sales development was up +150 bps at 7.5%  with a solid contribution from all segments. Total development  including cross-selling  was 1.5 billion euros. The year ended strongly with the win of the Ardent healthcare services contract to supply patient and staff dining  nutrition counselling  retail and environmental services (incl. Protecta ¬Æ ) to 50 locations across six States  employing 1 500 Sodexo employees.As a result  the net new business signed during the year was positive for the first time in several years.Benefits & Rewards Services delivered organic growth of +14.2%. Employee benefits organic growth was +18.7% and accelerated sequentially through the year  reaching +23.1% in the fourth quarter. Issue volume increased +16.2%  boosted by strong net new business leveraging digital products and enhanced sales efficiency  as well as face value increases. Financial revenues were also up strongly supported by rising interest rates  particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe.Underlying operating profit was 1 059 million euros  up +83.3%.Underlying operating margin was 5.0%  up +170 bps. This significant improvement was a result of the strong recovery in volumes  the benefit of the GET efficiency program  and effective actions to mitigate inflation through indexation  contract renegotiations and productivity. The improvement was across both On-Site  up +160 bps to 4.6%  and Benefits & Rewards up +370 bps to 28.6%.Other operating expenses (net) amounted to 5 million euros in Fiscal 2022  compared to 239 million euros in the previous year. Restructuring costs fell to 10 million euros and gains on the sale of assets more than off-set losses.The Effective tax rate returned to a more normal level of 27.5% compared to 43.9% in the previous year.Net income Group share multiplied by five to reach 695 million euros  versus 139 million euros in Fiscal 2021.

Cash conversion was 91%  below the normal level of 100%  but including 363 million euros of negative non-recurring elements.Net debt reduced to 1.3 billion euros from 1.5 billion euros at end Fiscal 2021. Gearing 2 fell to 28.7% and the net debt ratio 2 fell to 1.0x compared to 1.7x at the end of Fiscal 2021. Our debt ratios have now returned to the bottom end of our target range.In Fiscal 2022  further progress has been made towards our 2025 CSR objectives . In particular  The business value benefiting SMEs rose +13% to 7.8 billion euros; we are well on track to reach the 10 billion euros target for 2025.Food waste reduction was -41.5% lower. While the reduction is lower than in Fiscal 2021  this indicator is now managed and measured across 1 873 sites compared to 878 last year. The Group remains on track to reduce food waste by 50% on 85% 3 of our sites by 2025.As a people company  Lost time incident rate (LTIR) is an important indicator which we monitor closely. In Fiscal 2022  the LTIR reached 0.65  down by -8.5% year-on-year.Progress on our Strategic priorities: Boost US growth : We delivered a strong improvement in operational execution and sales development in North AmericaImproved retention to over 96%  up +400 basis points  our best performance in 10 years Improved development by +400 basis points Strong Cross-selling Increased first-time outsourcing contracts: 44% of signatures in Fiscal 2022Accelerate the food model transformation:Deployed more new food model brands and offers with targeted investments Developed new client relationships with high-end brands Acquired companies to develop convenience offer  such as Frontline Food services and VendEdge.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the Underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1‚Ç¨= AVERAGE RATE FY 2022 AVERAGE RATE FY 2021 AVERAGE RATE FY 2022VS.

This record performance was the result of an improvement in almost all regions  and particularly in North America. In France  difficult inflation negotiations  particularly in public sector Schools led to some contract exits.new sales development was up +150 bps at 7.5%  with a solid contribution from all segments. Total development  including cross-selling  was 1.5 billion euros.As a result  the net new business signed during the year was more than 300 million euros.

Sports & Leisure is back up to 96% of Fiscal 2019 level in the fourth quarter  while the return to the office  schools and universities was slower than in other regions. All other segments are strong  boosted also by price inflation. As a result  North America represented 44% of On-site Services revenues  back up to the pre-Covid level.Europe (representing 38% of On-site Services revenues) achieved solid growth in Fiscal 2022  up +13.0%  to 94% of pre-Covid level in the Fourth quarter. Growth slowed progressively during the year. This was due to a higher comparative base each quarter as the Covid recovery had come through earlier in Europe  as well as the end of the Testing Centers in the UK from the end of March.Asia-Pacific  Latin America  Middle East and Africa (18% of On-site Services revenues) ended the year up +11.5%  with strong post-Covid recovery in India and solid demand and new business in Energy & Resources  in particular in the mining sector in Latin America. The impact of the multiple lockdowns in China was relatively limited as activity tended to be higher on industrial sites partially compensating the effect of the closure of tertiary offices.

This is the result of ongoing growth in Energy & Resources and Government & Agencies  the recovery to pre-Covid levels of Sports & Leisure events and a solid return to office in all countries. The trend in the last two months of the year confirms our WFH estimates made in 2020  even though we are convinced that there is still further improvement to come.Organic growth in North America was +45.1%  with a progressive return to the office quarter on quarter and a strong recovery in all the Sports & Leisure activities  firstly in the stadiums and then in the convention centers. The Government & Agencies and Energy & Resources segments were both up thanks to new business and a gradual return of office workers on-site  neither having been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Although slower than in other regions  the return to the office gathered pace during the year. Many clients chose to enhance their on-site food services to attract their staff back into the office. The new food offers  providing more flexible  more healthy and sustainable meals grew significantly.In Europe  revenues were up +20.3% organically  driven by the progressive return to the office  strong recovery in the Sports & Leisure activities  first in the sporting events  and then in corporate entertaining and tourism in the second half. Government & Agencies and Energy & Resources were flat on the year  due to respectively the end of the significant Transforming Rehabilitation contract in the UK and weak activity in the Energy sector.In Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa  organic revenue growth was +11.6%. Growth in Corporate Services segment remained solid across all regions  particularly in India  where the Covid-related recovery was strong. Energy & Resources continued to achieve very solid growth  against a backdrop of double digit growth in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021. New business ramp-ups in Latin America  and particularly in the mining sector  more than offset the lack of new oil & gas projects and some contract losses in the Asia-Pacific region.Healthcare & SeniorsREVENUES BY REGION(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 RESTATED ORGANIC GROWTH North America 3 047 2 642 +6.1% Europe 2 106 1 838 +0.7% Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa 305 281 +8.5% HEALTHCARE & SENIORS TOTAL 5 459 4 762 +4.0%Healthcare & Seniors revenues amounted to 5.5 billion euros  up +4.0% organically.In North America  organic growth was +6.1%  boosted by cross-selling  progressive recovery in hospital retail sales and Senior occupancy and pricing  particularly in the last two quarters. The contribution of net new business remained slightly negative  as the signings during the year have not yet fed through into revenues.In Europe  organic growth was +0.7% impacted by the early closure of the Testing Centers in the UK at the end of March. This shortfall was compensated by the combination of pricing  new contracts in Seniors in France and some increase in volumes  especially in retail sales.In Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa  organic revenue growth was a solid +8.5%  resulting from increased volumes  pricing and some new business.EducationREVENUES BY REGION(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 RESTATED ORGANIC GROWTH North America 2 798 2 013 +27.9% Europe 769 963 +6.5% Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa 70 65 +24.0% EDUCATION TOTAL 3 637 3 041 +22.0%Fiscal 2022 revenues in Education were 3.6 billion euros  up +22.0% organically.In North America  organic growth was +27.9%  reflecting the reopening of schools and universities from the beginning of the 2021 academic year. However  events and special catering activities remained restricted due to staff shortages and ongoing fears of the pandemic. In the fourth quarter  summer camp and conference activity was solid and the 2022 start of the academic year was helped by an extra day and higher levels of staffing.In Europe  revenue was up +6.5% organically. All schools and Universities were fully opened. However  meal volumes were impacted by high levels of absenteeism due to Covid-19 waves.In Asia-Pacific  Latam  Middle East and Africa  organic growth was +24.0% reflecting reopening of schools and universities in China and India.BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICESFiscal 2022 Benefits & Rewards Services revenue amounted to 865 million euros  up +16.2%  helped by a +2.6% impact from currencies  offset somewhat by the impact of net disposals of -0.6%.

Issue volume amounted to 14.3 billion euros for the year and was up +16.2% organically  boosted by strong net new business leveraging digital products and enhanced sales efficiency  as well as face value increases. Financial revenues were also up strongly supported by rising interest rates  particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe.Services Diversification was down -1.3% organically for the year. Public Benefits fell back significantly during the year after a very strong Covid-linked performance  offsetting the solid growth in Mobility solutions in Latin America.REVENUES BY REGION(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 ORGANIC GROWTH Europe  USA and Asia 558 499 +14.4% Latin America 307 246 +13.8% BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 865 745 +14.2%Organic revenue growth was strong across all geographies  respectively +14.4% in Europe  USA and Asia  and +13.8% in Latin America  accelerating quarter by quarter.This performance was due to strong net new business in all key markets as well as sustained increase in face values. In addition  financial revenues were also up strongly thanks to increasing interest rates.REVENUES BY NATURE(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 ORGANIC GROWTH Operating Revenues 804 701 +12.4% Financial Revenues 61 43 +43.7% BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 865 745 +14.2%The increase in Operating revenues of +12.4% reflects strong growth in issue volumes due to face value increases and significant net new business in most countries and in most services  except Public Benefits.Financial revenues were up +43.7% due to the progressive effect of the increase in interest rates.1.4 Underlying operating profitFiscal 2022 Underlying operating profit was 1 059 million euros  up +83.3%  or +73.5% excluding the currency effect.

The margin came out at 4.6% up +170 bps or +160 bps excluding currencies  helped by the strong dollar particularly in Healthcare and Education where the weight of North American revenues is the highest. The performance by segment at constant rates is as follows:Business & Administrations Underlying operating profit was multiplied by nearly four times  up +263.7%. As a result  the margin was up +230 bps to 3.5%. This improved performance reflects the flow-through of the significant improvement in the activity levels in Corporate Services and Sports & Leisure  operational efficiencies and strong price increases and mitigation to offset inflation.In Healthcare & Seniors   the +7.6% increase in Underlying operating profit resulted in a margin of 6.5%  down -10 bps  in a highly inflationary environment  particularly in North America. Pricing has also been strong in this segment; the teams have been very active in rolling out their mitigation actions and the results of the portfolio clean-up of the preceding years is now coming through.In Education  Underlying operating profit was up +144.5% and the margin up +250 bps to 5.0% thanks to the flow-through of the revenue recovery  particularly in North America. High inflation and staff shortages have been offset by very significant mitigation efforts on the ground  as well as pricing in North America. Pricing has been more difficult in France where the national inflation index used in the Schools contracts has underperformed our input cost increases.Benefits & Rewards Services Underlying operating profit was up +33.2%  or +30.5% excluding the positive impact of currencies. The margin increased to 28.6% up +360 bps or +370 bps excluding currencies  helped by the strong acceleration in volumes and  in particular  the financial revenues from quarter to quarter throughout the year. While processing costs have remained stable relative to revenues  all other cost increases have been contained.The GET efficiency program has provided a significant improvement in profitability in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022. Half of the initiatives were aimed at protecting the gross profit margin by adapting on-site costs to the new post-Covid levels of activity and to compensate for the end of government aid. The other half of the program was aimed at structurally reducing SG&A for the long-term by simplifying the structures in the Group  to free up capacity to invest in growth and to enhance margins.Fiscal 2022 results benefited from the final tranche of cost savings of 164 million euros  of which 98 million euros in cost avoidance and 66 million euros in SG&A. The cash impact for the year was 73 million euros.GET PROGRAM FISCAL 2020 FISCAL 2021 FISCAL 2022 TARGET (in million euros) CUMULATED NUMBERS Total exceptional costs 158 312 322 350 Cash impact (75) (217) (290) (315) SG&A savings ‚Äî 91 157 175 Gross profit cost avoidance ‚Äî 127 225 175 Total savings ‚Äî 218 382 350 Savings/Costs 119% 100%Cumulated  the GET program has cost 322 million euros  generated 382 million euros of annual savings  with a cash impact of 290 million euros. As a result  the program exceeded the target cost savings by 32 million euros with a ratio of savings to costs of 119%  also above the target of 100%.1.5 Group net profitOther operating income and expenses amounted to 5 million euros compared to 239 million euros in the previous year. This significant reduction is due to the end of the GET program  with only 10 million euros of restructuring costs  a spill-over from Fiscal 2021  compared to 153 million euros in the previous year  and 117 million euros of gains related to the disposals program.As a result  the Operating Profit recovered to 1 054 million euros compared to 339 million euros in the previous year.(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 1 059 578 Net scope change impacts 50 (32) Restructuring and rationalization costs (10) (153) Amortization of purchased intangible assets (46) (33) Other 1 (21) Other Operating income and expenses (5) (239) OPERATING PROFIT 1 054 339Fiscal 2022 Net financial expenses decreased to 87 million euros against 106 million euros in the previous year. The reduction came from the net effect of the debt reimbursements and issuance in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022  an increase in interest income related to higher levels of activity and some positive currency impacts. The blended cost of debt at Fiscal 2022 year end was stable at 1.6% relative to year end Fiscal 2021.The tax charge was up significantly to 264 million euros  reflecting the higher pre-tax profit. However  the Effective tax rate on Pre-tax profit (excluding the share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method) of 960 million euros was 27.5%  back down to a more normal rate  against 43.9% last year.The share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method was stable at 8 million euros. Profit attributed to non-controlling interests was 9 million euros compared to the previous year amount of -2 million euros.As a result  Group net income was multiplied by five to reach 695 million euros  compared to 139 million euros in Fiscal 2021. Underlying net profit adjusted for Other operating income and expenses net of tax doubled to reach 699 million euros  compared to 346 million euros in Fiscal 2021.1.6 Earnings per sharePublished EPS was 4.75 euros against 0.95 euro in Fiscal 2021. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2022 was more or less stable at 146 295 576 compared to 146 004 484 shares for Fiscal 2021. As a result of much lower Other income and expenses  Underlying EPS was very close to the published number  amounting to 4.78 euros  double the previous year.1.7 Proposed dividendThe Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of 2.40‚Ç¨  up +20% compared to Fiscal 2021  in line with our policy of a pay-out ratio of 50% of Underlying net profit.2 Consolidated financial position2.1 Cash flowsCash flows for the period were as follows:(in million euros) FISCAL 2022 FISCAL 2021 Operating cash flow 1 243 766 Change in working capital excluding change in BRS financial assets(1) (63) 171 IFRS 16 outflow (208) (242) Net capital expenditure (341) (211) Free cash flow(2) 631 483 Net acquisitions 14 (42) Share buy-backs (13) (11) Dividends paid to shareholders (294) ‚Äî Other changes (including scope and exchange rates) (128) (40) (Increase)/decrease in net debt 210 390(1) Excluding change in financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity of -145 million euros in Fiscal 2022versus 45 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Total change in working capital as reported in consolidated accounts:in Fiscal 2022: -208 million euros = -63 million euros - 145 million eurosand in Fiscal 2021: 216 million euros = 171 million euros + 45 million euros.(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group‚Äôs performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable).To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).Free cash flow  adjusted for IFRS 16  was 631 million euros against 483 million euros in Fiscal 2021.Operating cash flow of 1 243 million euros improved significantly compared to the previous year at 766 million euros  boosted by the strong recovery in Underlying operating profit and by the Benefits & Rewards Services indemnity from the Hungarian government related to closure of the business for 34 million euros.The Working capital outflow in Fiscal 2022 of 63 million euros was due to some significant exceptional items such as restructuring costs  a cash contribution to the UK pension found for 71 million euros  the unwinding of government Covid-linked payment delays for 117 million euros  the reimbursement of the Tokyo Olympics hospitality packages for 55 million euros and the Benefits & Rewards fine related to the dispute with the French competition authorities which is being paid monthly.Net capital expenditure  including client investments  increased to 341 million euros  and 1.6% of revenues  compared to 211 million euros in the preceding year  at 1.2% of revenues. Gross capex was 478 million euros  or 2.3% of revenues. Digital and IT investments accounted for 30% of the gross spend  with the remainder focused on client facing investments.Benefits & Rewards Services continued to invest heavily  at a rate of 9.1% of revenues  with 93% of its investments in IT and digital. The Business & Administrations gross capital expenditure to revenues ratio was at 1.3%  nearly double last year  linked to the recovery in Sports & Leisure activity. Healthcare was also at 1.5%  the highest level in many years  due to some significant investments in several hospitals in North America and Continental Europe. On the other hand  in Education  capex to sales was down -60 bps this year at 2.7% of revenues even though the euro amount remained stable.Cash conversion was 91%  below the normal level of 100%  but including 363 million euros of negative non-recurring elements.M&A activity restarted in Fiscal 2022 with acquisition spend of 70 million euros but was more than offset by disposals of 84 million euros.After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt decreased by 210 million euros ending the year to 1 268 million euros at August 31  2022.2.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFiscal 2022 has been an active year for closing numerous disposals of non-core activities and geographies:the On-site Services activities in Morocco  the Congo and Russia;Lido in France;Non-strategic account portfolios in Australia and the Czech Republic;Benefits & Rewards activities in Russia in December 2021  followed by the On-site activities in the second half;Benefits & Rewards sports cards in Germany  Romania and Spain;The Childcare activities  completed mid-March.On the other hand  further strategic acquisitions & investments have also been made:In the Advanced Food Model  Sodexo has acquired Frontline Food Services and VendEdge in North America and an off-site production unit in China.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Syst√®mes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group‚Äôs actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù section 1.9 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document (‚ÄòDocument d'enregistrement universel‚Äô) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2022  available on the Group‚Äôs website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor ‚ÄúUncertain Global Economic Environment‚Äù in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:‚ÄúIn light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô solutions may represent a large portion of a customer‚Äôs investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers‚Äô revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Syst√®mes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô diversification efforts in new industries;current inflation forecasts  as well as uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of this trend  could adversely affect the financial condition of Dassault Syst√®mes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô products ‚Äì already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers ‚Äì could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises ‚Äì health and geopolitical crises in particular ‚Äì could have consequences for the health and safety of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô employees. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing capabilities of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Syst√®mes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company‚Äôs business results.‚ÄùIn preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.05 per ‚Ç¨1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY139.0 to ‚Ç¨1.00  before hedging for the fourth quarter 2022. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.06 per ‚Ç¨1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY136.7 to ‚Ç¨1.00  before hedging for the full year 2022. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group‚Äôs results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

We believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business. Therefore  we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed by us ‚Äúin constant currencies‚Äù  the results of the ‚Äúprior‚Äù period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  we are including this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates are expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (‚Äúorganic growth‚Äù)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group‚Äôs scope  Dassault Syst√®mes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Syst√®mes‚Äô Industries develop Solution Experiences  industry-focused offerings that deliver specific value to companies and users in a particular industry.

This reflects the combination of a 28% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter and a positive currency impact of 11%1.Pierre Barnab√©  Soitec‚Äôs CEO  commented: ‚ÄúAfter several months in Soitec  I am thrilled and proud to announce this quarterly revenue. The Q2‚Äô23 performance reflects the strong dynamics in each of our three markets and a robust industrial execution. Mobile communications growth continued to be driven by radiofrequency applications that are supported by the growing 5G deployment. For the second consecutive quarter  we recorded a strong surge in FD-SOI wafer sales across our three end markets  confirming the solid momentum on its adoption. With this H1‚Äô23 performance  we do confirm our outlook for the full year.‚ÄùSecond quarter FY‚Äô23 consolidated revenue (unaudited)As indicated during the presentation of its full-year results in June 2022  Soitec is  from now on  reporting its revenue by end market instead of breaking it down by wafer size. This decision was made in order to better reflect the way Soitec is conducting and monitoring its business2.Q2‚Äô22 Q2‚Äô23 Q2‚Äô23/Q2‚Äô22 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 142 189 +32% +22% Automotive & Industrial 17 34 +96% +80% Smart devices 33 45 +37% +28% Total revenue 193 268 +39% +28%Soitec recorded a 28% total revenue increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23 compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22. Performance was driven by sustained growth in each of the three end markets: Mobile communications  Automotive & Industrial and Smart Devices.Mobile communicationsGrowth in Mobile communications continues to be supported by the adoption of 5G smartphones and WiFi6  as well as the deployment of 5G infrastructure.In the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  Mobile communications revenue reached 189 million Euros  a 22% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22  mainly reflecting an increase in volumes.RF-SOI wafer sales continue to be boosted by the increase in RF content in every 5G smartphone and higher penetration of high-end phones. In the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  Soitec enjoyed further growth in RF-SOI 200-mm and sharp growth in RF-SOI 300-mm  enabled by the ongoing ramp-up in production at its Singapore facility.FD-SOI wafer sales continue to demonstrate the value for 5G front end modules both on mmWaves and Sub 6 GHz.Regarding POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters for 5G smartphones  while several customers are confirming the value of POI products  they are going through the adoption phase  a process that will continue in the coming quarters.Automotive & IndustrialDemand from the automotive industry is increasingly supported by the growing needs for multimedia content (infotainment)  by the trends towards more autonomous driving and functional safety  as well as by the shift to greener vehicles powered by electric and hybrid engines.Automotive & Industrial revenue reached 34 million Euros in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  a 17 million Euros increase compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22. Growth essentially reflects an increase in volumes.In the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  growth in Automotive & Industrial revenue mostly came from FD-SOI wafers dedicated to automotive applications. Sales of Power-SOI wafers also recorded a significant increase.Smart devicesThe demand from the smart devices market is driven by the need for more complex sensors  higher connectivity functionalities and embedded intelligence  leading to more powerful and efficient edge artificial intelligence chips.Smart devices revenue reached 45 million Euros in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  a 28% increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22. This performance reflects higher volumes.Sales of both Imager-SOI wafers  which allow improved imager performance in 3D Imaging Applications  and Photonics-SOI wafers for data transceivers  recorded strong growth compared to the second quarter of FY‚Äô22.The increase in sales of FD-SOI wafers was also very strong  confirming structural demand for Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors.First half FY‚Äô23 consolidated revenue (unaudited)H1‚Äô22 H1‚Äô23 H1‚Äô23/H1‚Äô22 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 277 341 +23% +14% Automotive & Industrial 33 57 +72% +59% Smart devices 63 73 +17% +10% Total revenue 373 471 +26% +18%In the first quarter of FY‚Äô23  production at Bernin site was affected during a few days in April by a power outage  then by a strike action during another few days in June. As expected  Soitec has been able to progressively make up for the lost production (around 10 days). Combined with higher demand  growth was therefore much stronger in the second quarter of FY‚Äô23  reaching 28% at constant exchange rates and perimeter.Overall  consolidated revenue reached 471 million Euros in the first half of FY‚Äô23  up 26% on a reported basis compared to 373 million Euros in the first half of FY‚Äô22. This reflects an 18% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter combined with a positive currency impact of 9%3.Confirmed FY‚Äô23 outlookSoitec continues to anticipate FY‚Äô23 revenue to grow around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter  and FY‚Äô23 EBITDA1 margin2 to reach around 36%.Key events of the quarterSTMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries to advance FD-SOI ecosystem with new 300mm manufacturing facility in FranceOn July 11th  2022  STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries announced the creation of a new  jointly-operated 300-mm semiconductor manufacturing facility adjacent to ST‚Äôs existing site in Crolles  France. This new facility will support several technologies  in particular FD-SOI-based technologies  and will cover multiple variants.

DisposalsIn July 2022  URW completed the disposal of Gera Arcaden  closed the sale of Almere Centrum  Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc and URW‚Äôs partner in Aupark exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake. On September 30  2022  URW completed the sale of Villeneuve 2.With these transactions  URW has completed ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn of its ‚Ç¨4.0 Bn European disposals programme. The Group remains in active discussions with potential buyers on mature office and retail assets that are not core to its strategy. Given current market conditions  the Group now expects to complete the European disposals programme in 2023.In the US  URW announced the sale of Westfield Santa Anita  a regional shopping centre  in August for $537.5 Mn (at 100%  URW share 49%).The Group is in active discussions in relation to its regional assets and continues to work actively on its Flagship assets. Turnover  leasing and vacancy metrics reinforce the desirability and intrinsic value of these assets.URW is committed to completing its deleveraging programme through the radical reduction of its financial exposure to the US. The performance of the Group‚Äôs assets  as well as its strong liquidity position  will allow URW to pursue this plan in an organised and timely manner.7. Financial resourcesAs at September 30  2022  the Group‚Äôs net financial debt12 decreased to ‚Ç¨23.3 Bn (from ‚Ç¨24.1 Bn as at June 30  2022) and the cash on hand13 increased to ‚Ç¨3.0 Bn (from ‚Ç¨2.4 Bn as at June 30  2022)  supported by the disposals achieved in Q3-2022.Since end of September  the Group has signed ‚Ç¨550 Mn of sustainability-linked term loans with a 5-year maturity (including the refinancing of ‚Ç¨150 Mn debt maturing in January 2023).This additional liquidity will further strengthen the Group‚Äôs cash position to ‚Ç¨3.4 Bn13. This compares with ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn of debt maturing by December 2024 and ‚Ç¨4.5 Bn including the hybrid with a 2023 call date.In addition  as at September 30  2022  the Group‚Äôs credit lines fully undrawn position amounted to ‚Ç¨10.0 Bn including ‚Ç¨3.7 Bn maturing over the next twelve months. URW is considering opportunities to extend or renew part of these lines.Taking into account this liquidity and undrawn credit facilities and thanks to its long-dated debt maturity  the Group has secured more than 36 months of financing needs14 (assuming the reinstatement of a dividend for fiscal year 2023 and the reimbursement of the 2023 hybrid).Thanks to improved operational performance and debt reduction  the Net debt/EBITDA ratio15/16 improved from 11.0x on June 30  2022 to 10.4x on September 30  2022. The ICR16 remained stable between H1-2022 and 9M-2022 at 4.5x.Furthermore  the Group‚Äôs debt is fully hedged for the coming years  with hedging instruments and fixed debt of more than ‚Ç¨20.0 Bn over 2022-2025 and of over ‚Ç¨15 Bn in 2026.8. ESGThe sustainability leadership of URW has been recognised externally by its long-term presence in the top quartile of all ESG ratings. URW ranks 1st in the entire Real Estate sector17 according to Sustainalytics. In Q3-2022  URW renewed its AAA from MSCI ESG rating  consistently since 2014  and received for the 11th time a ‚Äò5 Star‚Äô rating in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)  which recognises entities placed in the top 20%.The company has already achieved a -27% reduction of its total carbon footprint since 201518  and is on track to achieve its target of a -50% reduction by 2030 by implementing a range of initiatives such as the supply of its assets with renewable electricity for common use. With a 15% reduction of its energy intensity globally since 2015  URW is also on track to reach its target of permanently reducing its total energy intensity by -30%. In the context of the current energy crisis  URW has announced it will improve its energy efficiency in Europe by an additional -15%. This includes a -20% reduction for France  beyond requirements  and further increased its energy-saving approach across all of its shopping centres to support wider government and private sector efforts to address the European energy crisis.19The recent delivery of Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√© represents a living example of URW‚Äôs sustainability ambition  demonstrating strong performance with a 40% reduction in energy used for heating. This will result in 880 tonnes of avoided CO 2 emissions each year.9. OutlookBased on the performance of the first nine months of 2022  including a strong Q3 that confirms the positive trend seen in H1  the Group is upgrading its 2022 AREPS guidance from at least ‚Ç¨8.90 to at least ‚Ç¨9.10 per share.The Group assumes no major COVID-19 or energy-related restrictions  or any major disruption to the macro-economic environment.10.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 27  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 27  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) presents its preliminary  unaudited financial report for the first nine months ended September 30  2022.Pharming_Group_NV_LogoChief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:""In the first nine months of 2022 Pharming continued to perform well despite challenging industry conditions. Our commercialized asset RUCONEST¬Æ saw increased sales of 3% or US$151.0 million  compared to the same period last year  highlighting the continued need for a safe and effective acute hereditary angioedema therapy.From a strategic perspective  we continued to make significant progress delivering on a number of important regulatory milestones for leniolisib  a rare immunodeficiency disease. Of note  our New Drug Application for leniolisib was accepted by the US FDA for Priority Review with a PDUFA goal date of March 29  2023. Furthermore  we submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for the product to the European Medicines Agency following the grant of accelerated assessment. We remain on track for the anticipated marketing authorization of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in key markets next year.Looking ahead  the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib will be supported by our strong balance sheet and the steady sales of RUCONEST¬Æ. We will continue focusing on our strategic objectives and the internal review of our pipeline as we look to bring the unserved rare disease patient the solutions they need. We look forward to presenting more detailed plans at our full year financial results.""Story continuesStrategic highlightsDuring the first nine months of 2022  we continued to execute on our strategic objectives of building a sustainable business by focusing on RUCONEST¬Æ sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline as we prioritize our efforts on rare diseases.As announced during the half year financial results in August 2022  we initiated an internal review of our pipeline with a greater and renewed focus towards rare diseases. As a result  we will advance the development of our pipeline through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib  as well as OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition of new  late-stage assets through in-licensing and M&A opportunities.We believe these potential acquisitions and in-licensing will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST¬Æ business  anticipated future leniolisib business  as well as available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming will access additional funding from the capital markets.Pipeline developmentleniolisibFor leniolisib  Pharming has a three-step approach planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated marketing authorization and commercial launch of leniolisib for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older in the US during the first half of 2023. This will be followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK in the second half of 2023 and early 2024  respectively  dependent upon regulatory approval. The Company will evaluate additional countries and regions and will commercialize the product either directly or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes the marketing authorization and commercial launch of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in children as young as one year of age.The third step is the continued life cycle management of the leniolisib compound into further indications which will be disclosed when decisions have been taken.US marketWe remain on track for the anticipated commercial approval of leniolisib in the first quarter of 2023  subject to approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  followed by the commercial launch of leniolisib in the second quarter of 2023.In the third quarter of 2022  we delivered on a number of important regulatory milestones including the filing and acceptance of a New Drug Application (NDA) for Priority Review by the FDA.As a result of receiving Priority Review  Pharming's NDA for leniolisib was assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023.In anticipation of a positive outcome from the FDA  we continued to grow our US field force and leverage our marketing capabilities for the commercialization of leniolisib.Finally  the ICD-10-CM code for APDS took effect on October 1  2022. The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code enables physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.European Economic Area (EEA) and UK marketIn the EEA  we announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Upon further request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days.Further positive milestones were reached in October 2022 when we announced that we had submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for leniolisib to the EMA. We expect to receive EMA validation of the MAA at the end of October 2022  with anticipated marketing authorization in H1 2023.Moving on to the UK market  in April 2022  the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS. A PIM designation is an early indication that leniolisib is a candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme. This scheme provides an opportunity for treatment options to be used in clinical practice in parallel with the later stages of the regulatory process.Finally  on September 30  2022  the UK government took the decision to extend the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP) by 12 months  until December 31  2023. The ECDRP allows a company to submit a product that has received approval from EMA to the UK's MHRA. The MHRA can grant a license relying on the EMA's decision  thereby ensuring a less time consuming in-country review.The extension of the ECDRP has several benefits including aligned EU and UK dossiers  consistent labeling across the EU and UK  and the potential for an earlier Marketing Authorisation Approval. As such  Pharming has decided that the ECDRP procedure will be used for the application of leniolisib to the MHRA. Under ECDRP  if the submission of an application is made within five days of an EMA CHMP positive opinion  the MHRA will aim to determine a decision within a 67-day timeline. The anticipated MHRA decision should be known in H2 2023.Pediatric clinical developmentAs previously announced  we intend to expand access to leniolisib for the treatment of pediatric APDS. As a result  Pharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age. During the first half of the year  positive decisions were received from EMA and MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned  global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS aged 4 to 11 with a second study in patients aged 1 to 6. These two studies will support regulatory filings worldwide. Pharming expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib in the fourth quarter of 2022.OTL-105Pharming's strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is ongoing. The program has made good progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)As announced at our half year 2022 financial results  following an internal review of our pipeline  we have taken the strategic decision to discontinue further development of rhC1INH therapy for Acute Kidney Injury. We are considering strategic options to gain value from the work done to date and have de-prioritized further development and investment in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd. The herd is being maintained to allow all possible outcomes to be explored.The ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial is continuing as we evaluate these strategic options.We will update the market at our full year 2022 financial results on further progress in this area.PompeWe continue the preclinical investigation of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease and will update the market on the results as appropriate.Financial SummaryAmounts in US$m except per share data YTD 2022 YTD 2021 % Change Income StatementRevenues 151.0 146.1 3 % Gross profit 139.7 130.6 7 % Operating profit 28.4 15.3 86 % Profit for the year 28.3 13.9 104 % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 189.9 184.8 3 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.043 0.022 95 % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.040 0.018 122 %Financial highlightsYTD Q3 2022Revenues for the first nine months of 2022 were US$151.0 million  a 3% increase compared to the first nine months of 2021 (US$146.1 million).Gross profit for the first nine months of 2022 increased 7% to US$139.7 million. This increase was driven by growth in revenues  production efficiencies and a favorable tailwind in currency translation effects.Operating costs for the first nine months of 2022 increased by US$9.8 million to US$126.9 million versus the same period last year. The increase results from a combination of increased R&D expenditure  launch preparation and manufacturing costs for leniolisib  and an increase in travel related expenses post-COVID-19. This increase was partly offset by significant one-off costs in Q3 2021 relating to the in-licensing of OTL-105 from Orchard Therapeutics.Operating profit for the first nine months of 2022 was US$28.4 million  increasing 86% versus the same period last year. This was mainly driven by the increase in other income of US$13.8 million as a result of a reduced minority stake in BioConnection communicated in our H1 2022 press release.Net profit for the first nine months of 2022 was US$28.3 million  a 104% increase compared to the same period last year (US$13.9 million). This was driven by the increase in other income of US$13.8 million.Cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  decreased from US$193.0 million at the end of 2021  to US$189.9 million at the end of the third quarter 2022.OutlookFor the financial year of 2022:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST¬Æ sales. Quarterly fluctuations are expected.Subject to a positive outcome from the FDA review  we anticipate marketing authorization in the US for leniolisib at the end of Q1 2023  with an anticipated launch and commercialization in Q2 2023.Subject to a positive outcome from the EMA review  we anticipate a positive opinion from the CHMP for leniolisib  followed by the issuance of an MAA by the European Commission towards the end of H1 2023. Initial commercial launches in EU markets are planned for H2 2023.Following an anticipated positive CHMP opinion  we intend to submit an ECDRP filing for leniolisib with the MHRA in the UK in H2 2023.Pharming will continue to allocate resources towards the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib with the view of accelerating future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will continue to impact profit for the remainder of 2022 and throughout 2023. However  no additional financing to support the current business is expected with the continued cash flow from RUCONEST¬Æ funding these investments.Investment and continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of new  late- stage development opportunities and assets in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.No further specific financial guidance for 2022 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation will be available on the Pharming.com website from 10:30 CET on October 27  2022.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CET on October 27  2022.

(NYSE: ""CLB US"" and Euronext Amsterdam: ""CLB NA"") (""Core""  ""Core Lab""  or the ""Company"") reported third quarter 2022 revenue of $126 000 000. Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was adversely impacted by the devaluation of the Euro and British Pound when translated into U.S. dollars. Using a constant U.S. dollar exchange rate  revenue would be $1 500 000 higher sequentially and $4 300 000 higher year-over-year. Core's operating income was $14 600 000  with diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") of $0.16  all in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Operating income  ex-items  a non-GAAP financial measure  was $13 300 000  yielding operating margins of 11%  and EPS  ex-items  of $0.18. Sequential incremental margins  excluding the aforementioned currency devaluation  were over 55%. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is included in the attached financial tables.Core's CEO  Larry Bruno stated  ""First  our thoughts remain with our Ukrainian employees and their families during the on-going conflict. Core's results during the third quarter of 2022 displayed continued positive momentum as we achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins  free cash flow (""FCF"") and EPS  with strong incremental margins. This quarter-over-quarter improvement in financial results was driven by steady U.S. activity and an increase in international activity  effectively illustrating the operational leverage that is inherent in our global  asset-light business model. Looking forward  Core sees continued progress in both onshore and offshore client activity across our global operations  although the Russia-Ukraine conflict  and the potential collateral impact in Europe  create uncertainties to growth prospects in those specific regions.""Story continuesRussia-Ukraine ConflictThe on-going geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine  along with the associated sanctions  continue to present some measure of uncertainty for Core's business and financial performance in the affected regions. As part of Core's Reservoir Description laboratory network  the Company provides analytical services on crude oil  natural gas and derived products  including both reservoir condition analysis and ambient condition assay work. Over the course of the third quarter of 2022  demand for laboratory assay work showed modest improvement  as global trading patterns continued to realign.Reservoir DescriptionReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels  with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from projects originating outside the U.S. Reservoir Description revenue in the third quarter of 2022 was $79 000 000  up 4% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Third quarter international revenue increased 8% sequentially  driven by project progression and realignment of global trading patterns. Considering the devaluation of the Euro and British Pound  and using a constant U.S. dollar exchange rate  international revenue would be up 11% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Operating income for the third quarter of 2022 on a GAAP basis was $9 800 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $8 400 000  yielding operating margins of 11%. Using the aforementioned currency devaluation  sequential incremental margins  ex-items  were in excess of 70%.During the third quarter of 2022  Core continued to leverage its global network  expertise and proprietary technologies to evaluate core and reservoir fluid samples acquired from a multi-well exploration program in the deepwater  Orange Basin  located offshore Namibia. Conventional core recovered from targeted stratigraphic intervals were scanned using Core's Non-Invasive Technologies for Reservoir Optimization (""NITRO‚Ñ¢""). A wide range of critical petrophysical parameters for pay delineation were generated using Core Lab's innovative measurement and modeling techniques  allowing for early-time assessment of the recovered strata. Selected samples are now progressing through the traditional  time-honored program of physical laboratory measurements. Core's proprietary  full visualization  high-pressure  high-temperature  pressure-volume-temperature (""PVT"") cells and other proprietary technologies were utilized to determine the chemical and physical properties of recovered reservoir fluids. Recent successes in Namibia have generated renewed interest in Core Lab's ""Reservoirs and Seals of Offshore Namibia Basins  South Atlantic Margin"" regional study. This study  conducted in collaboration with the National Oil Company of Namibia  includes geological analysis of samples from more than 20 wells. The study assessed depositional and diagenetic controls on porosity and provides a regional evaluation of prospective reservoir targets. This study is just one of 22 multi-well  multi-company studies that Core Lab has conducted on offshore Africa sedimentary basins.Core Lab is pleased to announce that during the third quarter of 2022  Quantum Energy Partners  LLC and Trace Midstream Management II  LLC joined Core's Carbon Capture and Sequestration (""CCS"") Consortium  bringing total membership to eight participants. These new members enhance the Consortium's exposure to private equity engagement and midstream operations expertise in the emerging CCS marketplace. Earlier in 2022  Core announced the launch of its CCS Consortium in collaboration with Dr. Birol Dindoruk of the University of Houston. The objective of the Consortium is to analyze geologic risks and challenges associated with subsurface carbon sequestration. This consortium project leverages Core's expertise in subsurface characterization  with a focus on reservoir capacity  subsurface injection and containment integrity  as well as rock-fluid and fluid-fluid compatibility. Regulatory entities that govern carbon sequestration projects require extensive site evaluation. Core's technologies ensure that models for simulation and monitoring of CO 2 injection and sequestration are both representative and applicable for the permitting process.Production EnhancementProduction Enhancement operations  which are focused on complex completions in unconventional  tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S.  as well as conventional offshore projects across the globe  posted third quarter 2022 revenue of $47 000 000  up 4% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $4 400 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $4 700 000  yielding operating margins of 10% and sequential incremental margins  ex-items  of 44%. During the quarter  Core's proprietary energetic product sales grew over 20% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year  driven by both organic growth from new product sales and market penetration in U.S. and international markets.During the third quarter of 2022  Core Lab continued to build on the success of its proprietary Plug and Abandonment Perforating System (""PAC‚Ñ¢"") in applications for oil and gas well abandonment programs. Core provides solutions that leverage its expertise in energetics as an alternative to traditional section milling  which is slower and more costly. Thus far in 2022  Core has successfully deployed its PAC‚Ñ¢ technologies in over 30 wells in the North Sea. Core's PAC‚Ñ¢ energetic solutions are commonly used in Perf-Wash-Cement (""PWC"") applications. This technique enables the operator to selectively establish circulation in the annular space between casing strings  thereby creating pathways for setting the permanent cement barriers that comply with stringent requirements for well abandonment in the North Sea. Core's Production Enhancement team offers an industry-leading portfolio of plug and abandonment energetic solutions.Operators continued to leverage Core's expertise in completion diagnostics for offshore wells during the third quarter of 2022. Core's SpectraStim‚Ñ¢  SpectraScan¬Æ  and PackScan¬Æ downhole imaging technologies were utilized in deepwater Gulf of Mexico Miocene wells to evaluate single and dual zone frac pack completions. In addition to those technologies  Core's FLOWPROFILER‚Ñ¢ oil tracers were used to assess production in ultra-deepwater Gulf of Mexico reservoirs involving multi-zone completions. The costs associated with completing multiple zones in these high-stakes wells necessitates confirmation that each frac pack is properly configured  and that each targeted zone is contributing oil production as per the completion plan. Recently  Core's Production Enhancement team was tasked to deploy a unique FLOWPROFILER‚Ñ¢ diagnostic tracer in each of four frac pack completion zones. Core's proprietary laboratory analytical techniques confirmed that all four zones were contributing to production. FLOWPROFILER‚Ñ¢ also helped the operator understand how the reservoir was responding  allowing them to adjust flowback procedures to achieve drawdown pressure that optimized production without damaging the reservoir. Core's Completion diagnostics are a critical tool for determining whether planned completion programs were successfully executed downhole  many thousands  or even tens of thousands of feet away from the wellhead.Liquidity  Free Cash Flow and DividendOn 9 June 2022  Core Lab announced a $60 000 000 At-The-Market (""ATM"") equity offering program. As of 30 September 2022  the Company had not sold any shares under the ATM program.Core continues to focus on maximizing FCF  a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. For the third quarter of 2022  cash from operations was $5 800 000 and capital expenditures were $2 700 000  yielding FCF of $3 100 000. Core expects the growth in working capital associated with higher levels of inventory to moderate  cash from operations to strengthen and the Company to generate positive free cash in future quarters. Core's free cash will continue to be returned to its shareholders through the Company's regular quarterly dividend as well as being focused towards reducing long-term debt.Core will continue applying free cash towards reducing debt until the Company reaches its target leverage ratio (calculated as total net debt divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA) of 1.5 times or lower.On 27 July 2022  Core's Board of Supervisory Directors (""Board"") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock  which was paid on 29 August 2022 to shareholders of record on 8 August 2022. Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.On 26 October 2022  the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter dividend will be payable on 28 November 2022  to shareholders of record on 7 November 2022. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.Return On Invested CapitalThe Board and the Company's Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (""ROIC"") and FCF  factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return. Core's commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promotes capital efficiency and is designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.The Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core's Comp Group by Bloomberg  as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. Bloomberg's calculations using the latest comparable data available indicate Core Lab's ROIC of 5.8%.Industry and Core Lab Outlook and GuidanceAs the fourth quarter of 2022 unfolds  Core anticipates the crude-oil commodity price will remain near current levels but may fluctuate in response to the crude-oil supply and demand uncertainties related to slowing global economic growth  inflationary pressures and government-imposed COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Over the longer term  crude-oil supply is projected to tighten as production growth faces limitations due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe. As a result  Core Lab expects operators to expand their upstream spending plans into 2023  supporting Core's outlook for continued improvement in international onshore and offshore activity  with projects emerging across most regions. These crude-oil market fundamentals are leading indicators for what Core sees as a strengthening multi-year international recovery.Turning to the U.S.  Core expects U.S. onshore activity to remain steady and modestly grow in 2023  as operators remain focused on capital discipline and availability of additional frac crews and drilling rigs may constrain growth.As a result  for the fourth quarter of 2022  Core's Reservoir Description segment revenue is projected to be flat to up slightly. While momentum in international activity continues to build  near-term growth may be affected by two factors: 1) volatility associated with the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict  and 2) client-driven project delays. Production Enhancement segment revenue is estimated to increase by mid to high single digits as U.S. land activity is projected to remain steady and international growth continues.For the fourth quarter of 2022  Core projects U.S. activity to remain stable and the recent improvement trends in international  offshore and deepwater markets to continue. Core projects fourth quarter 2022 revenue to range from $126 000 000 to $131 000 000 and operating income of $13 000 000 to $15 000 000  yielding operating margins of approximately 11%. EPS for the fourth quarter of 2022 is expected to be $0.17 to $0.21.The Company's fourth quarter 2022 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. Fourth quarter 2022 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.Earnings Call ScheduledThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core's third quarter 2022 earnings announcement.

As of 26 October 2022  the total number of shares purchased under this program since 22 July 2022 is 469 434 shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨19.46 for a total consideration of ‚Ç¨9.1m. The purpose of the buyback is to return excess capital to shareholders. The intention is that shares repurchased as part of this program will initially be held in treasury. 3 259 529 shares are held in treasury as at 26 October 2022 with 58% of these treasury shares repurchased for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of various employee incentive plans and the remaining 42% repurchased for the purpose of returning excess capital to shareholdersOn 21 October 2022  Flow Traders announced a proposed implementation of an updated corporate holding structure  as an enabler of its global strategic ambition. This proposed update will involve a top holding company in Bermuda and is the result of a thorough legal and capital structure review. This will be formally proposed to shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting  scheduled to take place on 2 December 2022 at 14.00 CETManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:‚ÄúThis quarter delivered further proof points with respect to the diligent execution of our strategic growth agenda  particularly in fixed income. Our liquidity provision across the fixed income space which includes ETFs as well as corporate credit and emerging markets sovereign bonds continues to be positively received by the buy-side and we were delighted to be the lead sponsor once again at the recent Fixed Income Leadership Summit in Nice. Another landmark for Flow Traders was the successful approval of our QFII license which is a key part of our plan to enter the mainland China market. Given the strong financial performance in the quarter and within the context of our capital allocation framework  we have elected to increase the current share buyback program to a new total size of up to ‚Ç¨40 million. This buyback will further enhance the capital returns to our shareholders.‚ÄúWe have also worked hard this quarter on laying the groundwork for the future. The proposed update to the corporate holding structure was announced on 21 October 2022 and is a natural enabler for the strategic ambition which the team outlined at the Capital Markets Update held in July. In addition  we created an Executive Committee in order to accelerate the implementation of our strategy as well as to ensure that our leadership talent pool grows alongside the needs of the business. Lastly  it is also pleasing that in a highly competitive employment market  we are still able to attract and recruit the best talent and we welcomed a large intake of 18 new graduates in September to complement our already highly talented team.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúThe third quarter saw a more active fixed income market given interest rate and inflation impacts. This contributed to an overall strong trading performance  which was particularly evident in EMEA. Across other asset classes  realized volatility remained subdued compared to earlier in the year. Our trading footprint continues to grow as we successfully executed our first ever on-shore China trades. From a broader trading perspective  we remained focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities. We have enduring confidence in our ability to expand our trading activities across these various asset classes going forward.‚ÄùMike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:‚ÄúIndicative of the success of our trading diversification strategy  Flow Traders achieved a return on trading capital of 67% in Q3. Once again  the firm‚Äôs trading capital continues to generate attractive and economically accretive returns. From an operating cost perspective  we have had to contend with a changing macro environment which has brought rising inflation as well as a strengthening US dollar. We are therefore seeking to absorb these impacts while at the same time ensuring we continue to invest in the business in order to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable returns for our stakeholders. The adjusted profit-sharing percentage continues to effectively ensure that the base compensation increases implemented in Q2 are income statement neutral as communicated before. A key focus for the remainder of this year and next is to further increase the underlying efficiency of the business as we prepare ourselves for Flow Traders‚Äô next stage of growth.‚ÄúA key takeaway from the recent Capital Markets Update was the importance of engaging more intensely in the ecosystem we operate and thrive in. With that in mind  we have continued to support new products and listings across the crypto space and  notably  worked with exchanges and ETP issuers around the Ethereum upgrade. The pace of our strategic investments has naturally slowed somewhat with the advent of the ‚Äòcrypto winter‚Äô which has allowed for more time to work with partners on build-out and development. Nonetheless  Flow Traders Capital still announced five investments during the third quarter.‚ÄúPreliminary Financial Calendar2 December 2022 EGM12 January 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q422 / FY22 results9 February 2023 Release Q422 / FY22 results (incl. analyst conference call)24 February 2023 Release 2022 Annual Report31 March 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q123 trading update21 April 2023 Release Q123 trading update (no analyst conference call)26 April 2023 AGMContact DetailsFlow Traders N.V.InvestorsJonathan BergerPhone: +31 20 7996149Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996125Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial products  historically specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)  now expanding into other asset classes.

The policy is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On this basis  the following items were adjusted or excluded for the Q322 trading update: Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of prior years‚Äô share plans.

Our growth platforms have delivered a double-digit sales performance  reflecting improving commercial execution and the strength of our portfolio. These results have outweighed the adverse impact from competitive activity on Somatuline in the U.S. and Europe. Based on the strong sales momentum  we are confirming our guidance for the full year.I was also delighted by the enhancement of our pipeline  portfolio and organization as a result of the recent acquisition of Epizyme. In the near term  we look forward to a number of milestones for our pipeline  including Phase III data readouts in Oncology. I am pleased with the sustained progress we are making as we continue to maximize our brands  strengthen our pipeline  drive efficiencies and focus on our culture.‚ÄùFull-year 2022 guidanceIpsen has confirmed its financial guidance for FY 20223:‚Äì Total-sales growth greater than 7.0%  at constant exchange rates.

In Europe  sales declined by 9.3%4  reflecting the larger effects of the launches of generic lanreotide in more markets  including Germany  France  Spain and the Nordics. Sales in the Rest of the World grew by 34.5%4  a result of strong performances in several geographies  including Japan and Brazil‚Äì Decapeptyl: the performance was mainly driven by continued volume growth across all countries  higher volumes in China and Korea and favorable shipment phasing in Algeria. In the third quarter  sales were supported by a strong performance in China  partly reflecting the impact of a loosening of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions‚Äì Cabometyx: the performance reflected strong volume uptakes in renal cell carcinoma across most geographies  mainly as a second-line monotherapy and  more recently  as a first-line therapy in combination with nivolumab‚Äì Onivyde: sales growth was primarily driven by a solid performance in the U.S.  as well as sales to Ipsen‚Äôs ex-U.S. partner. The decline in sales in the third quarter reflected the impact of the phasing of 2022 sales to the partner‚Äì Dysport: the performance in the year to date was driven by strong demand in most therapeutics markets  and similar growth in the aesthetics market  including increased sales to Ipsen‚Äôs partner  Galderma  especially in North America and Australia. The stronger growth in the third quarter was boosted by the catch-up from the recent manufacturing-capacity increase that benefitted supply to support aesthetics-market demand‚Äì Tazverik: sales  which are in the U.S.  were consolidated from 1 September 2022Total sales by geographical areaYTD2022 YTD2021 % change Q32022 Q32021 % change ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER6 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER6 North America 759.2 649.8 16.8% 4.0% 279.9 246.8 13.4% -2.6% Europe7 924.7 887.3 4.2% 3.7% 301.1 297.5 1.2% 1.1% Rest of the World 524.6 375.2 39.8% 32.5% 193.9 123.5 57.0% 43.7% Total Sales 2 208.5 1 912.3 15.5% 9.5% 774.8 667.8 16.0% 7.6%Commentary is based on the performance in YTD 2022.‚Äì North America: sales grew by 4.0%6  driven by a continued strong performance from Dysport in the therapeutics market and  in the aesthetics market  through Galderma  and from Onivyde  partly offset by a Somatuline sales decline of 3.6%6‚Äì Europe: sales growth of 3.7%6  mainly reflecting strong Cabometyx performances in France  Spain and Germany  and Decapeptyl‚Äôs continued market-share uptakes. Following the launch of generic lanreotide in some European markets  Somatuline sales declined by 9.3%6. Dysport sales grew by 7.6%6  driven by volume uptakes in the therapeutics market‚Äì Rest of the World: sales growth of 32.5%6  driven by solid volume growth in both Oncology and Neuroscience. In Oncology  the increase in Decapeptyl sales reflected the strong performance in China  share gains in several markets  and favorable shipment phasing in Algeria. The strong growth of Cabometyx was also a result of market-share gains across a number of geographies. The performance also reflected good Somatuline sales  including in Japan and Brazil. In Neuroscience  the strong growth of Dysport sales was a result of volume uptakes in both therapeutics and aesthetics markets  primarily in Latin America and AustraliaAppendix: geographic breakdown of total sales by medicineYTD Total North America Europe Rest of the World 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER8 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER8 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER8 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER8 Oncology 1 767.2 1 565.4 12.9% 6.9% 634.5 570.8 11.2% -1.0% 789.3 756.2 4.4% 3.8% 343.4 238.4 44.1% 35.6% Somatuline 911.9 874.4 4.3% -2.8% 525.5 485.3 8.3% -3.6% 292.7 322.1 -9.1% -9.3% 93.7 67.0 39.8% 34.5% Decapeptyl 396.0 332.6 19.1% 15.6% 0.0 0.0 - - 221.2 200.4 10.4% 10.3% 174.7 132.2 32.2% 23.5% Cabometyx 327.7 258.6 26.7% 24.1% 12.9 9.9 30.4% 18.8% 242.4 210.0 15.4% 15.1% 72.4 38.7 87.0% 74.2% Onivyde 122.0 93.0 31.1% 17.1% 93.1 75.1 23.8% 10.1% 26.5 17.5 51.8% 36.5% 2.4 0.4 n/a9 n/a 9 Tazverik 2.8 0.0 n/a9 n/a 9 2.8 0.0 n/a9 n/a 9 0.0 0.0 - - 0.0 0.0 - - Other Oncology 6.9 6.7 2.0% 1.6% 0.3 0.5 -45.1% -50.0% 6.4 6.3 3.1% 3.2% 0.2 0.0 n/a9 n/a9 Neuroscience 407.7 309.6 31.7% 25.1% 116.7 70.8 64.8% 46.3% 110.9 103.0 7.7% 7.6% 180.1 135.8 32.6% 27.3% Dysport 400.3 305.3 31.1% 24.8% 116.7 70.8 64.8% 46.3% 110.9 103.0 7.7% 7.6% 172.8 131.5 31.4% 26.5% Other Neuroscience 7.3 4.3 70.5% 49.1% 0.0 0.0 - - 0.0 0.0 - - 7.3 4.3 70.5% 49.1% Rare Disease 33.6 37.3 -9.8% -12.5% 8.1 8.2 -1.5% -12.3% 24.5 28.2 -13.0% -13.1% 1.1 1.0 13.0% 4.6% NutropinAq 20.8 24.5 -15.3% -15.5% 0.0 0.0 - - 19.9 23.7 -15.9% -16.1% 0.8 0.8 3.6% 0.5% Increlex 12.8 12.8 -0.2% -7.4% 8.0 8.2 -2.8% -13.4% 4.6 4.5 2.3% 2.5% 0.2 0.1 70.3% 25.6% Total Sales 2 208.5 1 912.3 15.5% 9.5% 759.2 649.8 16.8% 4.0% 924.7 887.3 4.2% 3.7% 524.6 375.2 39.8% 32.5%Q3 Total North America Europe Rest of the World 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER10 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER10 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER10 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER10 Oncology 603.1 552.3 9.2% 1.2% 234.1 217.4 7.7% -7.4% 248.8 254.1 -2.1% -2.3% 120.2 80.8 48.8% 35.3% Somatuline 311.9 313.0 -0.3% -9.8% 193.6 183.7 5.4% -9.4% 86.0 107.6 -20.1% -19.9% 32.4 21.8 48.7% 36.1% Decapeptyl 131.4 110.1 19.3% 14.9% 0.0 0.0 - - 70.1 65.9 6.4% 6.6% 61.3 44.2 38.6% 27.2% Cabometyx 115.5 91.8 25.9% 21.8% 4.2 3.3 28.4% 13.5% 84.7 73.9 14.6% 14.4% 26.6 14.6 82.6% 61.1% Onivyde 38.8 35.2 10.1% -5.3% 33.4 30.3 10.3% -5.7% 5.4 4.7 14.6% 1.6% 0.0 0.2 n/a11 n/a11 Tazverik 2.8 0.0 n/a11 n/a11 2.8 0.0 n/a11 n/a11 0.0 0.0 - - 0.0 0.0 - - Other Oncology 2.6 2.2 18.1% 18.2% 0.1 0.1 -36.3% -43.6% 2.6 2.1 24.3% 24.9% 0.0 0.0 - - Neuroscience 160.7 103.8 54.8% 43.4% 42.6 26.7 59.7% 36.0% 44.9 34.7 29.3% 29.3% 73.3 42.4 72.7% 59.8% Dysport 158.0 102.5 54.1% 43.3% 42.6 26.7 59.7% 36.0% 44.9 34.7 29.3% 29.3% 70.5 41.1 71.5% 60.0% Other Neuroscience 2.7 1.3 n/a11 54.1% 0.0 0.0 - - 0.0 0.0 - - 2.7 1.3 n/a11 54.1% Rare Disease 11.0 11.7 -5.4% -9.3% 3.2 2.7 18.5% 2.7% 7.4 8.7 -14.6% -14.6% 0.5 0.3 44.6% 33.3% NutropinAq 6.3 7.5 -16.1% -16.4% 0.0 0.0 - - 5.9 7.2 -17.1% -17.2% 0.3 0.3 9.1% 3.7% Increlex 4.8 4.2 13.5% 3.3% 3.2 2.7 18.4% 2.7% 1.5 1.5 -2.7% -2.1% 0.1 0.0 n/a11 n/a11 Total Sales 774.8 667.8 16.0% 7.6% 279.9 246.8 13.4% -2.6% 301.1 297.5 1.2% 1.1% 193.9 123.5 57.0% 43.7%Forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen‚Äôs management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance.

This situation has prompted the Group to adopt a prudent stance again with regard to its business over the coming months.NB: All revenue growth figures reported herein are at constant exchange rates and consolidation scope  unless otherwise stated.Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its unaudited revenues for the third quarter of 2022  covering the period from 1 July to 30 September 2022  and for the first nine months of 2022.Nine-month 2022 revenues:‚Ç¨m 9M 2021 Like-for-likechange Currencyimpact 9M 2022 LFL change(excl. currencyimpact) Reportedgrowth (incl.currencyimpact) France 56.8 3.6 - 60.4 +6.3% +6.3% International 65.1 8.3 1.2 74.6 +12.8% +14.6% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 121.9 11.9 1.2 135.0 +9.8% +10.7%Q3 2022 revenues‚Ç¨m Q3 2021 Like-for-likechange Currencyimpact Q3 2022 LFL change(exc. currency impact) Reportedgrowth (incl.currencyimpact) France 17.7 2.6 - 20.3 +14.7% +14.7% International 23.1 4.5 0.6 28.2 +19.4% +22.0% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 40.8 7.1 0.6 48.5 +17.3% +18.9%Breakdown by clusterFrance clusterThe France cluster posted revenues of ‚Ç¨60.4m for the nine months ended 30 September 2022  up 6.3% versus the previous year. This performance reflects in particular the continued improvement in on-trade sales in the third quarter coupled with robust sales in the off-trade market. Consequently Q3 revenues were up 14.7% versus 2021.Story continuesRevenue growth continued for the Group‚Äôs main brands over the first nine months of 2022  in particular Marie Brizard  Sobieski and San Jos√©. Our brands are positioned in line with customer needs in the current inflationary environment. In a declining market for under-12-year blended whisky (down 7.5% for the first nine months of 2022)  William Peel maintained its sales volumes compared to the first nine months of 2021 thanks to a competitive positioning still bolstered by the new listing obtained in the second half of 2021.However  in view of the ongoing severe supply chain disruption and sharp price rises for raw materials  particularly in the glass industry  the Group continues to adopt allocation measures per brand based on available volumes. Likewise  the necessary sales policy adjustments announced previously are being maintained and will continue in order to adapt to this changing environment.International clusterThe International cluster posted nine-month 2022 revenues of ‚Ç¨74.6m  up 12.8% versus 2021 at constant exchange rates.Western Europe enjoyed a favourable economic climate over the first nine months  with on-trade growth confirmed versus 2021  still driven by Marie Brizard.In Spain  nine-month revenues were up 12.8% versus 2021  mainly driven by strong subcontracting business and a sustained performance by strategic brands  primarily Marie Brizard and William Peel.Scandinavia posted nine-month revenues up 30.6%  also driven by Marie Brizard sales.The Baltic States posted nine-month revenues up 13.3%  including a slight upturn in the third quarter mainly due to brand performance driven by a proactive pricing policy and a buoyant bulk market.Bulgaria confirmed its growth trend with third quarter revenues up 18.9% across the entire brand portfolio (spirits and wines) in both domestic and export markets.In Poland  Gautier and Marie Brizard sales rose sharply in the first nine months of 2022 despite a slowdown in the third quarter.In the United States  nine-month revenues continued to fall short of 2021 performance  still impacted by a highly competitive vodka market (Sobieski) and inventory adjustment by our local distributor. Marie Brizard and Gautier continue to grow in this market.Brazil revenues edged up in Q3 2022  mainly driven by local brands underpinned by a proactive pricing policy.In Asia Pacific  the positive trend in the first half of 2022 was confirmed in the third quarter by sustained performance  particularly in South Korea and Australia.OutlookOngoing increases in raw material prices  surging energy costs and continued volatility in supplier production availability are factors we have already mentioned that must be taken into account when assessing the level and performance of the Group‚Äôs business activities.If they continue  these adverse factors could have an impact on the Group‚Äôs ability to supply all of its customers (in France and abroad) and on potential flexibility in consumer demand upset by sharp price rises.Despite the level of business growth since the start of the year  the prevailing situation obliges the Group to continue to proactively adapt pricing policies with customers. The Group will therefore continue to adopt a prudent stance with regard to its business level over the coming months  usually an important period as the year draws to a close  and perhaps also at the start of 2023.Financial calendarQ4 and full-year 2022 revenues: 16 February 2023Contact Relations Investisseurs et ActionnairesGroupe MBWSEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comT√©l : +33 1 43 91 62 40 Contact PresseImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr ‚Äì lmaury@image7.frT√©l : +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group based in Europe and the United States.

The purpose of the buyback is to return excess capital to shareholders. The intention is that shares repurchased as part of this program will initially be held in treasury. 3 259 529 shares are held in treasury as at 26 October 2022 with 58% of these treasury shares repurchased for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of various employee incentive plans and the remaining 42% repurchased for the purpose of returning excess capital to shareholdersOn 21 October 2022  Flow Traders announced a proposed implementation of an updated corporate holding structure  as an enabler of its global strategic ambition. This proposed update will involve a top holding company in Bermuda and is the result of a thorough legal and capital structure review. This will be formally proposed to shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting  scheduled to take place on 2 December 2022 at 14.00 CETManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:‚ÄúThis quarter delivered further proof points with respect to the diligent execution of our strategic growth agenda  particularly in fixed income. Our liquidity provision across the fixed income space which includes ETFs as well as corporate credit and emerging markets sovereign bonds continues to be positively received by the buy-side and we were delighted to be the lead sponsor once again at the recent Fixed Income Leadership Summit in Nice. Another landmark for Flow Traders was the successful approval of our QFII license which is a key part of our plan to enter the mainland China market. Given the strong financial performance in the quarter and within the context of our capital allocation framework  we have elected to increase the current share buyback program to a new total size of up to ‚Ç¨40 million. This buyback will further enhance the capital returns to our shareholders.‚ÄúWe have also worked hard this quarter on laying the groundwork for the future. The proposed update to the corporate holding structure was announced on 21 October 2022 and is a natural enabler for the strategic ambition which the team outlined at the Capital Markets Update held in July. In addition  we created an Executive Committee in order to accelerate the implementation of our strategy as well as to ensure that our leadership talent pool grows alongside the needs of the business. Lastly  it is also pleasing that in a highly competitive employment market  we are still able to attract and recruit the best talent and we welcomed a large intake of 18 new graduates in September to complement our already highly talented team.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúThe third quarter saw a more active fixed income market given interest rate and inflation impacts. This contributed to an overall strong trading performance  which was particularly evident in EMEA. Across other asset classes  realized volatility remained subdued compared to earlier in the year. Our trading footprint continues to grow as we successfully executed our first ever on-shore China trades. From a broader trading perspective  we remained focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities. We have enduring confidence in our ability to expand our trading activities across these various asset classes going forward.‚ÄùMike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:‚ÄúIndicative of the success of our trading diversification strategy  Flow Traders achieved a return on trading capital of 67% in Q3. Once again  the firm‚Äôs trading capital continues to generate attractive and economically accretive returns. From an operating cost perspective  we have had to contend with a changing macro environment which has brought rising inflation as well as a strengthening US dollar. We are therefore seeking to absorb these impacts while at the same time ensuring we continue to invest in the business in order to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable returns for our stakeholders. The adjusted profit-sharing percentage continues to effectively ensure that the base compensation increases implemented in Q2 are income statement neutral as communicated before. A key focus for the remainder of this year and next is to further increase the underlying efficiency of the business as we prepare ourselves for Flow Traders‚Äô next stage of growth.‚ÄúA key takeaway from the recent Capital Markets Update was the importance of engaging more intensely in the ecosystem we operate and thrive in. With that in mind  we have continued to support new products and listings across the crypto space and  notably  worked with exchanges and ETP issuers around the Ethereum upgrade. The pace of our strategic investments has naturally slowed somewhat with the advent of the ‚Äòcrypto winter‚Äô which has allowed for more time to work with partners on build-out and development. Nonetheless  Flow Traders Capital still announced five investments during the third quarter.‚ÄúPreliminary Financial Calendar2 December 2022 EGM12 January 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q422 / FY22 results9 February 2023 Release Q422 / FY22 results (incl. analyst conference call)24 February 2023 Release 2022 Annual Report31 March 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q123 trading update21 April 2023 Release Q123 trading update (no analyst conference call)26 April 2023 AGMContact DetailsFlow Traders N.V.InvestorsJonathan BergerPhone: +31 20 7996149Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996125Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial products  historically specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)  now expanding into other asset classes.

The policy is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On this basis  the following items were adjusted or excluded for the Q322 trading update: Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of prior years‚Äô share plans.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q3 2022 ResultsRevenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨2 664 million  an increase of 23.7% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency. Revenue includes a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit in Recorded Music from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider (the ""Legal Settlement"")  as well as a ‚Ç¨21 million negative impact in Music Publishing from a previously announced change in accounting policy.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters.UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 26.5% year-over-year  or 15.4% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨539 million  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. EBITDA margin was 20.2%  compared to 19.8% in the third quarter of 2021. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨14 million during the third quarter of 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨15 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the third quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was ‚Ç¨553 million  up 20.0% year-over-year  or 9.1% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.8%  compared to 21.4% in the third quarter of 2021.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 included a ‚Ç¨52 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  partially offset by the negative ‚Ç¨7 million impact from the Change in Society Accounting.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were also impacted by the timing of certain A&R expenses  which increased in the quarter but remain down year-to-date  and by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards Merchandising and Other revenues  which carry a significantly lower EBITDA margin than the Company's other revenues. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat versus the prior-year quarter.YTD 2022 ResultsIn the nine months ended September 30  2022  UMG's revenues of ‚Ç¨7 398 million increased by 23.6%  or 15.6% in constant currency  compared to the nine months ended September 30  2021. This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2022 includes a ‚Ç¨123 million benefit from the Change in Society Accounting  and a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  both discussed above. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2021 included a ‚Ç¨41 million benefit from a catch up payment from a digital service provider ""DSP Catch-Up Payment""  previously disclosed and booked in Q2 2021. Excluding these items  revenue increased 21.2% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  EBITDA of ‚Ç¨1 499 million grew 20.1% year-over-year  or 12.6% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 20.3% compared to 20.9% in the prior year period. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨16 million during the nine months through Q3 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨18 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the nine months through Q3 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 was ‚Ç¨1 515 million  up 17.8% compared to the comparable period in 2021  or up 10.2% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.0pp year-over-year to 20.5%.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 benefitted from the Change in Society Accounting (‚Ç¨27 million) and the Legal Settlement (‚Ç¨52 million). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended Q3 2021 benefitted from the DSP Catch-Up Payment (‚Ç¨26 million)  as well as from a previously disclosed recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release""  ‚Ç¨20 million) in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA grew 15.8% year-over-year  or 8.0% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%  compared to 20.9% for the nine months ended Q3 2021. The contraction in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards lower-margin Merchandising revenues in the first nine months of 2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedSeptember 30 %%Nine Months EndedSeptember 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance measures or indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue.

The combination will create a leading Dutch insurance company. This step enables Aegon to accelerate its strategy and represents a major step in its ambition to become a leader in its chosen markets. Aegon will receive EUR 2.5 billion in gross cash proceeds  and a 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r.  with associated governance rights. Aegon‚Äôs Dutch asset management activities will remain part of Aegon‚Äôs global asset manager. Aegon will enter into a long-term asset management agreement with a.s.r. to manage parts of the combination‚Äôs general account investments  the investments of the Premium Pension Institution (PPI) offering of Aegon Cappital  and a.s.r.‚Äôs mortgage funds.‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement marks a major milestone in the history of our company and in our long-term ambition to create leaders in our chosen markets‚Äù  said Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon. ‚ÄúBoth Aegon and a.s.r. are deeply rooted in Dutch society and share a long and rich history. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees  Aegon the Netherlands has been able to improve its performance in recent years. We‚Äôre now building on that success by creating a Dutch insurance leader. I‚Äôm convinced that the combination of our companies is in the best long-term interest of all stakeholders and Dutch society at large. Customers of both companies will benefit from a more diversified product offering and strong distribution.Story continues‚ÄúThis transaction provides a unique opportunity to accelerate both the return of capital to shareholders and our strategy of investing in markets where we are well positioned for growth. Our priority continues to be to further improve our operational performance and grow profitably. The increased focus and resources resulting from this transaction  will place us in a better position for the future growth of the company.‚ÄùJos Baeten  CEO of a.s.r. said: ‚ÄúI am pleased to announce today that a.s.r. and Aegon the Netherlands  two renowned Dutch companies  deeply rooted in Dutch society  will create a leader in Dutch insurance. Together we will form a sustainable  leading insurer and strengthen our market position as the number two insurer in the market. Given the joined strength of both companies  the company will provide a good home for all Aegon the Netherlands employees  customers  and relations. As employees of a.s.r.  we will work with the new colleagues on the future of this combination. The starting point will be  one company  one culture  by leveraging the best of both organizations. We look forward to welcoming all employees  customers  and relations of Aegon the Netherlands in the near future.‚Äù1 Value of 29.99% stake is EUR 2.4 billion based on the closing price of a.s.r.‚Äôs shares on October 26  2022 and 57 million shares to be received by Aegon upon closing of the transaction before any potential equity offering by a.s.r. as part of the funding of the transaction.Compelling strategic rationaleCombining the two companies will result in a strong well-diversified Dutch insurance company that will be able to deliver a broad range of attractive products and services and generate attractive shareholder returns.The combined group will:have a leading position in the Dutch pension market. This will lead to more attractive value propositions to customers as the company is well placed to capture opportunities from the upcoming pension reform;become the market leader in disability insurance and the number three player in property and casualty insurance  facilitating a more competitive product offering;have enhanced scale in the origination and servicing of Dutch mortgages  creating the opportunity for more streamlined and improved operations;have stronger distribution activities by combining Aegon‚Äôs and a.s.r.‚Äôs expertise  resources  and platforms in this area; anddeliver significant synergies through the integration of the closed individual life portfolios of the two companies into one platform.The combination will be well positioned to further extend its role in the Dutch insurance market in the field of sustainability and ESG and contribute to finding solutions to the main challenges society faces that have a clear relationship with the core activities of the new combination.Combining the two companies is expected to lead to substantial cost synergies and diversification benefits. Aegon will benefit from a.s.r.‚Äôs improved operating capital generation and capital synergies through its 29.99% stake in the company. Aegon will bring to a.s.r. significant risk management capabilities and accelerate the implementation of a Partial Internal Model for the calculation of the Solvency II required capital of the combination.Leveraging Aegon Asset Management‚Äôs capabilitiesAegon has agreed an exclusive long-term partnership with a.s.r. to manage the illiquid investments that are part of the general account of the combined businesses. In addition  it will continue to be the asset manager for the investments of Aegon Cappital‚Äôs PPI proposition and will take over the management of a.s.r.‚Äôs mortgage funds. Through these steps  Aegon Asset Management will further strengthen its position as a provider in the Dutch market of fiduciary services  retirement multi-assets & solutions  fixed income  including alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing.Governance of combinationAegon N.V. will be a 29.99% strategic  supportive shareholder in a.s.r.  allowing Aegon to participate in the financial benefits that the combination will bring. Furthermore  Aegon will have the right to nominate two candidates for the a.s.r. Supervisory Board. Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon N.V will be nominated as a non-independent member  and Danielle Jansen Heijtmajer  Chair of the Supervisory Board of Aegon the Netherlands  will be nominated as an independent member of the Supervisory Board of a.s.r.. The non-independent member has an affirmative vote within a.s.r.‚Äôs Supervisory Board on certain topics  in line with the size of Aegon‚Äôs shareholding.Integration and organization of companiesThe activities of a.s.r. and Aegon the Netherlands will be integrated after closing of the transaction to maximize the potential of the two businesses and fully benefit from their combined reach  scale  and resources. The integration is expected to impact employees in both companies. The integration will be largely completed within three years  and the intention is to minimize the number of redundancies through natural attrition and by helping people to the greatest extent possible to find jobs either inside or outside of the combination. The process will be executed in a fair  diligent  and open way  respecting the talents and strengths of people in both organizations. Employees of the combination will benefit from the sharing of best practices and greater long-term career opportunities within a larger  more diversified Dutch company.The a.s.r. brand will be the leading brand of the combination. The Aegon brand will remain in use in the pension and mortgage markets for three years after closing of the transaction. There will be no change for the brands of Aegon‚Äôs other entities  including TKP  Knab  Robidus and Nedasco.Accelerating transformationThe transaction represents a major step in the transformation of Aegon  building on the successful execution of the strategy outlined at the Capital Markets Day of December 2020 to create leaders in chosen markets. The transaction forms a leader in the Dutch insurance market and enables Aegon to increase its focus on creating advantaged businesses in chosen markets outside the Netherlands.In the US  Aegon will build upon Transamerica‚Äôs leading positions in both individual life insurance solutions and the workplace pension business  investing capital to profitably grow its market share in selected product lines. Additionally  Transamerica will continue to take management actions designed to further improve the risk-return profile of the business. In the UK  Aegon‚Äôs ambition is to continue to profitably grow both the Retail and Workplace channels of its leading platform business by improving its customer propositions  service capabilities and digital experience for advisors  employers  and customers. The transaction allows Aegon Asset Management to strengthen its position in retirement-related investment solutions  alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing  and to build leadership in these areas. In its growth markets  Aegon will continue to look to invest capital in value-added growth opportunities. More details will be shared on the plans to profitably grow the strategic businesses in Aegon‚Äôs core markets  its growth markets  and its global asset manager at a Capital Markets Day in the second quarter of 2023.Use of proceeds and financial implicationsAegon anticipates that it will return EUR 1.5 billion of the cash proceeds to shareholders  barring unforeseen circumstances  to offset the dilutive effect of the transaction on free cash flow per share. Furthermore  the company intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million.A priority for Aegon moving forward is to drive sustainable  profitable growth for Transamerica and to execute upon additional in-force management actions designed to improve the risk-return profile of the business. It is anticipated that this will require funding and therefore Aegon expects to maintain its Cash Capital at the Holding above the middle of the operating range of EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion in the near term. Surplus Cash Capital at the Holding above the operating range will be subject to continued disciplined capital management  whereby capital that is not used for value-added growth opportunities will be returned to shareholders over time.Update on financial targets; increase in dividend per shareOn completion of the transaction  Aegon will replace its full ownership of the cash flow and profits of its Dutch businesses with its 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r.. In the near term  this is expected to translate into lower free cash flow  improving over time as synergies emerge from the combination. On completion of the capital return to shareholders and realization of the synergies  Aegon anticipates that its free cash flow on a per share basis will be higher than pre-transaction levels.The progress that Aegon has made on its transformation allows the company to increase its pay-out ratio and rebase the targeted dividend per share over 2023 from the current level of around 25 eurocents to around 30 eurocents.All other financial targets will be updated in due course.The transaction is expected to reduce IFRS shareholders‚Äô equity by EUR 3.3 billion based on the balance sheet position on June 30  2022. This includes the impact from the settlement of a tax position at closing of the transaction  which is not anticipated to have a material impact on Aegon‚Äôs Cash Capital at the Holding.Group supervision implicationsAegon will engage with its college of supervisors on the implications for group supervision upon closing of the intended transaction. Regardless of the outcome  Aegon intends to maintain its head office in the Netherlands. Its shares will remain listed on Euronext in Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange.Indicative timelinesThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including regulatory and antitrust approvals  shareholder approvals  and the completion of the works council consultation processes of both Aegon and a.s.r..Aegon will convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM) and request approval for the proposed combination between Aegon the Netherlands and a.s.r.. The EGM is expected to be held on January 18  2023. The Board of the Association Aegon has been informed of Aegon‚Äôs ambition to accelerate its strategy and the proposed combination with a.s.r.. The Board is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for its support.Based on the required steps  and necessary approvals  the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023.About AegonAegon is an integrated  diversified  international financial services group.

(Recall that during the first half of 2022  e-commerce product sales decreased by approximately 15%. Source: Fevad) Growth over the first nine months of 2022 is now up 14%  an acceleration of two points compared to the first half. Payment volume growth continues to be spread across our main market segments: France  iGaming and International.It‚Äôs worth noting that the development of the omni-channel offering is taking shape. In-store payment volume represents 9% of flows in France since the beginning of the year (vs. 3% in 2021). This has enabled HiPay to establish its position as an omni-channel payment specialist.An upturn in business once again results in double-digit quarterly revenue growthThird quarter 2022 revenue reached 14.3 million euros  an increase of 2 million euros and a 16% increase compared to the third quarter of 2021  despite the end of Direct Banking payment methods in the iGaming segment  whose volumes have shifted to other less profitable payment methods. Adjusted for this unfavourable mix effect  revenue growth reached an increase of 22% for the quarter  which is in line with performance over 2019-2021 (CAGR of 25% over the first 9 months of the year).Story continuesThe ratio of revenue to payment volumes  which reflects HiPay's ability to monetise its services  shows stabilisation. This ratio reached 0.82% in the third quarter of 2022 (vs 0.84% in 2021)  impacted by the iGaming payment mix effect for -1 bp (basis points) and by the growth in payment volumes at points of sale for -2 bp.Cumulated over the first 9 months of the year  the iGaming payment mix effect cost HiPay 2.7 million euros in revenue  i.e.  -7 growth points. The revenue ratio on payment volume thus reached 0.78% (vs. 0.84% in 2021). The erosion of -6 bps is explained by -5 bps from the iGaming payment method mix and -3 bps from the growth of payment volume at points of sale. Consequently  excluding these two mix effects  the monetisation of payment volume increased by 0.02 pts  which reflects the business strategy pursued over the course of several half-year periods.The negative mix effect on revenue caused by the end of the use of Direct Banking payments in the iGaming segment  having taken place in 2021  is expected to continue until the end of the fourth quarter of 2022  but no further.Robust momentum in HiPay‚Äôs business in France and abroad offers promising future prospectsHiPay‚Äôs European expansion continues through new agreements with the following retail players:In Italy   with the strengthening of its strategic partnership with IC Intracom  users of the HiPay MOTO solution  in addition to the launch of the Salutea parapharmaceutical siteIn Portugal   through the agreement with Mr Blue  which bolsters HiPay's status as e-commerce Fashion Retail payment expert in this marketIn Spain   through its work with Aladinia  the Spanish leader in gift experiences.In the United Kingdom  through the signing of Bludiode.com  an international electronic goods merchantAdditionally  the iGaming business continues to grow.

At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  the Group recorded growth of 14.0%  despite persistent supply chain issues in its various businesses  particularly in agricultural spraying and sugar beet harvesters.The change in consolidation scope arising from the Group‚Äôs two recent acquisitions (EXEL Yachting and G.F.) contributed ‚Ç¨5.2 million to fourth quarter sales.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 37.8%After peaking in spring 2022  accentuated by the conflict in Ukraine  agricultural commodity prices fell slightly during the summer and stabilized at levels still well above pre-COVID prices. Against this backdrop  demand remained strong in all regions  particularly North America  while the component shortage shows no sign of abating.The exceptionally well-stocked order book enabled the various Group companies to mitigate sales seasonality and carry out a significant amount of billing during the quarter.Story continuesSUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 18.9%After a third quarter particularly impacted by component shortages and a resurgence of COVID in Germany  business caught up strongly in the fourth quarter  resulting in record billings for sales of sugar beet harvesters.LEISURE: UP 21.7%The garden equipment market declined in the Group‚Äôs three main operating regions (the United Kingdom  France and Italy). In this context and after a series of challenging quarters (IT migration)  Q4 business came close to the previous year‚Äôs levels  bolstered by a more favorable basis of comparison than in previous quarters.The EXEL Yachting business posted a satisfactory quarterly performance with deliveries in line with forecasts.INDUSTRY: UP 5.1%At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  business was stable during the quarter: technical hoses and industrial spraying saw a slight slowdown in volumes in Europe  offset by ongoing robust momentum in Asia and  to a lower extent  the USA.Situation in Ukraine and RussiaThe new sanctions announced in early October do not affect Group products any more than the previous sanctions. As previously announced  EXEL Industries has maintained its operations in Russia (agricultural equipment and industrial spraying) but has taken care to ensure that deliveries are made in compliance with international regulations. The Group has been able to maintain overall sales volumes in the region.FY 2021‚Äì2022 salesFull-year 2021‚Äì2022 sales amounted to ‚Ç¨977.0 million  up 11.4%. Growth at constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates was 4.4%. EXEL Industries‚Äô concern was to adjust prices across all of its business lines  in response to rising raw material and component costs. This policy implemented throughout the year offset certain volume declines due to shortages (mainly agricultural equipment) or to the market slowdown (gardening). The currency effect was particularly favorable to the agricultural spraying and industry segments.The change in consolidation scope represented sales of ‚Ç¨29.8 million for the year.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 16.1%The agricultural spraying business was impacted by varying trends during the year: on the one hand  Group brands were hard hit by persisting component shortages despite very different production bases (Europe  the USA). Prices were increased throughout the period in order to pass on price increases implemented by supplier. On the other hand  order intake was boosted by the stabilization of agricultural commodity prices at globally high levels  giving the Group clear visibility over the coming fiscal year.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 8.0%After recovering in 2020‚Äì2021  sales remained strong during the fiscal year ended. In addition  component shortages allowed the Group to clear a large volume of used machine inventories. Lastly  prices were increased to offset increases in production costs (steel and other components).LEISURE: UP 4.9%The gardening business was impacted by three factors during the year. After two exceptional years in terms of volumes  markets returned to pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile  challenges related to the migration of IT systems curbed leisure business volumes by around ‚Ç¨10 million. Prices were increased during the year to offset significant increases in the cost of raw materials and logistics. Lastly  the acquisition of G.F. on February 15  2022  resulted in a scope effect increasing sales for this activity by approximately ‚Ç¨20 million.A new sales  marketing and industrial drive launched in the nautical business is expected to impact the coming years.INDUSTRY: UP 9.5%The underlying markets (mainly automotive  furniture and industry) experienced contrasting trends. However  the industrial spraying business continued to post high volumes throughout the year in line with the previous year.The technical hose division was impacted by declining volumes in the gardening business  while the B2B business was impacted by falling demand towards the end of the year.Yves Belegaud  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group  said:‚ÄúThe strong commitment of our teams in the fourth quarter and the successful integration of our latest acquisitions allowed us to post record sales. This excellent performance was achieved in a challenging and volatile environment in which shortages have not been recovered. However  the Group is confident in its ability to continue its development  underpinned by the various business sectors in which it operates and a well-stocked order book.‚ÄùUpcoming eventsDecember 20  2022  before market opening: 2021‚Äì2022 full-year results.January 25  2023  before market opening: Q1 2022‚Äì2023 sales.About EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.

These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 27  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

For the third year in a row  we realized a substantial top line growth  while slightly reducing operating expenses  on a like for like basis. We also achieved Cash-Flow positive  as well as significant improvements on all the other financial KPIs. This is even more remarkable  because it was achieved during a time still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing concerns about the global economy due to the ramifications of the war in Ukraine with high energy prices and increased inflation.A summary of the key financials is provided in the table below:Due to the change in the period of the accounting year 2020-21 (to 18 months)  it is more difficult to analyze and compare the financials of the accounting year 2021-22 with the previous accounting years. As already remarked  the current accounting year covers the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 (12 months)  while the previous accounting year 2020-21 covers the period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021 (18 months). Additionally  the accounting year 2019 was based on a 12-month period but from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. To enable easier comparison  we also include below the income statement for the current accounting year and the pro-forma income statement for the two previous years  covering the same 12-months period from 1 July to 30 June the following year. This enables a clearer view of the revenue growth and significant improvements in all financial KPIs  comparing the same period.Story continuesRevenue increased year-over-year by 40% to ‚Ç¨2.371.000 in 2021-22 compared to ‚Ç¨1.698.000 in the same period in 2020-21. It is very encouraging to highlight that this growth is not only due to non-recurring service revenue  but also the recurring service revenue increased substantially year-over-year (+72%) and recurring licenses remained essentially stable compared with the previous year.Costs for maps and data increased by 20 8% compared to the 12-months period of the prior year. These costs are related to content purchased to maintain and enrich the database and to hosting cost for delivering our data solutions via the cloud.Personnel expenses decreased in 2021-22  showing a 3% saving compared to the same period in 2020-21 despite a 40% higher revenue. The main drivers for this are a reduction in certain management roles in February 2022 and lower use of outsourced resources in the Netherlands and India during the second half of the accounting year.The depreciation cost on tangible fixed assets remained nearly flat year over year while amortization costs on intangible assets slightly increased. This increase is due to higher capitalized development costs and the amortization of these assets. Capitalized development costs are currently amortized over a period of 7 years  while before 2018  they were amortized over a longer period (15 to 20 years). Note that the book value of the database is subject to impairment testing. This means that the book value is compared to the value in use for the company. Per 30 June 2022  an impairment test was executed. This did not show a requirement for any additional impairment loss.Other operating expenses decreased more than 13% compared to the same period in 2020-21. This is the result of the implementation of a strict spending review  cost control measures  integration of tools and simplification of the group structure.Total Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 3% and Net Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 7% compared with the previous 12-months period. This confirms the general positive mood in which the company is operating today  capable of ‚Äúdelivering more with less‚Äù.Operating Result  despite still negative  shows an improvement of 63%  while the Net Loss was reduced by 46%  compared with the previous year.The net cash flow from operating activities in 2021-22 amounted to a positive cash inflow of ‚Ç¨131.000 compared to cash outflow of ‚Ç¨1.035.000 in the same period in 2020-21. This is primarily due to the significant improvement in the operating result and more favorable invoicing and collection terms negotiated with our customers and suppliers. During the accounting year 2021-22 there were no financing transactions  while  during the 2020-21 12-months period  a private placement was completed in December 2020  raising ‚Ç¨825.000 in equity funding.As an independent player  GeoJunxion focuses on creating ‚Äúmap agnostic‚Äù products  i.e.  designed to be fully integrated into any commercial and open-source brand of maps or utilized in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases in different industries and market sectors.GeoJunxion activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with its customers  through the creation of a recurring business model rather than one-off projects or transactions. Although the relationship may start with a proof-of-concept or a one-off project  most of our high value datasets require frequent and continuous updates to maintain or increase their value. As a result  the one-off project or proof-of-concept is often only a first step  followed by a recurring service or a license contract. As a result  converting the initial  one-off project into a recurring  predictable and sustainable revenue stream. In most cases  GeoJunxion also retains the IP and ownership of the newly developed datasets which can then be resold to other customers  thereby leveraging the initial investment and converting it into a virtuous business cycle.The GeoJunxion mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the environmental impact through intelligent solutions which enable more environmentally conscious decisions.GeoJunxion has valued diversity  integration and investment in social responsibility for years. We are committed to offering our daily contribution towards a better and more sustainable work environment. For this reason  the company has applied for PSO certification in 2020. PSO is the Dutch abbreviation for ‚ÄúPrestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen‚Äù  Performance ladder Social Entrepreneurship. In July 2022 we achieved Level 2 PSO certification  as one of the first publicly listed organizations in the Netherlands.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKLooking at the future  despite the general uncertainty pictured by the European Central Bank  GeoJunxion expects to see its top line to continue growing by 25 to 30% year over year. This expectation is built on orders booked in the first quarter of 2022-23 and a solid pipeline of opportunities. As a result of inflationary pressure and growing staff costs to deliver the projects  we expect our cost base to increase by 5 to 10%. GeoJunxion is reasonably confident to convert the above-mentioned guidance into positive EBITDA and EBIT close to break-even. On this basis  cash flow is  once again  expected to be positive for the accounting year 2022-23.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS / IMPORTANT NOTICEThis document contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial position and results of GeoJunxion.

12231,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2022-q3-revenue-report-160000932.html,2022 Q3 Revenue Report,The transition to a geographical rebalancing of revenue continues Operational transition still underway in FranceDynamic growth of activities outside France ...,SOLUTIONS 30The transition to a geographical rebalancing of revenue continuesOperational transition still underway in FranceDynamic growth of activities outside FranceConfirmation of long-term outlook driven by excellent momentum outside FrancePriority given to organic growth and maintaining a financial structure with low debtGrowth to pick up in 2023 and profitability to improve in tandemIn millions of euros 9 months Q3 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change Total 656.8 653.5 +0.5% 212.4 212.1 +0.1% From France 318.6 391.8 -18.7% 96.7 121.5 -20.4% From Benelux 152.1 114.2 +33.2% 53.6 39.3 +36.5% From other countries 186.1 147.5 +26.2% 62.1 51.3 +21.0%55% of group revenue generated outside of FranceConsolidated revenueIn the third quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 posted consolidated revenue of ‚Ç¨212.4 million  up 0.1% compared to the same period in 2021 (-2.4% on an organic basis).In line with previous quarters  performance in France continues to be impacted by the operational transition linked to the maturity of certain markets. Elsewhere in Europe  activities are growing quickly as the roll-out of fiber-optic networks gets underway in most of the countries where Solutions 30 operates.For the first nine months of 2022  Solutions 30‚Äôs consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨656.8 million  up +0.5% (-1.8% on an organic basis).Revenue by regionFrance: In the third quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of ‚Ç¨96.7 million  down 20.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021.With ‚Ç¨68.9 million in revenue  the telecom business is down 20.0% compared to the third quarter of 2021. This decline in business reflects the maturity of the market after the record levels of activity observed during the COVID crisis  which accelerated the deployment of ultra-fast broadband in France. The industry as a whole‚Äîcustomers as well as service providers and subcontractors‚Äîhas been forced to adapt and adjust to new ways of cooperating and to a temporary lack of visibility brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties. As a result  the operational conditions under which contracts are executed have significantly deteriorated in recent months and been aggravated by the current inflationary situation.Story continuesThis has implications for the entire industry and pricing renegotiations are underway. In this context  Solutions 30 is continuing its operational transition by building on its strong competitive advantages: a diversified customer and business portfolio  a healthy financial structure with little debt  and an agile organization.Revenue from the energy business amounted to ‚Ç¨11.5 million  compared with ‚Ç¨19.7 million a year earlier. This decline of 41.4% is due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France (activity down 79.6%). Even though revenue from the new energy transition and electric mobility verticals is still suffering from supply chain disruptions  it increased by 31%. However  this growth does not yet compensate for the decline in the company‚Äôs historic verticals.The IT business posted revenue of ‚Ç¨11.2 million  stable compared to last year‚Äôs third quarter  while the security and payments business is up 12.9%  generating ‚Ç¨5.1 million in revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨4.5 million a year earlier.Over the first nine months of the year  revenue is down 18.7% to ‚Ç¨318.6 million.Benelux: Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨53.6 million compared to ‚Ç¨39.3 million a year earlier  representing pure organic growth of 36.5% and reflecting the excellent dynamics of the Belgian and Dutch markets.The growth of the telecom business is accelerating due to the rapid ramp-up of the contracts signed with Fiberklaar  Open Dutch Fiber  and Unifiber. Revenue from fiber activities alone increased 4.5 times over the quarter  growing the telecom business by 40.1% and resulting in quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨40.3 million compared to ‚Ç¨28.8 million a year earlier.For the energy business  revenue was ‚Ç¨9.5 million compared to ‚Ç¨6.6 million a year earlier  a purely organic increase of 43.0%  thanks to the deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius.Quarterly revenue from the IT business remained stable at ‚Ç¨2.1 million while revenue from the retail and security businesses was ‚Ç¨1.7 million  compared to ‚Ç¨1.8 million for the third quarter of 2021.Over the first nine months of 2022  revenue grew by 33.2% to ‚Ç¨152.1 million  compared to ‚Ç¨114.2 million a year earlier.In all other countries  the group posted quaterly revenue of ‚Ç¨62.1 million  an increase of 21.0% (10.4% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue began to grow again and is up 7% to ‚Ç¨16.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨15.1 million a year earlier. As expected  the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization  as well as updated pricing conditions for certain major contracts  are starting to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 19% in the third quarter of 2022 to ‚Ç¨14.8 million  driven by the pursuit of TIM‚Äôs ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley  which began in the first quarter of 2021.On the Iberian peninsula  revenue grew by 8% to ‚Ç¨14.4 million  thanks to positive dynamics in the telecommunications sector (fiber and 5th generation mobile networks)  a strong uptick in installations of charging stations for electric vehicles  and pricing increases obtained from several customers.In Poland  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨7.9 million  up 35% (23% organic growth). Solutions 30 continues to gain market share in this country  while the integration of Sirtel into the portfolio of activities for 5G networks is progressing well. The organization put in place will ensure the company‚Äôs ability to support its customers‚Äô growth. The mobile networks business is growing rapidly and now accounts for nearly 10% of revenue.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted ‚Ç¨8.8 million in revenue during the quarter  up 92% (-11% on an organic basis). Solutions 30 has streamlined its operations to focus on higher-potential markets and the diversification of its services into fiber-optic networks  while the integration of Mono‚Äôs operations continues.In all these countries  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨186.1 million for the first nine months of 2022  an increase of 26.2% (15.8% on an organic basis) compared to the first nine months of 2021.OutlookIn response to current inflationary pressure  Solutions 30 is increasing its prices  both on new and existing contracts. The group has also taken measures to strictly control operating costs with the aim of preserving a solid financial structure with little debt. Such a structure will protect its ability to finance growth through acquisitions  increase its agility  strengthen its competitive advantages  and preserve its future capacity to pursue consolidation in its sector.In France  the market is in transition  which has led to limited short-term visibility. Against this backdrop  Solutions 30 will pursue its action plan to restore growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan involves (i) winning marketshare in the mature telecoms sector where a second phase of consolidation is expected to take place; (ii) developing new  high-growth activities  especially in the energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles; and (iii) seeking out synergies between the various businesses  accompanied by a reallocation of technicians to businesses with greater potential.In the Benelux and other countries  growth will remain strong through the end of the year  with the same momentum it saw in the third quarter.For the group as a whole  the fourth-quarter trend should be in line with the first nine months of the year and 2022 revenue should remain at the same levels as in 2021. The increase in the EBITDA margin at the end of the year is subject to ongoing price negotiations.From 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth  driven by the development momentum of its activities outside France. It should also see an overall improvement in its profitability. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q4 Revenue and 2022 Annual Revenue Reports | January 26  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

12237,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4549871-growth-is-around-the-corner-for-golar-lng,Golar LNG Stock: Growth Is Around The Corner (NASDAQ:GLNG),Golar has completed a massive transformation process and is well-positioned for growth. Here's what investors need to know.,"LeestatNote: Golar LNG (NASDAQ:GLNG) is a company focused on floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facilities. I suggest readers review an interview from March 2020 in which I offer a detailed analysis of the company  with an update in May 2021 and a new update in January 2022. I believe these articles will provide a good basis for the one that follows.There has been a lot happening since my last article at the beginning of the year. I suppose the most important event from an external point of view is the fact that Golar's stock price has performed extremely well in a rough market  rising 85% in contrast to the S&P's 20% drop  according to the Seeking Alpha tracker.As value investors know all too well  Mr. Market is a manic-depressive animal whose irrational mood sometimes offers the opportunity to buy very high-quality assets at very attractive prices. Investors have gone from hate to love in a short period of time  causing a huge swing in the stock price in a period when Golar has not added any new projects/assets to his portfolio. There is no doubt that the environment has improved after the Russian invasion  but I firmly believe that the biggest driver of such an amazing performance is that Golar has delivered  alleviating most of the concerns surrounding the company in recent years.I would say that Mr. Karl Fredrik Staubo was key to achieving such a significant improvement. The market was somewhat dubious when he was named CEO in May 2021  as both the experienced CEO and CFO had just resigned from the company without giving much detail  suggesting that Golar's business was deteriorating  and Karl seemed too young to take on such a large responsibility. Since then  however  Karl has proven at every conference that he is a shark who wakes up angry every morning looking to create shareholder value. There is no doubt that he has done an excellent job at the helm  despite the haphazard nature of the events that have unfolded.Under Karl's leadership  Golar has undertaken a massive transformation process to crystallize value  strengthen the balance sheet and simplify the corporate structure. This year alone  the company has spun off its LNG carrier fleet and raised $275 million  sold approximately one-third of its New Fortress shares (NFE) raising $250 million  sold Golar Tundra FSRU for $350 million and agreed to sell the steam turbine carrier Golar Arctic as a converted FSRU to Italy's Snam for $288 million.In addition  the company has increased utilization of Hilli FLNG to mid-2026 and has reached swap agreements for 75% of 2H 2022  all of 2023  and half of its 2024 TTF-linked exposure at a staggering price  locking in a total of $274M while maintaining upside Brent exposure. It is worth remembering that prior to that  Golar had already started the process of unlocking value by selling Hygo and GMLP to New Fortress for $5 billion EV.All of these smart decisions have helped the company regain investor confidence  and are the main reason why Golar has soared from $11 per share when Karl came on board as CEO to the current >$25/share. The market ignored the company because it thought Golar's business was too complex and the balance sheet was weak. However  these two nagging arguments have been softened. In fact  Golar has a strong balance sheet with a net cash position  and valuing the company has never been easier. The company has two assets  only one of which is generating profits (Hilli FLNG)  while the other is under construction and will be deployed by the end of 2023 (Gimi FLNG). In addition  Golar has public stakes in NFE  CoolCo  and Avenir LNG.Hilli FLNGHilli is the world's best-performing FLNG. It is the only proven design that has excelled with 100% uptime  which has given Golar a unique reputation among its competitors. The asset has three sources of revenue:The base tolling tariff (T1 & T2)  which has been generating around $66 million of EBITDA/year  occasionally increased due to overproduction. The Brent bonus tariff which contributes $2.7 million for every dollar of Brent crude oil price above $60 up to $102. The TTF gas tariff (T3) based on 0.2 Mpta  which has recently been extended until mid-2026. As I mentioned earlier  Golar has hedged most of the European gas exposure for the next few years  ensuring cash flow visibility at huge TTF gas prices - i.e.  levels where energy is equivalent to a Brent oil price of $300/bbl.Hilli's FLNG is a cash cow  as Golar's share of debt and interest service is $50 per year (based on current high LIBOR rates of 3%)  implying that this asset alone will generate over $570 million of free cash flow to equity through 2024  which is over 21% of market capitalization in 2.5 years (40% if we exclude cash and marketable securities). It should be noted that Hilli is a tax-free asset and has almost no capex needs.Although Hilli's cash flow generation profile might surprise you  there is room for improvement  as Hilli is not yet fully utilized. But how much is this asset worth? You might be aware that Exmar recently sold its FLNG Tango to Eni for $572-$694 million. The final price depends on the barge's performance in the first six months on site. Knowing that the FLNG Tango performed above expectations in its short period of operations with YPF in 2020 and that the asset has been well maintained in the lay-up period  I expect the final price to be close to the upper range  being the only FLNG deal and showing how valuable an FLNG is.The Tango floating liquefaction plant  built in 2017  has an LNG storage capacity of 16 100m¬≥ and a liquefaction capacity of up to 0.6 million tonnes per year  while Hilli Episeyo FLNG is 294m in length with a storage capacity of 125 000m3  and was designed to produce about 2.4 million tonnes per year of LNG. In addition  Hilli has much higher specifications as it can perform in a more complex environment.Therefore  knowing that Tango FLNG was sold for $660 million and has one-quarter of the liquefaction capacity of Hilli FLNG as well as much lower specifications  we should argue that Hilli is worth at least $2.6 bn. Being very conservative  I am valuing Hilli at a significant discount to the price we reach by comparing a fair and recent transaction. Using a 10% WACC  we reach a value of $1.27 billion or $11.8/share. You can see my estimates in the following image.Hilli FLNG DCF model (Own elaboration based on my estimates)Be aware that Hilli's current contract with Perenco ends in mid-2026  but the asset has a long life left. I have argued in the past that Hilli will not leave Cameroon  but Golar has begun to explore other options in case Perenco does not make significant commitments. According to Cypriot and Greek media  Energean CEO Mathios Rigas proposed connecting Energean's gas fields in offshore Israel to a Hilli floating liquefied natural gas unit that would be stationed off Vasilikos  Cyprus  by the end of 2026  just after the current contract expires.That said  I remain confident that Perenco will increase production and extend the contract in late 2023 or early 2024 because if Hilli exits Cameroon  it will be extremely difficult for Perenco to monetize the remaining reserves. Therefore  once it happens  our valuation of Hilli will increase accordingly.In addition  our utilization rate  and therefore the valuation of the asset  could prove to be very conservative. It should be noted that Gazprom Marketing & Trading is now Hilli's off-taker. After the war  this entity has been under federal trusteeship and recapitalized with a contribution of about $10 billion from the German government. Following that liquidity injection  it was then renamed SEFE Securing European Energy and will soon be nationalized  so the buyer of Hilli liquified gas is now Germany  which is desperately seeking to increase its LNG supply. I understand that SEFE is in talks with Perenco about the possibility of adding at least 0.2 million tons and likely more  depending on production capacity. Based on the conservative assumptions well below the forward curve I provided above  an addition of 0.2 MPTA  which will only increase utilization to 66%  will generate an extra $350M from 2023 to mid-2026.Gimi FLNGGimi's conversion has continued steadily according to plan. Golar's latest earning presentation shows that the asset is 86% complete. However  Keppel has not been immune to the current logistical and inflation issues and Golar had to contribute an extra $35 million (70% of $50 million) to secure the delivery date. The Gimi FLNG will set sail in H1 2023 and will begin its 20-year contract by the end of that year. Golar owns 70% of Gimi  which has a $4.3bn order backlog. This means that Gimi will start contributing $151 million of EBITDA each year starting by Q4 2023 for the next 20 years  so despite recent minor difficulties  Gimi's economics look terrific. Be aware that according to current specifics  Gimi should be able to produce 10% more  so EBITDA could end up being higher than what I am modeling.Gimi's valuation is easier than Hilli's as there are no moving parts such as TTF or Brent exposure. $151M EBITDA  16-year straight debt amortization curve  which might be conservative on a 25+ year life and a 20-year contract value at a 5% interest rate. I understand that the company will refinance and increase the leverage of the asset once it is online  but it is something I am not modeling yet. I used a WACC of 8%. The lower discount rate than Hilli's is because BP is an extraordinary counterparty  and our profit forecast is less uncertain  as revenues are fixed and hedged against inflation. Therefore  according to my model  the asset is worth about $1.5 billion  and after deducting Golar's share debt and remaining capex  we reach an equity value of just under $0.8 billion or $7.2/share.Golar Marketable Securities and Net DebtAfter repayments on Golar's credit facilities  corporate debt is only the $300M unsecured Norwegian bond  with Golar's cash position being in excess of $700M after the latest sales. Note that I am considering Golar Arctic's net proceeds. Remember that Golar will convert its trading steam turbine LNG carrier  Golar Arctic  to an FSRU and upon conversion  ownership of the asset will be transferred to Snam  which will pay ‚Ç¨269.0M  but the conversion has a cost of $160M and is expected to take up to two years. All in all  Golar has a net corporate cash position (excluding Golar's share of Hilli and Gimi debt) of $400M.In addition  Golar holds marketable securities that could be liquidated in a short period of time for $845M. These are comprised of 12.4M shares of NFE  which at the current price of $50.7 implies $629M (or $806M taking the $65 consensus TP)  and 12.5M shares of CoolCo company worth $169M  which is listed on the Euronext market. We expect a dual listing in the U.S. in the coming months  and Avenir LNG stake is worth $47M.As Golar's management has pointed out on numerous occasions during recent conferences  Golar is not a holding company; therefore  I expect Golar to divest all of those holdings to fund FLNG's growth and that is the reason why I am not applying any holding discount. Due to the illiquidity of the CoolCo stake and the incredible prospects for LNG shipping  I personally expect Golar to distribute those shares as a special dividend to its shareholders once the company is listed on the U.S. market.Lastly  Golar's corporate costs are 21M per year  so after applying a multiple of 8x  we deduct $168M from our valuation. However  I am aware that core costs may decrease significantly after the CoolCo spin-off.Golar Sum Of Parts Target Price (Own elaboration based on my estimates)We reach a target price of $29 based on current assets  which implies an attractive upside from current prices. I am comfortable with this valuation as I consider myself very conservative. Conservatism is shown by playing with what-if scenarios. In the scenario where Golar does not grow further  we should expect FCF of $325M in 2024 after debt service (interest and debt amortization). Most of the FCF is fixed  so my estimates are accurate enough. Golar has stated that they will start paying dividends as soon as Gimi is online and if they have no capex growth needs  based on the stability of their income stream  I believe they will pay all free cash flow as a dividend  like Tor Olav Troim is famous for  because his ability to allocate capital where it creates the most value. If we take the current market cap of $2.7Bn and exclude listed securities and net cash (likely also distributed under that scenario)  we reach a potential yearly dividend yield of >22% (12% to market cap). Given these figures  it is fair to say that my current valuation is conservative  even if we do not consider FLNG growth.FLNG GrowthThe upside based on current assets is attractive but would not by itself justify Golar as one of our top holdings. However  I would like to emphasize that the target price I showed you is not considering any growth and at this point  I think growth is more exciting than current assets. I firmly believe that Golar will be able to deliver three projects in the next 12-18 months  one of them starting this year.The environment for FLNG has never been more favorable. The lack of global supply became apparent after COVID-19  as demonstrated by high gas prices. Global supply was not able to catch up with strong demand  but the global gas market broke down following the Russian invasion. Unsurprisingly  Europe has cut ties with Russia and decided to move away from dependence on Russian gas. It should be known that the annual gas demand in Europe is about 500 bcm of which 400 bcm is imported and Russia used to supply (mostly by pipeline) 45% of it  up to 55/60% in the closest countries like Germany  while Norway supplies about 25% of European imports and LNG imports add another 25%. The remaining 5% is supplied by Algeria  Azerbaijan  Libya and Iran.Gazprom's gas exports to Europe (UBS research )As can be seen  Russia already serves only 14% of total imports  creating a huge imbalance between demand and supply that is unlikely to be fixed soon as there is not enough LNG infrastructure to replace Russia in the short term. Nor is the European regasification infrastructure large enough  nor is the global liquefaction capacity. Initially  I expected Russia to restart Nord Stream pipeline flows  as I felt they had cut off pipeline flows using gas as a weapon to gain leverage in a tough negotiation  but I do not foresee volumes coming back after the recent Nord Stream pipeline explosion.Russia's daily exports to Europe (CoolCo presentation)Note that daily Russian gas flows in H1 2022 were significantly lower than in 2019 but much higher than today. While I continue to expect Russian gas to flow to Europe via Ukraine at the current level  I see downside rather than upside risk.Therefore  I expect gas prices in Europe to remain extremely high  as suggested by the forward curve. In fact  I expect gas prices on average for 2023 to be higher than in 2022 due to a greater challenge to refill storage next year with the loss of Russian flows.You might see that the price of gas in Europe has plummeted due to the oversupply. That's fair enough  as natural gas prices are driven by daily supply and demand  as it is a commodity that trades in the present  unlike equities  which discount the future. Current demand is not strong as unseasonable weather depresses it  while storage is full because Europe has rushed to buy all available LNG so as not to run out of gas during the winter. However  winter is coming and Europe's consumption will be 2-4x higher than it is now  while pipeline supply will remain tight. Moreover  even though storage is full  European storage only covers two to three months of consumption.Months of gas storage per country (Oxford Economics)Therefore  the European pain is not over yet  and the gas price will increase significantly in the coming weeks  as the current forward curve suggests (around ‚Ç¨140MWh compared to the ‚Ç¨15MWh it used to trade or ‚Ç¨40/50MWh now). In addition  we should be grateful to China for remaining in a continuous lockdown. This is the first year in which LNG imports from China have not grown; on the contrary  we would be required to pay even higher prices to attract LNG cargoes to Europe.As can be concluded  the only way for Europe to normalize its energy situation is to build LNG infrastructure and secure capacity. Moving away from Russia means that Europe will have to seek up to 150 bcm or 110 million tons of LNG. Europe has already taken the first big step by ordering enough regasification terminals to process LNG  but it remains to be seen how they will be able to secure LNG capacity over the next few years. I don't think the U.S. will be able to supply such a large amount of LNG because it does not have sufficient LNG liquefaction capacity  but even if it could do so over the next decade  I would not expect Europe to make the same mistake a second time and rely on a single source.As reported in the news  Europe is actively targeting Africa. This continent has unique advantages  such as proximity and proven African gas fields associated with a low cost of supply. It is evident that Africa is set to occupy a key place among European gas suppliers.Africa's competitive advantages (Golar presentation)Also  as shown in the picture  Golar's liquefaction technology is one of the lowest cost and carbon footprint solutions in the world  including onshore liquefaction facilities in the United States. It is known that Golar can supply gas to Europe or Asia at $5 MMBtu  which means it can easily make huge profits in almost every scenario. Golar is aware of this huge opportunity and is looking not to be a single service provider but to make it an integrated project. In fact  it is rumored that Golar and New Fortress could partner and revive Fortuna FLNG.Golar's integrated project economics (Golar presentation)Fortuna FLNG is a project that Golar knows very well  as it was going to be FID in 2018 teaming up with Schlumberger (SLB) among others  but eventually  after a key manager left the company  Schlumberger rejected the project to focus on its core business and killed the project. As time has proven  Schlumberger made a big mistake  but I think the current economics are even better now than they were then.The Fortuna FLNG integrated project required $2 billion to obtain the first gas  of which $1.2 billion would be financed with debt and would be used entirely for the start of commercial operations. We should factor inflation into these figures  but I believe this is a project that Golar should be able to afford.As shown in the figure  the payback of the project under current conditions is about one year  which provides an astonishing IRR. Most importantly  however  it is environmentally friendly and has a low break-even cost. Europe will prioritize this ""green"" gas and even in a very challenging market  the Asian LNG market has never been consistently below $5 MMBtu  which means that even in the worst situation  this project will not burn cash. That said  I would like to stress that the world has changed after Europe realized the huge energy risk it was taking from Russia's concentration of gas suppliers and even if the war is resolved and we move on  the price of gas will be structurally higher  as it is known that the cost of LNG imports  which requires liquefaction  shipping and regasification  is much higher than that of Russian pipeline gas.The growth of Golar FLNG is a matter of time. In fact  the company has publicly stated that an FLNG project will be announced before the end of the year and I don't expect Golar to go back on its word. There are many candidates  Kosmos (KOS) reported at the last earnings conference that they want to move forward with the Greater Tortue expansion. In fact  they said they expect to reach an FID in the coming months and expect first gas by the end of 2026. Based on my conversations with them  I would guess that the fact that they haven't moved forward yet would be because they are considering increasing the size of the project from the estimated 2.5 Mpta to 3.5-5 Mpta.As seen  there are many FLNG candidates for Golar and I am not sure what deal Golar will take  but I expect three FLNG projects in the next 18 months  with one being in the next few weeks. Why am I so confident? Golar has the most efficient and proven solution that can be delivered quickly. It is also the most environmentally friendly solution  which is the first step in participating in a large gas project these days.At this point  one might ask  if the current global gas market imbalance has been so clear for a year now and has been intensified by the Russian invasion  why hasn't Golar announced an FLNG project yet?It is a fair question  but it shows the overall lack of knowledge of the sector among investors. The FID of an LNG project is very complex. It is a huge infrastructure project that requires the intervention of many players at the same time and tons of money. The FEED  EPC award  project financing  host government agreements  environmental firms  financing due diligence  offtake contracts - all have to go down and integrate with each other. Just one example: most of the financing will be done through ECAs  tied to a percentage of the procurement  which in turn is tied to the FEED and the EPC award. It quickly becomes clear how complex all this is. Moreover  it is a binary outcome. All parties could have been working for years and in the end  one of them leaves the table and all the work is lost.An offshore gas project is a big infrastructure headache; however  when FID is done and Golar's expertise is on the table  the returns are amazing  as we have seen on Hilli's FLNG.Golar's FLNG designs (Golar presentation)Golar is uniquely positioned for FLNG growth and has three different alternatives that cover all customer needs. The MKI and MK II designs are conversions that could be deployed in three years  while the largest new-build design (MK III) will require four years to be operational.Based on the current balance sheet  I expect Golar to be able to move forward with 3 FLNG growth projects in parallel in the next 18 months that could increase my target price by $25/share (depending on final capex and generation specifications)  reaching a total of over $50/share. Dividend capacity can be huge by the end of 2026 and could justify a higher valuation. Moreover  once time passes and Golar keeps delivering FLNG projects  the target price could eventually grow up to $100/share by 2030.ConclusionEarlier this year  I called Golar a strong buy and titled my analysis ""2022 Is Set to Be the True Inflection Point."" The company has delivered on plan and the market has rewarded them closing most of the gap between price and value. However  the current market price is ignoring Golar's ability to grow  which I understand as the company has not announced any FLNG projects since 2019.Golar is well positioned for growth and should be able to pursue three FLNG projects in parallel  which should raise the target price above $50/share. In addition  I remain very confident in my core holding due to the low downside  as Golar's cash flow generation is set to quadruple and should offer a huge dividend yield should growth fail to materialize.Golar has a fiduciary duty to Europe to advance FLNG growth by helping Europe regain control of the energy chaos. The environment has never been better and the company is in advanced talks with many credible players which prompted them to be confident enough to guide for an FLNG FID before the end of the year.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.47,0.08,0.44,True,English,"['Golar LNG Stock', 'Growth', 'The', 'Corner', 'NASDAQ', 'GLNG', 'floating liquefied natural gas', 'The TTF gas tariff', 'The Brent bonus tariff', 'current high LIBOR rates', 'cash flow generation profile', 'huge TTF gas prices', 'Brent crude oil price', 'Mr. Karl Fredrik Staubo', 'base tolling tariff', 'Brent oil price', 'European gas exposure', 'upside Brent exposure', 'Seeking Alpha tracker', 'steam turbine carrier', 'cash flow visibility', 'free cash flow', 'net cash position', 'two nagging arguments', 'LNG carrier fleet', 'massive transformation process', 'New Fortress shares', 'strong balance sheet', 'Golar Tundra FSRU', 'Hilli FLNG Hilli', 'attractive prices', 'huge swing', '2024 TTF-linked exposure', 'cash cow', 'stock price', 'Mr. Market', 'staggering price', 'two assets', 'Avenir LNG', 'new projects/assets', 'FLNG) facilities', 'detailed analysis', 'good basis', 'last article', 'important event', 'external point', 'S&P', 'manic-depressive animal', 'irrational mood', 'high-quality assets', 'Russian invasion', 'biggest driver', 'amazing performance', 'large responsibility', 'excellent job', 'haphazard nature', 'corporate structure', 'swap agreements', '$5 billion EV.', 'smart decisions', 'investor confidence', 'main reason', 'Gimi FLNG', 'public stakes', 'performing FLNG', 'unique reputation', 'three sources', 'interest service', 'marketable securities', 'capex needs', 'FLNG Tango', 'new update', 'rough market', 'market capitalization', 'Golar LNG', 'short period', 'significant improvement', 'experienced CEO', 'shareholder value', 'recent years', 'Golar Arctic', 'tax-free asset', 'value investors', 'current >$', '2.5 years', 'Leestat', 'Note', 'NASDAQ', 'GLNG', 'company', 'readers', 'interview', 'March', 'May', 'January', 'articles', 'one', 'lot', 'beginning', 'fact', 'contrast', '20% drop', 'opportunity', 'hate', 'love', 'time', 'portfolio', 'doubt', 'environment', 'concerns', 'CFO', 'business', 'conference', 'events', 'leadership', 'Italy', 'Snam', 'addition', 'utilization', '2H', 'half', 'total', 'Hygo', 'GMLP', 'board', 'profits', 'construction', 'end', 'CoolCo', 'world', 'design', 'competitors', 'revenue', 'EBITDA', 'overproduction', 'dollar', '0.2 Mpta', 'mid-20', 'next', 'levels', 'energy', 'debt', 'equity', 'room', 'Exmar']",2022-10-27,2022-10-27,seekingalpha.com

GTT  the technological expert in membrane c‚Ä¶,GTTNine-month 2022 revenues stand at ‚Ç¨222 million in line with expectations;strong order momentum continuesRecord orders : 134 LNG carriers during the first nine months2022 targets confirmedParis ‚Äì October 27  2022. GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its revenues for the first nine months of 2022.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: ‚ÄúWith 134 LNG carrier orders  our core business during the first nine months of 2022 has broken all previous sales records  highlighting the continuation of particularly strong momentum. The surge in demand for LNG  particularly in Europe  is fuelling further demand for LNG carriers  underpinned by investment in liquefaction plants and increased construction capacity at shipyards.In the LNG as fuel business  GTT booked 42 orders during the first nine months of 2022. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this activity over the medium and long term.GTT maintains a tireless focus on R&D to meet its customers‚Äô energy transition needs and the tightening requirements they face. Over the first nine months  we obtained numerous approvals from classification societies to develop new technologies in a wide range of fields  particularly in LNG as fuel  but also for the design of a hydrogen carrier and an innovative design for a three-tank LNG carrier.From a financial perspective  Q3 2022 revenues were up 4.1% versus Q3 2021. As expected  nine-month 2022 revenues were down compared to the same period in 2021 due to an unfavourable base effect  which is gradually disappearing thanks to the strong order momentum.In addition  the Group confirms its 2022 targets with results expected to reach the lower half of the initial target range  as announced in the first half results release.‚ÄùStory continuesBusiness activity during the first nine months- Continued momentum in LNG carrier ordersIn the first nine months of 2022  GTT booked 134 orders for LNG carriers  including 46 in the third quarter  in line with the excellent sales momentum achieved in the first half of the year. Delivery is scheduled between Q3 2024 and Q2 2027. In particular  58 orders for projects in Qatar were received during the first nine months.- Dynamic order intake of LNG-powered vesselsIn addition to the 38 orders for LNG-powered vessels received in the first half of 2022  four new orders were received in the third quarter of 2022  bringing the total to 42 orders for the first nine months. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this business over the medium and long term.- New licensing agreements with Chinese shipyardsIn the third quarter of 2022  GTT signed two new Technical Assistance and Licensing Agreements (TALA)  with the Yangzijiang Shipbuilding and China Merchants Heavy Industries shipyards for the construction of GTT membrane containment systems. This brings to five the number of construction sites now operating in China and contributes to increasing vessel construction capacity.- Smart Shipping: new contractIn July  GTT signed a contract with Antarctica21  the world‚Äôs leading operator of fly and cruise expeditions to Antarctica  to install ‚ÄúGTT Digital‚Äù smart shipping solutions in its cutting-edge expedition vessel Magellan Explorer.- ‚Ç¨86 million State support for Hydrogen IPCEI1 project confirms the relevance of Elogen positioningFollowing the selection by the European Commission of Elogen‚Äôs ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù project and the strengthening of its R&D division as part of the Hydrogen IPCEI  Elogen has been awarded a maximum of ‚Ç¨86 million in subsidies by the French government. An agreement regarding this subsidy will shortly be signed with Bpifrance. For the record  the Elogen gigafactory will start production in 2025 with a production capacity of over 1 GW.Furthermore  in July 2022  Elogen was selected by Symbio to supply an electrolyser with an initial capacity of 2.5 MW for Symbio‚Äôs new fuel cell plant. This new contract represents an important milestone for Elogen  as it highlights the company‚Äôs ability to deploy its technologies on multi-megawatt capacities for large industrial projects.Finally  as previously announced  in the first half of 2022 Elogen entered into several international partnerships for the manufacture and sale of electrolysers for producing green hydrogen:with HiFraser Group in Australia and New Zealand;with Valmax Technology Corporation in South Korea;with Charbone Hydrog√®ne in North America.Innovation: development of new technologies in a wide range of fieldsIn the first half of 2022  GTT received several approvals in principle from classification societies  including:Bureau Veritas for a new LNG conversion concept for large-capacity container ships;ClassNK for a new design of LNG fuel tank with 2 bar gauge pressure applicable to PCTC 2 vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships;DNV for an innovative LNG-powered PCTC vessel design;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for GTT‚Äôs future NEXT1 containment system;Bureau Veritas for Shear-Water  a ballast-free vessel concept for LNG bunkering and refuelling vessels.In the third quarter of 2022  GTT obtained five new approvals in principle from:DNV for a containment system enabling the transport of liquid hydrogen  as well as the concept for a hydrogen carrier vessel. Both approvals in principle were obtained in the framework of the cooperation agreement with Shell announced early 2022 and reflect the progress of this project;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for a new digital solution named ‚ÄúPOWER‚Äù designed to optimise transhipment operations between LNG carriers and floating units;Bureau Veritas for the design of a LNG-powered and ‚ÄúNH3-ready‚Äù Very Large Crude Carrier;Bureau Veritas and DNV for an innovative three-tank LNG carrier concept.Order book at September 30  2022On January 1  2022  GTT‚Äôs order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 161 units  and subsequently changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 21 LNG carriers  4 ethane carriers  1 FLNG;Orders received: 134 LNG carriers.At September 30  2022  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 269 units  breaking down as follows:250 LNG carriers;2 ethane carriers;2 FSUs;3 GBSs;12 onshore storage tanks.Regarding LNG as fuel  following the delivery of four vessels  and orders for 42 container ship tanks  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 70 units at September 30  2022.Evolution of consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022(in thousands of euros) 9M 2021 9M 2022 Change Revenues 240 025 222 037 -7.5% Newbuilds 224 281 200 385 -10.7% LNG carriers/VLEC 194 767 174 749 -10.3% FSUs3 9 660 13 578 +40.6% FSRUs4 8 054 - nm FLNGs5 2 202 1 218 -44.7% Onshore storage tanks 1 468 4 680 +218.8% GBSs6 2 521 3 303 +31.1% LNG-powered vessels 5 610 2 857 -49.1% Electrolysers 3 316 2 980 -10.1% Services 12 428 18 672 +50.2%Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022 were ‚Ç¨222.0 million  down 7.5% compared to the first nine months of 2021. The third quarter 2022 revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨77.8 million  up 4.1% compared to the third quarter 2021.Newbuild revenues totalled ‚Ç¨200.4 million  down 10.7% compared with the first nine months of 2021  when the cycle was still at its peak. Royalties amounted to ‚Ç¨174.7 million from LNG and ethane carriers  ‚Ç¨13.6 million from FSUs  ‚Ç¨1.2 million from FLNGs  ‚Ç¨4.7 million from onshore storage tanks and ‚Ç¨3.3 million from GBSs. LNG as fuel royalties (‚Ç¨2.9 million) were not yet impacted by the high order intake in 2021 and 2022.Nine-month revenues from the Elogen electrolyser business amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million  in a context of increasing commercial dynamic.Revenues from services rose sharply  up 50.2% to ‚Ç¨18.7 million  driven by growth in digital services and engineering studies mainly related to the conversion of LNG carriers into FSRUs.Update on exposure to RussiaWork on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is currently continuing  in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes.In Russia  the Group is involved in tank design for 15 ice-breaking LNG carriers currently being built at the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of 3 GBSs7 currently under construction at Saren B.V.8 At October 1  2022  revenues of ‚Ç¨74 million have yet to be recognised by 2025 for ice-breaking LNG carriers  including ‚Ç¨4 million in Q4 2022. Revenues of ‚Ç¨12 million have yet to be recognised for 2027 for GBSs  including ‚Ç¨1 million in Q4 2022.Given the impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and successful execution of these contracts are still exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation. In particular  sanctions are still affecting Russian imports of certain products and equipment used in current projects  including the Zvezda project. Furthermore  as previously announced  in July Saren B.V. notified GTT of its intention to terminate the contract between them. The termination date has not yet been finally set. In this context  GTT continues to investigate solutions to ensure the proper implementation and integrity of its technology  in strict compliance with international sanctions.As a reminder  other orders in progress in Asian shipyards for six ice-breaking LNG carriers and two FSUs9 are specifically intended for Russian Arctic projects. These projects are currently proceeding according to plan. At October 1  2022  these orders represented total revenues of ‚Ç¨31 million for GTT  to be recognized by 2024  including ‚Ç¨7 million in Q4 2022.Finally  eight conventional LNG carriers ordered by international shipowners  under construction in Asian shipyards  are intended for the Arctic LNG 2 project  but can operate in all types of conditions.2022 outlook confirmedIn its 2021 annual results press release dated February 17  2022  the Group issued the following targets for 2022  assuming no significant order deferrals or cancellations:consolidated revenues of between ‚Ç¨290 million and ‚Ç¨320 million consolidated EBITDA of between ‚Ç¨140 million and ‚Ç¨170 million a dividend amount for the 2022 financial year at least equivalent to the 2021 dividend.Given delays in shipbuilding schedules for certain vessels during the first nine months of 2022  the Group confirms its forecast that revenues and EBITDA will reach the lower half of the ranges announced in February.In the longer term  the Group should benefit from the current strong order momentum and expects to achieve significantly higher revenues and earnings from 2023 onwards versus 2022.***First nine months of 2022 activity update presentationPhilippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and Virginie Aubagnac  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT‚Äôs business during the first nine months of 2022 and answer questions from the financial community during a conference call to be held  in English  on Thursday  October 27  2022 at 6:15 p.m. Paris time.This conference will also be broadcast live on GTT‚Äôs website (www.gtt.fr/finance).To participate in the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: +33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004USA: +1 718 705 87 96Confirmation code: 130114The presentation document will be available on the website on October 27  2022 from 17:45 p.m.Financial agendaPayment of an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨1.55 per share for the 2022 financial year: December 15  20222022 full year results release: February 16  2023 (after close of trading)Shareholders‚Äô Meeting: June 7  2023About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of ‚Ç¨1 363.1m over the first nine months of 2022  up +15.2% at constant FX and perimeter compared to 9M-21. On a reported basis (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover was up +17.7%.Revenues from insurance activities (including bonding and Single Risk) increased by +16.6% at constant FX and perimeter (and by +18.8% at current FX) compared to 9M-21. Growth benefited from an increase in client activity and continued high retention.The retention rate reached a record level of 93.5%  up +1.4% compared to 9M-21. New business totalled ‚Ç¨82m  down ‚Ç¨20m compared to 9M-21 in an increasingly competitive market.The growth in Coface‚Äôs client activity had a positive impact of +11.1% over 9M-22. This record increase for the first nine months reflects the scale of the recent economic recovery and inflation. The price effect continued to reverse  coming in at -3.0% in 9M-22  in line with the -3.0% fall in H1-22. This is largely due to previous very low loss experience.Revenues from other activities were up +7.9% compared to 9M-21  still with contrasting trends in the different businesses. Turnover from factoring rose +13.0%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Poland. Revenues from information services continued to grow  rising +15.6% (vs. +13.4% in 9M-21). Fee and commission income (collection fees) was impacted by the decline in claims to be recovered and dropped -37.9% while commissions were up by +6.7%.Total revenue - in ‚Ç¨m(by country of invoicing) 9M-21 9M-22 Variation %ex.

Trade credit insurance benefited from the increase in client activity and a high retention rate. Factoring turnover increased by +7.0%.In Western Europe  turnover was up by +14.8% at constant FX (+16.0% at current FX) thanks to a high retention rate and client activity.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover was up by +16.8% and by +17.6% at constant FX  due to high retention  and growth in trade credit insurance driven by client activity. Factoring turnover continued to increase significantly  rising by +36.9%.In Mediterranean and Africa  a region driven by Italy and Spain  turnover grew by +17.2% and by +15.4% at current FX. This was due to high levels of new business and high retention. Revenues from services increased by +27.7%.In North America  turnover increased +12.4% at constant FX and +26.0% as reported  driven by high client activity and positive FX effect  which were partially offset by premium refunds.In Latin America  turnover was up +29.8% at constant FX and +41.3% at current FX  driven by strong retention as well as growth in client activity driven by the rise in commodity prices.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +16.6% at constant FX and +25.7% at current FX.

ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio  net of reinsurance  stood at 63.8% for 9M-22 (a rise of 7.7 points compared to 9M-21).(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 30.2%  up 5.0 ppts compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims close to pre-Covid levels and the return of relatively large claims  which nevertheless remain below average. Coface increased its provisions relating to the residual exposure in Russia.The Group‚Äôs reserving policy remains unchanged. Strict management of past claims enabled Coface to record 53.1 ppts of recoveries. The loss ratio for the 2022 underwriting year is still high at 80.9%  signalling that Coface anticipates an increase in the number of bankruptcies in the coming quarters  and an increase in reserves on Russia.The loss ratio net of reinsurance came out at 36.9%  up by 11.5 ppts compared to 9M-21.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is following its strict policy of cost management. In the third quarter 2022  costs rose by +16.0% at constant FX and perimeter  and +20.1% at current FX. This increase is in line with the growth in turnover  even though Coface continued to invest. The cost ratio before reinsurance was 32.2%  an improvement of 0.8 ppt over one year.The cost ratio  net of reinsurance was 26.9% for the first nine months  an improvement of 3.8 ppts year-on-year  reflecting lower gross cost ratio and higher reinsurance commissions.Financial resultNet financial income for 9M-22 was ‚Ç¨39.1m  up by ‚Ç¨8.2m compared to 9M-21. This figure includes ‚Ç¨10.7m in realised capital gains and positive hedging results as well as a currency effect of ‚Ç¨3.2m. This performance was achieved against a particularly turbulent market backdrop  primarily due to the effectiveness of hedging policies.The portfolio‚Äôs current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX impact) is ‚Ç¨29.5m (compared to ‚Ç¨25.2m in 9M-21). The accounting yield3  excluding capital gains and depreciation  stood at 1.0% in 9M-22  up compared to the previous year (0.9%)  mainly due to higher reinvestment rates.Operating income and net incomeOperating income for 9M-22 was ‚Ç¨329.8m  up +24.3%  mainly due to increased growth and a still low loss ratio.The effective tax rate was 26%  compared to 24% for 9M-21.In total  net income (group share) was ‚Ç¨228.4m  up +19.6% compared to 9M-21  of which ‚Ç¨84.0m in Q3-22.3. Shareholders‚Äô equity & solvencyAt 30 September 2022  Group shareholders‚Äô equity stood at ‚Ç¨1 955.2m  down ‚Ç¨185.8m  or -8.7% (compared to ‚Ç¨2 141.0m at 31 December 2021).This change is mainly due to the positive net income of ‚Ç¨228.4m  the payment of the dividend (-‚Ç¨224.8m) and the fall in unrealised capital gains (-‚Ç¨240.5m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 16.4% at 30 September 2022  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.4. OutlookThe risks threatening global growth were confirmed in the third quarter. The leading central banks continued to tighten monetary policy in a bid to curb inflation  which remains high. There was no improvement in the conflict in Ukraine and the energy crisis in Europe remains acute. European countries are taking substantial financial measures to limit the consequences of the crisis but there are considerable disparities in the extent of their intervention and the lack of coordination is undermining their effectiveness. The Chinese economy continues to be periodically affected by local lockdowns and is facing the consequences of the bursting of the property market bubble.As expected  growth forecasts for the global economy continue to be downgraded. Coface has lowered its financial outlook for 49 economic sectors  following significant downgrades to its country risk assessments in the second quarter.It is continuing to monitor the worsening economic environment. With its strong underwriting discipline and its reserving policy  which remains unchanged  Coface is well positioned to successfully navigate this more complex stage in the economic cycle. The raising of its credit rating outlook by Moody‚Äôs attests to the robustness of Coface's business model and its careful risk management.Coface is continuing to invest in expanding its service activities such as information services (growth of +15.6%) and factoring (+13.0%). Its record retention rate (93.5%) and the steady rise in its net promoter score (NPS) to 38% reflect client recognition of its constant focus on service quality.Conference call for financial analystsCoface‚Äôs results for 9M-2022 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Thursday 27 October at 18.00 (Paris time).

Conference call to be held today at 09:00 CEST (see details on page 7).Julie Walbaum  Chief Executive Officer  commented:‚ÄúOur third-quarter 2022 performance is in line with our expectations in a global environment that remains very challenging. The commercial initiatives we implemented since the end of May as well as our sustained efforts in inventory replenishment have been bearing fruit and should continue to support our activity through the end of the year. As a result  notwithstanding the high inflation and soft discretionary spending  we are still expecting sales improvement in Q4  benefiting from higher inventory levels  sustained promotional activity and a more favorable base effect online. The cost and cash savings action plan that we started in Q2 is also delivering its effects as planned.Story continuesConsequently  we keep our full year 2022 objectives unchanged. We remain fully confident in the fundamental strengths of Maisons du Monde that combines a love brand  a broad range of desirable and increasingly sustainable home & living products  with a unique omnichannel business model.‚ÄùQ3 key commercial developmentsDuring the period  Maisons du Monde continued to strengthen its direct-to-consumer love brand through creativity  inspiration and engagement  as well as to further deploy its unique omnichannel model.Brand and customersTotal active customers reached 2.1 million at 30 September 2022  of which 687 000 new customers (32% of the active customer base).

In the face of this new reality  the Group implemented in May 2022 an action plan to contain cost and protect cash  targeting an extra ‚Ç¨5 million gross margin and ‚Ç¨20 million cost adjustments to reduce the impact of rising inflation. As of 30 September 2022  the execution of the plan is on track and MdM teams are fully focused on preparing and optimizing the 2023 equation.2022 capex  originally planned at around ‚Ç¨90 million  has been revised downward and now is expected to be in the ‚Ç¨70 million-‚Ç¨75 million range for the year. Regarding working capital requirement  the Group has made good progress in:adjusting its H2 2022 shipping plans to mitigate excess inventory risk while rebuilding inventories in select product families to support Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 salesand simultaneously negotiating with suppliers to reorganize manufacturing and purchasing planning  as well as to optimize payment terms.OutlookThe current economic environment remains challenging with still rising inflation across Europe and short-term consumption trends impacted by the current energy crisis.However  Q4 2022 sales are expected to improve over Q3 2022  thanks to improved furniture inventory levels  sustained promotional activity and a favorable base effect.Thanks to all actions engaged since end of Q2 2022 on sales  costs and cash  Maisons du Monde leaves its full-year 2022 objectives unchanged:Top line decrease in the mid-single digit rangeAn EBIT margin of 5% or aboveFCF of ‚Ç¨10 million to 30 millionReduction of the Group‚Äôs carbon intensity: CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2Dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40%Update on share buyback programOn 29 July 2022  the Group launched a second share repurchase program with an objective to repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares at market price over a period of several months. At 30 September 2022  the Group had purchased 1 151 846 of its own shares  i.e. 25% of the program  at an average price per share of ‚Ç¨9.74. The shares acquired by December under this new buyback program are intended to be cancelled before year end  thereby reducing Maisons du Monde‚Äôs share capital.***Store Network(In units) Number of stores at end of: Q1 20 Q2 20 Q3 20 Q4 20 FY 20 Q1 21 Q2 21 Q3 21 Q4 21 FY 21 Q1 22 Q2 22 Q3 22 France 228 227 227 228 228 223 222 220 219 219 215 214 215 Italy 48 48 48 49 49 49 49 48 50 50 49 49 49 Spain 27 27 27 27 27 26 28 28 30 30 30 31 32 Belgium 23 23 23 24 24 25 26 26 27 27 25 25 25 Germany 11 10 10 11 11 11 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 Switzerland 9 9 9 9 9 10 10 11 12 12 12 12 12 Luxembourg 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Portugal 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 Austria - - - - - 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Number of stores 350 348 348 352 352 349 352 350 357 357 350 350 352 Net openings -6 -2 0 +4 -4 -3 +3 -2 +7 +5 -7 0 +2 Sales area (K sqm) 415.7 413.6 414.2 420.2 420.2 419.0 424.4 424.5 432.9 432.9 427.8 428.9 433.0 Change (K sqm) -1.5 -2.1 +0.6 +6.0 +3.0 -1.2 +5.3 +0.6 +8.0 +12.7 -5.1 +1.1 +4.1***Disclaimer: Forward Looking StatementThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements "" including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

Operating EBITA margin increased to 10.3% (last year: 9.5%)  driven by improved performance across the GBAs.Peter Oosterveer  CEO Arcadis  comments:‚ÄúDuring the last quarter  we have continued to see growing client demand across our three Global Business Areas. Our Resilience business continues to benefit from increased client demand for sustainability advisory  energy transition and climate adaptation solutions. In our Places business we have enjoyed large wins in North America and Germany  and increased demand from manufacturing and governmental clients. For our Mobility business  significant rail wins in the Netherlands and a growing demand for smart mobility solutions from highways and public transport clients created strong results.We have also made significant progress in optimizing our portfolio and focusing our efforts on geographies where we see the most attractive opportunities. This has resulted in the divestments of operations in Singapore  Malaysia  our Design and Engineering business in Hong Kong  Switzerland and our environmental restoration business in France. These follow the divestments made earlier on in the year; of our operations in Thailand  Czech Republic and Slovakia.Story continuesAs we look ahead to 2023  our focus is on fully embedding both IBI and DPS into our four Global Business Areas  and the shaping of our fourth GBA ‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù. Through these acquisitions  we not only significantly grow our presence in North America and Europe  but we will also be in the position to provide complementary client services and solutions in high growth markets  including life sciences  semiconductors  and industrial manufacturing.Although the evolving geo-political situation and inflationary headwinds remain firmly on our radar  our record backlog and continued focus on the optimization of our portfolio  combined with the exciting new growth opportunities IBI  DPS and Giftge Consulting offer  position us well to meet our strategic targets. I can only be very proud of all the teams across Arcadis that have kept the right focus on our clients in these busy and exciting times for our company.‚ÄùKEY FIGURESAs the acquisition of the IBI Group has been formally closed on 27th of September 2022  the Arcadis consolidated financial statements include IBI consolidated data for balance sheet items (those items having an impact on NWC% and DSO calculated for Arcadis as a whole). Arcadis backlog includes IBI backlog as well. As the three days of P&L of IBI Group between September 27th and September 30th have been considered as non-significant  P&L data and corresponding KPI‚Äôs (e.g. EBITDA  order intake  FCF) for the third quarter represent Arcadis standalone data.in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Gross revenues 1 003 828 21% 2 851 2 489 15% Net revenues 740 636 16% 2 158 1 912 13% Organic growth1) 10.9% 4.8% 8.2% 3.9% Operating EBITDA2) 101 83 21% 284 252 12% Operating EBITDA margin 13.6% 13.1% 13.2% 13.2% EBITA 27 57 -52% 158 171 -8% EBITA margin 3.7% 9.0% 7.3% 9.0% Operating EBITA2) 76 60 26% 208 177 18% Operating EBITA margin 10.3% 9.5% 9.7% 9.2% Free Cash Flow3) 38 75 -50% 27 105 -74% Net Working Capital %4) 13.8% 14.0% Days Sales Outstanding4) 72 74 Net Debt4) 880 298 195% Backlog net revenues4) 2 813 2 126 32% Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 5.0%1) Underlying growth excluding the impact of currency movements  acquisitions or footprint reductions  such as the Middle East  winddowns or divestments2) This excludes the net result on divestment of consolidated companies  and acquisitions  restructuring  and integration-related costs. The Operating EBITDA is used when calculating the strategic target: average net debt / (Operating) EBITDA  guided for 1.5-2.5x3) Free Cash flow: Cash Flow from Operations corrected for Capex and Lease liabilities4) Including IBI Group  transaction closing per 27th of September 2022INCOME STATEMENTNet revenues totaled ‚Ç¨740 million and increased organically by 10.9%. Growth was driven by all three GBAs  with Resilience and Mobility being exceptionally strong in North America and the UK. The currency impact was 9%. The operating EBITA margin improved to 10.3% (Q3‚Äò21: 9.5%)  driven by all three GBAs  and a significant year-on-year improvement driven by Places from improved operational efficiencies  despite lower working days in the UK and Australia due to Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs funeral.Non-operating costs were ‚Ç¨49 million and include transaction costs related to the three recently announced acquisitions  and a net loss on divestments of operations in Singapore  Malaysia  Hong Kong (Design & Engineering business)  Switzerland and France (Environmental Restoration business). These net losses had no impact on Free Cash Flow.ORDER INTAKE &BACKLOGAt the end of September 2022 backlog reached a record high level of ‚Ç¨2 813 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨2 126 million)  of which ‚Ç¨530 million was added through the acquisition of the IBI Group. Strong order intake  with almost no cancellations in the quarter resulted in a solid organic backlog growth of 5.0% year-over-year  with a positive contribution of all three GBAs.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues was 13.8% (Q3‚Äò21: 14.0%)  globally in line with last year performance. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased to 72 days (Q3‚Äò21: 74 days). Net debt increased to ‚Ç¨880 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨298 million)  including the ‚Ç¨600 million bridge loan for IBI acquisition and IBI net debt of ‚Ç¨54 million.Free cash flow generation during the quarter was ‚Ç¨38 million and below last year‚Äôs (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨75 million)  driven by sharp revenue growth elevating working capital levels  and some transaction costs relating to the recent acquisitions. Free cash flow generation year-to-date was ‚Ç¨27 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨105 million)  which was impacted by a normalization of working capital levels compared to 2021.STRATEGIC PROGRESSFocus & Scale is one of the three key pillars of our ‚ÄúMaximizing Impact‚Äù business strategy for 2021-2023. Arcadis has focused on driving operational efficiencies through the implementation of the GBA model  focus on key clients  and greater use of the Global Excellence Centers (GECs)  as well as investing in high growth markets  for instance through the acquisitions of IBI  DPS and Giftge Consult.At the same time  ‚ÄúFocus & Scale‚Äù triggered a portfolio assessment  reviewing operations on their scalability  growth potential  financial performance  and scope of services. This has resulted in the following divestment of non-core operations  from a geographic or business point of view: Singapore  Malaysia  Hong Kong (Design & Engineering business)  Switzerland and France (Environmental Restoration business)  representing ~900 people and ‚Ç¨47 million of annual net revenues. This was in addition to the divestments of Czech Republic  Slovakia and Thailand that occurred in the first half of 2022  representing ~190 people and ‚Ç¨11 million of annual net revenues.The recent acquisitions of IBI  DPS and Giftge  together with the divestments  have rebalanced the geographic and business portfolio  and repositioned Arcadis towards high growth and resilient markets such as placemaking and urban planning in North America  and industrial manufacturing engineering in the US and Europe. The creation of the fourth GBA ‚ÄúIntelligence""  will enhance Arcadis‚Äô position as a digital leader  and ability to serve its clients in a more efficient way across all phases of the asset lifecycle. The backlog for Intelligence at the end of the third quarter was ‚Ç¨112 million  representing 4% of the total Arcadis backlog.PERFORMANCE BY GLOBAL BUSINESS AREARESILIENCE(43% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 320 259 24% 909 771 18% Organic growth1) 13.7% 9.7% Backlog net revenues 943 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 5.4%Resilience showed continued solid revenue and backlog growth for the third quarter  driven by continued strong client demand in energy transition  climate adaptation and mitigation  including a new commission as lead designer of a flood defense for Battery Park  New York City  complementing resiliency work for southeast and lower Manhattan. Revenue growth was supported by the successful onboarding of new hires  especially in the US.The Resilience business closed the quarter at a backlog of ‚Ç¨943 million  representing 34% of total Arcadis backlog.PLACES(32% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 234 209 12% 697 656 6% Organic growth1) 3.6% 2.8% Backlog net revenues 1 216 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 2.1%Revenue and backlog growth in the third quarter were driven by a strong Continental Europe and US  with good demand for sustainable and intelligent buildings  including the development of datacenters and automotive giga-factories for electric vehicle battery production. Revenue and backlog growth was somewhat hampered by weakening market circumstances in China.The absolute backlog of Places increased by 29% year-on-year to ‚Ç¨1 216 million. The position includes the backlog of IBI Group  which was marked by strong order intake in the third quarter and excludes the divested countries in Southeast Asia. These strategic decisions led to a significant repositioning of the Places backlog  now representing 43% of total Arcadis backlog  with an increased focus on North America and Europe.MOBILITY(25% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 186 168 11% 552 485 14% Organic growth1) 15.4% 12.5% Backlog net revenues 542 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 9.0%Stellar revenue growth for Mobility in the third quarter was driven by the UK  Australia and the US.

At the end of Q3  mobility backlog amounted to ‚Ç¨542 million  representing 19% of total Arcadis backlog.IBI‚Äôs experience in developing digital tools including Travel-IQ will further help to pursue new opportunities and strengthen our Mobility business both in North America and across the world.Financial calendar:16 February 2023 ‚Äì Q4 & FY 2022 Results4 May 2023 ‚Äì Q1 2023 Trading Update27 July 2023 ‚Äì Q2 & HY 2023 Results26 October 2023 ‚Äì Q3 2023 Trading UpdateFor further information please contact:Arcadis Investor RelationsChristine DischMobile: +31 (0)6 1537 6020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comArcadis Corporate CommunicationsTanno MassarMobile: +31 (0)6 1158 9121E-mail: tanno.massar@arcadis.comAnalyst meetingArcadis will hold an analyst webcast to discuss the Q3results for 2022.

The product net sales in the nine months ended September 30  2022 were $227.3 million. No product net sales were recognized during the same period in 2021.Collaboration revenue for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $6.7 million and $9.3 million  respectively  compared to $0.1 million and $471.3 million for the same periods in 2021. The collaboration revenue during the three months ended September 30  2022 primarily relates to milestone revenue of the ‚Ç¨5 million triggered by the option exercised by LEO Pharma to enter into a commercial license for ARGX-112. The collaboration revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30  2021 was primarily attributable to the recognition of the transaction price as a consequence of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Janssen  resulting in the recognition of $315.1 million and the closing of the strategic collaboration for efgartigimod with Zai Lab  resulting in the recognition of $151.9 million in collaboration revenue.Other operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $8.5 million  and $26.6 million  respectively  compared to $6.2 million and $34.5 million for the same periods in 2021. During the nine months ended September 30  2022  and September 30  2021  the fair value of the argenx profit share in AgomAb Therapeutics NV increased by $4.3 million and $11.2 million respectively. The increase is a result of the extension of a Series B financing round by AgomAb for which argenx maintains a profit share in exchange for granting the license for the use of HGF-mimetic antibodies from the SIMPLE Antibody‚Ñ¢ platform.Total operating expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $355.1 million and $869.1 million  respectively  compared to $220.1 million and $623.6 million for the same periods in 2021  and consists of:Cost of sales for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $10.3 million and $16.6 million  respectively. The cost of sales were recognized with respect to the sale of VYVGART during 2022. There were no cost of sales recognized in the comparable prior year periods.Research and development expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $236.7 million and $515.6 million  respectively  compared to $139.4 million and $413.3 million for the same periods in 2021. The research and development expenses mainly relate to external research and development expenses and personnel expenses incurred in the clinical development of efgartigimod in various indications and the expansion of other clinical and preclinical pipeline candidates. The increase in research and development expense during the third quarter 2022 is mainly driven by the recognition of the priority review voucher submitted with the BLA filing for SC efgartigimod for the treatment of gMG  which resulted in an expense of $99.1 million.Selling  general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $108.2 million and $336.8 million  respectively  compared to $80.6 million and $210.2 million for the same periods in 2021. The selling  general and administrative expenses mainly relate to professional and marketing fees linked to the commercialization of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and the EU and personnel expenses.Exchange losses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $39.6 million and $93.0 million  respectively  compared to $17.6 million and $36.0 million for the same periods in 2021. Exchange losses are mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate losses on cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets position in Euro.Income tax for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $6.0 million and $17.1 of tax income  respectively  compared to $2.7 million and $15.6 million of tax expense for the same periods in 2021. Tax income for the three months ended September 30  2022 consists of $7.3 million of income tax expense and $13.3 million of deferred tax income  compared to $4.3 million of income tax expense and $1.6 million of deferred tax income for the same period in 2021.Net loss for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $235.0 million and $671.0 million  respectively  compared to net loss of $233.6 million and $170.4 million for the same periods in 2021.Cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets totaled $2 385.5 million as of September 30  2022  compared to $2 336.7 million as of December 31  2021. Cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets increased primarily as a result of the closing of a global offering of shares  which resulted in the receipt of $761.0 million in net proceeds in March 2022  offset by net cash flows used in operating activities.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEBased on current plans to fund anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures  argenx continues to expect its 2022 cash burn to be up to $1 billion. This will support the global VYVGART launches  clinical development of efgartigimod in 10 indications and ARGX-117 in two indications  investment in the global supply chain  and continued focus on pipeline expansion through the Immunology Innovation Program.EXPECTED 2023 FINANCIAL CALENDARMarch 2  2023: FY 2022 financial results and business updateMay 4  2023: Q1 2023 financial results and business updateJuly 27  2023: HY 2023 financial results and business updateOctober 27  2023: Q3 2023 financial results and business updateCONFERENCE CALL DETAILSThe third quarter 2022 financial results and business update will be discussed during a conference call and webcast presentation today at 2:30 pm CEST/8:30 am ET.

Excluding the temporary net positive impact of Covid-related contracts  our underlying organic growth is 9.2% at the end of September.The average cumulative organic growth at the end of September is 32% over the last two years and 19% over the last three years  which demonstrates our regular performance and strong operating model.PERFORMANCE BY QUARTER2022 vs. 2021 In millions ofEuros 2022Revenue Totalgrowth Organicgrowth 1st quarter 547.8 17.5% 12.3% (1) 2nd quarter 574.0 8.9% 2.1% 3rd quarter 601.5 14.3% 5.3%* Revenue 1 723.3 13.4 % 6.3 %*(1) Covid-related contracts were maintained at least in part until March 31  2022* Underlying organic growth is 6.9% for the third quarter and 9.2% for the Nine-month 2022  excluding the temporary net positive impact of Covid-related contracts (specific pandemic monitoring projects for governments  minus contracts that could not be executed because of the health situation).Looking specifically at the third quarter  total growth is 14.3%  of which 5.3% organic and 8.0% currency effects.

In particular  double-digit growth is experienced in the Service Lines that focus on measuring and analyzing brand growth and expression.Good growth is also noted in our work focusing on customers and employees  which reflects an increasing interest of our clients in measuring and assessing their own client experiences and also in ensuring the quality of their HR plans.After massive growth during the 2020-21 period spurred by large scale Covid-testing programmes in Europe  our work among citizens has fallen back in 2022. However  the underlying business excluding Covid contracts records a double-digit growth  confirming the need for governments to better understand citizens‚Äô expectations and behaviours in an uncertain and inflationary world.Finally  our work with doctors and patients has seen moderate growth in 2022  impacted by an unfavorable base effect after a rapid expansion during the pandemic.OUTLOOKWe are confident that we can deliver better performance than promised at this start of the year: we now expect organic growth in 2022 to be closer to 6% than 5% and a level of operating margin comparable to that of last year.

Today‚Äôs announcement demonstrates the Stellantis commitment to investing in France in the latest technologies  and to supporting low-carbon mobility based on the ‚ÄúOne Company‚Äù principle ‚Äù Tavares stated. ‚ÄúStellantis has succeeded in moving on to the next step in automotive history  in a transition managed in conjunction with our social partners at our 12 industrial sites across seven French regions  where we are proud to have laid historical roots.‚ÄùThese hydrogen-powered vehicles will be assembled on the site‚Äôs multi-energy line  which already produces the electric and combustion engine versions of the ‚ÄúK-Zero‚Äù daily. Using a reinforced platform from body-in-white onwards  the hydrogen-powered models will then follow the usual stages of paintwork and assembly  on the same production line as combustion engine and electric vehicles  before they enter the new 8 000-m¬≤ facility that focuses solely on the final tuning.A dedicated team will install the tank  the additional batteries  and the fuel cell on a production line at the Hordain site that halves the adjustment time compared to the previous small-scale process  where the fuel cell was assembled at a pilot workshop in R√ºsselsheim.This industrialization of hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles ‚Äì accompanied by ‚Ç¨10 million in investments with financial support from the French government ‚Äì is a new step for Hordain  where 43% of models for the Peugeot  Citro√´n  Opel  Vauxhall  Fiat and Toyota brands are already available in a zero-emission electric version.The ‚ÄúK-zero‚Äù vehicles with a fuel cell are intended for long-distance freight professionals who require a longer range (400 km)  the fastest possible charging time (3 minutes) and no compromises on charging capacity (1000 kg of payload).Launched in 2021  Stellantis is the first manufacturer in the world to market this type of vehicle.Inaugurated in 1994  the Hordain site lies at the heart of the industrial strategy at the Stellantis commercial vehicles division. This benchmark site assembles light commercial vehicles and passenger cars from the ‚ÄúK-Zero‚Äù family. Hordain employs 2 440 people on three shifts  with daily production of 628 vehicles.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its revenues for the first nine months of 2022.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: ‚ÄúWith 134 LNG carrier orders  our core business during the first nine months of 2022 has broken all previous sales records  highlighting the continuation of particularly strong momentum. The surge in demand for LNG  particularly in Europe  is fuelling further demand for LNG carriers  underpinned by investment in liquefaction plants and increased construction capacity at shipyards.In the LNG as fuel business  GTT booked 42 orders during the first nine months of 2022. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this activity over the medium and long term.GTT maintains a tireless focus on R&D to meet its customers‚Äô energy transition needs and the tightening requirements they face. Over the first nine months  we obtained numerous approvals from classification societies to develop new technologies in a wide range of fields  particularly in LNG as fuel  but also for the design of a hydrogen carrier and an innovative design for a three-tank LNG carrier.From a financial perspective  Q3 2022 revenues were up 4.1% versus Q3 2021. As expected  nine-month 2022 revenues were down compared to the same period in 2021 due to an unfavourable base effect  which is gradually disappearing thanks to the strong order momentum.In addition  the Group confirms its 2022 targets with results expected to reach the lower half of the initial target range  as announced in the first half results release.‚ÄùBusiness activity during the first nine months- Continued momentum in LNG carrier ordersIn the first nine months of 2022  GTT booked 134 orders for LNG carriers  including 46 in the third quarter  in line with the excellent sales momentum achieved in the first half of the year. Delivery is scheduled between Q3 2024 and Q2 2027. In particular  58 orders for projects in Qatar were received during the first nine months.- Dynamic order intake of LNG-powered vesselsIn addition to the 38 orders for LNG-powered vessels received in the first half of 2022  four new orders were received in the third quarter of 2022  bringing the total to 42 orders for the first nine months. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this business over the medium and long term.- New licensing agreements with Chinese shipyardsIn the third quarter of 2022  GTT signed two new Technical Assistance and Licensing Agreements (TALA)  with the Yangzijiang Shipbuilding and China Merchants Heavy Industries shipyards for the construction of GTT membrane containment systems. This brings to five the number of construction sites now operating in China and contributes to increasing vessel construction capacity.- Smart Shipping: new contractIn July  GTT signed a contract with Antarctica21  the world‚Äôs leading operator of fly and cruise expeditions to Antarctica  to install ‚ÄúGTT Digital‚Äù smart shipping solutions in its cutting-edge expedition vessel Magellan Explorer.- ‚Ç¨86 million State support for Hydrogen IPCEI1 project confirms the relevance of Elogen positioningFollowing the selection by the European Commission of Elogen‚Äôs ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù project and the strengthening of its R&D division as part of the Hydrogen IPCEI  Elogen has been awarded a maximum of ‚Ç¨86 million in subsidies by the French government. An agreement regarding this subsidy will shortly be signed with Bpifrance. For the record  the Elogen gigafactory will start production in 2025 with a production capacity of over 1 GW.Furthermore  in July 2022  Elogen was selected by Symbio to supply an electrolyser with an initial capacity of 2.5 MW for Symbio‚Äôs new fuel cell plant. This new contract represents an important milestone for Elogen  as it highlights the company‚Äôs ability to deploy its technologies on multi-megawatt capacities for large industrial projects.Finally  as previously announced  in the first half of 2022 Elogen entered into several international partnerships for the manufacture and sale of electrolysers for producing green hydrogen:with HiFraser Group in Australia and New Zealand;with Valmax Technology Corporation in South Korea;with Charbone Hydrog√®ne in North America.Innovation: development of new technologies in a wide range of fieldsIn the first half of 2022  GTT received several approvals in principle from classification societies  including:Bureau Veritas for a new LNG conversion concept for large-capacity container ships;ClassNK for a new design of LNG fuel tank with 2 bar gauge pressure applicable to PCTC 2 vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships;vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships; DNV for an innovative LNG-powered PCTC vessel design;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for GTT‚Äôs future NEXT1 containment system;Bureau Veritas for Shear-Water  a ballast-free vessel concept for LNG bunkering and refuelling vessels.In the third quarter of 2022  GTT obtained five new approvals in principle from:DNV for a containment system enabling the transport of liquid hydrogen  as well as the concept for a hydrogen carrier vessel. Both approvals in principle were obtained in the framework of the cooperation agreement with Shell announced early 2022 and reflect the progress of this project;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for a new digital solution named ‚ÄúPOWER‚Äù designed to optimise transhipment operations between LNG carriers and floating units;Bureau Veritas for the design of a LNG-powered and ‚ÄúNH3-ready‚Äù Very Large Crude Carrier;Bureau Veritas and DNV for an innovative three-tank LNG carrier concept.Order book at September 30  2022On January 1  2022  GTT‚Äôs order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 161 units  and subsequently changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 21 LNG carriers  4 ethane carriers  1 FLNG;Orders received: 134 LNG carriers.At September 30  2022  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 269 units  breaking down as follows:250 LNG carriers;2 ethane carriers;2 FSUs;3 GBSs;12 onshore storage tanks.Regarding LNG as fuel  following the delivery of four vessels  and orders for 42 container ship tanks  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 70 units at September 30  2022.Evolution of consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022(in thousands of euros) 9M 2021 9M 2022 Change Revenues 240 025 222 037 -7.5% Newbuilds 224 281 200 385 -10.7% LNG carriers/VLEC 194 767 174 749 -10.3% FSUs3 9 660 13 578 +40.6% FSRUs4 8 054 - nm FLNGs5 2 202 1 218 -44.7% Onshore storage tanks 1 468 4 680 +218.8% GBSs6 2 521 3 303 +31.1% LNG-powered vessels 5 610 2 857 -49.1% Electrolysers 3 316 2 980 -10.1% Services 12 428 18 672 +50.2%Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022 were ‚Ç¨222.0 million  down 7.5% compared to the first nine months of 2021. The third quarter 2022 revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨77.8 million  up 4.1% compared to the third quarter 2021.Newbuild revenues totalled ‚Ç¨200.4 million  down 10.7% compared with the first nine months of 2021  when the cycle was still at its peak. Royalties amounted to ‚Ç¨174.7 million from LNG and ethane carriers  ‚Ç¨13.6 million from FSUs  ‚Ç¨1.2 million from FLNGs  ‚Ç¨4.7 million from onshore storage tanks and ‚Ç¨3.3 million from GBSs. LNG as fuel royalties (‚Ç¨2.9 million) were not yet impacted by the high order intake in 2021 and 2022.Nine-month revenues from the Elogen electrolyser business amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million  in a context of increasing commercial dynamic.Revenues from services rose sharply  up 50.2% to ‚Ç¨18.7 million  driven by growth in digital services and engineering studies mainly related to the conversion of LNG carriers into FSRUs.Update on exposure to RussiaWork on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is currently continuing  in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes.In Russia  the Group is involved in tank design for 15 ice-breaking LNG carriers currently being built at the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of 3 GBSs7 currently under construction at Saren B.V.8 At October 1  2022  revenues of ‚Ç¨74 million have yet to be recognised by 2025 for ice-breaking LNG carriers  including ‚Ç¨4 million in Q4 2022. Revenues of ‚Ç¨12 million have yet to be recognised for 2027 for GBSs  including ‚Ç¨1 million in Q4 2022.Given the impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and successful execution of these contracts are still exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation. In particular  sanctions are still affecting Russian imports of certain products and equipment used in current projects  including the Zvezda project. Furthermore  as previously announced  in July Saren B.V. notified GTT of its intention to terminate the contract between them. The termination date has not yet been finally set. In this context  GTT continues to investigate solutions to ensure the proper implementation and integrity of its technology  in strict compliance with international sanctions.As a reminder  other orders in progress in Asian shipyards for six ice-breaking LNG carriers and two FSUs9 are specifically intended for Russian Arctic projects. These projects are currently proceeding according to plan. At October 1  2022  these orders represented total revenues of ‚Ç¨31 million for GTT  to be recognized by 2024  including ‚Ç¨7 million in Q4 2022.Finally  eight conventional LNG carriers ordered by international shipowners  under construction in Asian shipyards  are intended for the Arctic LNG 2 project  but can operate in all types of conditions.2022 outlook confirmedIn its 2021 annual results press release dated February 17  2022  the Group issued the following targets for 2022  assuming no significant order deferrals or cancellations:consolidated revenues of between ‚Ç¨290 million and ‚Ç¨320 million consolidated EBITDA of between ‚Ç¨140 million and ‚Ç¨170 million a dividend amount for the 2022 financial year at least equivalent to the 2021 dividend.Given delays in shipbuilding schedules for certain vessels during the first nine months of 2022  the Group confirms its forecast that revenues and EBITDA will reach the lower half of the ranges announced in February.In the longer term  the Group should benefit from the current strong order momentum and expects to achieve significantly higher revenues and earnings from 2023 onwards versus 2022.***First nine months of 2022 activity update presentationPhilippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and Virginie Aubagnac  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT‚Äôs business during the first nine months of 2022 and answer questions from the financial community during a conference call to be held  in English  on Thursday  October 27  2022 at 6:15 p.m. Paris time.This conference will also be broadcast live on GTT‚Äôs website (www.gtt.fr/finance).To participate in the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: +33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004USA: +1 718 705 87 96Confirmation code: 130114The presentation document will be available on the website on October 27  2022 from 17:45 p.m.Financial agendaPayment of an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨1.55 per share for the 2022 financial year: December 15  20222022 full year results release: February 16  2023 (after close of trading)Shareholders‚Äô Meeting: June 7  2023About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q3 2022 ResultsRevenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨2 664 million  an increase of 23.7% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency. Revenue includes a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit in Recorded Music from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider (the ""Legal Settlement"")  as well as a ‚Ç¨21 million negative impact in Music Publishing from a previously announced change in accounting policy.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters.UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 26.5% year-over-year  or 15.4% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨539 million  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. EBITDA margin was 20.2%  compared to 19.8% in the third quarter of 2021. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨14 million during the third quarter of 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨15 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the third quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was ‚Ç¨553 million  up 20.0% year-over-year  or 9.1% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.8%  compared to 21.4% in the third quarter of 2021.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 included a ‚Ç¨52 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  partially offset by the negative ‚Ç¨7 million impact from the Change in Society Accounting.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were also impacted by the timing of certain A&R expenses  which increased in the quarter but remain down year-to-date  and by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards Merchandising and Other revenues  which carry a significantly lower EBITDA margin than the Company's other revenues. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat versus the prior-year quarter.YTD 2022 ResultsIn the nine months ended September 30  2022  UMG's revenues of ‚Ç¨7 398 million increased by 23.6%  or 15.6% in constant currency  compared to the nine months ended September 30  2021. This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2022 includes a ‚Ç¨123 million benefit from the Change in Society Accounting  and a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  both discussed above. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2021 included a ‚Ç¨41 million benefit from a catch up payment from a digital service provider ""DSP Catch-Up Payment""  previously disclosed and booked in Q2 2021. Excluding these items  revenue increased 21.2% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  EBITDA of ‚Ç¨1 499 million grew 20.1% year-over-year  or 12.6% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 20.3% compared to 20.9% in the prior year period. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨16 million during the nine months through Q3 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨18 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the nine months through Q3 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 was ‚Ç¨1 515 million  up 17.8% compared to the comparable period in 2021  or up 10.2% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.0pp year-over-year to 20.5%.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 benefitted from the Change in Society Accounting (‚Ç¨27 million) and the Legal Settlement (‚Ç¨52 million). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended Q3 2021 benefitted from the DSP Catch-Up Payment (‚Ç¨26 million)  as well as from a previously disclosed recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release""  ‚Ç¨20 million) in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA grew 15.8% year-over-year  or 8.0% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%  compared to 20.9% for the nine months ended Q3 2021. The contraction in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards lower-margin Merchandising revenues in the first nine months of 2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedSeptember 30 %%Nine Months EndedSeptember 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance measures or indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the income from Operating Profit:amortization of intangible assets; impairment losses on goodwill and other intangibles; other income and expenses related to transactions with shareowners (except when directly recognized in equity); depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets; (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  including right of use assets and intangible assets; (income)/losses from equity affiliates; restructuring expenses; and other non-recurring items.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity  including but not limited to professional fees and listing fees related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity.Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/512308/UMG.jpgSOURCE Universal Music Group N.V.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.21,0.56,True,English,"['Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Financial Results', 'Third Quarter', 'Nine Months', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'financial reporting quarters', 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'alternative performance indicators', 'copyright infringement lawsuit', 'internet service provider', 'best available estimate', 'Euronext Amsterdam durin', 'Summary Q3 Results1', 'Summary YTD Results', '‚Ç¨21 million negative impact', 'relevant collection society', 'current year rates', 'greater absolute EBITDA', 'current year results', 'Music Publishing revenue', 'prior year results', 'financial results', 'Constant currency change', 'Q3 2022 Results', 'Society Accounting', 'greater value', '‚Ç¨71 million benefit', 'accounting policy', 'prior years', 'Recorded Music', 'Music revenue', 'Top sellers', 'Morgan Wallen', 'nine months', 'growing range', 'creative opportunities', 'recording artists', 'global reach', 'unique understanding', 'music-related content', 'recurring income', 'Boyd Muir', 'long-term value', 'broad diversity', 'press release', 'UMG Results', 'Three Months', 'end customer', 'share-based compensation', 'strong growth', 'Other revenue', 'high-quality revenue', 'revenue streams', 'Legal Settlement', 'revenue growth', 'third quarter', '12.6 % EBITDA margin', 'IFRS measures', 'Other segments', 'growing revenues', '15.6 % EBITDA', 'Merchandising', 'BTS', 'BLACKPINK', 'Ado', 'INI', 'HILVERSUM', 'Netherlands', 'PRNewswire', 'Company', 'diverse', 'business', 'songwriters', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'innovation', 'evolution', 'market', 'monetization', 'sources', 'EVP', 'CFO', 'President', 'Operations', 'vision', 'success', 'shareholders', 'descriptions', 'reconciliations', 'Appendix', 'YoY', '0.4pp', 'Note', 'increase', 'relation', 'societies', 'usage', 'collectability', 'Recognition', 'accrual', 'amount', 'consideration', 'timing', 'expenses', 'listing', '23.7', '23.6']",2022-10-27,2022-10-27,prnewswire.co.uk

We look forward to welcoming all employees  customers  and relations of Aegon the Netherlands in the near future.‚Äù1 Value of 29.99% stake is EUR 2.4 billion based on the closing price of a.s.r.‚Äôs shares on October 26  2022 and 57 million shares to be received by Aegon upon closing of the transaction before any potential equity offering by a.s.r. as part of the funding of the transaction.Compelling strategic rationaleCombining the two companies will result in a strong well-diversified Dutch insurance company that will be able to deliver a broad range of attractive products and services and generate attractive shareholder returns.The combined group will:have a leading position in the Dutch pension market.

Aegon will benefit from a.s.r.‚Äôs improved operating capital generation and capital synergies through its 29.99% stake in the company. Aegon will bring to a.s.r. significant risk management capabilities and accelerate the implementation of a Partial Internal Model for the calculation of the Solvency II required capital of the combination.Leveraging Aegon Asset Management‚Äôs capabilitiesAegon has agreed an exclusive long-term partnership with a.s.r. to manage the illiquid investments that are part of the general account of the combined businesses. In addition  it will continue to be the asset manager for the investments of Aegon Cappital‚Äôs PPI proposition and will take over the management of a.s.r.‚Äôs mortgage funds. Through these steps  Aegon Asset Management will further strengthen its position as a provider in the Dutch market of fiduciary services  retirement multi-assets & solutions  fixed income  including alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing.Governance of combinationAegon N.V. will be a 29.99% strategic  supportive shareholder in a.s.r.  allowing Aegon to participate in the financial benefits that the combination will bring. Furthermore  Aegon will have the right to nominate two candidates for the a.s.r. Supervisory Board. Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon N.V will be nominated as a non-independent member  and Danielle Jansen Heijtmajer  Chair of the Supervisory Board of Aegon the Netherlands  will be nominated as an independent member of the Supervisory Board of a.s.r.. The non-independent member has an affirmative vote within a.s.r.‚Äôs Supervisory Board on certain topics  in line with the size of Aegon‚Äôs shareholding.Integration and organization of companiesThe activities of a.s.r. and Aegon the Netherlands will be integrated after closing of the transaction to maximize the potential of the two businesses and fully benefit from their combined reach  scale  and resources. The integration is expected to impact employees in both companies. The integration will be largely completed within three years  and the intention is to minimize the number of redundancies through natural attrition and by helping people to the greatest extent possible to find jobs either inside or outside of the combination. The process will be executed in a fair  diligent  and open way  respecting the talents and strengths of people in both organizations. Employees of the combination will benefit from the sharing of best practices and greater long-term career opportunities within a larger  more diversified Dutch company.The a.s.r. brand will be the leading brand of the combination. The Aegon brand will remain in use in the pension and mortgage markets for three years after closing of the transaction. There will be no change for the brands of Aegon‚Äôs other entities  including TKP  Knab  Robidus and Nedasco.Accelerating transformationThe transaction represents a major step in the transformation of Aegon  building on the successful execution of the strategy outlined at the Capital Markets Day of December 2020 to create leaders in chosen markets. The transaction forms a leader in the Dutch insurance market and enables Aegon to increase its focus on creating advantaged businesses in chosen markets outside the Netherlands.In the US  Aegon will build upon Transamerica‚Äôs leading positions in both individual life insurance solutions and the workplace pension business  investing capital to profitably grow its market share in selected product lines. Additionally  Transamerica will continue to take management actions designed to further improve the risk-return profile of the business. In the UK  Aegon‚Äôs ambition is to continue to profitably grow both the Retail and Workplace channels of its leading platform business by improving its customer propositions  service capabilities and digital experience for advisors  employers  and customers. The transaction allows Aegon Asset Management to strengthen its position in retirement-related investment solutions  alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing  and to build leadership in these areas. In its growth markets  Aegon will continue to look to invest capital in value-added growth opportunities. More details will be shared on the plans to profitably grow the strategic businesses in Aegon‚Äôs core markets  its growth markets  and its global asset manager at a Capital Markets Day in the second quarter of 2023.Use of proceeds and financial implicationsAegon anticipates that it will return EUR 1.5 billion of the cash proceeds to shareholders  barring unforeseen circumstances  to offset the dilutive effect of the transaction on free cash flow per share. Furthermore  the company intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million.A priority for Aegon moving forward is to drive sustainable  profitable growth for Transamerica and to execute upon additional in-force management actions designed to improve the risk-return profile of the business. It is anticipated that this will require funding and therefore Aegon expects to maintain its Cash Capital at the Holding above the middle of the operating range of EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion in the near term. Surplus Cash Capital at the Holding above the operating range will be subject to continued disciplined capital management  whereby capital that is not used for value-added growth opportunities will be returned to shareholders over time.Update on financial targets; increase in dividend per shareOn completion of the transaction  Aegon will replace its full ownership of the cash flow and profits of its Dutch businesses with its 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r.. In the near term  this is expected to translate into lower free cash flow  improving over time as synergies emerge from the combination. On completion of the capital return to shareholders and realization of the synergies  Aegon anticipates that its free cash flow on a per share basis will be higher than pre-transaction levels.The progress that Aegon has made on its transformation allows the company to increase its pay-out ratio and rebase the targeted dividend per share over 2023 from the current level of around 25 eurocents to around 30 eurocents.All other financial targets will be updated in due course.The transaction is expected to reduce IFRS shareholders‚Äô equity by EUR 3.3 billion based on the balance sheet position on June 30  2022. This includes the impact from the settlement of a tax position at closing of the transaction  which is not anticipated to have a material impact on Aegon‚Äôs Cash Capital at the Holding.Group supervision implicationsAegon will engage with its college of supervisors on the implications for group supervision upon closing of the intended transaction. Regardless of the outcome  Aegon intends to maintain its head office in the Netherlands. Its shares will remain listed on Euronext in Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange.Indicative timelinesThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including regulatory and antitrust approvals  shareholder approvals  and the completion of the works council consultation processes of both Aegon and a.s.r..Aegon will convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM) and request approval for the proposed combination between Aegon the Netherlands and a.s.r.. The EGM is expected to be held on January 18  2023. The Board of the Association Aegon has been informed of Aegon‚Äôs ambition to accelerate its strategy and the proposed combination with a.s.r.. The Board is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for its support.Based on the required steps  and necessary approvals  the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023.About AegonAegon is an integrated  diversified  international financial services group.

Over the nine first months  Ipsos posted a 13.4% growth  of which 6.3% organic  confirming that we are on track to finish 2022 well. Excluding the temporary net positive impact of Covid-related contracts  our underlying organic growth is 9.2% at the end of September.The average cumulative organic growth at the end of September is 32% over the last two years and 19% over the last three years  which demonstrates our regular performance and strong operating model.PERFORMANCE BY QUARTER2022 vs. 2021 In millions ofEuros 2022Revenue Totalgrowth Organicgrowth 1st quarter 547.8 17.5% 12.3% (1) 2nd quarter 574.0 8.9% 2.1% 3rd quarter 601.5 14.3% 5.3%* Revenue 1 723.3 13.4 % 6.3 %*(1) Covid-related contracts were maintained at least in part until March 31  2022* Underlying organic growth is 6.9% for the third quarter and 9.2% for the Nine-month 2022  excluding the temporary net positive impact of Covid-related contracts (specific pandemic monitoring projects for governments  minus contracts that could not be executed because of the health situation).Looking specifically at the third quarter  total growth is 14.3%  of which 5.3% organic and 8.0% currency effects.

In particular  double-digit growth is experienced in the Service Lines that focus on measuring and analyzing brand growth and expression.Good growth is also noted in our work focusing on customers and employees  which reflects an increasing interest of our clients in measuring and assessing their own client experiences and also in ensuring the quality of their HR plans.After massive growth during the 2020-21 period spurred by large scale Covid-testing programmes in Europe  our work among citizens has fallen back in 2022. However  the underlying business excluding Covid contracts records a double-digit growth  confirming the need for governments to better understand citizens‚Äô expectations and behaviours in an uncertain and inflationary world.Finally  our work with doctors and patients has seen moderate growth in 2022  impacted by an unfavorable base effect after a rapid expansion during the pandemic.OUTLOOKWe are confident that we can deliver better performance than promised at this start of the year: we now expect organic growth in 2022 to be closer to 6% than 5% and a level of operating margin comparable to that of last year. Hence  we confirm a consistently higher level of profitability than in the past.As the business prepares for 2023  we are in a good place. If some clients become more cautious for the coming months  we see no significant slowdown in our orders.

Q4 Net Sales growth will be driven by both volumes and prices. We maintain our target of over 200 million euros in Free Cash Flow.Despite input cost inflation  continued investment in Brand support  and OPEX aimed at fueling growth  Full Year 2022 adjusted EBIT is expected to grow in absolute terms.Strong Momentum in all divisions9M 2022 Group Net Sales increased 11.6% on a comparative basis  13.8% at Constant Currencies  and 11.3% on a 12-month rolling basis2. Year-to-date and quarterly growth were driven by volume increase  favorable mix  and the successful implementation of price increases in all regions. All divisions and regions contributed to 9M and Q3 performance.In Human Expression   9M organic growth continued to be driven by our Core Writing Instruments and Coloring segments. The 2022 Back-to-School season was solid in Europe  North America  and Mexico  notably in the Ball Pen  Mechanical Pen  and Coloring segments. Capitalizing on our value positioning  we gained market share in all key countries  outperforming in classic and added-value segments. India and African countries continued to recover from the pandemic and achieved high-double-digit growth. In Brazil  the strong recovery of the Stationery market  which grew double-digit year-to-date  coupled with a strong commercial execution from our teams  should support a solid 2022-2023 Back-to-School season.Added-value Lighters grew 13% in value and accounted for 35% of the Flame For Life 9M Net Sales. In the US  BIC EZ Reach utility pocket lighter continued to be incremental to the overall category and reached over 5% of the Pocket lighter market  driven by accelerated distribution  notably in convenience stores  and efficient Brand Support. Net Sales grew double-digit in Europe  driven by both Western and Eastern countries. Brazil's performance continued to be fueled by demand for more flame occasions.In Blade Excellence  we gained market share in all key regions (US  Europe  and Latin America). Our value-added products fueled the performance  driven by the ongoing success of our Flex and Soleil ranges. BIC Blade-Tech B2B business continued to ramp up and contributed to 20% of the total Blade Excellence Year-to-Date Net Sales growth.Input cost inflation and investment in Growth (Brand Support and OPEX) partially offset by favorable pricing and Net Sales operating leverage9M 2022 Gross Profit margin decreased by 2.5 points to 48.9% as reported  and by 2.8 points excluding Inkbox. Input cost inflation (- 5.6 pts) and unfavorable FX (-1.1 pts)  mainly EUR/USD hedging rate (-1.2 pts)  were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption (+2.1 pts)  pricing (+1.7 pts)  and the positive contribution of Inkbox (+0.3 pts). 9M 2022 Adjusted EBIT increased by 8.0%. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%  a decrease of 2.1 pts compared to 9M 2021 as reported and -1.2 pts excluding Inkbox. Net Sales operating leverage (+4.2 pts) was more than offset by the increase in Brand Support (-0.9 pts)  OPEX (-1.6 pts)  and the negative impact from recent acquisitions  including Inkbox (-0.9 pts).Q3 Gross Profit margin decreased by 3.4 pts at 47.4% notably driven by higher FX. Q3 adjusted EBIT margin declined -5.9 pts driven by higher Brand Support and OPEX  as well as the negative impact from recent acquisitions investments in growth partially offset by Net Sales Operating leverage.Total input cost inflation weighed 79 million euros on 9M adjusted EBIT (including 31 million euros in Q3). For the balance of the year  we expect approximately 30 million euros headwinds from input cost inflation  including electricity prices.

The purpose of the programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the company. All shares repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled. It is intended that  subject to market conditions  the programme will be completed prior to the company‚Äôs Q4 results announcement  scheduled for February 2  2023.The company has entered into an arrangement with a single broker consisting of three irrevocable  non-discretionary contracts  to enable the purchase of ordinary shares on both London market exchanges (the London Stock Exchange and/or on BATS and/or on Chi-X) (pursuant to two ‚ÄòLondon contracts‚Äô) and Netherlands exchanges (Euronext Amsterdam and/or on CBOE Europe DXE and/or on Turquoise Europe) (pursuant to one ‚ÄòNetherlands contract‚Äô) for a period up to and including January 27  2023. The aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the London contracts is $2 billion and the maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the Netherlands contract is $2 billion. Purchases under the London contracts will be carried out in accordance with the company‚Äôs authority1 to repurchase shares on-market and will be effected within certain contractually agreed parameters. Purchases under the Netherlands contract will be carried out in accordance with the company‚Äôs authority1 to repurchase shares off-market pursuant to the off-market share buyback contract approved by its shareholders and the parameters set out therein.The maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased or committed to be purchased by the company under the programme (across all three contracts) is 528 919 217  which is the maximum number remaining as of the date of this announcement pursuant to the relevant authorities granted by shareholders at the company's 2022 Annual General Meeting1.The broker will make its trading decisions in relation to the company's securities independently of the company.The programme will be conducted in accordance with Chapter 12 of the Listing Rules  Article 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU dealing with buy-back programmes (‚ÄòEU MAR‚Äô) and EU MAR as ‚Äúonshored‚Äù into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (the ‚ÄòEU MAR Delegated Regulation‚Äô) and the EU MAR Delegated Regulation as ‚Äúonshored‚Äù into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time.1 The existing shareholder authorities to buy back shares granted at the company's 2022 Annual General Meeting will expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 24  2023  and the end of the date of the company's 2023 Annual General Meeting. The company expects to seek renewal of shareholder authority to buy back shares at subsequent Annual General Meetings.EnquiriesMedia International: +44 (0) 207 934 5550Media Americas: +1 832 337 4355CAUTIONARY STATEMENTThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this announcement ‚ÄúShell‚Äù  ‚ÄúShell Group‚Äù and ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words ‚Äúwe‚Äù  ‚Äúus‚Äù and our‚Äù are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‚Äò‚ÄòSubsidiaries‚Äô‚Äô  ‚ÄúShell subsidiaries‚Äù and ‚ÄúShell companies‚Äù as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as ‚Äújoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù  respectively. ‚ÄúJoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù are collectively referred to as ‚Äújoint arrangements‚Äù. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as ‚Äúassociates‚Äù. The term ‚ÄúShell interest‚Äù is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 27  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Elsewhere in Europe  activities are growing quickly as the roll-out of fiber-optic networks gets underway in most of the countries where Solutions 30 operates.For the first nine months of 2022  Solutions 30‚Äôs consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨656.8 million  up +0.5% (-1.8% on an organic basis).Revenue by regionFrance: In the third quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of ‚Ç¨96.7 million  down 20.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021.With ‚Ç¨68.9 million in revenue  the telecom business is down 20.0% compared to the third quarter of 2021. This decline in business reflects the maturity of the market after the record levels of activity observed during the COVID crisis  which accelerated the deployment of ultra-fast broadband in France. The industry as a whole‚Äîcustomers as well as service providers and subcontractors‚Äîhas been forced to adapt and adjust to new ways of cooperating and to a temporary lack of visibility brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties. As a result  the operational conditions under which contracts are executed have significantly deteriorated in recent months and been aggravated by the current inflationary situation.This has implications for the entire industry and pricing renegotiations are underway. In this context  Solutions 30 is continuing its operational transition by building on its strong competitive advantages: a diversified customer and business portfolio  a healthy financial structure with little debt  and an agile organization.Revenue from the energy business amounted to ‚Ç¨11.5 million  compared with ‚Ç¨19.7 million a year earlier. This decline of 41.4% is due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France (activity down 79.6%). Even though revenue from the new energy transition and electric mobility verticals is still suffering from supply chain disruptions  it increased by 31%. However  this growth does not yet compensate for the decline in the company‚Äôs historic verticals.The IT business posted revenue of ‚Ç¨11.2 million  stable compared to last year‚Äôs third quarter  while the security and payments business is up 12.9%  generating ‚Ç¨5.1 million in revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨4.5 million a year earlier.Over the first nine months of the year  revenue is down 18.7% to ‚Ç¨318.6 million.Benelux: Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨53.6 million compared to ‚Ç¨39.3 million a year earlier  representing pure organic growth of 36.5% and reflecting the excellent dynamics of the Belgian and Dutch markets.The growth of the telecom business is accelerating due to the rapid ramp-up of the contracts signed with Fiberklaar  Open Dutch Fiber  and Unifiber. Revenue from fiber activities alone increased 4.5 times over the quarter  growing the telecom business by 40.1% and resulting in quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨40.3 million compared to ‚Ç¨28.8 million a year earlier.For the energy business  revenue was ‚Ç¨9.5 million compared to ‚Ç¨6.6 million a year earlier  a purely organic increase of 43.0%  thanks to the deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius.Quarterly revenue from the IT business remained stable at ‚Ç¨2.1 million while revenue from the retail and security businesses was ‚Ç¨1.7 million  compared to ‚Ç¨1.8 million for the third quarter of 2021.Over the first nine months of 2022  revenue grew by 33.2% to ‚Ç¨152.1 million  compared to ‚Ç¨114.2 million a year earlier.In all other countries  the group posted quaterly revenue of ‚Ç¨62.1 million  an increase of 21.0% (10.4% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue began to grow again and is up 7% to ‚Ç¨16.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨15.1 million a year earlier. As expected  the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization  as well as updated pricing conditions for certain major contracts  are starting to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 19% in the third quarter of 2022 to ‚Ç¨14.8 million  driven by the pursuit of TIM‚Äôs ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley  which began in the first quarter of 2021.On the Iberian peninsula  revenue grew by 8% to ‚Ç¨14.4 million  thanks to positive dynamics in the telecommunications sector (fiber and 5th generation mobile networks)  a strong uptick in installations of charging stations for electric vehicles  and pricing increases obtained from several customers.In Poland  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨7.9 million  up 35% (23% organic growth). Solutions 30 continues to gain market share in this country  while the integration of Sirtel into the portfolio of activities for 5G networks is progressing well. The organization put in place will ensure the company‚Äôs ability to support its customers‚Äô growth. The mobile networks business is growing rapidly and now accounts for nearly 10% of revenue.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted ‚Ç¨8.8 million in revenue during the quarter  up 92% (-11% on an organic basis). Solutions 30 has streamlined its operations to focus on higher-potential markets and the diversification of its services into fiber-optic networks  while the integration of Mono‚Äôs operations continues.In all these countries  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨186.1 million for the first nine months of 2022  an increase of 26.2% (15.8% on an organic basis) compared to the first nine months of 2021.OutlookIn response to current inflationary pressure  Solutions 30 is increasing its prices  both on new and existing contracts. The group has also taken measures to strictly control operating costs with the aim of preserving a solid financial structure with little debt. Such a structure will protect its ability to finance growth through acquisitions  increase its agility  strengthen its competitive advantages  and preserve its future capacity to pursue consolidation in its sector.In France  the market is in transition  which has led to limited short-term visibility. Against this backdrop  Solutions 30 will pursue its action plan to restore growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan involves (i) winning marketshare in the mature telecoms sector where a second phase of consolidation is expected to take place; (ii) developing new  high-growth activities  especially in the energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles; and (iii) seeking out synergies between the various businesses  accompanied by a reallocation of technicians to businesses with greater potential.In the Benelux and other countries  growth will remain strong through the end of the year  with the same momentum it saw in the third quarter.For the group as a whole  the fourth-quarter trend should be in line with the first nine months of the year and 2022 revenue should remain at the same levels as in 2021. The increase in the EBITDA margin at the end of the year is subject to ongoing price negotiations.From 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth  driven by the development momentum of its activities outside France. It should also see an overall improvement in its profitability. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q4 Revenue and 2022 Annual Revenue Reports | January 26  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  the Group recorded growth of 14.0%  despite persistent supply chain issues in its various businesses  particularly in agricultural spraying and sugar beet harvesters.The change in consolidation scope arising from the Group‚Äôs two recent acquisitions (EXEL Yachting and G.F.) contributed ‚Ç¨5.2 million to fourth quarter sales.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 37.8%After peaking in spring 2022  accentuated by the conflict in Ukraine  agricultural commodity prices fell slightly during the summer and stabilized at levels still well above pre-COVID prices. Against this backdrop  demand remained strong in all regions  particularly North America  while the component shortage shows no sign of abating.The exceptionally well-stocked order book enabled the various Group companies to mitigate sales seasonality and carry out a significant amount of billing during the quarter.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 18.9%After a third quarter particularly impacted by component shortages and a resurgence of COVID in Germany  business caught up strongly in the fourth quarter  resulting in record billings for sales of sugar beet harvesters.LEISURE: UP 21.7%The garden equipment market declined in the Group‚Äôs three main operating regions (the United Kingdom  France and Italy). In this context and after a series of challenging quarters (IT migration)  Q4 business came close to the previous year‚Äôs levels  bolstered by a more favorable basis of comparison than in previous quarters.The EXEL Yachting business posted a satisfactory quarterly performance with deliveries in line with forecasts.INDUSTRY: UP 5.1%At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  business was stable during the quarter: technical hoses and industrial spraying saw a slight slowdown in volumes in Europe  offset by ongoing robust momentum in Asia and  to a lower extent  the USA.Situation in Ukraine and RussiaThe new sanctions announced in early October do not affect Group products any more than the previous sanctions. As previously announced  EXEL Industries has maintained its operations in Russia (agricultural equipment and industrial spraying) but has taken care to ensure that deliveries are made in compliance with international regulations. The Group has been able to maintain overall sales volumes in the region.FY 2021‚Äì2022 salesFull-year 2021‚Äì2022 sales amounted to ‚Ç¨977.0 million  up 11.4%. Growth at constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates was 4.4%. EXEL Industries‚Äô concern was to adjust prices across all of its business lines  in response to rising raw material and component costs. This policy implemented throughout the year offset certain volume declines due to shortages (mainly agricultural equipment) or to the market slowdown (gardening). The currency effect was particularly favorable to the agricultural spraying and industry segments.The change in consolidation scope represented sales of ‚Ç¨29.8 million for the year.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 16.1%The agricultural spraying business was impacted by varying trends during the year: on the one hand  Group brands were hard hit by persisting component shortages despite very different production bases (Europe  the USA). Prices were increased throughout the period in order to pass on price increases implemented by supplier. On the other hand  order intake was boosted by the stabilization of agricultural commodity prices at globally high levels  giving the Group clear visibility over the coming fiscal year.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 8.0%After recovering in 2020‚Äì2021  sales remained strong during the fiscal year ended. In addition  component shortages allowed the Group to clear a large volume of used machine inventories. Lastly  prices were increased to offset increases in production costs (steel and other components).LEISURE: UP 4.9%The gardening business was impacted by three factors during the year. After two exceptional years in terms of volumes  markets returned to pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile  challenges related to the migration of IT systems curbed leisure business volumes by around ‚Ç¨10 million. Prices were increased during the year to offset significant increases in the cost of raw materials and logistics. Lastly  the acquisition of G.F. on February 15  2022  resulted in a scope effect increasing sales for this activity by approximately ‚Ç¨20 million.A new sales  marketing and industrial drive launched in the nautical business is expected to impact the coming years.INDUSTRY: UP 9.5%The underlying markets (mainly automotive  furniture and industry) experienced contrasting trends. However  the industrial spraying business continued to post high volumes throughout the year in line with the previous year.The technical hose division was impacted by declining volumes in the gardening business  while the B2B business was impacted by falling demand towards the end of the year.Yves Belegaud  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group  said:‚ÄúThe strong commitment of our teams in the fourth quarter and the successful integration of our latest acquisitions allowed us to post record sales. This excellent performance was achieved in a challenging and volatile environment in which shortages have not been recovered. However  the Group is confident in its ability to continue its development  underpinned by the various business sectors in which it operates and a well-stocked order book.‚ÄùUpcoming eventsDecember 20  2022  before market opening: 2021‚Äì2022 full-year results.January 25  2023  before market opening: Q1 2022‚Äì2023 sales.About EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.

It covers the 12-months period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. We remark that comparative financials for the past accounting year 2020-21 relate to the 18-months period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021.A full copy of the GeoJunxion Annual Report 2021/22 is attached to this press release and can be found on the company‚Äôs website www.geojunxion.com  under the Investor Relations and Financial News sections.The 2021-22 accounting year was  once again  an eventful period during which the company continued its transformation and turnaround. For the third year in a row  we realized a substantial top line growth  while slightly reducing operating expenses  on a like for like basis. We also achieved Cash-Flow positive  as well as significant improvements on all the other financial KPIs. This is even more remarkable  because it was achieved during a time still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing concerns about the global economy due to the ramifications of the war in Ukraine with high energy prices and increased inflation.A summary of the key financials is provided in the table below:Due to the change in the period of the accounting year 2020-21 (to 18 months)  it is more difficult to analyze and compare the financials of the accounting year 2021-22 with the previous accounting years. As already remarked  the current accounting year covers the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 (12 months)  while the previous accounting year 2020-21 covers the period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021 (18 months). Additionally  the accounting year 2019 was based on a 12-month period but from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. To enable easier comparison  we also include below the income statement for the current accounting year and the pro-forma income statement for the two previous years  covering the same 12-months period from 1 July to 30 June the following year. This enables a clearer view of the revenue growth and significant improvements in all financial KPIs  comparing the same period.Revenue increased year-over-year by 40% to ‚Ç¨2.371.000 in 2021-22 compared to ‚Ç¨1.698.000 in the same period in 2020-21. It is very encouraging to highlight that this growth is not only due to non-recurring service revenue  but also the recurring service revenue increased substantially year-over-year (+72%) and recurring licenses remained essentially stable compared with the previous year.Costs for maps and data increased by 20 8% compared to the 12-months period of the prior year. These costs are related to content purchased to maintain and enrich the database and to hosting cost for delivering our data solutions via the cloud.Personnel expenses decreased in 2021-22  showing a 3% saving compared to the same period in 2020-21 despite a 40% higher revenue. The main drivers for this are a reduction in certain management roles in February 2022 and lower use of outsourced resources in the Netherlands and India during the second half of the accounting year.The depreciation cost on tangible fixed assets remained nearly flat year over year while amortization costs on intangible assets slightly increased. This increase is due to higher capitalized development costs and the amortization of these assets. Capitalized development costs are currently amortized over a period of 7 years  while before 2018  they were amortized over a longer period (15 to 20 years). Note that the book value of the database is subject to impairment testing. This means that the book value is compared to the value in use for the company. Per 30 June 2022  an impairment test was executed. This did not show a requirement for any additional impairment loss.Other operating expenses decreased more than 13% compared to the same period in 2020-21. This is the result of the implementation of a strict spending review  cost control measures  integration of tools and simplification of the group structure.Total Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 3% and Net Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 7% compared with the previous 12-months period. This confirms the general positive mood in which the company is operating today  capable of ‚Äúdelivering more with less‚Äù.Operating Result  despite still negative  shows an improvement of 63%  while the Net Loss was reduced by 46%  compared with the previous year.The net cash flow from operating activities in 2021-22 amounted to a positive cash inflow of ‚Ç¨131.000 compared to cash outflow of ‚Ç¨1.035.000 in the same period in 2020-21. This is primarily due to the significant improvement in the operating result and more favorable invoicing and collection terms negotiated with our customers and suppliers. During the accounting year 2021-22 there were no financing transactions  while  during the 2020-21 12-months period  a private placement was completed in December 2020  raising ‚Ç¨825.000 in equity funding.As an independent player  GeoJunxion focuses on creating ‚Äúmap agnostic‚Äù products  i.e.  designed to be fully integrated into any commercial and open-source brand of maps or utilized in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases in different industries and market sectors.GeoJunxion activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with its customers  through the creation of a recurring business model rather than one-off projects or transactions. Although the relationship may start with a proof-of-concept or a one-off project  most of our high value datasets require frequent and continuous updates to maintain or increase their value. As a result  the one-off project or proof-of-concept is often only a first step  followed by a recurring service or a license contract. As a result  converting the initial  one-off project into a recurring  predictable and sustainable revenue stream. In most cases  GeoJunxion also retains the IP and ownership of the newly developed datasets which can then be resold to other customers  thereby leveraging the initial investment and converting it into a virtuous business cycle.The GeoJunxion mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the environmental impact through intelligent solutions which enable more environmentally conscious decisions.GeoJunxion has valued diversity  integration and investment in social responsibility for years. We are committed to offering our daily contribution towards a better and more sustainable work environment. For this reason  the company has applied for PSO certification in 2020. PSO is the Dutch abbreviation for ‚ÄúPrestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen‚Äù  Performance ladder Social Entrepreneurship. In July 2022 we achieved Level 2 PSO certification  as one of the first publicly listed organizations in the Netherlands.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKLooking at the future  despite the general uncertainty pictured by the European Central Bank  GeoJunxion expects to see its top line to continue growing by 25 to 30% year over year. This expectation is built on orders booked in the first quarter of 2022-23 and a solid pipeline of opportunities. As a result of inflationary pressure and growing staff costs to deliver the projects  we expect our cost base to increase by 5 to 10%. GeoJunxion is reasonably confident to convert the above-mentioned guidance into positive EBITDA and EBIT close to break-even. On this basis  cash flow is  once again  expected to be positive for the accounting year 2022-23.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS / IMPORTANT NOTICEThis document contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial position and results of GeoJunxion.

The Parties have determined that they will not be able to fulfil the closing conditions  including the approval by the Danish Competition and Consumer Authority. The Parties have therefore withdrawn the notification of the transaction to the Danish Competition and Consumer Authority. Aqua d‚ÄôOr remains under review.IV. IFRS STANDARDS AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSIAS29: impact on reported dataDanone has been applying IAS 29 in hyperinflation countries as defined in IFRS  except for Turkey in view of the unmaterial impact. Adoption of IAS 29 in these hyperinflationary countries requires its non-monetary assets and liabilities and its income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general pricing power of its functional currency  leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover  its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.IAS 29: impact on reported data‚Ç¨ million except % Q3 2022 Sales 1.4 Sales growth (%) +0.02%Breakdown by quarter of 9M 2022 sales after application of IAS 299M 2022 sales correspond to the addition of:Q3 2022 reported sales;Q1 and Q2 2022 sales resulting from the application of IAS29 until September 30  2022 to sales of entities of hyperinflation countries (application of the inflation rate until September 30  2022 and translation into euros using September 30  2022 closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data).‚Ç¨ million Q1 20221 Q2 20222 Q3 2022 9M 2022 Europe 2 114 2 267 2 246 6 628 North America 1 477 1 662 1 813 4 953 China  North Asia & Oceania 735 936 940 2 611 Rest of the World 1 936 2 237 2 335 6 509 Total 6 263 7 103 7 334 20 7001Results from the application of IAS29 until September 30  2022 to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.2Results from the application of IAS29 until September 30  2022 to Q2 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.Financial indicators not defined in IFRSDue to rounding  the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported.

These results and trends enable us to upgrade our full-year targets for 2022  which should be another record year  both in sales and profitability.Our strong third quarter is also an excellent illustration of how our new strategy  Power Up 2025  allows us to tap into high growth segments of the electrical materials market  driven by powerful and resilient mega trends such as sustainability  energy transition or resource and labor scarcity.These trends  combined with a very strong backlog and our relentless focus on efficiency and digital  position us well for the future  in an economic environment that continues to offer little visibility.‚ÄùSALES REVIEW FOR THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30  2022Unless otherwise stated  all comments are on a constant and adjusted basis and  for sales  at same number of working days.SALESIn Q3  sales were up +35.5% year-on-year on a reported basis and +16.3% on a constant and same-day basis  reflecting positive momentum in all three geographies.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q3 2022 YoY change 9m 2022 YoY change Sales on a reported basis 4 816.6 +35.5% 13 899.4 +31.0% On a constant and actual-day basis +15.5% +15.4% On a constant and same-day basis +16.3% +14.7%In the third quarter  Rexel posted record sales of ‚Ç¨4 816.6m  up +35.5% on a reported basis  with a well-balanced contribution from both organic growth and M&A.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.
