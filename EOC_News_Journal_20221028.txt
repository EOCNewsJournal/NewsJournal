Shareholders can contact their broker  financial intermediary  bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.Story continuesTaxation - cash dividendsWith the Company‚Äôs tax residence moved to the UK  dividends paid to shareholders on their ordinary shares will not attract Dutch dividend withholding tax. This means that holders of the former A shares receive their dividends in full as Dutch dividend withholding tax is no longer withheld on these dividends.

The term ‚ÄúShell interest‚Äù is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 27  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions.

Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov).

Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) presents its preliminary  unaudited financial report for the first nine months ended September 30  2022.Pharming_Group_NV_LogoChief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:""In the first nine months of 2022 Pharming continued to perform well despite challenging industry conditions. Our commercialized asset RUCONEST¬Æ saw increased sales of 3% or US$151.0 million  compared to the same period last year  highlighting the continued need for a safe and effective acute hereditary angioedema therapy.From a strategic perspective  we continued to make significant progress delivering on a number of important regulatory milestones for leniolisib  a rare immunodeficiency disease. Of note  our New Drug Application for leniolisib was accepted by the US FDA for Priority Review with a PDUFA goal date of March 29  2023. Furthermore  we submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for the product to the European Medicines Agency following the grant of accelerated assessment. We remain on track for the anticipated marketing authorization of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in key markets next year.Looking ahead  the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib will be supported by our strong balance sheet and the steady sales of RUCONEST¬Æ. We will continue focusing on our strategic objectives and the internal review of our pipeline as we look to bring the unserved rare disease patient the solutions they need. We look forward to presenting more detailed plans at our full year financial results.""Story continuesStrategic highlightsDuring the first nine months of 2022  we continued to execute on our strategic objectives of building a sustainable business by focusing on RUCONEST¬Æ sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline as we prioritize our efforts on rare diseases.As announced during the half year financial results in August 2022  we initiated an internal review of our pipeline with a greater and renewed focus towards rare diseases. As a result  we will advance the development of our pipeline through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib  as well as OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition of new  late-stage assets through in-licensing and M&A opportunities.We believe these potential acquisitions and in-licensing will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST¬Æ business  anticipated future leniolisib business  as well as available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming will access additional funding from the capital markets.Pipeline developmentleniolisibFor leniolisib  Pharming has a three-step approach planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated marketing authorization and commercial launch of leniolisib for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older in the US during the first half of 2023. This will be followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK in the second half of 2023 and early 2024  respectively  dependent upon regulatory approval. The Company will evaluate additional countries and regions and will commercialize the product either directly or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes the marketing authorization and commercial launch of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in children as young as one year of age.The third step is the continued life cycle management of the leniolisib compound into further indications which will be disclosed when decisions have been taken.US marketWe remain on track for the anticipated commercial approval of leniolisib in the first quarter of 2023  subject to approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  followed by the commercial launch of leniolisib in the second quarter of 2023.In the third quarter of 2022  we delivered on a number of important regulatory milestones including the filing and acceptance of a New Drug Application (NDA) for Priority Review by the FDA.As a result of receiving Priority Review  Pharming's NDA for leniolisib was assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023.In anticipation of a positive outcome from the FDA  we continued to grow our US field force and leverage our marketing capabilities for the commercialization of leniolisib.Finally  the ICD-10-CM code for APDS took effect on October 1  2022. The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code enables physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.European Economic Area (EEA) and UK marketIn the EEA  we announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Upon further request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days.Further positive milestones were reached in October 2022 when we announced that we had submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for leniolisib to the EMA. We expect to receive EMA validation of the MAA at the end of October 2022  with anticipated marketing authorization in H1 2023.Moving on to the UK market  in April 2022  the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS. A PIM designation is an early indication that leniolisib is a candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme. This scheme provides an opportunity for treatment options to be used in clinical practice in parallel with the later stages of the regulatory process.Finally  on September 30  2022  the UK government took the decision to extend the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP) by 12 months  until December 31  2023. The ECDRP allows a company to submit a product that has received approval from EMA to the UK's MHRA. The MHRA can grant a license relying on the EMA's decision  thereby ensuring a less time consuming in-country review.The extension of the ECDRP has several benefits including aligned EU and UK dossiers  consistent labeling across the EU and UK  and the potential for an earlier Marketing Authorisation Approval. As such  Pharming has decided that the ECDRP procedure will be used for the application of leniolisib to the MHRA. Under ECDRP  if the submission of an application is made within five days of an EMA CHMP positive opinion  the MHRA will aim to determine a decision within a 67-day timeline. The anticipated MHRA decision should be known in H2 2023.Pediatric clinical developmentAs previously announced  we intend to expand access to leniolisib for the treatment of pediatric APDS. As a result  Pharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age. During the first half of the year  positive decisions were received from EMA and MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned  global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS aged 4 to 11 with a second study in patients aged 1 to 6. These two studies will support regulatory filings worldwide. Pharming expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib in the fourth quarter of 2022.OTL-105Pharming's strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is ongoing. The program has made good progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)As announced at our half year 2022 financial results  following an internal review of our pipeline  we have taken the strategic decision to discontinue further development of rhC1INH therapy for Acute Kidney Injury. We are considering strategic options to gain value from the work done to date and have de-prioritized further development and investment in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd. The herd is being maintained to allow all possible outcomes to be explored.The ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial is continuing as we evaluate these strategic options.We will update the market at our full year 2022 financial results on further progress in this area.PompeWe continue the preclinical investigation of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease and will update the market on the results as appropriate.Financial SummaryAmounts in US$m except per share data YTD 2022 YTD 2021 % Change Income StatementRevenues 151.0 146.1 3 % Gross profit 139.7 130.6 7 % Operating profit 28.4 15.3 86 % Profit for the year 28.3 13.9 104 % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 189.9 184.8 3 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.043 0.022 95 % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.040 0.018 122 %Financial highlightsYTD Q3 2022Revenues for the first nine months of 2022 were US$151.0 million  a 3% increase compared to the first nine months of 2021 (US$146.1 million).Gross profit for the first nine months of 2022 increased 7% to US$139.7 million. This increase was driven by growth in revenues  production efficiencies and a favorable tailwind in currency translation effects.Operating costs for the first nine months of 2022 increased by US$9.8 million to US$126.9 million versus the same period last year. The increase results from a combination of increased R&D expenditure  launch preparation and manufacturing costs for leniolisib  and an increase in travel related expenses post-COVID-19. This increase was partly offset by significant one-off costs in Q3 2021 relating to the in-licensing of OTL-105 from Orchard Therapeutics.Operating profit for the first nine months of 2022 was US$28.4 million  increasing 86% versus the same period last year. This was mainly driven by the increase in other income of US$13.8 million as a result of a reduced minority stake in BioConnection communicated in our H1 2022 press release.Net profit for the first nine months of 2022 was US$28.3 million  a 104% increase compared to the same period last year (US$13.9 million). This was driven by the increase in other income of US$13.8 million.Cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  decreased from US$193.0 million at the end of 2021  to US$189.9 million at the end of the third quarter 2022.OutlookFor the financial year of 2022:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST¬Æ sales. Quarterly fluctuations are expected.Subject to a positive outcome from the FDA review  we anticipate marketing authorization in the US for leniolisib at the end of Q1 2023  with an anticipated launch and commercialization in Q2 2023.Subject to a positive outcome from the EMA review  we anticipate a positive opinion from the CHMP for leniolisib  followed by the issuance of an MAA by the European Commission towards the end of H1 2023. Initial commercial launches in EU markets are planned for H2 2023.Following an anticipated positive CHMP opinion  we intend to submit an ECDRP filing for leniolisib with the MHRA in the UK in H2 2023.Pharming will continue to allocate resources towards the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib with the view of accelerating future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will continue to impact profit for the remainder of 2022 and throughout 2023. However  no additional financing to support the current business is expected with the continued cash flow from RUCONEST¬Æ funding these investments.Investment and continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of new  late- stage development opportunities and assets in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.No further specific financial guidance for 2022 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation will be available on the Pharming.com website from 10:30 CET on October 27  2022.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CET on October 27  2022.

CSC and Intertrust jointly recommend to all Shareholders to tender their Shares before that time.Q3 2022 revenue was ‚Ç¨ 159.0 million (+13.4% y-o-y). Underlying revenue growth was 8.2%  driven by double-digit growth in US Fund Services and Luxembourg  a return to growth in Cayman Islands and continued solid momentum in Rest of the World.

In the first nine months  revenue totalled ‚Ç¨ 459.1 million (+8.3% y-o-y) with underlying revenue growth of 4.2%.Adjusted EBITA was ‚Ç¨ 42.0 million  resulting in a 26.4% adjusted EBITA margin in Q3 2022 and reflects increased investments in the workforce  including onboarding and training of new personnel. Additionally  adjusted EBITA included ‚Ç¨ 4.4 million one-off costs related to remediation activities. In the first nine months  adjusted EBITA amounted to ‚Ç¨ 115.2 million  resulting in a 25.1% margin.Shankar Iyer  CEO of Intertrust: ‚ÄúWe see strong top-line momentum with accelerated revenue growth in the third quarter. Our continued investments in compliance  remediation and in our workforce support the long-term growth of our business. Our initiatives to contain costs in the current inflationary environment are beginning to bear fruit  resulting in a margin improvement compared to the previous quarter. We‚Äôve entered the final stages of the transaction with CSC  marking a new era for the Company.

This proposed update will involve a top holding company in Bermuda and is the result of a thorough legal and capital structure review. This will be formally proposed to shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting  scheduled to take place on 2 December 2022 at 14.00 CETManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:‚ÄúThis quarter delivered further proof points with respect to the diligent execution of our strategic growth agenda  particularly in fixed income. Our liquidity provision across the fixed income space which includes ETFs as well as corporate credit and emerging markets sovereign bonds continues to be positively received by the buy-side and we were delighted to be the lead sponsor once again at the recent Fixed Income Leadership Summit in Nice. Another landmark for Flow Traders was the successful approval of our QFII license which is a key part of our plan to enter the mainland China market. Given the strong financial performance in the quarter and within the context of our capital allocation framework  we have elected to increase the current share buyback program to a new total size of up to ‚Ç¨40 million. This buyback will further enhance the capital returns to our shareholders.‚ÄúWe have also worked hard this quarter on laying the groundwork for the future. The proposed update to the corporate holding structure was announced on 21 October 2022 and is a natural enabler for the strategic ambition which the team outlined at the Capital Markets Update held in July. In addition  we created an Executive Committee in order to accelerate the implementation of our strategy as well as to ensure that our leadership talent pool grows alongside the needs of the business. Lastly  it is also pleasing that in a highly competitive employment market  we are still able to attract and recruit the best talent and we welcomed a large intake of 18 new graduates in September to complement our already highly talented team.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúThe third quarter saw a more active fixed income market given interest rate and inflation impacts. This contributed to an overall strong trading performance  which was particularly evident in EMEA. Across other asset classes  realized volatility remained subdued compared to earlier in the year. Our trading footprint continues to grow as we successfully executed our first ever on-shore China trades. From a broader trading perspective  we remained focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities. We have enduring confidence in our ability to expand our trading activities across these various asset classes going forward.‚ÄùMike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:‚ÄúIndicative of the success of our trading diversification strategy  Flow Traders achieved a return on trading capital of 67% in Q3. Once again  the firm‚Äôs trading capital continues to generate attractive and economically accretive returns. From an operating cost perspective  we have had to contend with a changing macro environment which has brought rising inflation as well as a strengthening US dollar. We are therefore seeking to absorb these impacts while at the same time ensuring we continue to invest in the business in order to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable returns for our stakeholders. The adjusted profit-sharing percentage continues to effectively ensure that the base compensation increases implemented in Q2 are income statement neutral as communicated before. A key focus for the remainder of this year and next is to further increase the underlying efficiency of the business as we prepare ourselves for Flow Traders‚Äô next stage of growth.‚ÄúA key takeaway from the recent Capital Markets Update was the importance of engaging more intensely in the ecosystem we operate and thrive in. With that in mind  we have continued to support new products and listings across the crypto space and  notably  worked with exchanges and ETP issuers around the Ethereum upgrade. The pace of our strategic investments has naturally slowed somewhat with the advent of the ‚Äòcrypto winter‚Äô which has allowed for more time to work with partners on build-out and development. Nonetheless  Flow Traders Capital still announced five investments during the third quarter.‚ÄúPreliminary Financial Calendar2 December 2022 EGM12 January 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q422 / FY22 results9 February 2023 Release Q422 / FY22 results (incl. analyst conference call)24 February 2023 Release 2022 Annual Report31 March 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q123 trading update21 April 2023 Release Q123 trading update (no analyst conference call)26 April 2023 AGMContact DetailsFlow Traders N.V.InvestorsJonathan BergerPhone: +31 20 7996149Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996125Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial products  historically specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)  now expanding into other asset classes.

Our growth platforms have delivered a double-digit sales performance  reflecting improving commercial execution and the strength of our portfolio. These results have outweighed the adverse impact from competitive activity on Somatuline in the U.S. and Europe. Based on the strong sales momentum  we are confirming our guidance for the full year.I was also delighted by the enhancement of our pipeline  portfolio and organization as a result of the recent acquisition of Epizyme. In the near term  we look forward to a number of milestones for our pipeline  including Phase III data readouts in Oncology. I am pleased with the sustained progress we are making as we continue to maximize our brands  strengthen our pipeline  drive efficiencies and focus on our culture.‚ÄùFull-year 2022 guidanceIpsen has confirmed its financial guidance for FY 20223:‚Äì Total-sales growth greater than 7.0%  at constant exchange rates.

In Europe  sales declined by 9.3%4  reflecting the larger effects of the launches of generic lanreotide in more markets  including Germany  France  Spain and the Nordics. Sales in the Rest of the World grew by 34.5%4  a result of strong performances in several geographies  including Japan and Brazil‚Äì Decapeptyl: the performance was mainly driven by continued volume growth across all countries  higher volumes in China and Korea and favorable shipment phasing in Algeria. In the third quarter  sales were supported by a strong performance in China  partly reflecting the impact of a loosening of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions‚Äì Cabometyx: the performance reflected strong volume uptakes in renal cell carcinoma across most geographies  mainly as a second-line monotherapy and  more recently  as a first-line therapy in combination with nivolumab‚Äì Onivyde: sales growth was primarily driven by a solid performance in the U.S.  as well as sales to Ipsen‚Äôs ex-U.S. partner. The decline in sales in the third quarter reflected the impact of the phasing of 2022 sales to the partner‚Äì Dysport: the performance in the year to date was driven by strong demand in most therapeutics markets  and similar growth in the aesthetics market  including increased sales to Ipsen‚Äôs partner  Galderma  especially in North America and Australia. The stronger growth in the third quarter was boosted by the catch-up from the recent manufacturing-capacity increase that benefitted supply to support aesthetics-market demand‚Äì Tazverik: sales  which are in the U.S.  were consolidated from 1 September 2022Total sales by geographical areaYTD2022 YTD2021 % change Q32022 Q32021 % change ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER6 ‚Ç¨m ‚Ç¨m Actual CER6 North America 759.2 649.8 16.8% 4.0% 279.9 246.8 13.4% -2.6% Europe7 924.7 887.3 4.2% 3.7% 301.1 297.5 1.2% 1.1% Rest of the World 524.6 375.2 39.8% 32.5% 193.9 123.5 57.0% 43.7% Total Sales 2 208.5 1 912.3 15.5% 9.5% 774.8 667.8 16.0% 7.6%Commentary is based on the performance in YTD 2022.‚Äì North America: sales grew by 4.0%6  driven by a continued strong performance from Dysport in the therapeutics market and  in the aesthetics market  through Galderma  and from Onivyde  partly offset by a Somatuline sales decline of 3.6%6‚Äì Europe: sales growth of 3.7%6  mainly reflecting strong Cabometyx performances in France  Spain and Germany  and Decapeptyl‚Äôs continued market-share uptakes. Following the launch of generic lanreotide in some European markets  Somatuline sales declined by 9.3%6. Dysport sales grew by 7.6%6  driven by volume uptakes in the therapeutics market‚Äì Rest of the World: sales growth of 32.5%6  driven by solid volume growth in both Oncology and Neuroscience. In Oncology  the increase in Decapeptyl sales reflected the strong performance in China  share gains in several markets  and favorable shipment phasing in Algeria. The strong growth of Cabometyx was also a result of market-share gains across a number of geographies. The performance also reflected good Somatuline sales  including in Japan and Brazil.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen‚Äôs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers.

This situation has prompted the Group to adopt a prudent stance again with regard to its business over the coming months.NB: All revenue growth figures reported herein are at constant exchange rates and consolidation scope  unless otherwise stated.Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its unaudited revenues for the third quarter of 2022  covering the period from 1 July to 30 September 2022  and for the first nine months of 2022.Nine-month 2022 revenues:‚Ç¨m 9M 2021 Like-for-likechange Currencyimpact 9M 2022 LFL change(excl. currencyimpact) Reportedgrowth (incl.currencyimpact) France 56.8 3.6 - 60.4 +6.3% +6.3% International 65.1 8.3 1.2 74.6 +12.8% +14.6% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 121.9 11.9 1.2 135.0 +9.8% +10.7%Q3 2022 revenues‚Ç¨m Q3 2021 Like-for-likechange Currencyimpact Q3 2022 LFL change(exc. currency impact) Reportedgrowth (incl.currencyimpact) France 17.7 2.6 - 20.3 +14.7% +14.7% International 23.1 4.5 0.6 28.2 +19.4% +22.0% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 40.8 7.1 0.6 48.5 +17.3% +18.9%Breakdown by clusterFrance clusterThe France cluster posted revenues of ‚Ç¨60.4m for the nine months ended 30 September 2022  up 6.3% versus the previous year. This performance reflects in particular the continued improvement in on-trade sales in the third quarter coupled with robust sales in the off-trade market. Consequently Q3 revenues were up 14.7% versus 2021.Story continuesRevenue growth continued for the Group‚Äôs main brands over the first nine months of 2022  in particular Marie Brizard  Sobieski and San Jos√©. Our brands are positioned in line with customer needs in the current inflationary environment. In a declining market for under-12-year blended whisky (down 7.5% for the first nine months of 2022)  William Peel maintained its sales volumes compared to the first nine months of 2021 thanks to a competitive positioning still bolstered by the new listing obtained in the second half of 2021.However  in view of the ongoing severe supply chain disruption and sharp price rises for raw materials  particularly in the glass industry  the Group continues to adopt allocation measures per brand based on available volumes. Likewise  the necessary sales policy adjustments announced previously are being maintained and will continue in order to adapt to this changing environment.International clusterThe International cluster posted nine-month 2022 revenues of ‚Ç¨74.6m  up 12.8% versus 2021 at constant exchange rates.Western Europe enjoyed a favourable economic climate over the first nine months  with on-trade growth confirmed versus 2021  still driven by Marie Brizard.In Spain  nine-month revenues were up 12.8% versus 2021  mainly driven by strong subcontracting business and a sustained performance by strategic brands  primarily Marie Brizard and William Peel.Scandinavia posted nine-month revenues up 30.6%  also driven by Marie Brizard sales.The Baltic States posted nine-month revenues up 13.3%  including a slight upturn in the third quarter mainly due to brand performance driven by a proactive pricing policy and a buoyant bulk market.Bulgaria confirmed its growth trend with third quarter revenues up 18.9% across the entire brand portfolio (spirits and wines) in both domestic and export markets.In Poland  Gautier and Marie Brizard sales rose sharply in the first nine months of 2022 despite a slowdown in the third quarter.In the United States  nine-month revenues continued to fall short of 2021 performance  still impacted by a highly competitive vodka market (Sobieski) and inventory adjustment by our local distributor. Marie Brizard and Gautier continue to grow in this market.Brazil revenues edged up in Q3 2022  mainly driven by local brands underpinned by a proactive pricing policy.In Asia Pacific  the positive trend in the first half of 2022 was confirmed in the third quarter by sustained performance  particularly in South Korea and Australia.OutlookOngoing increases in raw material prices  surging energy costs and continued volatility in supplier production availability are factors we have already mentioned that must be taken into account when assessing the level and performance of the Group‚Äôs business activities.If they continue  these adverse factors could have an impact on the Group‚Äôs ability to supply all of its customers (in France and abroad) and on potential flexibility in consumer demand upset by sharp price rises.Despite the level of business growth since the start of the year  the prevailing situation obliges the Group to continue to proactively adapt pricing policies with customers. The Group will therefore continue to adopt a prudent stance with regard to its business level over the coming months  usually an important period as the year draws to a close  and perhaps also at the start of 2023.Financial calendarQ4 and full-year 2022 revenues: 16 February 2023Contact Relations Investisseurs et ActionnairesGroupe MBWSEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comT√©l : +33 1 43 91 62 40 Contact PresseImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr ‚Äì lmaury@image7.frT√©l : +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group based in Europe and the United States.

This proposed update will involve a top holding company in Bermuda and is the result of a thorough legal and capital structure review. This will be formally proposed to shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting  scheduled to take place on 2 December 2022 at 14.00 CETManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:‚ÄúThis quarter delivered further proof points with respect to the diligent execution of our strategic growth agenda  particularly in fixed income. Our liquidity provision across the fixed income space which includes ETFs as well as corporate credit and emerging markets sovereign bonds continues to be positively received by the buy-side and we were delighted to be the lead sponsor once again at the recent Fixed Income Leadership Summit in Nice. Another landmark for Flow Traders was the successful approval of our QFII license which is a key part of our plan to enter the mainland China market. Given the strong financial performance in the quarter and within the context of our capital allocation framework  we have elected to increase the current share buyback program to a new total size of up to ‚Ç¨40 million. This buyback will further enhance the capital returns to our shareholders.‚ÄúWe have also worked hard this quarter on laying the groundwork for the future. The proposed update to the corporate holding structure was announced on 21 October 2022 and is a natural enabler for the strategic ambition which the team outlined at the Capital Markets Update held in July. In addition  we created an Executive Committee in order to accelerate the implementation of our strategy as well as to ensure that our leadership talent pool grows alongside the needs of the business. Lastly  it is also pleasing that in a highly competitive employment market  we are still able to attract and recruit the best talent and we welcomed a large intake of 18 new graduates in September to complement our already highly talented team.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúThe third quarter saw a more active fixed income market given interest rate and inflation impacts. This contributed to an overall strong trading performance  which was particularly evident in EMEA. Across other asset classes  realized volatility remained subdued compared to earlier in the year. Our trading footprint continues to grow as we successfully executed our first ever on-shore China trades. From a broader trading perspective  we remained focused on executing our growth plans with respect to our business lines of Equity  Fixed Income and Crypto  Currencies and Commodities. We have enduring confidence in our ability to expand our trading activities across these various asset classes going forward.‚ÄùMike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:‚ÄúIndicative of the success of our trading diversification strategy  Flow Traders achieved a return on trading capital of 67% in Q3. Once again  the firm‚Äôs trading capital continues to generate attractive and economically accretive returns. From an operating cost perspective  we have had to contend with a changing macro environment which has brought rising inflation as well as a strengthening US dollar. We are therefore seeking to absorb these impacts while at the same time ensuring we continue to invest in the business in order to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable returns for our stakeholders. The adjusted profit-sharing percentage continues to effectively ensure that the base compensation increases implemented in Q2 are income statement neutral as communicated before. A key focus for the remainder of this year and next is to further increase the underlying efficiency of the business as we prepare ourselves for Flow Traders‚Äô next stage of growth.‚ÄúA key takeaway from the recent Capital Markets Update was the importance of engaging more intensely in the ecosystem we operate and thrive in. With that in mind  we have continued to support new products and listings across the crypto space and  notably  worked with exchanges and ETP issuers around the Ethereum upgrade. The pace of our strategic investments has naturally slowed somewhat with the advent of the ‚Äòcrypto winter‚Äô which has allowed for more time to work with partners on build-out and development. Nonetheless  Flow Traders Capital still announced five investments during the third quarter.‚ÄúPreliminary Financial Calendar2 December 2022 EGM12 January 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q422 / FY22 results9 February 2023 Release Q422 / FY22 results (incl. analyst conference call)24 February 2023 Release 2022 Annual Report31 March 2023 Start Silent Period ahead of Q123 trading update21 April 2023 Release Q123 trading update (no analyst conference call)26 April 2023 AGMContact DetailsFlow Traders N.V.InvestorsJonathan BergerPhone: +31 20 7996149Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996125Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial products  historically specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)  now expanding into other asset classes.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q3 2022 ResultsRevenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨2 664 million  an increase of 23.7% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency. Revenue includes a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit in Recorded Music from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider (the ""Legal Settlement"")  as well as a ‚Ç¨21 million negative impact in Music Publishing from a previously announced change in accounting policy.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters.UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 26.5% year-over-year  or 15.4% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨539 million  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. EBITDA margin was 20.2%  compared to 19.8% in the third quarter of 2021. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨14 million during the third quarter of 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨15 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the third quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was ‚Ç¨553 million  up 20.0% year-over-year  or 9.1% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.8%  compared to 21.4% in the third quarter of 2021.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 included a ‚Ç¨52 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  partially offset by the negative ‚Ç¨7 million impact from the Change in Society Accounting.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were also impacted by the timing of certain A&R expenses  which increased in the quarter but remain down year-to-date  and by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards Merchandising and Other revenues  which carry a significantly lower EBITDA margin than the Company's other revenues. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat versus the prior-year quarter.YTD 2022 ResultsIn the nine months ended September 30  2022  UMG's revenues of ‚Ç¨7 398 million increased by 23.6%  or 15.6% in constant currency  compared to the nine months ended September 30  2021. This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2022 includes a ‚Ç¨123 million benefit from the Change in Society Accounting  and a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  both discussed above. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2021 included a ‚Ç¨41 million benefit from a catch up payment from a digital service provider ""DSP Catch-Up Payment""  previously disclosed and booked in Q2 2021. Excluding these items  revenue increased 21.2% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  EBITDA of ‚Ç¨1 499 million grew 20.1% year-over-year  or 12.6% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 20.3% compared to 20.9% in the prior year period. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨16 million during the nine months through Q3 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨18 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the nine months through Q3 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 was ‚Ç¨1 515 million  up 17.8% compared to the comparable period in 2021  or up 10.2% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.0pp year-over-year to 20.5%.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 benefitted from the Change in Society Accounting (‚Ç¨27 million) and the Legal Settlement (‚Ç¨52 million). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended Q3 2021 benefitted from the DSP Catch-Up Payment (‚Ç¨26 million)  as well as from a previously disclosed recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release""  ‚Ç¨20 million) in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA grew 15.8% year-over-year  or 8.0% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%  compared to 20.9% for the nine months ended Q3 2021. The contraction in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards lower-margin Merchandising revenues in the first nine months of 2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedSeptember 30 %%Nine Months EndedSeptember 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

Subscription and streaming revenue grew 19.6% year-over-year  or 7.7% in constant currency  with subscription revenue up 20.1% year-over-year  or 8.7% in constant currency  driven by the continued healthy growth in music subscribers. Ad-supported streaming revenue grew 18.3% year-over-year  or 5.2% in constant currency  reflecting ongoing improvement in ad-based monetization  despite industry-wide ad-market pressure as a result of the uncertain macro-economic environment. Physical revenue declined 5.7% year-over-year  or 9.6% in constant currency  driven by the industry transition to digital consumption and a difficult comparison against strong physical sellers in the prior-year quarter. Downloads and other digital revenue were up 67.1% year-over-year  or 55.7% in constant currency due to the Legal Settlement. License and other revenue improved 40.4% year-over-year  or 30.2% in constant currency  driven by the strong recovery in live touring  where the Company participates in certain markets. Top sellers for the quarter included BTS  BLACKPINK  Ado  INI and Morgan Wallen  while top sellers in the prior-year quarter included Olivia Rodrigo  BTS  Billie Eilish  Drake and King & Prince.YTD 2022 ResultsIn the nine months through Q3 2022  Recorded Music revenues were ‚Ç¨5 703 million  up 17.6% year-over-year  or 10.1% in constant currency. Subscription revenue of ‚Ç¨2 856 million grew 17.6% year-over-year  or 9.5% in constant currency. Subscription revenue in the first nine months of 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance measures or indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the income from Operating Profit:Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity  including but not limited to professional fees and listing fees related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity.CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-music-group-nv-reports-financial-results-for-the-third-quarter-and-nine-months-ended-september-30-2022-301661116.htmlSOURCE Universal Music Group N.V.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.25,0.28,0.47,True,English,"['Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Financial Results', 'Third Quarter', 'Nine Months', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'financial reporting quarters', 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'alternative performance indicators', 'copyright infringement lawsuit', 'internet service provider', 'best available estimate', 'Summary Q3 Results1', 'Summary YTD Results', '‚Ç¨21 million negative impact', 'relevant collection society', 'current year rates', 'greater absolute EBITDA', 'current year results', 'Music Publishing revenue', 'prior year results', 'financial results', 'Constant currency change', 'Q3 2022 Results', 'Society Accounting', 'greater value', '‚Ç¨71 million benefit', 'accounting policy', 'prior years', 'Recorded Music', 'Music revenue', 'UMG Results', 'Top sellers', 'Morgan Wallen', 'nine months', 'creative opportunities', 'recording artists', 'global reach', 'unique understanding', 'music-related content', 'recurring income', 'Boyd Muir', 'long-term value', 'broad diversity', 'press release', 'Three Months', 'end customer', 'share-based compensation', 'strong growth', 'Other revenue', 'high-quality revenue', 'revenue streams', 'Legal Settlement', 'revenue growth', 'third quarter', '12.6 % EBITDA margin', 'growing range', 'IFRS measures', 'Other segments', '15.6 % EBITDA', 'Merchandising', 'BTS', 'BLACKPINK', 'Ado', 'INI', 'HILVERSUM', 'Netherlands', 'PRNewswire', 'Company', 'PRNewsfoto', 'diverse', 'business', 'songwriters', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'innovation', 'evolution', 'market', 'monetization', 'sources', 'EVP', 'CFO', 'President', 'Operations', 'vision', 'success', 'revenues', 'shareholders', 'Story', 'EU', 'descriptions', 'reconciliations', 'Appendix', 'YoY', '4pp', 'Note', 'increase', 'relation', 'societies', 'usage', 'collectability', 'Recognition', 'accrual', 'amount', 'consideration', 'timing', 'expenses', '23.7', '23.6']",2022-10-27,2022-10-28,finance.yahoo.com

The combination will create a leading Dutch insurance company. This step enables Aegon to accelerate its strategy and represents a major step in its ambition to become a leader in its chosen markets. Aegon will receive EUR 2.5 billion in gross cash proceeds  and a 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r.  with associated governance rights. Aegon‚Äôs Dutch asset management activities will remain part of Aegon‚Äôs global asset manager. Aegon will enter into a long-term asset management agreement with a.s.r. to manage parts of the combination‚Äôs general account investments  the investments of the Premium Pension Institution (PPI) offering of Aegon Cappital  and a.s.r.‚Äôs mortgage funds.‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement marks a major milestone in the history of our company and in our long-term ambition to create leaders in our chosen markets‚Äù  said Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon. ‚ÄúBoth Aegon and a.s.r. are deeply rooted in Dutch society and share a long and rich history. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees  Aegon the Netherlands has been able to improve its performance in recent years. We‚Äôre now building on that success by creating a Dutch insurance leader. I‚Äôm convinced that the combination of our companies is in the best long-term interest of all stakeholders and Dutch society at large. Customers of both companies will benefit from a more diversified product offering and strong distribution.Story continues‚ÄúThis transaction provides a unique opportunity to accelerate both the return of capital to shareholders and our strategy of investing in markets where we are well positioned for growth. Our priority continues to be to further improve our operational performance and grow profitably. The increased focus and resources resulting from this transaction  will place us in a better position for the future growth of the company.‚ÄùJos Baeten  CEO of a.s.r. said: ‚ÄúI am pleased to announce today that a.s.r. and Aegon the Netherlands  two renowned Dutch companies  deeply rooted in Dutch society  will create a leader in Dutch insurance. Together we will form a sustainable  leading insurer and strengthen our market position as the number two insurer in the market. Given the joined strength of both companies  the company will provide a good home for all Aegon the Netherlands employees  customers  and relations. As employees of a.s.r.  we will work with the new colleagues on the future of this combination. The starting point will be  one company  one culture  by leveraging the best of both organizations. We look forward to welcoming all employees  customers  and relations of Aegon the Netherlands in the near future.‚Äù1 Value of 29.99% stake is EUR 2.4 billion based on the closing price of a.s.r.‚Äôs shares on October 26  2022 and 57 million shares to be received by Aegon upon closing of the transaction before any potential equity offering by a.s.r. as part of the funding of the transaction.Compelling strategic rationaleCombining the two companies will result in a strong well-diversified Dutch insurance company that will be able to deliver a broad range of attractive products and services and generate attractive shareholder returns.The combined group will:have a leading position in the Dutch pension market. This will lead to more attractive value propositions to customers as the company is well placed to capture opportunities from the upcoming pension reform;become the market leader in disability insurance and the number three player in property and casualty insurance  facilitating a more competitive product offering;have enhanced scale in the origination and servicing of Dutch mortgages  creating the opportunity for more streamlined and improved operations;have stronger distribution activities by combining Aegon‚Äôs and a.s.r.‚Äôs expertise  resources  and platforms in this area; anddeliver significant synergies through the integration of the closed individual life portfolios of the two companies into one platform.The combination will be well positioned to further extend its role in the Dutch insurance market in the field of sustainability and ESG and contribute to finding solutions to the main challenges society faces that have a clear relationship with the core activities of the new combination.Combining the two companies is expected to lead to substantial cost synergies and diversification benefits. Aegon will benefit from a.s.r.‚Äôs improved operating capital generation and capital synergies through its 29.99% stake in the company. Aegon will bring to a.s.r. significant risk management capabilities and accelerate the implementation of a Partial Internal Model for the calculation of the Solvency II required capital of the combination.Leveraging Aegon Asset Management‚Äôs capabilitiesAegon has agreed an exclusive long-term partnership with a.s.r. to manage the illiquid investments that are part of the general account of the combined businesses. In addition  it will continue to be the asset manager for the investments of Aegon Cappital‚Äôs PPI proposition and will take over the management of a.s.r.‚Äôs mortgage funds. Through these steps  Aegon Asset Management will further strengthen its position as a provider in the Dutch market of fiduciary services  retirement multi-assets & solutions  fixed income  including alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing.Governance of combinationAegon N.V. will be a 29.99% strategic  supportive shareholder in a.s.r.  allowing Aegon to participate in the financial benefits that the combination will bring. Furthermore  Aegon will have the right to nominate two candidates for the a.s.r. Supervisory Board. Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon N.V will be nominated as a non-independent member  and Danielle Jansen Heijtmajer  Chair of the Supervisory Board of Aegon the Netherlands  will be nominated as an independent member of the Supervisory Board of a.s.r.. The non-independent member has an affirmative vote within a.s.r.‚Äôs Supervisory Board on certain topics  in line with the size of Aegon‚Äôs shareholding.Integration and organization of companiesThe activities of a.s.r. and Aegon the Netherlands will be integrated after closing of the transaction to maximize the potential of the two businesses and fully benefit from their combined reach  scale  and resources. The integration is expected to impact employees in both companies. The integration will be largely completed within three years  and the intention is to minimize the number of redundancies through natural attrition and by helping people to the greatest extent possible to find jobs either inside or outside of the combination. The process will be executed in a fair  diligent  and open way  respecting the talents and strengths of people in both organizations. Employees of the combination will benefit from the sharing of best practices and greater long-term career opportunities within a larger  more diversified Dutch company.The a.s.r. brand will be the leading brand of the combination. The Aegon brand will remain in use in the pension and mortgage markets for three years after closing of the transaction. There will be no change for the brands of Aegon‚Äôs other entities  including TKP  Knab  Robidus and Nedasco.Accelerating transformationThe transaction represents a major step in the transformation of Aegon  building on the successful execution of the strategy outlined at the Capital Markets Day of December 2020 to create leaders in chosen markets. The transaction forms a leader in the Dutch insurance market and enables Aegon to increase its focus on creating advantaged businesses in chosen markets outside the Netherlands.In the US  Aegon will build upon Transamerica‚Äôs leading positions in both individual life insurance solutions and the workplace pension business  investing capital to profitably grow its market share in selected product lines. Additionally  Transamerica will continue to take management actions designed to further improve the risk-return profile of the business. In the UK  Aegon‚Äôs ambition is to continue to profitably grow both the Retail and Workplace channels of its leading platform business by improving its customer propositions  service capabilities and digital experience for advisors  employers  and customers. The transaction allows Aegon Asset Management to strengthen its position in retirement-related investment solutions  alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing  and to build leadership in these areas. In its growth markets  Aegon will continue to look to invest capital in value-added growth opportunities. More details will be shared on the plans to profitably grow the strategic businesses in Aegon‚Äôs core markets  its growth markets  and its global asset manager at a Capital Markets Day in the second quarter of 2023.Use of proceeds and financial implicationsAegon anticipates that it will return EUR 1.5 billion of the cash proceeds to shareholders  barring unforeseen circumstances  to offset the dilutive effect of the transaction on free cash flow per share. Furthermore  the company intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million.A priority for Aegon moving forward is to drive sustainable  profitable growth for Transamerica and to execute upon additional in-force management actions designed to improve the risk-return profile of the business. It is anticipated that this will require funding and therefore Aegon expects to maintain its Cash Capital at the Holding above the middle of the operating range of EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion in the near term. Surplus Cash Capital at the Holding above the operating range will be subject to continued disciplined capital management  whereby capital that is not used for value-added growth opportunities will be returned to shareholders over time.Update on financial targets; increase in dividend per shareOn completion of the transaction  Aegon will replace its full ownership of the cash flow and profits of its Dutch businesses with its 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r.. In the near term  this is expected to translate into lower free cash flow  improving over time as synergies emerge from the combination. On completion of the capital return to shareholders and realization of the synergies  Aegon anticipates that its free cash flow on a per share basis will be higher than pre-transaction levels.The progress that Aegon has made on its transformation allows the company to increase its pay-out ratio and rebase the targeted dividend per share over 2023 from the current level of around 25 eurocents to around 30 eurocents.All other financial targets will be updated in due course.The transaction is expected to reduce IFRS shareholders‚Äô equity by EUR 3.3 billion based on the balance sheet position on June 30  2022. This includes the impact from the settlement of a tax position at closing of the transaction  which is not anticipated to have a material impact on Aegon‚Äôs Cash Capital at the Holding.Group supervision implicationsAegon will engage with its college of supervisors on the implications for group supervision upon closing of the intended transaction. Regardless of the outcome  Aegon intends to maintain its head office in the Netherlands. Its shares will remain listed on Euronext in Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange.Indicative timelinesThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including regulatory and antitrust approvals  shareholder approvals  and the completion of the works council consultation processes of both Aegon and a.s.r..Aegon will convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM) and request approval for the proposed combination between Aegon the Netherlands and a.s.r.. The EGM is expected to be held on January 18  2023. The Board of the Association Aegon has been informed of Aegon‚Äôs ambition to accelerate its strategy and the proposed combination with a.s.r.. The Board is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for its support.Based on the required steps  and necessary approvals  the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023.About AegonAegon is an integrated  diversified  international financial services group.

(Recall that during the first half of 2022  e-commerce product sales decreased by approximately 15%. Source: Fevad) Growth over the first nine months of 2022 is now up 14%  an acceleration of two points compared to the first half. Payment volume growth continues to be spread across our main market segments: France  iGaming and International.It‚Äôs worth noting that the development of the omni-channel offering is taking shape. In-store payment volume represents 9% of flows in France since the beginning of the year (vs. 3% in 2021). This has enabled HiPay to establish its position as an omni-channel payment specialist.An upturn in business once again results in double-digit quarterly revenue growthThird quarter 2022 revenue reached 14.3 million euros  an increase of 2 million euros and a 16% increase compared to the third quarter of 2021  despite the end of Direct Banking payment methods in the iGaming segment  whose volumes have shifted to other less profitable payment methods. Adjusted for this unfavourable mix effect  revenue growth reached an increase of 22% for the quarter  which is in line with performance over 2019-2021 (CAGR of 25% over the first 9 months of the year).Story continuesThe ratio of revenue to payment volumes  which reflects HiPay's ability to monetise its services  shows stabilisation. This ratio reached 0.82% in the third quarter of 2022 (vs 0.84% in 2021)  impacted by the iGaming payment mix effect for -1 bp (basis points) and by the growth in payment volumes at points of sale for -2 bp.Cumulated over the first 9 months of the year  the iGaming payment mix effect cost HiPay 2.7 million euros in revenue  i.e.  -7 growth points. The revenue ratio on payment volume thus reached 0.78% (vs. 0.84% in 2021). The erosion of -6 bps is explained by -5 bps from the iGaming payment method mix and -3 bps from the growth of payment volume at points of sale. Consequently  excluding these two mix effects  the monetisation of payment volume increased by 0.02 pts  which reflects the business strategy pursued over the course of several half-year periods.The negative mix effect on revenue caused by the end of the use of Direct Banking payments in the iGaming segment  having taken place in 2021  is expected to continue until the end of the fourth quarter of 2022  but no further.Robust momentum in HiPay‚Äôs business in France and abroad offers promising future prospectsHiPay‚Äôs European expansion continues through new agreements with the following retail players:In Italy   with the strengthening of its strategic partnership with IC Intracom  users of the HiPay MOTO solution  in addition to the launch of the Salutea parapharmaceutical siteIn Portugal   through the agreement with Mr Blue  which bolsters HiPay's status as e-commerce Fashion Retail payment expert in this marketIn Spain   through its work with Aladinia  the Spanish leader in gift experiences.In the United Kingdom  through the signing of Bludiode.com  an international electronic goods merchantAdditionally  the iGaming business continues to grow.

At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  the Group recorded growth of 14.0%  despite persistent supply chain issues in its various businesses  particularly in agricultural spraying and sugar beet harvesters.The change in consolidation scope arising from the Group‚Äôs two recent acquisitions (EXEL Yachting and G.F.) contributed ‚Ç¨5.2 million to fourth quarter sales.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 37.8%After peaking in spring 2022  accentuated by the conflict in Ukraine  agricultural commodity prices fell slightly during the summer and stabilized at levels still well above pre-COVID prices. Against this backdrop  demand remained strong in all regions  particularly North America  while the component shortage shows no sign of abating.The exceptionally well-stocked order book enabled the various Group companies to mitigate sales seasonality and carry out a significant amount of billing during the quarter.Story continuesSUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 18.9%After a third quarter particularly impacted by component shortages and a resurgence of COVID in Germany  business caught up strongly in the fourth quarter  resulting in record billings for sales of sugar beet harvesters.LEISURE: UP 21.7%The garden equipment market declined in the Group‚Äôs three main operating regions (the United Kingdom  France and Italy). In this context and after a series of challenging quarters (IT migration)  Q4 business came close to the previous year‚Äôs levels  bolstered by a more favorable basis of comparison than in previous quarters.The EXEL Yachting business posted a satisfactory quarterly performance with deliveries in line with forecasts.INDUSTRY: UP 5.1%At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  business was stable during the quarter: technical hoses and industrial spraying saw a slight slowdown in volumes in Europe  offset by ongoing robust momentum in Asia and  to a lower extent  the USA.Situation in Ukraine and RussiaThe new sanctions announced in early October do not affect Group products any more than the previous sanctions. As previously announced  EXEL Industries has maintained its operations in Russia (agricultural equipment and industrial spraying) but has taken care to ensure that deliveries are made in compliance with international regulations. The Group has been able to maintain overall sales volumes in the region.FY 2021‚Äì2022 salesFull-year 2021‚Äì2022 sales amounted to ‚Ç¨977.0 million  up 11.4%. Growth at constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates was 4.4%. EXEL Industries‚Äô concern was to adjust prices across all of its business lines  in response to rising raw material and component costs. This policy implemented throughout the year offset certain volume declines due to shortages (mainly agricultural equipment) or to the market slowdown (gardening). The currency effect was particularly favorable to the agricultural spraying and industry segments.The change in consolidation scope represented sales of ‚Ç¨29.8 million for the year.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 16.1%The agricultural spraying business was impacted by varying trends during the year: on the one hand  Group brands were hard hit by persisting component shortages despite very different production bases (Europe  the USA). Prices were increased throughout the period in order to pass on price increases implemented by supplier. On the other hand  order intake was boosted by the stabilization of agricultural commodity prices at globally high levels  giving the Group clear visibility over the coming fiscal year.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 8.0%After recovering in 2020‚Äì2021  sales remained strong during the fiscal year ended. In addition  component shortages allowed the Group to clear a large volume of used machine inventories. Lastly  prices were increased to offset increases in production costs (steel and other components).LEISURE: UP 4.9%The gardening business was impacted by three factors during the year. After two exceptional years in terms of volumes  markets returned to pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile  challenges related to the migration of IT systems curbed leisure business volumes by around ‚Ç¨10 million. Prices were increased during the year to offset significant increases in the cost of raw materials and logistics. Lastly  the acquisition of G.F. on February 15  2022  resulted in a scope effect increasing sales for this activity by approximately ‚Ç¨20 million.A new sales  marketing and industrial drive launched in the nautical business is expected to impact the coming years.INDUSTRY: UP 9.5%The underlying markets (mainly automotive  furniture and industry) experienced contrasting trends. However  the industrial spraying business continued to post high volumes throughout the year in line with the previous year.The technical hose division was impacted by declining volumes in the gardening business  while the B2B business was impacted by falling demand towards the end of the year.Yves Belegaud  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group  said:‚ÄúThe strong commitment of our teams in the fourth quarter and the successful integration of our latest acquisitions allowed us to post record sales. This excellent performance was achieved in a challenging and volatile environment in which shortages have not been recovered. However  the Group is confident in its ability to continue its development  underpinned by the various business sectors in which it operates and a well-stocked order book.‚ÄùUpcoming eventsDecember 20  2022  before market opening: 2021‚Äì2022 full-year results.January 25  2023  before market opening: Q1 2022‚Äì2023 sales.About EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.

In this announcement ‚ÄúShell‚Äù  ‚ÄúShell Group‚Äù and ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words ‚Äúwe‚Äù  ‚Äúus‚Äù and our‚Äù are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‚Äò‚ÄòSubsidiaries‚Äô‚Äô  ‚ÄúShell subsidiaries‚Äù and ‚ÄúShell companies‚Äù as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as ‚Äújoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù  respectively. ‚ÄúJoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù are collectively referred to as ‚Äújoint arrangements‚Äù. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as ‚Äúassociates‚Äù. The term ‚ÄúShell interest‚Äù is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 27  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

12230,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/geojunxion-gojxn-pleased-publish-2021-060000461.html,GeoJunxion (GOJXN.AS) is pleased to publish its 2021-22 Annual Accounts for the year ending 30 June 2022  showing significant improvements in all financial KPIs  including positive cash-flow.,Capelle aan den IJssel  The Netherlands ‚Äì 27 October 2022 ‚Äì GeoJunxion (GOJXN.AS) publishes its 2021-22 Annual Accounts for the 12-months accounting year...,GeoJunxion N.V.Capelle aan den IJssel  The Netherlands ‚Äì 27 October 2022 ‚Äì GeoJunxion (GOJXN.AS) publishes its 2021-22 Annual Accounts for the 12-months accounting year ending 30 June 2022  showing significant improvements in all financial KPIs  including positive cash-flow.We are pleased to present the GeoJunxion Annual Report for the accounting year 2021-22. It covers the 12-months period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. We remark that comparative financials for the past accounting year 2020-21 relate to the 18-months period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021.A full copy of the GeoJunxion Annual Report 2021/22 is attached to this press release and can be found on the company‚Äôs website www.geojunxion.com  under the Investor Relations and Financial News sections.The 2021-22 accounting year was  once again  an eventful period during which the company continued its transformation and turnaround. For the third year in a row  we realized a substantial top line growth  while slightly reducing operating expenses  on a like for like basis. We also achieved Cash-Flow positive  as well as significant improvements on all the other financial KPIs. This is even more remarkable  because it was achieved during a time still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing concerns about the global economy due to the ramifications of the war in Ukraine with high energy prices and increased inflation.A summary of the key financials is provided in the table below:Due to the change in the period of the accounting year 2020-21 (to 18 months)  it is more difficult to analyze and compare the financials of the accounting year 2021-22 with the previous accounting years. As already remarked  the current accounting year covers the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 (12 months)  while the previous accounting year 2020-21 covers the period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021 (18 months). Additionally  the accounting year 2019 was based on a 12-month period but from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. To enable easier comparison  we also include below the income statement for the current accounting year and the pro-forma income statement for the two previous years  covering the same 12-months period from 1 July to 30 June the following year. This enables a clearer view of the revenue growth and significant improvements in all financial KPIs  comparing the same period.Story continuesRevenue increased year-over-year by 40% to ‚Ç¨2.371.000 in 2021-22 compared to ‚Ç¨1.698.000 in the same period in 2020-21. It is very encouraging to highlight that this growth is not only due to non-recurring service revenue  but also the recurring service revenue increased substantially year-over-year (+72%) and recurring licenses remained essentially stable compared with the previous year.Costs for maps and data increased by 20 8% compared to the 12-months period of the prior year. These costs are related to content purchased to maintain and enrich the database and to hosting cost for delivering our data solutions via the cloud.Personnel expenses decreased in 2021-22  showing a 3% saving compared to the same period in 2020-21 despite a 40% higher revenue. The main drivers for this are a reduction in certain management roles in February 2022 and lower use of outsourced resources in the Netherlands and India during the second half of the accounting year.The depreciation cost on tangible fixed assets remained nearly flat year over year while amortization costs on intangible assets slightly increased. This increase is due to higher capitalized development costs and the amortization of these assets. Capitalized development costs are currently amortized over a period of 7 years  while before 2018  they were amortized over a longer period (15 to 20 years). Note that the book value of the database is subject to impairment testing. This means that the book value is compared to the value in use for the company. Per 30 June 2022  an impairment test was executed. This did not show a requirement for any additional impairment loss.Other operating expenses decreased more than 13% compared to the same period in 2020-21. This is the result of the implementation of a strict spending review  cost control measures  integration of tools and simplification of the group structure.Total Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 3% and Net Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 7% compared with the previous 12-months period. This confirms the general positive mood in which the company is operating today  capable of ‚Äúdelivering more with less‚Äù.Operating Result  despite still negative  shows an improvement of 63%  while the Net Loss was reduced by 46%  compared with the previous year.The net cash flow from operating activities in 2021-22 amounted to a positive cash inflow of ‚Ç¨131.000 compared to cash outflow of ‚Ç¨1.035.000 in the same period in 2020-21. This is primarily due to the significant improvement in the operating result and more favorable invoicing and collection terms negotiated with our customers and suppliers. During the accounting year 2021-22 there were no financing transactions  while  during the 2020-21 12-months period  a private placement was completed in December 2020  raising ‚Ç¨825.000 in equity funding.As an independent player  GeoJunxion focuses on creating ‚Äúmap agnostic‚Äù products  i.e.  designed to be fully integrated into any commercial and open-source brand of maps or utilized in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases in different industries and market sectors.GeoJunxion activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with its customers  through the creation of a recurring business model rather than one-off projects or transactions. Although the relationship may start with a proof-of-concept or a one-off project  most of our high value datasets require frequent and continuous updates to maintain or increase their value. As a result  the one-off project or proof-of-concept is often only a first step  followed by a recurring service or a license contract. As a result  converting the initial  one-off project into a recurring  predictable and sustainable revenue stream. In most cases  GeoJunxion also retains the IP and ownership of the newly developed datasets which can then be resold to other customers  thereby leveraging the initial investment and converting it into a virtuous business cycle.The GeoJunxion mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the environmental impact through intelligent solutions which enable more environmentally conscious decisions.GeoJunxion has valued diversity  integration and investment in social responsibility for years. We are committed to offering our daily contribution towards a better and more sustainable work environment. For this reason  the company has applied for PSO certification in 2020. PSO is the Dutch abbreviation for ‚ÄúPrestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen‚Äù  Performance ladder Social Entrepreneurship. In July 2022 we achieved Level 2 PSO certification  as one of the first publicly listed organizations in the Netherlands.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKLooking at the future  despite the general uncertainty pictured by the European Central Bank  GeoJunxion expects to see its top line to continue growing by 25 to 30% year over year. This expectation is built on orders booked in the first quarter of 2022-23 and a solid pipeline of opportunities. As a result of inflationary pressure and growing staff costs to deliver the projects  we expect our cost base to increase by 5 to 10%. GeoJunxion is reasonably confident to convert the above-mentioned guidance into positive EBITDA and EBIT close to break-even. On this basis  cash flow is  once again  expected to be positive for the accounting year 2022-23.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS / IMPORTANT NOTICEThis document contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial position and results of GeoJunxion.

Elsewhere in Europe  activities are growing quickly as the roll-out of fiber-optic networks gets underway in most of the countries where Solutions 30 operates.For the first nine months of 2022  Solutions 30‚Äôs consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨656.8 million  up +0.5% (-1.8% on an organic basis).Revenue by regionFrance: In the third quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of ‚Ç¨96.7 million  down 20.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021.With ‚Ç¨68.9 million in revenue  the telecom business is down 20.0% compared to the third quarter of 2021. This decline in business reflects the maturity of the market after the record levels of activity observed during the COVID crisis  which accelerated the deployment of ultra-fast broadband in France. The industry as a whole‚Äîcustomers as well as service providers and subcontractors‚Äîhas been forced to adapt and adjust to new ways of cooperating and to a temporary lack of visibility brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties. As a result  the operational conditions under which contracts are executed have significantly deteriorated in recent months and been aggravated by the current inflationary situation.Story continuesThis has implications for the entire industry and pricing renegotiations are underway. In this context  Solutions 30 is continuing its operational transition by building on its strong competitive advantages: a diversified customer and business portfolio  a healthy financial structure with little debt  and an agile organization.Revenue from the energy business amounted to ‚Ç¨11.5 million  compared with ‚Ç¨19.7 million a year earlier. This decline of 41.4% is due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France (activity down 79.6%). Even though revenue from the new energy transition and electric mobility verticals is still suffering from supply chain disruptions  it increased by 31%. However  this growth does not yet compensate for the decline in the company‚Äôs historic verticals.The IT business posted revenue of ‚Ç¨11.2 million  stable compared to last year‚Äôs third quarter  while the security and payments business is up 12.9%  generating ‚Ç¨5.1 million in revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨4.5 million a year earlier.Over the first nine months of the year  revenue is down 18.7% to ‚Ç¨318.6 million.Benelux: Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨53.6 million compared to ‚Ç¨39.3 million a year earlier  representing pure organic growth of 36.5% and reflecting the excellent dynamics of the Belgian and Dutch markets.The growth of the telecom business is accelerating due to the rapid ramp-up of the contracts signed with Fiberklaar  Open Dutch Fiber  and Unifiber. Revenue from fiber activities alone increased 4.5 times over the quarter  growing the telecom business by 40.1% and resulting in quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨40.3 million compared to ‚Ç¨28.8 million a year earlier.For the energy business  revenue was ‚Ç¨9.5 million compared to ‚Ç¨6.6 million a year earlier  a purely organic increase of 43.0%  thanks to the deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius.Quarterly revenue from the IT business remained stable at ‚Ç¨2.1 million while revenue from the retail and security businesses was ‚Ç¨1.7 million  compared to ‚Ç¨1.8 million for the third quarter of 2021.Over the first nine months of 2022  revenue grew by 33.2% to ‚Ç¨152.1 million  compared to ‚Ç¨114.2 million a year earlier.In all other countries  the group posted quaterly revenue of ‚Ç¨62.1 million  an increase of 21.0% (10.4% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue began to grow again and is up 7% to ‚Ç¨16.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨15.1 million a year earlier. As expected  the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization  as well as updated pricing conditions for certain major contracts  are starting to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 19% in the third quarter of 2022 to ‚Ç¨14.8 million  driven by the pursuit of TIM‚Äôs ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley  which began in the first quarter of 2021.On the Iberian peninsula  revenue grew by 8% to ‚Ç¨14.4 million  thanks to positive dynamics in the telecommunications sector (fiber and 5th generation mobile networks)  a strong uptick in installations of charging stations for electric vehicles  and pricing increases obtained from several customers.In Poland  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨7.9 million  up 35% (23% organic growth). Solutions 30 continues to gain market share in this country  while the integration of Sirtel into the portfolio of activities for 5G networks is progressing well. The organization put in place will ensure the company‚Äôs ability to support its customers‚Äô growth. The mobile networks business is growing rapidly and now accounts for nearly 10% of revenue.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted ‚Ç¨8.8 million in revenue during the quarter  up 92% (-11% on an organic basis). Solutions 30 has streamlined its operations to focus on higher-potential markets and the diversification of its services into fiber-optic networks  while the integration of Mono‚Äôs operations continues.In all these countries  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨186.1 million for the first nine months of 2022  an increase of 26.2% (15.8% on an organic basis) compared to the first nine months of 2021.OutlookIn response to current inflationary pressure  Solutions 30 is increasing its prices  both on new and existing contracts. The group has also taken measures to strictly control operating costs with the aim of preserving a solid financial structure with little debt. Such a structure will protect its ability to finance growth through acquisitions  increase its agility  strengthen its competitive advantages  and preserve its future capacity to pursue consolidation in its sector.In France  the market is in transition  which has led to limited short-term visibility. Against this backdrop  Solutions 30 will pursue its action plan to restore growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan involves (i) winning marketshare in the mature telecoms sector where a second phase of consolidation is expected to take place; (ii) developing new  high-growth activities  especially in the energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles; and (iii) seeking out synergies between the various businesses  accompanied by a reallocation of technicians to businesses with greater potential.In the Benelux and other countries  growth will remain strong through the end of the year  with the same momentum it saw in the third quarter.For the group as a whole  the fourth-quarter trend should be in line with the first nine months of the year and 2022 revenue should remain at the same levels as in 2021. The increase in the EBITDA margin at the end of the year is subject to ongoing price negotiations.From 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth  driven by the development momentum of its activities outside France. It should also see an overall improvement in its profitability. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q4 Revenue and 2022 Annual Revenue Reports | January 26  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

Q3 2022 underlying revenue growth was 8.2% and Q3 2022 adjusted EBITA margin was 26.4%. Cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨ 31.5m in the third quarter increased 41.0% compared to last year.

CSC and Intertrust jointly recommend to all Shareholders to tender their Shares before that time.Q3 2022 revenue was ‚Ç¨ 159.0 million (+13.4% y-o-y). Underlying revenue growth was 8.2%  driven by double-digit growth in US Fund Services and Luxembourg  a return to growth in Cayman Islands and continued solid momentum in Rest of the World.

In the first nine months  revenue totalled ‚Ç¨ 459.1 million (+8.3% y-o-y) with underlying revenue growth of 4.2%.Adjusted EBITA was ‚Ç¨ 42.0 million  resulting in a 26.4% adjusted EBITA margin in Q3 2022 and reflects increased investments in the workforce  including onboarding and training of new personnel. Additionally  adjusted EBITA included ‚Ç¨ 4.4 million one-off costs related to remediation activities. In the first nine months  adjusted EBITA amounted to ‚Ç¨ 115.2 million  resulting in a 25.1% margin.Shankar Iyer  CEO of Intertrust: ‚ÄúWe see strong top-line momentum with accelerated revenue growth in the third quarter. Our continued investments in compliance  remediation and in our workforce support the long-term growth of our business. Our initiatives to contain costs in the current inflationary environment are beginning to bear fruit  resulting in a margin improvement compared to the previous quarter. We‚Äôve entered the final stages of the transaction with CSC  marking a new era for the Company. We strongly believe the combination with CSC will deliver greater value for clients  colleagues and other stakeholders  driven by a truly long-term focus and enhanced efforts on compliance and remediation.

12237,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4549871-growth-is-around-the-corner-for-golar-lng,Golar LNG Stock: Growth Is Around The Corner (NASDAQ:GLNG),Golar has completed a massive transformation process and is well-positioned for growth. Here's what investors need to know.,"LeestatNote: Golar LNG (NASDAQ:GLNG) is a company focused on floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facilities. I suggest readers review an interview from March 2020 in which I offer a detailed analysis of the company  with an update in May 2021 and a new update in January 2022. I believe these articles will provide a good basis for the one that follows.There has been a lot happening since my last article at the beginning of the year. I suppose the most important event from an external point of view is the fact that Golar's stock price has performed extremely well in a rough market  rising 85% in contrast to the S&P's 20% drop  according to the Seeking Alpha tracker.As value investors know all too well  Mr. Market is a manic-depressive animal whose irrational mood sometimes offers the opportunity to buy very high-quality assets at very attractive prices. Investors have gone from hate to love in a short period of time  causing a huge swing in the stock price in a period when Golar has not added any new projects/assets to his portfolio. There is no doubt that the environment has improved after the Russian invasion  but I firmly believe that the biggest driver of such an amazing performance is that Golar has delivered  alleviating most of the concerns surrounding the company in recent years.I would say that Mr. Karl Fredrik Staubo was key to achieving such a significant improvement. The market was somewhat dubious when he was named CEO in May 2021  as both the experienced CEO and CFO had just resigned from the company without giving much detail  suggesting that Golar's business was deteriorating  and Karl seemed too young to take on such a large responsibility. Since then  however  Karl has proven at every conference that he is a shark who wakes up angry every morning looking to create shareholder value. There is no doubt that he has done an excellent job at the helm  despite the haphazard nature of the events that have unfolded.Under Karl's leadership  Golar has undertaken a massive transformation process to crystallize value  strengthen the balance sheet and simplify the corporate structure. This year alone  the company has spun off its LNG carrier fleet and raised $275 million  sold approximately one-third of its New Fortress shares (NFE) raising $250 million  sold Golar Tundra FSRU for $350 million and agreed to sell the steam turbine carrier Golar Arctic as a converted FSRU to Italy's Snam for $288 million.In addition  the company has increased utilization of Hilli FLNG to mid-2026 and has reached swap agreements for 75% of 2H 2022  all of 2023  and half of its 2024 TTF-linked exposure at a staggering price  locking in a total of $274M while maintaining upside Brent exposure. It is worth remembering that prior to that  Golar had already started the process of unlocking value by selling Hygo and GMLP to New Fortress for $5 billion EV.All of these smart decisions have helped the company regain investor confidence  and are the main reason why Golar has soared from $11 per share when Karl came on board as CEO to the current >$25/share. The market ignored the company because it thought Golar's business was too complex and the balance sheet was weak. However  these two nagging arguments have been softened. In fact  Golar has a strong balance sheet with a net cash position  and valuing the company has never been easier. The company has two assets  only one of which is generating profits (Hilli FLNG)  while the other is under construction and will be deployed by the end of 2023 (Gimi FLNG). In addition  Golar has public stakes in NFE  CoolCo  and Avenir LNG.Hilli FLNGHilli is the world's best-performing FLNG. It is the only proven design that has excelled with 100% uptime  which has given Golar a unique reputation among its competitors. The asset has three sources of revenue:The base tolling tariff (T1 & T2)  which has been generating around $66 million of EBITDA/year  occasionally increased due to overproduction. The Brent bonus tariff which contributes $2.7 million for every dollar of Brent crude oil price above $60 up to $102. The TTF gas tariff (T3) based on 0.2 Mpta  which has recently been extended until mid-2026. As I mentioned earlier  Golar has hedged most of the European gas exposure for the next few years  ensuring cash flow visibility at huge TTF gas prices - i.e.  levels where energy is equivalent to a Brent oil price of $300/bbl.Hilli's FLNG is a cash cow  as Golar's share of debt and interest service is $50 per year (based on current high LIBOR rates of 3%)  implying that this asset alone will generate over $570 million of free cash flow to equity through 2024  which is over 21% of market capitalization in 2.5 years (40% if we exclude cash and marketable securities). It should be noted that Hilli is a tax-free asset and has almost no capex needs.Although Hilli's cash flow generation profile might surprise you  there is room for improvement  as Hilli is not yet fully utilized. But how much is this asset worth? You might be aware that Exmar recently sold its FLNG Tango to Eni for $572-$694 million. The final price depends on the barge's performance in the first six months on site. Knowing that the FLNG Tango performed above expectations in its short period of operations with YPF in 2020 and that the asset has been well maintained in the lay-up period  I expect the final price to be close to the upper range  being the only FLNG deal and showing how valuable an FLNG is.The Tango floating liquefaction plant  built in 2017  has an LNG storage capacity of 16 100m¬≥ and a liquefaction capacity of up to 0.6 million tonnes per year  while Hilli Episeyo FLNG is 294m in length with a storage capacity of 125 000m3  and was designed to produce about 2.4 million tonnes per year of LNG. In addition  Hilli has much higher specifications as it can perform in a more complex environment.Therefore  knowing that Tango FLNG was sold for $660 million and has one-quarter of the liquefaction capacity of Hilli FLNG as well as much lower specifications  we should argue that Hilli is worth at least $2.6 bn. Being very conservative  I am valuing Hilli at a significant discount to the price we reach by comparing a fair and recent transaction. Using a 10% WACC  we reach a value of $1.27 billion or $11.8/share. You can see my estimates in the following image.Hilli FLNG DCF model (Own elaboration based on my estimates)Be aware that Hilli's current contract with Perenco ends in mid-2026  but the asset has a long life left. I have argued in the past that Hilli will not leave Cameroon  but Golar has begun to explore other options in case Perenco does not make significant commitments. According to Cypriot and Greek media  Energean CEO Mathios Rigas proposed connecting Energean's gas fields in offshore Israel to a Hilli floating liquefied natural gas unit that would be stationed off Vasilikos  Cyprus  by the end of 2026  just after the current contract expires.That said  I remain confident that Perenco will increase production and extend the contract in late 2023 or early 2024 because if Hilli exits Cameroon  it will be extremely difficult for Perenco to monetize the remaining reserves. Therefore  once it happens  our valuation of Hilli will increase accordingly.In addition  our utilization rate  and therefore the valuation of the asset  could prove to be very conservative. It should be noted that Gazprom Marketing & Trading is now Hilli's off-taker. After the war  this entity has been under federal trusteeship and recapitalized with a contribution of about $10 billion from the German government. Following that liquidity injection  it was then renamed SEFE Securing European Energy and will soon be nationalized  so the buyer of Hilli liquified gas is now Germany  which is desperately seeking to increase its LNG supply. I understand that SEFE is in talks with Perenco about the possibility of adding at least 0.2 million tons and likely more  depending on production capacity. Based on the conservative assumptions well below the forward curve I provided above  an addition of 0.2 MPTA  which will only increase utilization to 66%  will generate an extra $350M from 2023 to mid-2026.Gimi FLNGGimi's conversion has continued steadily according to plan. Golar's latest earning presentation shows that the asset is 86% complete. However  Keppel has not been immune to the current logistical and inflation issues and Golar had to contribute an extra $35 million (70% of $50 million) to secure the delivery date. The Gimi FLNG will set sail in H1 2023 and will begin its 20-year contract by the end of that year. Golar owns 70% of Gimi  which has a $4.3bn order backlog. This means that Gimi will start contributing $151 million of EBITDA each year starting by Q4 2023 for the next 20 years  so despite recent minor difficulties  Gimi's economics look terrific. Be aware that according to current specifics  Gimi should be able to produce 10% more  so EBITDA could end up being higher than what I am modeling.Gimi's valuation is easier than Hilli's as there are no moving parts such as TTF or Brent exposure. $151M EBITDA  16-year straight debt amortization curve  which might be conservative on a 25+ year life and a 20-year contract value at a 5% interest rate. I understand that the company will refinance and increase the leverage of the asset once it is online  but it is something I am not modeling yet. I used a WACC of 8%. The lower discount rate than Hilli's is because BP is an extraordinary counterparty  and our profit forecast is less uncertain  as revenues are fixed and hedged against inflation. Therefore  according to my model  the asset is worth about $1.5 billion  and after deducting Golar's share debt and remaining capex  we reach an equity value of just under $0.8 billion or $7.2/share.Golar Marketable Securities and Net DebtAfter repayments on Golar's credit facilities  corporate debt is only the $300M unsecured Norwegian bond  with Golar's cash position being in excess of $700M after the latest sales. Note that I am considering Golar Arctic's net proceeds. Remember that Golar will convert its trading steam turbine LNG carrier  Golar Arctic  to an FSRU and upon conversion  ownership of the asset will be transferred to Snam  which will pay ‚Ç¨269.0M  but the conversion has a cost of $160M and is expected to take up to two years. All in all  Golar has a net corporate cash position (excluding Golar's share of Hilli and Gimi debt) of $400M.In addition  Golar holds marketable securities that could be liquidated in a short period of time for $845M. These are comprised of 12.4M shares of NFE  which at the current price of $50.7 implies $629M (or $806M taking the $65 consensus TP)  and 12.5M shares of CoolCo company worth $169M  which is listed on the Euronext market. We expect a dual listing in the U.S. in the coming months  and Avenir LNG stake is worth $47M.As Golar's management has pointed out on numerous occasions during recent conferences  Golar is not a holding company; therefore  I expect Golar to divest all of those holdings to fund FLNG's growth and that is the reason why I am not applying any holding discount. Due to the illiquidity of the CoolCo stake and the incredible prospects for LNG shipping  I personally expect Golar to distribute those shares as a special dividend to its shareholders once the company is listed on the U.S. market.Lastly  Golar's corporate costs are 21M per year  so after applying a multiple of 8x  we deduct $168M from our valuation. However  I am aware that core costs may decrease significantly after the CoolCo spin-off.Golar Sum Of Parts Target Price (Own elaboration based on my estimates)We reach a target price of $29 based on current assets  which implies an attractive upside from current prices. I am comfortable with this valuation as I consider myself very conservative. Conservatism is shown by playing with what-if scenarios. In the scenario where Golar does not grow further  we should expect FCF of $325M in 2024 after debt service (interest and debt amortization). Most of the FCF is fixed  so my estimates are accurate enough. Golar has stated that they will start paying dividends as soon as Gimi is online and if they have no capex growth needs  based on the stability of their income stream  I believe they will pay all free cash flow as a dividend  like Tor Olav Troim is famous for  because his ability to allocate capital where it creates the most value. If we take the current market cap of $2.7Bn and exclude listed securities and net cash (likely also distributed under that scenario)  we reach a potential yearly dividend yield of >22% (12% to market cap). Given these figures  it is fair to say that my current valuation is conservative  even if we do not consider FLNG growth.FLNG GrowthThe upside based on current assets is attractive but would not by itself justify Golar as one of our top holdings. However  I would like to emphasize that the target price I showed you is not considering any growth and at this point  I think growth is more exciting than current assets. I firmly believe that Golar will be able to deliver three projects in the next 12-18 months  one of them starting this year.The environment for FLNG has never been more favorable. The lack of global supply became apparent after COVID-19  as demonstrated by high gas prices. Global supply was not able to catch up with strong demand  but the global gas market broke down following the Russian invasion. Unsurprisingly  Europe has cut ties with Russia and decided to move away from dependence on Russian gas. It should be known that the annual gas demand in Europe is about 500 bcm of which 400 bcm is imported and Russia used to supply (mostly by pipeline) 45% of it  up to 55/60% in the closest countries like Germany  while Norway supplies about 25% of European imports and LNG imports add another 25%. The remaining 5% is supplied by Algeria  Azerbaijan  Libya and Iran.Gazprom's gas exports to Europe (UBS research )As can be seen  Russia already serves only 14% of total imports  creating a huge imbalance between demand and supply that is unlikely to be fixed soon as there is not enough LNG infrastructure to replace Russia in the short term. Nor is the European regasification infrastructure large enough  nor is the global liquefaction capacity. Initially  I expected Russia to restart Nord Stream pipeline flows  as I felt they had cut off pipeline flows using gas as a weapon to gain leverage in a tough negotiation  but I do not foresee volumes coming back after the recent Nord Stream pipeline explosion.Russia's daily exports to Europe (CoolCo presentation)Note that daily Russian gas flows in H1 2022 were significantly lower than in 2019 but much higher than today. While I continue to expect Russian gas to flow to Europe via Ukraine at the current level  I see downside rather than upside risk.Therefore  I expect gas prices in Europe to remain extremely high  as suggested by the forward curve. In fact  I expect gas prices on average for 2023 to be higher than in 2022 due to a greater challenge to refill storage next year with the loss of Russian flows.You might see that the price of gas in Europe has plummeted due to the oversupply. That's fair enough  as natural gas prices are driven by daily supply and demand  as it is a commodity that trades in the present  unlike equities  which discount the future. Current demand is not strong as unseasonable weather depresses it  while storage is full because Europe has rushed to buy all available LNG so as not to run out of gas during the winter. However  winter is coming and Europe's consumption will be 2-4x higher than it is now  while pipeline supply will remain tight. Moreover  even though storage is full  European storage only covers two to three months of consumption.Months of gas storage per country (Oxford Economics)Therefore  the European pain is not over yet  and the gas price will increase significantly in the coming weeks  as the current forward curve suggests (around ‚Ç¨140MWh compared to the ‚Ç¨15MWh it used to trade or ‚Ç¨40/50MWh now). In addition  we should be grateful to China for remaining in a continuous lockdown. This is the first year in which LNG imports from China have not grown; on the contrary  we would be required to pay even higher prices to attract LNG cargoes to Europe.As can be concluded  the only way for Europe to normalize its energy situation is to build LNG infrastructure and secure capacity. Moving away from Russia means that Europe will have to seek up to 150 bcm or 110 million tons of LNG. Europe has already taken the first big step by ordering enough regasification terminals to process LNG  but it remains to be seen how they will be able to secure LNG capacity over the next few years. I don't think the U.S. will be able to supply such a large amount of LNG because it does not have sufficient LNG liquefaction capacity  but even if it could do so over the next decade  I would not expect Europe to make the same mistake a second time and rely on a single source.As reported in the news  Europe is actively targeting Africa. This continent has unique advantages  such as proximity and proven African gas fields associated with a low cost of supply. It is evident that Africa is set to occupy a key place among European gas suppliers.Africa's competitive advantages (Golar presentation)Also  as shown in the picture  Golar's liquefaction technology is one of the lowest cost and carbon footprint solutions in the world  including onshore liquefaction facilities in the United States. It is known that Golar can supply gas to Europe or Asia at $5 MMBtu  which means it can easily make huge profits in almost every scenario. Golar is aware of this huge opportunity and is looking not to be a single service provider but to make it an integrated project. In fact  it is rumored that Golar and New Fortress could partner and revive Fortuna FLNG.Golar's integrated project economics (Golar presentation)Fortuna FLNG is a project that Golar knows very well  as it was going to be FID in 2018 teaming up with Schlumberger (SLB) among others  but eventually  after a key manager left the company  Schlumberger rejected the project to focus on its core business and killed the project. As time has proven  Schlumberger made a big mistake  but I think the current economics are even better now than they were then.The Fortuna FLNG integrated project required $2 billion to obtain the first gas  of which $1.2 billion would be financed with debt and would be used entirely for the start of commercial operations. We should factor inflation into these figures  but I believe this is a project that Golar should be able to afford.As shown in the figure  the payback of the project under current conditions is about one year  which provides an astonishing IRR. Most importantly  however  it is environmentally friendly and has a low break-even cost. Europe will prioritize this ""green"" gas and even in a very challenging market  the Asian LNG market has never been consistently below $5 MMBtu  which means that even in the worst situation  this project will not burn cash. That said  I would like to stress that the world has changed after Europe realized the huge energy risk it was taking from Russia's concentration of gas suppliers and even if the war is resolved and we move on  the price of gas will be structurally higher  as it is known that the cost of LNG imports  which requires liquefaction  shipping and regasification  is much higher than that of Russian pipeline gas.The growth of Golar FLNG is a matter of time. In fact  the company has publicly stated that an FLNG project will be announced before the end of the year and I don't expect Golar to go back on its word. There are many candidates  Kosmos (KOS) reported at the last earnings conference that they want to move forward with the Greater Tortue expansion. In fact  they said they expect to reach an FID in the coming months and expect first gas by the end of 2026. Based on my conversations with them  I would guess that the fact that they haven't moved forward yet would be because they are considering increasing the size of the project from the estimated 2.5 Mpta to 3.5-5 Mpta.As seen  there are many FLNG candidates for Golar and I am not sure what deal Golar will take  but I expect three FLNG projects in the next 18 months  with one being in the next few weeks. Why am I so confident? Golar has the most efficient and proven solution that can be delivered quickly. It is also the most environmentally friendly solution  which is the first step in participating in a large gas project these days.At this point  one might ask  if the current global gas market imbalance has been so clear for a year now and has been intensified by the Russian invasion  why hasn't Golar announced an FLNG project yet?It is a fair question  but it shows the overall lack of knowledge of the sector among investors. The FID of an LNG project is very complex. It is a huge infrastructure project that requires the intervention of many players at the same time and tons of money. The FEED  EPC award  project financing  host government agreements  environmental firms  financing due diligence  offtake contracts - all have to go down and integrate with each other. Just one example: most of the financing will be done through ECAs  tied to a percentage of the procurement  which in turn is tied to the FEED and the EPC award. It quickly becomes clear how complex all this is. Moreover  it is a binary outcome. All parties could have been working for years and in the end  one of them leaves the table and all the work is lost.An offshore gas project is a big infrastructure headache; however  when FID is done and Golar's expertise is on the table  the returns are amazing  as we have seen on Hilli's FLNG.Golar's FLNG designs (Golar presentation)Golar is uniquely positioned for FLNG growth and has three different alternatives that cover all customer needs. The MKI and MK II designs are conversions that could be deployed in three years  while the largest new-build design (MK III) will require four years to be operational.Based on the current balance sheet  I expect Golar to be able to move forward with 3 FLNG growth projects in parallel in the next 18 months that could increase my target price by $25/share (depending on final capex and generation specifications)  reaching a total of over $50/share. Dividend capacity can be huge by the end of 2026 and could justify a higher valuation. Moreover  once time passes and Golar keeps delivering FLNG projects  the target price could eventually grow up to $100/share by 2030.ConclusionEarlier this year  I called Golar a strong buy and titled my analysis ""2022 Is Set to Be the True Inflection Point."" The company has delivered on plan and the market has rewarded them closing most of the gap between price and value. However  the current market price is ignoring Golar's ability to grow  which I understand as the company has not announced any FLNG projects since 2019.Golar is well positioned for growth and should be able to pursue three FLNG projects in parallel  which should raise the target price above $50/share. In addition  I remain very confident in my core holding due to the low downside  as Golar's cash flow generation is set to quadruple and should offer a huge dividend yield should growth fail to materialize.Golar has a fiduciary duty to Europe to advance FLNG growth by helping Europe regain control of the energy chaos. The environment has never been better and the company is in advanced talks with many credible players which prompted them to be confident enough to guide for an FLNG FID before the end of the year.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.47,0.08,0.44,True,English,"['Golar LNG Stock', 'Growth', 'The', 'Corner', 'NASDAQ', 'GLNG', 'floating liquefied natural gas', 'The TTF gas tariff', 'The Brent bonus tariff', 'current high LIBOR rates', 'cash flow generation profile', 'huge TTF gas prices', 'Brent crude oil price', 'Mr. Karl Fredrik Staubo', 'base tolling tariff', 'Brent oil price', 'European gas exposure', 'upside Brent exposure', 'Seeking Alpha tracker', 'steam turbine carrier', 'cash flow visibility', 'free cash flow', 'net cash position', 'two nagging arguments', 'LNG carrier fleet', 'massive transformation process', 'New Fortress shares', 'strong balance sheet', 'Golar Tundra FSRU', 'Hilli FLNG Hilli', 'attractive prices', 'huge swing', '2024 TTF-linked exposure', 'cash cow', 'stock price', 'Mr. Market', 'staggering price', 'two assets', 'Avenir LNG', 'new projects/assets', 'FLNG) facilities', 'detailed analysis', 'good basis', 'last article', 'important event', 'external point', 'S&P', 'manic-depressive animal', 'irrational mood', 'high-quality assets', 'Russian invasion', 'biggest driver', 'amazing performance', 'large responsibility', 'excellent job', 'haphazard nature', 'corporate structure', 'swap agreements', '$5 billion EV.', 'smart decisions', 'investor confidence', 'main reason', 'Gimi FLNG', 'public stakes', 'performing FLNG', 'unique reputation', 'three sources', 'interest service', 'marketable securities', 'capex needs', 'FLNG Tango', 'new update', 'rough market', 'market capitalization', 'Golar LNG', 'short period', 'significant improvement', 'experienced CEO', 'shareholder value', 'recent years', 'Golar Arctic', 'tax-free asset', 'value investors', 'current >$', '2.5 years', 'Leestat', 'Note', 'NASDAQ', 'GLNG', 'company', 'readers', 'interview', 'March', 'May', 'January', 'articles', 'one', 'lot', 'beginning', 'fact', 'contrast', '20% drop', 'opportunity', 'hate', 'love', 'time', 'portfolio', 'doubt', 'environment', 'concerns', 'CFO', 'business', 'conference', 'events', 'leadership', 'Italy', 'Snam', 'addition', 'utilization', '2H', 'half', 'total', 'Hygo', 'GMLP', 'board', 'profits', 'construction', 'end', 'CoolCo', 'world', 'design', 'competitors', 'revenue', 'EBITDA', 'overproduction', 'dollar', '0.2 Mpta', 'mid-20', 'next', 'levels', 'energy', 'debt', 'equity', 'room', 'Exmar']",2022-10-27,2022-10-28,seekingalpha.com

GTT  the technological expert in membrane c‚Ä¶,GTTNine-month 2022 revenues stand at ‚Ç¨222 million in line with expectations;strong order momentum continuesRecord orders : 134 LNG carriers during the first nine months2022 targets confirmedParis ‚Äì October 27  2022. GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its revenues for the first nine months of 2022.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: ‚ÄúWith 134 LNG carrier orders  our core business during the first nine months of 2022 has broken all previous sales records  highlighting the continuation of particularly strong momentum. The surge in demand for LNG  particularly in Europe  is fuelling further demand for LNG carriers  underpinned by investment in liquefaction plants and increased construction capacity at shipyards.In the LNG as fuel business  GTT booked 42 orders during the first nine months of 2022. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this activity over the medium and long term.GTT maintains a tireless focus on R&D to meet its customers‚Äô energy transition needs and the tightening requirements they face. Over the first nine months  we obtained numerous approvals from classification societies to develop new technologies in a wide range of fields  particularly in LNG as fuel  but also for the design of a hydrogen carrier and an innovative design for a three-tank LNG carrier.From a financial perspective  Q3 2022 revenues were up 4.1% versus Q3 2021. As expected  nine-month 2022 revenues were down compared to the same period in 2021 due to an unfavourable base effect  which is gradually disappearing thanks to the strong order momentum.In addition  the Group confirms its 2022 targets with results expected to reach the lower half of the initial target range  as announced in the first half results release.‚ÄùStory continuesBusiness activity during the first nine months- Continued momentum in LNG carrier ordersIn the first nine months of 2022  GTT booked 134 orders for LNG carriers  including 46 in the third quarter  in line with the excellent sales momentum achieved in the first half of the year. Delivery is scheduled between Q3 2024 and Q2 2027. In particular  58 orders for projects in Qatar were received during the first nine months.- Dynamic order intake of LNG-powered vesselsIn addition to the 38 orders for LNG-powered vessels received in the first half of 2022  four new orders were received in the third quarter of 2022  bringing the total to 42 orders for the first nine months. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this business over the medium and long term.- New licensing agreements with Chinese shipyardsIn the third quarter of 2022  GTT signed two new Technical Assistance and Licensing Agreements (TALA)  with the Yangzijiang Shipbuilding and China Merchants Heavy Industries shipyards for the construction of GTT membrane containment systems. This brings to five the number of construction sites now operating in China and contributes to increasing vessel construction capacity.- Smart Shipping: new contractIn July  GTT signed a contract with Antarctica21  the world‚Äôs leading operator of fly and cruise expeditions to Antarctica  to install ‚ÄúGTT Digital‚Äù smart shipping solutions in its cutting-edge expedition vessel Magellan Explorer.- ‚Ç¨86 million State support for Hydrogen IPCEI1 project confirms the relevance of Elogen positioningFollowing the selection by the European Commission of Elogen‚Äôs ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù project and the strengthening of its R&D division as part of the Hydrogen IPCEI  Elogen has been awarded a maximum of ‚Ç¨86 million in subsidies by the French government. An agreement regarding this subsidy will shortly be signed with Bpifrance. For the record  the Elogen gigafactory will start production in 2025 with a production capacity of over 1 GW.Furthermore  in July 2022  Elogen was selected by Symbio to supply an electrolyser with an initial capacity of 2.5 MW for Symbio‚Äôs new fuel cell plant. This new contract represents an important milestone for Elogen  as it highlights the company‚Äôs ability to deploy its technologies on multi-megawatt capacities for large industrial projects.Finally  as previously announced  in the first half of 2022 Elogen entered into several international partnerships for the manufacture and sale of electrolysers for producing green hydrogen:with HiFraser Group in Australia and New Zealand;with Valmax Technology Corporation in South Korea;with Charbone Hydrog√®ne in North America.Innovation: development of new technologies in a wide range of fieldsIn the first half of 2022  GTT received several approvals in principle from classification societies  including:Bureau Veritas for a new LNG conversion concept for large-capacity container ships;ClassNK for a new design of LNG fuel tank with 2 bar gauge pressure applicable to PCTC 2 vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships;DNV for an innovative LNG-powered PCTC vessel design;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for GTT‚Äôs future NEXT1 containment system;Bureau Veritas for Shear-Water  a ballast-free vessel concept for LNG bunkering and refuelling vessels.In the third quarter of 2022  GTT obtained five new approvals in principle from:DNV for a containment system enabling the transport of liquid hydrogen  as well as the concept for a hydrogen carrier vessel. Both approvals in principle were obtained in the framework of the cooperation agreement with Shell announced early 2022 and reflect the progress of this project;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for a new digital solution named ‚ÄúPOWER‚Äù designed to optimise transhipment operations between LNG carriers and floating units;Bureau Veritas for the design of a LNG-powered and ‚ÄúNH3-ready‚Äù Very Large Crude Carrier;Bureau Veritas and DNV for an innovative three-tank LNG carrier concept.Order book at September 30  2022On January 1  2022  GTT‚Äôs order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 161 units  and subsequently changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 21 LNG carriers  4 ethane carriers  1 FLNG;Orders received: 134 LNG carriers.At September 30  2022  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 269 units  breaking down as follows:250 LNG carriers;2 ethane carriers;2 FSUs;3 GBSs;12 onshore storage tanks.Regarding LNG as fuel  following the delivery of four vessels  and orders for 42 container ship tanks  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 70 units at September 30  2022.Evolution of consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022(in thousands of euros) 9M 2021 9M 2022 Change Revenues 240 025 222 037 -7.5% Newbuilds 224 281 200 385 -10.7% LNG carriers/VLEC 194 767 174 749 -10.3% FSUs3 9 660 13 578 +40.6% FSRUs4 8 054 - nm FLNGs5 2 202 1 218 -44.7% Onshore storage tanks 1 468 4 680 +218.8% GBSs6 2 521 3 303 +31.1% LNG-powered vessels 5 610 2 857 -49.1% Electrolysers 3 316 2 980 -10.1% Services 12 428 18 672 +50.2%Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022 were ‚Ç¨222.0 million  down 7.5% compared to the first nine months of 2021. The third quarter 2022 revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨77.8 million  up 4.1% compared to the third quarter 2021.Newbuild revenues totalled ‚Ç¨200.4 million  down 10.7% compared with the first nine months of 2021  when the cycle was still at its peak. Royalties amounted to ‚Ç¨174.7 million from LNG and ethane carriers  ‚Ç¨13.6 million from FSUs  ‚Ç¨1.2 million from FLNGs  ‚Ç¨4.7 million from onshore storage tanks and ‚Ç¨3.3 million from GBSs. LNG as fuel royalties (‚Ç¨2.9 million) were not yet impacted by the high order intake in 2021 and 2022.Nine-month revenues from the Elogen electrolyser business amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million  in a context of increasing commercial dynamic.Revenues from services rose sharply  up 50.2% to ‚Ç¨18.7 million  driven by growth in digital services and engineering studies mainly related to the conversion of LNG carriers into FSRUs.Update on exposure to RussiaWork on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is currently continuing  in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes.In Russia  the Group is involved in tank design for 15 ice-breaking LNG carriers currently being built at the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of 3 GBSs7 currently under construction at Saren B.V.8 At October 1  2022  revenues of ‚Ç¨74 million have yet to be recognised by 2025 for ice-breaking LNG carriers  including ‚Ç¨4 million in Q4 2022. Revenues of ‚Ç¨12 million have yet to be recognised for 2027 for GBSs  including ‚Ç¨1 million in Q4 2022.Given the impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and successful execution of these contracts are still exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation. In particular  sanctions are still affecting Russian imports of certain products and equipment used in current projects  including the Zvezda project. Furthermore  as previously announced  in July Saren B.V. notified GTT of its intention to terminate the contract between them. The termination date has not yet been finally set. In this context  GTT continues to investigate solutions to ensure the proper implementation and integrity of its technology  in strict compliance with international sanctions.As a reminder  other orders in progress in Asian shipyards for six ice-breaking LNG carriers and two FSUs9 are specifically intended for Russian Arctic projects. These projects are currently proceeding according to plan. At October 1  2022  these orders represented total revenues of ‚Ç¨31 million for GTT  to be recognized by 2024  including ‚Ç¨7 million in Q4 2022.Finally  eight conventional LNG carriers ordered by international shipowners  under construction in Asian shipyards  are intended for the Arctic LNG 2 project  but can operate in all types of conditions.2022 outlook confirmedIn its 2021 annual results press release dated February 17  2022  the Group issued the following targets for 2022  assuming no significant order deferrals or cancellations:consolidated revenues of between ‚Ç¨290 million and ‚Ç¨320 million consolidated EBITDA of between ‚Ç¨140 million and ‚Ç¨170 million a dividend amount for the 2022 financial year at least equivalent to the 2021 dividend.Given delays in shipbuilding schedules for certain vessels during the first nine months of 2022  the Group confirms its forecast that revenues and EBITDA will reach the lower half of the ranges announced in February.In the longer term  the Group should benefit from the current strong order momentum and expects to achieve significantly higher revenues and earnings from 2023 onwards versus 2022.***First nine months of 2022 activity update presentationPhilippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and Virginie Aubagnac  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT‚Äôs business during the first nine months of 2022 and answer questions from the financial community during a conference call to be held  in English  on Thursday  October 27  2022 at 6:15 p.m. Paris time.This conference will also be broadcast live on GTT‚Äôs website (www.gtt.fr/finance).To participate in the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: +33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004USA: +1 718 705 87 96Confirmation code: 130114The presentation document will be available on the website on October 27  2022 from 17:45 p.m.Financial agendaPayment of an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨1.55 per share for the 2022 financial year: December 15  20222022 full year results release: February 16  2023 (after close of trading)Shareholders‚Äô Meeting: June 7  2023About GTTGTT is a technological expert in containment systems with cryogenic membranes used to transport and store liquefied gases.

The situation in the United Kingdom served as a reminder that governments have little financial leeway and that fiscal and monetary policies need to be aligned. As expected  global growth forecasts have been downgraded.Bankruptcies are continuing to rise  especially in developed countries. Coface maintains its prudent reserving policy on Russia. This environment did not prevent Coface from achieving record net income of ‚Ç¨84m in the third quarter  with the YTD figure now totalling ‚Ç¨228m  higher than in fiscal year 2021. This corresponds to annualised return on tangible equity of 16.4%.Investments in adjacent businesses are continuing. Information services (+15.6%) and factoring (+13.0%) recorded continued growth in turnover. Coface is also continuing to focus on service quality  reflected in the record high retention rate and an improvement in the net promoter score (NPS) to 38%.We welcome Moody‚Äôs decision to assign our credit rating a positive outlook. This acknowledges the work done by all of Coface's teams over the past few years and our strengths at the beginning of a more complex stage in the economic cycle.""Story continuesKey figures at 30 September 2022The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the consolidated financial statements at 30 September 2022 (non-audited figures) at its meeting of 27 October 2022.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of ‚Ç¨1 363.1m over the first nine months of 2022  up +15.2% at constant FX and perimeter compared to 9M-21. On a reported basis (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover was up +17.7%.Revenues from insurance activities (including bonding and Single Risk) increased by +16.6% at constant FX and perimeter (and by +18.8% at current FX) compared to 9M-21. Growth benefited from an increase in client activity and continued high retention.The retention rate reached a record level of 93.5%  up +1.4% compared to 9M-21. New business totalled ‚Ç¨82m  down ‚Ç¨20m compared to 9M-21 in an increasingly competitive market.The growth in Coface‚Äôs client activity had a positive impact of +11.1% over 9M-22. This record increase for the first nine months reflects the scale of the recent economic recovery and inflation. The price effect continued to reverse  coming in at -3.0% in 9M-22  in line with the -3.0% fall in H1-22. This is largely due to previous very low loss experience.Revenues from other activities were up +7.9% compared to 9M-21  still with contrasting trends in the different businesses. Turnover from factoring rose +13.0%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Poland. Revenues from information services continued to grow  rising +15.6% (vs. +13.4% in 9M-21). Fee and commission income (collection fees) was impacted by the decline in claims to be recovered and dropped -37.9% while commissions were up by +6.7%.Total revenue - in ‚Ç¨m(by country of invoicing) 9M-21 9M-22 Variation %ex.

Trade credit insurance benefited from the increase in client activity and a high retention rate. Factoring turnover increased by +7.0%.In Western Europe  turnover was up by +14.8% at constant FX (+16.0% at current FX) thanks to a high retention rate and client activity.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover was up by +16.8% and by +17.6% at constant FX  due to high retention  and growth in trade credit insurance driven by client activity. Factoring turnover continued to increase significantly  rising by +36.9%.In Mediterranean and Africa  a region driven by Italy and Spain  turnover grew by +17.2% and by +15.4% at current FX. This was due to high levels of new business and high retention. Revenues from services increased by +27.7%.In North America  turnover increased +12.4% at constant FX and +26.0% as reported  driven by high client activity and positive FX effect  which were partially offset by premium refunds.In Latin America  turnover was up +29.8% at constant FX and +41.3% at current FX  driven by strong retention as well as growth in client activity driven by the rise in commodity prices.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +16.6% at constant FX and +25.7% at current FX. This growth was driven by high retention and increased client activity as well as a positive currency effect.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio  net of reinsurance  stood at 63.8% for 9M-22 (a rise of 7.7 points compared to 9M-21).(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 30.2%  up 5.0 ppts compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims close to pre-Covid levels and the return of relatively large claims  which nevertheless remain below average. Coface increased its provisions relating to the residual exposure in Russia.The Group‚Äôs reserving policy remains unchanged. Strict management of past claims enabled Coface to record 53.1 ppts of recoveries. The loss ratio for the 2022 underwriting year is still high at 80.9%  signalling that Coface anticipates an increase in the number of bankruptcies in the coming quarters  and an increase in reserves on Russia.The loss ratio net of reinsurance came out at 36.9%  up by 11.5 ppts compared to 9M-21.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is following its strict policy of cost management. In the third quarter 2022  costs rose by +16.0% at constant FX and perimeter  and +20.1% at current FX. This increase is in line with the growth in turnover  even though Coface continued to invest. The cost ratio before reinsurance was 32.2%  an improvement of 0.8 ppt over one year.The cost ratio  net of reinsurance was 26.9% for the first nine months  an improvement of 3.8 ppts year-on-year  reflecting lower gross cost ratio and higher reinsurance commissions.Financial resultNet financial income for 9M-22 was ‚Ç¨39.1m  up by ‚Ç¨8.2m compared to 9M-21. This figure includes ‚Ç¨10.7m in realised capital gains and positive hedging results as well as a currency effect of ‚Ç¨3.2m. This performance was achieved against a particularly turbulent market backdrop  primarily due to the effectiveness of hedging policies.The portfolio‚Äôs current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX impact) is ‚Ç¨29.5m (compared to ‚Ç¨25.2m in 9M-21). The accounting yield3  excluding capital gains and depreciation  stood at 1.0% in 9M-22  up compared to the previous year (0.9%)  mainly due to higher reinvestment rates.Operating income and net incomeOperating income for 9M-22 was ‚Ç¨329.8m  up +24.3%  mainly due to increased growth and a still low loss ratio.The effective tax rate was 26%  compared to 24% for 9M-21.In total  net income (group share) was ‚Ç¨228.4m  up +19.6% compared to 9M-21  of which ‚Ç¨84.0m in Q3-22.3. Shareholders‚Äô equity & solvencyAt 30 September 2022  Group shareholders‚Äô equity stood at ‚Ç¨1 955.2m  down ‚Ç¨185.8m  or -8.7% (compared to ‚Ç¨2 141.0m at 31 December 2021).This change is mainly due to the positive net income of ‚Ç¨228.4m  the payment of the dividend (-‚Ç¨224.8m) and the fall in unrealised capital gains (-‚Ç¨240.5m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 16.4% at 30 September 2022  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.4. OutlookThe risks threatening global growth were confirmed in the third quarter. The leading central banks continued to tighten monetary policy in a bid to curb inflation  which remains high. There was no improvement in the conflict in Ukraine and the energy crisis in Europe remains acute. European countries are taking substantial financial measures to limit the consequences of the crisis but there are considerable disparities in the extent of their intervention and the lack of coordination is undermining their effectiveness. The Chinese economy continues to be periodically affected by local lockdowns and is facing the consequences of the bursting of the property market bubble.As expected  growth forecasts for the global economy continue to be downgraded. Coface has lowered its financial outlook for 49 economic sectors  following significant downgrades to its country risk assessments in the second quarter.It is continuing to monitor the worsening economic environment. With its strong underwriting discipline and its reserving policy  which remains unchanged  Coface is well positioned to successfully navigate this more complex stage in the economic cycle. The raising of its credit rating outlook by Moody‚Äôs attests to the robustness of Coface's business model and its careful risk management.Coface is continuing to invest in expanding its service activities such as information services (growth of +15.6%) and factoring (+13.0%). Its record retention rate (93.5%) and the steady rise in its net promoter score (NPS) to 38% reflect client recognition of its constant focus on service quality.Conference call for financial analystsCoface‚Äôs results for 9M-2022 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Thursday 27 October at 18.00 (Paris time).

Conference call to be held today at 09:00 CEST (see details on page 7).Julie Walbaum  Chief Executive Officer  commented:‚ÄúOur third-quarter 2022 performance is in line with our expectations in a global environment that remains very challenging. The commercial initiatives we implemented since the end of May as well as our sustained efforts in inventory replenishment have been bearing fruit and should continue to support our activity through the end of the year. As a result  notwithstanding the high inflation and soft discretionary spending  we are still expecting sales improvement in Q4  benefiting from higher inventory levels  sustained promotional activity and a more favorable base effect online. The cost and cash savings action plan that we started in Q2 is also delivering its effects as planned.Story continuesConsequently  we keep our full year 2022 objectives unchanged.

In the face of this new reality  the Group implemented in May 2022 an action plan to contain cost and protect cash  targeting an extra ‚Ç¨5 million gross margin and ‚Ç¨20 million cost adjustments to reduce the impact of rising inflation. As of 30 September 2022  the execution of the plan is on track and MdM teams are fully focused on preparing and optimizing the 2023 equation.2022 capex  originally planned at around ‚Ç¨90 million  has been revised downward and now is expected to be in the ‚Ç¨70 million-‚Ç¨75 million range for the year. Regarding working capital requirement  the Group has made good progress in:adjusting its H2 2022 shipping plans to mitigate excess inventory risk while rebuilding inventories in select product families to support Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 salesand simultaneously negotiating with suppliers to reorganize manufacturing and purchasing planning  as well as to optimize payment terms.OutlookThe current economic environment remains challenging with still rising inflation across Europe and short-term consumption trends impacted by the current energy crisis.However  Q4 2022 sales are expected to improve over Q3 2022  thanks to improved furniture inventory levels  sustained promotional activity and a favorable base effect.Thanks to all actions engaged since end of Q2 2022 on sales  costs and cash  Maisons du Monde leaves its full-year 2022 objectives unchanged:Top line decrease in the mid-single digit rangeAn EBIT margin of 5% or aboveFCF of ‚Ç¨10 million to 30 millionReduction of the Group‚Äôs carbon intensity: CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2Dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40%Update on share buyback programOn 29 July 2022  the Group launched a second share repurchase program with an objective to repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares at market price over a period of several months. At 30 September 2022  the Group had purchased 1 151 846 of its own shares  i.e. 25% of the program  at an average price per share of ‚Ç¨9.74.

Operating EBITA margin increased to 10.3% (last year: 9.5%)  driven by improved performance across the GBAs.Peter Oosterveer  CEO Arcadis  comments:‚ÄúDuring the last quarter  we have continued to see growing client demand across our three Global Business Areas. Our Resilience business continues to benefit from increased client demand for sustainability advisory  energy transition and climate adaptation solutions. In our Places business we have enjoyed large wins in North America and Germany  and increased demand from manufacturing and governmental clients. For our Mobility business  significant rail wins in the Netherlands and a growing demand for smart mobility solutions from highways and public transport clients created strong results.We have also made significant progress in optimizing our portfolio and focusing our efforts on geographies where we see the most attractive opportunities. This has resulted in the divestments of operations in Singapore  Malaysia  our Design and Engineering business in Hong Kong  Switzerland and our environmental restoration business in France. These follow the divestments made earlier on in the year; of our operations in Thailand  Czech Republic and Slovakia.Story continuesAs we look ahead to 2023  our focus is on fully embedding both IBI and DPS into our four Global Business Areas  and the shaping of our fourth GBA ‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù. Through these acquisitions  we not only significantly grow our presence in North America and Europe  but we will also be in the position to provide complementary client services and solutions in high growth markets  including life sciences  semiconductors  and industrial manufacturing.Although the evolving geo-political situation and inflationary headwinds remain firmly on our radar  our record backlog and continued focus on the optimization of our portfolio  combined with the exciting new growth opportunities IBI  DPS and Giftge Consulting offer  position us well to meet our strategic targets. I can only be very proud of all the teams across Arcadis that have kept the right focus on our clients in these busy and exciting times for our company.‚ÄùKEY FIGURESAs the acquisition of the IBI Group has been formally closed on 27th of September 2022  the Arcadis consolidated financial statements include IBI consolidated data for balance sheet items (those items having an impact on NWC% and DSO calculated for Arcadis as a whole). Arcadis backlog includes IBI backlog as well. As the three days of P&L of IBI Group between September 27th and September 30th have been considered as non-significant  P&L data and corresponding KPI‚Äôs (e.g. EBITDA  order intake  FCF) for the third quarter represent Arcadis standalone data.in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Gross revenues 1 003 828 21% 2 851 2 489 15% Net revenues 740 636 16% 2 158 1 912 13% Organic growth1) 10.9% 4.8% 8.2% 3.9% Operating EBITDA2) 101 83 21% 284 252 12% Operating EBITDA margin 13.6% 13.1% 13.2% 13.2% EBITA 27 57 -52% 158 171 -8% EBITA margin 3.7% 9.0% 7.3% 9.0% Operating EBITA2) 76 60 26% 208 177 18% Operating EBITA margin 10.3% 9.5% 9.7% 9.2% Free Cash Flow3) 38 75 -50% 27 105 -74% Net Working Capital %4) 13.8% 14.0% Days Sales Outstanding4) 72 74 Net Debt4) 880 298 195% Backlog net revenues4) 2 813 2 126 32% Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 5.0%1) Underlying growth excluding the impact of currency movements  acquisitions or footprint reductions  such as the Middle East  winddowns or divestments2) This excludes the net result on divestment of consolidated companies  and acquisitions  restructuring  and integration-related costs. The Operating EBITDA is used when calculating the strategic target: average net debt / (Operating) EBITDA  guided for 1.5-2.5x3) Free Cash flow: Cash Flow from Operations corrected for Capex and Lease liabilities4) Including IBI Group  transaction closing per 27th of September 2022INCOME STATEMENTNet revenues totaled ‚Ç¨740 million and increased organically by 10.9%. Growth was driven by all three GBAs  with Resilience and Mobility being exceptionally strong in North America and the UK. The currency impact was 9%. The operating EBITA margin improved to 10.3% (Q3‚Äò21: 9.5%)  driven by all three GBAs  and a significant year-on-year improvement driven by Places from improved operational efficiencies  despite lower working days in the UK and Australia due to Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs funeral.Non-operating costs were ‚Ç¨49 million and include transaction costs related to the three recently announced acquisitions  and a net loss on divestments of operations in Singapore  Malaysia  Hong Kong (Design & Engineering business)  Switzerland and France (Environmental Restoration business). These net losses had no impact on Free Cash Flow.ORDER INTAKE &BACKLOGAt the end of September 2022 backlog reached a record high level of ‚Ç¨2 813 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨2 126 million)  of which ‚Ç¨530 million was added through the acquisition of the IBI Group. Strong order intake  with almost no cancellations in the quarter resulted in a solid organic backlog growth of 5.0% year-over-year  with a positive contribution of all three GBAs.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues was 13.8% (Q3‚Äò21: 14.0%)  globally in line with last year performance. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased to 72 days (Q3‚Äò21: 74 days). Net debt increased to ‚Ç¨880 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨298 million)  including the ‚Ç¨600 million bridge loan for IBI acquisition and IBI net debt of ‚Ç¨54 million.Free cash flow generation during the quarter was ‚Ç¨38 million and below last year‚Äôs (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨75 million)  driven by sharp revenue growth elevating working capital levels  and some transaction costs relating to the recent acquisitions. Free cash flow generation year-to-date was ‚Ç¨27 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨105 million)  which was impacted by a normalization of working capital levels compared to 2021.STRATEGIC PROGRESSFocus & Scale is one of the three key pillars of our ‚ÄúMaximizing Impact‚Äù business strategy for 2021-2023. Arcadis has focused on driving operational efficiencies through the implementation of the GBA model  focus on key clients  and greater use of the Global Excellence Centers (GECs)  as well as investing in high growth markets  for instance through the acquisitions of IBI  DPS and Giftge Consult.At the same time  ‚ÄúFocus & Scale‚Äù triggered a portfolio assessment  reviewing operations on their scalability  growth potential  financial performance  and scope of services. This has resulted in the following divestment of non-core operations  from a geographic or business point of view: Singapore  Malaysia  Hong Kong (Design & Engineering business)  Switzerland and France (Environmental Restoration business)  representing ~900 people and ‚Ç¨47 million of annual net revenues. This was in addition to the divestments of Czech Republic  Slovakia and Thailand that occurred in the first half of 2022  representing ~190 people and ‚Ç¨11 million of annual net revenues.The recent acquisitions of IBI  DPS and Giftge  together with the divestments  have rebalanced the geographic and business portfolio  and repositioned Arcadis towards high growth and resilient markets such as placemaking and urban planning in North America  and industrial manufacturing engineering in the US and Europe. The creation of the fourth GBA ‚ÄúIntelligence""  will enhance Arcadis‚Äô position as a digital leader  and ability to serve its clients in a more efficient way across all phases of the asset lifecycle. The backlog for Intelligence at the end of the third quarter was ‚Ç¨112 million  representing 4% of the total Arcadis backlog.PERFORMANCE BY GLOBAL BUSINESS AREARESILIENCE(43% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 320 259 24% 909 771 18% Organic growth1) 13.7% 9.7% Backlog net revenues 943 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 5.4%Resilience showed continued solid revenue and backlog growth for the third quarter  driven by continued strong client demand in energy transition  climate adaptation and mitigation  including a new commission as lead designer of a flood defense for Battery Park  New York City  complementing resiliency work for southeast and lower Manhattan. Revenue growth was supported by the successful onboarding of new hires  especially in the US.The Resilience business closed the quarter at a backlog of ‚Ç¨943 million  representing 34% of total Arcadis backlog.PLACES(32% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 234 209 12% 697 656 6% Organic growth1) 3.6% 2.8% Backlog net revenues 1 216 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 2.1%Revenue and backlog growth in the third quarter were driven by a strong Continental Europe and US  with good demand for sustainable and intelligent buildings  including the development of datacenters and automotive giga-factories for electric vehicle battery production. Revenue and backlog growth was somewhat hampered by weakening market circumstances in China.The absolute backlog of Places increased by 29% year-on-year to ‚Ç¨1 216 million. The position includes the backlog of IBI Group  which was marked by strong order intake in the third quarter and excludes the divested countries in Southeast Asia. These strategic decisions led to a significant repositioning of the Places backlog  now representing 43% of total Arcadis backlog  with an increased focus on North America and Europe.MOBILITY(25% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 186 168 11% 552 485 14% Organic growth1) 15.4% 12.5% Backlog net revenues 542 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 9.0%Stellar revenue growth for Mobility in the third quarter was driven by the UK  Australia and the US. A strong backlog development came from large highway and rail wins; such as for ProRail in the Netherlands  and a growing demand for smart mobility solutions from highways and public transport clients. At the end of Q3  mobility backlog amounted to ‚Ç¨542 million  representing 19% of total Arcadis backlog.IBI‚Äôs experience in developing digital tools including Travel-IQ will further help to pursue new opportunities and strengthen our Mobility business both in North America and across the world.Financial calendar:16 February 2023 ‚Äì Q4 & FY 2022 Results4 May 2023 ‚Äì Q1 2023 Trading Update27 July 2023 ‚Äì Q2 & HY 2023 Results26 October 2023 ‚Äì Q3 2023 Trading UpdateFor further information please contact:Arcadis Investor RelationsChristine DischMobile: +31 (0)6 1537 6020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comArcadis Corporate CommunicationsTanno MassarMobile: +31 (0)6 1158 9121E-mail: tanno.massar@arcadis.comAnalyst meetingArcadis will hold an analyst webcast to discuss the Q3results for 2022.

The product net sales in the nine months ended September 30  2022 were $227.3 million. No product net sales were recognized during the same period in 2021.Collaboration revenue for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $6.7 million and $9.3 million  respectively  compared to $0.1 million and $471.3 million for the same periods in 2021. The collaboration revenue during the three months ended September 30  2022 primarily relates to milestone revenue of the ‚Ç¨5 million triggered by the option exercised by LEO Pharma to enter into a commercial license for ARGX-112. The collaboration revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30  2021 was primarily attributable to the recognition of the transaction price as a consequence of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Janssen  resulting in the recognition of $315.1 million and the closing of the strategic collaboration for efgartigimod with Zai Lab  resulting in the recognition of $151.9 million in collaboration revenue.Other operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $8.5 million  and $26.6 million  respectively  compared to $6.2 million and $34.5 million for the same periods in 2021. During the nine months ended September 30  2022  and September 30  2021  the fair value of the argenx profit share in AgomAb Therapeutics NV increased by $4.3 million and $11.2 million respectively. The increase is a result of the extension of a Series B financing round by AgomAb for which argenx maintains a profit share in exchange for granting the license for the use of HGF-mimetic antibodies from the SIMPLE Antibody‚Ñ¢ platform.Total operating expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $355.1 million and $869.1 million  respectively  compared to $220.1 million and $623.6 million for the same periods in 2021  and consists of:Cost of sales for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $10.3 million and $16.6 million  respectively. The cost of sales were recognized with respect to the sale of VYVGART during 2022. There were no cost of sales recognized in the comparable prior year periods.Research and development expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $236.7 million and $515.6 million  respectively  compared to $139.4 million and $413.3 million for the same periods in 2021. The research and development expenses mainly relate to external research and development expenses and personnel expenses incurred in the clinical development of efgartigimod in various indications and the expansion of other clinical and preclinical pipeline candidates. The increase in research and development expense during the third quarter 2022 is mainly driven by the recognition of the priority review voucher submitted with the BLA filing for SC efgartigimod for the treatment of gMG  which resulted in an expense of $99.1 million.Selling  general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $108.2 million and $336.8 million  respectively  compared to $80.6 million and $210.2 million for the same periods in 2021. The selling  general and administrative expenses mainly relate to professional and marketing fees linked to the commercialization of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and the EU and personnel expenses.Exchange losses for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $39.6 million and $93.0 million  respectively  compared to $17.6 million and $36.0 million for the same periods in 2021. Exchange losses are mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate losses on cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets position in Euro.Income tax for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $6.0 million and $17.1 of tax income  respectively  compared to $2.7 million and $15.6 million of tax expense for the same periods in 2021. Tax income for the three months ended September 30  2022 consists of $7.3 million of income tax expense and $13.3 million of deferred tax income  compared to $4.3 million of income tax expense and $1.6 million of deferred tax income for the same period in 2021.Net loss for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $235.0 million and $671.0 million  respectively  compared to net loss of $233.6 million and $170.4 million for the same periods in 2021.Cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets totaled $2 385.5 million as of September 30  2022  compared to $2 336.7 million as of December 31  2021. Cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets increased primarily as a result of the closing of a global offering of shares  which resulted in the receipt of $761.0 million in net proceeds in March 2022  offset by net cash flows used in operating activities.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEBased on current plans to fund anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures  argenx continues to expect its 2022 cash burn to be up to $1 billion. This will support the global VYVGART launches  clinical development of efgartigimod in 10 indications and ARGX-117 in two indications  investment in the global supply chain  and continued focus on pipeline expansion through the Immunology Innovation Program.EXPECTED 2023 FINANCIAL CALENDARMarch 2  2023: FY 2022 financial results and business updateMay 4  2023: Q1 2023 financial results and business updateJuly 27  2023: HY 2023 financial results and business updateOctober 27  2023: Q3 2023 financial results and business updateCONFERENCE CALL DETAILSThe third quarter 2022 financial results and business update will be discussed during a conference call and webcast presentation today at 2:30 pm CEST/8:30 am ET.

Today‚Äôs announcement demonstrates the Stellantis commitment to investing in France in the latest technologies  and to supporting low-carbon mobility based on the ‚ÄúOne Company‚Äù principle ‚Äù Tavares stated. ‚ÄúStellantis has succeeded in moving on to the next step in automotive history  in a transition managed in conjunction with our social partners at our 12 industrial sites across seven French regions  where we are proud to have laid historical roots.‚ÄùThese hydrogen-powered vehicles will be assembled on the site‚Äôs multi-energy line  which already produces the electric and combustion engine versions of the ‚ÄúK-Zero‚Äù daily. Using a reinforced platform from body-in-white onwards  the hydrogen-powered models will then follow the usual stages of paintwork and assembly  on the same production line as combustion engine and electric vehicles  before they enter the new 8 000-m¬≤ facility that focuses solely on the final tuning.A dedicated team will install the tank  the additional batteries  and the fuel cell on a production line at the Hordain site that halves the adjustment time compared to the previous small-scale process  where the fuel cell was assembled at a pilot workshop in R√ºsselsheim.This industrialization of hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles ‚Äì accompanied by ‚Ç¨10 million in investments with financial support from the French government ‚Äì is a new step for Hordain  where 43% of models for the Peugeot  Citro√´n  Opel  Vauxhall  Fiat and Toyota brands are already available in a zero-emission electric version.The ‚ÄúK-zero‚Äù vehicles with a fuel cell are intended for long-distance freight professionals who require a longer range (400 km)  the fastest possible charging time (3 minutes) and no compromises on charging capacity (1000 kg of payload).Launched in 2021  Stellantis is the first manufacturer in the world to market this type of vehicle.Inaugurated in 1994  the Hordain site lies at the heart of the industrial strategy at the Stellantis commercial vehicles division. This benchmark site assembles light commercial vehicles and passenger cars from the ‚ÄúK-Zero‚Äù family. Hordain employs 2 440 people on three shifts  with daily production of 628 vehicles. The site assembled 144 650 vehicles in 2021 and produced its millionth ‚ÄúK-Zero‚Äù in summer 2022.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its revenues for the first nine months of 2022.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: ‚ÄúWith 134 LNG carrier orders  our core business during the first nine months of 2022 has broken all previous sales records  highlighting the continuation of particularly strong momentum. The surge in demand for LNG  particularly in Europe  is fuelling further demand for LNG carriers  underpinned by investment in liquefaction plants and increased construction capacity at shipyards.In the LNG as fuel business  GTT booked 42 orders during the first nine months of 2022. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this activity over the medium and long term.GTT maintains a tireless focus on R&D to meet its customers‚Äô energy transition needs and the tightening requirements they face. Over the first nine months  we obtained numerous approvals from classification societies to develop new technologies in a wide range of fields  particularly in LNG as fuel  but also for the design of a hydrogen carrier and an innovative design for a three-tank LNG carrier.From a financial perspective  Q3 2022 revenues were up 4.1% versus Q3 2021. As expected  nine-month 2022 revenues were down compared to the same period in 2021 due to an unfavourable base effect  which is gradually disappearing thanks to the strong order momentum.In addition  the Group confirms its 2022 targets with results expected to reach the lower half of the initial target range  as announced in the first half results release.‚ÄùBusiness activity during the first nine months- Continued momentum in LNG carrier ordersIn the first nine months of 2022  GTT booked 134 orders for LNG carriers  including 46 in the third quarter  in line with the excellent sales momentum achieved in the first half of the year. Delivery is scheduled between Q3 2024 and Q2 2027. In particular  58 orders for projects in Qatar were received during the first nine months.- Dynamic order intake of LNG-powered vesselsIn addition to the 38 orders for LNG-powered vessels received in the first half of 2022  four new orders were received in the third quarter of 2022  bringing the total to 42 orders for the first nine months. While the high price of LNG in Europe could slow order intake in the short term  GTT is convinced of the relevance of its solutions and the potential of this business over the medium and long term.- New licensing agreements with Chinese shipyardsIn the third quarter of 2022  GTT signed two new Technical Assistance and Licensing Agreements (TALA)  with the Yangzijiang Shipbuilding and China Merchants Heavy Industries shipyards for the construction of GTT membrane containment systems. This brings to five the number of construction sites now operating in China and contributes to increasing vessel construction capacity.- Smart Shipping: new contractIn July  GTT signed a contract with Antarctica21  the world‚Äôs leading operator of fly and cruise expeditions to Antarctica  to install ‚ÄúGTT Digital‚Äù smart shipping solutions in its cutting-edge expedition vessel Magellan Explorer.- ‚Ç¨86 million State support for Hydrogen IPCEI1 project confirms the relevance of Elogen positioningFollowing the selection by the European Commission of Elogen‚Äôs ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù project and the strengthening of its R&D division as part of the Hydrogen IPCEI  Elogen has been awarded a maximum of ‚Ç¨86 million in subsidies by the French government. An agreement regarding this subsidy will shortly be signed with Bpifrance. For the record  the Elogen gigafactory will start production in 2025 with a production capacity of over 1 GW.Furthermore  in July 2022  Elogen was selected by Symbio to supply an electrolyser with an initial capacity of 2.5 MW for Symbio‚Äôs new fuel cell plant. This new contract represents an important milestone for Elogen  as it highlights the company‚Äôs ability to deploy its technologies on multi-megawatt capacities for large industrial projects.Finally  as previously announced  in the first half of 2022 Elogen entered into several international partnerships for the manufacture and sale of electrolysers for producing green hydrogen:with HiFraser Group in Australia and New Zealand;with Valmax Technology Corporation in South Korea;with Charbone Hydrog√®ne in North America.Innovation: development of new technologies in a wide range of fieldsIn the first half of 2022  GTT received several approvals in principle from classification societies  including:Bureau Veritas for a new LNG conversion concept for large-capacity container ships;ClassNK for a new design of LNG fuel tank with 2 bar gauge pressure applicable to PCTC 2 vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships;vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships; DNV for an innovative LNG-powered PCTC vessel design;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for GTT‚Äôs future NEXT1 containment system;Bureau Veritas for Shear-Water  a ballast-free vessel concept for LNG bunkering and refuelling vessels.In the third quarter of 2022  GTT obtained five new approvals in principle from:DNV for a containment system enabling the transport of liquid hydrogen  as well as the concept for a hydrogen carrier vessel. Both approvals in principle were obtained in the framework of the cooperation agreement with Shell announced early 2022 and reflect the progress of this project;Lloyd‚Äôs Register for a new digital solution named ‚ÄúPOWER‚Äù designed to optimise transhipment operations between LNG carriers and floating units;Bureau Veritas for the design of a LNG-powered and ‚ÄúNH3-ready‚Äù Very Large Crude Carrier;Bureau Veritas and DNV for an innovative three-tank LNG carrier concept.Order book at September 30  2022On January 1  2022  GTT‚Äôs order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 161 units  and subsequently changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 21 LNG carriers  4 ethane carriers  1 FLNG;Orders received: 134 LNG carriers.At September 30  2022  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 269 units  breaking down as follows:250 LNG carriers;2 ethane carriers;2 FSUs;3 GBSs;12 onshore storage tanks.Regarding LNG as fuel  following the delivery of four vessels  and orders for 42 container ship tanks  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 70 units at September 30  2022.Evolution of consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022(in thousands of euros) 9M 2021 9M 2022 Change Revenues 240 025 222 037 -7.5% Newbuilds 224 281 200 385 -10.7% LNG carriers/VLEC 194 767 174 749 -10.3% FSUs3 9 660 13 578 +40.6% FSRUs4 8 054 - nm FLNGs5 2 202 1 218 -44.7% Onshore storage tanks 1 468 4 680 +218.8% GBSs6 2 521 3 303 +31.1% LNG-powered vessels 5 610 2 857 -49.1% Electrolysers 3 316 2 980 -10.1% Services 12 428 18 672 +50.2%Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of 2022 were ‚Ç¨222.0 million  down 7.5% compared to the first nine months of 2021. The third quarter 2022 revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨77.8 million  up 4.1% compared to the third quarter 2021.Newbuild revenues totalled ‚Ç¨200.4 million  down 10.7% compared with the first nine months of 2021  when the cycle was still at its peak. Royalties amounted to ‚Ç¨174.7 million from LNG and ethane carriers  ‚Ç¨13.6 million from FSUs  ‚Ç¨1.2 million from FLNGs  ‚Ç¨4.7 million from onshore storage tanks and ‚Ç¨3.3 million from GBSs. LNG as fuel royalties (‚Ç¨2.9 million) were not yet impacted by the high order intake in 2021 and 2022.Nine-month revenues from the Elogen electrolyser business amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million  in a context of increasing commercial dynamic.Revenues from services rose sharply  up 50.2% to ‚Ç¨18.7 million  driven by growth in digital services and engineering studies mainly related to the conversion of LNG carriers into FSRUs.Update on exposure to RussiaWork on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is currently continuing  in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes.In Russia  the Group is involved in tank design for 15 ice-breaking LNG carriers currently being built at the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of 3 GBSs7 currently under construction at Saren B.V.8 At October 1  2022  revenues of ‚Ç¨74 million have yet to be recognised by 2025 for ice-breaking LNG carriers  including ‚Ç¨4 million in Q4 2022. Revenues of ‚Ç¨12 million have yet to be recognised for 2027 for GBSs  including ‚Ç¨1 million in Q4 2022.Given the impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and successful execution of these contracts are still exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation. In particular  sanctions are still affecting Russian imports of certain products and equipment used in current projects  including the Zvezda project. Furthermore  as previously announced  in July Saren B.V. notified GTT of its intention to terminate the contract between them. The termination date has not yet been finally set.

That requires not only growing revenues but also growing a broad diversity of revenue streams that help drive greater absolute EBITDA and greater value for shareholders.""1 This press release includes certain alternative performance indicators which are not defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as endorsed by the EU. The descriptions of these alternative performance indicators and reconciliations of non-IFRS to IFRS measures are included in the Appendix to this press release.UMG ResultsThree Months EndedSeptember 30 %%Nine Months EndedSeptember 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q3 2022 ResultsRevenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨2 664 million  an increase of 23.7% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency. Revenue includes a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit in Recorded Music from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider (the ""Legal Settlement"")  as well as a ‚Ç¨21 million negative impact in Music Publishing from a previously announced change in accounting policy.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters.UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 26.5% year-over-year  or 15.4% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨539 million  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. EBITDA margin was 20.2%  compared to 19.8% in the third quarter of 2021. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨14 million during the third quarter of 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨15 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the third quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was ‚Ç¨553 million  up 20.0% year-over-year  or 9.1% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and the Legal Settlement. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.8%  compared to 21.4% in the third quarter of 2021.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 included a ‚Ç¨52 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  partially offset by the negative ‚Ç¨7 million impact from the Change in Society Accounting.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were also impacted by the timing of certain A&R expenses  which increased in the quarter but remain down year-to-date  and by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards Merchandising and Other revenues  which carry a significantly lower EBITDA margin than the Company's other revenues. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat versus the prior-year quarter.YTD 2022 ResultsIn the nine months ended September 30  2022  UMG's revenues of ‚Ç¨7 398 million increased by 23.6%  or 15.6% in constant currency  compared to the nine months ended September 30  2021. This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2022 includes a ‚Ç¨123 million benefit from the Change in Society Accounting  and a ‚Ç¨71 million benefit from the Legal Settlement  both discussed above. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30  2021 included a ‚Ç¨41 million benefit from a catch up payment from a digital service provider ""DSP Catch-Up Payment""  previously disclosed and booked in Q2 2021. Excluding these items  revenue increased 21.2% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  EBITDA of ‚Ç¨1 499 million grew 20.1% year-over-year  or 12.6% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 20.3% compared to 20.9% in the prior year period. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨16 million during the nine months through Q3 2022  and by ‚Ç¨20 million of share-based compensation as well as ‚Ç¨18 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during the nine months through Q3 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 was ‚Ç¨1 515 million  up 17.8% compared to the comparable period in 2021  or up 10.2% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.0pp year-over-year to 20.5%.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months through Q3 2022 benefitted from the Change in Society Accounting (‚Ç¨27 million) and the Legal Settlement (‚Ç¨52 million). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended Q3 2021 benefitted from the DSP Catch-Up Payment (‚Ç¨26 million)  as well as from a previously disclosed recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release""  ‚Ç¨20 million) in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA grew 15.8% year-over-year  or 8.0% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%  compared to 20.9% for the nine months ended Q3 2021. The contraction in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as revenues were more heavily weighted towards lower-margin Merchandising revenues in the first nine months of 2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedSeptember 30 %%Nine Months EndedSeptember 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance measures or indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the income from Operating Profit:amortization of intangible assets; impairment losses on goodwill and other intangibles; other income and expenses related to transactions with shareowners (except when directly recognized in equity); depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets; (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  including right of use assets and intangible assets; (income)/losses from equity affiliates; restructuring expenses; and other non-recurring items.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity  including but not limited to professional fees and listing fees related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity.Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/512308/UMG.jpgSOURCE Universal Music Group N.V.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.21,0.56,True,English,"['Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Financial Results', 'Third Quarter', 'Nine Months', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'financial reporting quarters', 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'alternative performance indicators', 'copyright infringement lawsuit', 'internet service provider', 'best available estimate', 'Euronext Amsterdam durin', 'Summary Q3 Results1', 'Summary YTD Results', '‚Ç¨21 million negative impact', 'relevant collection society', 'current year rates', 'greater absolute EBITDA', 'current year results', 'Music Publishing revenue', 'prior year results', 'financial results', 'Constant currency change', 'Q3 2022 Results', 'Society Accounting', 'greater value', '‚Ç¨71 million benefit', 'accounting policy', 'prior years', 'Recorded Music', 'Music revenue', 'Top sellers', 'Morgan Wallen', 'nine months', 'growing range', 'creative opportunities', 'recording artists', 'global reach', 'unique understanding', 'music-related content', 'recurring income', 'Boyd Muir', 'long-term value', 'broad diversity', 'press release', 'UMG Results', 'Three Months', 'end customer', 'share-based compensation', 'strong growth', 'Other revenue', 'high-quality revenue', 'revenue streams', 'Legal Settlement', 'revenue growth', 'third quarter', '12.6 % EBITDA margin', 'IFRS measures', 'Other segments', 'growing revenues', '15.6 % EBITDA', 'Merchandising', 'BTS', 'BLACKPINK', 'Ado', 'INI', 'HILVERSUM', 'Netherlands', 'PRNewswire', 'Company', 'diverse', 'business', 'songwriters', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'innovation', 'evolution', 'market', 'monetization', 'sources', 'EVP', 'CFO', 'President', 'Operations', 'vision', 'success', 'shareholders', 'descriptions', 'reconciliations', 'Appendix', 'YoY', '0.4pp', 'Note', 'increase', 'relation', 'societies', 'usage', 'collectability', 'Recognition', 'accrual', 'amount', 'consideration', 'timing', 'expenses', 'listing', '23.7', '23.6']",2022-10-27,2022-10-28,prnewswire.co.uk

The combination will create a leading Dutch insurance company. This step enables Aegon to accelerate its strategy and represents a major step in its ambition to become a leader in its chosen markets. Aegon will receive EUR 2.5 billion in gross cash proceeds  and a 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r.  with associated governance rights. Aegon‚Äôs Dutch asset management activities will remain part of Aegon‚Äôs global asset manager. Aegon will enter into a long-term asset management agreement with a.s.r. to manage parts of the combination‚Äôs general account investments  the investments of the Premium Pension Institution (PPI) offering of Aegon Cappital  and a.s.r.‚Äôs mortgage funds.‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement marks a major milestone in the history of our company and in our long-term ambition to create leaders in our chosen markets‚Äù  said Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon. ‚ÄúBoth Aegon and a.s.r. are deeply rooted in Dutch society and share a long and rich history. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees  Aegon the Netherlands has been able to improve its performance in recent years. We‚Äôre now building on that success by creating a Dutch insurance leader. I‚Äôm convinced that the combination of our companies is in the best long-term interest of all stakeholders and Dutch society at large. Customers of both companies will benefit from a more diversified product offering and strong distribution.‚ÄúThis transaction provides a unique opportunity to accelerate both the return of capital to shareholders and our strategy of investing in markets where we are well positioned for growth. Our priority continues to be to further improve our operational performance and grow profitably. The increased focus and resources resulting from this transaction  will place us in a better position for the future growth of the company.‚ÄùJos Baeten  CEO of a.s.r. said: ‚ÄúI am pleased to announce today that a.s.r. and Aegon the Netherlands  two renowned Dutch companies  deeply rooted in Dutch society  will create a leader in Dutch insurance. Together we will form a sustainable  leading insurer and strengthen our market position as the number two insurer in the market. Given the joined strength of both companies  the company will provide a good home for all Aegon the Netherlands employees  customers  and relations. As employees of a.s.r.  we will work with the new colleagues on the future of this combination. The starting point will be  one company  one culture  by leveraging the best of both organizations. We look forward to welcoming all employees  customers  and relations of Aegon the Netherlands in the near future.‚Äù1 Value of 29.99% stake is EUR 2.4 billion based on the closing price of a.s.r.‚Äôs shares on October 26  2022 and 57 million shares to be received by Aegon upon closing of the transaction before any potential equity offering by a.s.r. as part of the funding of the transaction.Compelling strategic rationaleCombining the two companies will result in a strong well-diversified Dutch insurance company that will be able to deliver a broad range of attractive products and services and generate attractive shareholder returns.The combined group will:have a leading position in the Dutch pension market. This will lead to more attractive value propositions to customers as the company is well placed to capture opportunities from the upcoming pension reform;become the market leader in disability insurance and the number three player in property and casualty insurance  facilitating a more competitive product offering;have enhanced scale in the origination and servicing of Dutch mortgages  creating the opportunity for more streamlined and improved operations;have stronger distribution activities by combining Aegon‚Äôs and a.s.r.‚Äôs expertise  resources  and platforms in this area; anddeliver significant synergies through the integration of the closed individual life portfolios of the two companies into one platform.The combination will be well positioned to further extend its role in the Dutch insurance market in the field of sustainability and ESG and contribute to finding solutions to the main challenges society faces that have a clear relationship with the core activities of the new combination.Combining the two companies is expected to lead to substantial cost synergies and diversification benefits. Aegon will benefit from a.s.r.‚Äôs improved operating capital generation and capital synergies through its 29.99% stake in the company. Aegon will bring to a.s.r. significant risk management capabilities and accelerate the implementation of a Partial Internal Model for the calculation of the Solvency II required capital of the combination.Leveraging Aegon Asset Management‚Äôs capabilitiesAegon has agreed an exclusive long-term partnership with a.s.r. to manage the illiquid investments that are part of the general account of the combined businesses. In addition  it will continue to be the asset manager for the investments of Aegon Cappital‚Äôs PPI proposition and will take over the management of a.s.r.‚Äôs mortgage funds. Through these steps  Aegon Asset Management will further strengthen its position as a provider in the Dutch market of fiduciary services  retirement multi-assets & solutions  fixed income  including alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing.Governance of combinationAegon N.V. will be a 29.99% strategic  supportive shareholder in a.s.r.  allowing Aegon to participate in the financial benefits that the combination will bring. Furthermore  Aegon will have the right to nominate two candidates for the a.s.r. Supervisory Board. Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon N.V will be nominated as a non-independent member  and Danielle Jansen Heijtmajer  Chair of the Supervisory Board of Aegon the Netherlands  will be nominated as an independent member of the Supervisory Board of a.s.r.. The non-independent member has an affirmative vote within a.s.r.‚Äôs Supervisory Board on certain topics  in line with the size of Aegon‚Äôs shareholding.Integration and organization of companiesThe activities of a.s.r. and Aegon the Netherlands will be integrated after closing of the transaction to maximize the potential of the two businesses and fully benefit from their combined reach  scale  and resources. The integration is expected to impact employees in both companies. The integration will be largely completed within three years  and the intention is to minimize the number of redundancies through natural attrition and by helping people to the greatest extent possible to find jobs either inside or outside of the combination. The process will be executed in a fair  diligent  and open way  respecting the talents and strengths of people in both organizations. Employees of the combination will benefit from the sharing of best practices and greater long-term career opportunities within a larger  more diversified Dutch company.The a.s.r. brand will be the leading brand of the combination. The Aegon brand will remain in use in the pension and mortgage markets for three years after closing of the transaction. There will be no change for the brands of Aegon‚Äôs other entities  including TKP  Knab  Robidus and Nedasco.Accelerating transformationThe transaction represents a major step in the transformation of Aegon  building on the successful execution of the strategy outlined at the Capital Markets Day of December 2020 to create leaders in chosen markets. The transaction forms a leader in the Dutch insurance market and enables Aegon to increase its focus on creating advantaged businesses in chosen markets outside the Netherlands.In the US  Aegon will build upon Transamerica‚Äôs leading positions in both individual life insurance solutions and the workplace pension business  investing capital to profitably grow its market share in selected product lines. Additionally  Transamerica will continue to take management actions designed to further improve the risk-return profile of the business. In the UK  Aegon‚Äôs ambition is to continue to profitably grow both the Retail and Workplace channels of its leading platform business by improving its customer propositions  service capabilities and digital experience for advisors  employers  and customers. The transaction allows Aegon Asset Management to strengthen its position in retirement-related investment solutions  alternative fixed income investments and responsible investing  and to build leadership in these areas. In its growth markets  Aegon will continue to look to invest capital in value-added growth opportunities. More details will be shared on the plans to profitably grow the strategic businesses in Aegon‚Äôs core markets  its growth markets  and its global asset manager at a Capital Markets Day in the second quarter of 2023.Use of proceeds and financial implicationsAegon anticipates that it will return EUR 1.5 billion of the cash proceeds to shareholders  barring unforeseen circumstances  to offset the dilutive effect of the transaction on free cash flow per share. Furthermore  the company intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million.A priority for Aegon moving forward is to drive sustainable  profitable growth for Transamerica and to execute upon additional in-force management actions designed to improve the risk-return profile of the business. It is anticipated that this will require funding and therefore Aegon expects to maintain its Cash Capital at the Holding above the middle of the operating range of EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion in the near term. Surplus Cash Capital at the Holding above the operating range will be subject to continued disciplined capital management  whereby capital that is not used for value-added growth opportunities will be returned to shareholders over time.Update on financial targets; increase in dividend per shareOn completion of the transaction  Aegon will replace its full ownership of the cash flow and profits of its Dutch businesses with its 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r.. In the near term  this is expected to translate into lower free cash flow  improving over time as synergies emerge from the combination. On completion of the capital return to shareholders and realization of the synergies  Aegon anticipates that its free cash flow on a per share basis will be higher than pre-transaction levels.The progress that Aegon has made on its transformation allows the company to increase its pay-out ratio and rebase the targeted dividend per share over 2023 from the current level of around 25 eurocents to around 30 eurocents.All other financial targets will be updated in due course.The transaction is expected to reduce IFRS shareholders‚Äô equity by EUR 3.3 billion based on the balance sheet position on June 30  2022. This includes the impact from the settlement of a tax position at closing of the transaction  which is not anticipated to have a material impact on Aegon‚Äôs Cash Capital at the Holding.Group supervision implicationsAegon will engage with its college of supervisors on the implications for group supervision upon closing of the intended transaction. Regardless of the outcome  Aegon intends to maintain its head office in the Netherlands. Its shares will remain listed on Euronext in Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange.Indicative timelinesThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including regulatory and antitrust approvals  shareholder approvals  and the completion of the works council consultation processes of both Aegon and a.s.r..Aegon will convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM) and request approval for the proposed combination between Aegon the Netherlands and a.s.r.. The EGM is expected to be held on January 18  2023. The Board of the Association Aegon has been informed of Aegon‚Äôs ambition to accelerate its strategy and the proposed combination with a.s.r.. The Board is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for its support.Based on the required steps  and necessary approvals  the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023.About AegonAegon is an integrated  diversified  international financial services group.

Excluding the temporary net positive impact of Covid-related contracts  our underlying organic growth is 9.2% at the end of September.The average cumulative organic growth at the end of September is 32% over the last two years and 19% over the last three years  which demonstrates our regular performance and strong operating model.PERFORMANCE BY QUARTER2022 vs. 2021 In millions ofEuros 2022Revenue Totalgrowth Organicgrowth 1st quarter 547.8 17.5% 12.3% (1) 2nd quarter 574.0 8.9% 2.1% 3rd quarter 601.5 14.3% 5.3%* Revenue 1 723.3 13.4 % 6.3 %*(1) Covid-related contracts were maintained at least in part until March 31  2022* Underlying organic growth is 6.9% for the third quarter and 9.2% for the Nine-month 2022  excluding the temporary net positive impact of Covid-related contracts (specific pandemic monitoring projects for governments  minus contracts that could not be executed because of the health situation).Looking specifically at the third quarter  total growth is 14.3%  of which 5.3% organic and 8.0% currency effects.

In particular  double-digit growth is experienced in the Service Lines that focus on measuring and analyzing brand growth and expression.Good growth is also noted in our work focusing on customers and employees  which reflects an increasing interest of our clients in measuring and assessing their own client experiences and also in ensuring the quality of their HR plans.After massive growth during the 2020-21 period spurred by large scale Covid-testing programmes in Europe  our work among citizens has fallen back in 2022.

Q4 Net Sales growth will be driven by both volumes and prices. We maintain our target of over 200 million euros in Free Cash Flow.Despite input cost inflation  continued investment in Brand support  and OPEX aimed at fueling growth  Full Year 2022 adjusted EBIT is expected to grow in absolute terms.Strong Momentum in all divisions9M 2022 Group Net Sales increased 11.6% on a comparative basis  13.8% at Constant Currencies  and 11.3% on a 12-month rolling basis2. Year-to-date and quarterly growth were driven by volume increase  favorable mix  and the successful implementation of price increases in all regions. All divisions and regions contributed to 9M and Q3 performance.In Human Expression   9M organic growth continued to be driven by our Core Writing Instruments and Coloring segments. The 2022 Back-to-School season was solid in Europe  North America  and Mexico  notably in the Ball Pen  Mechanical Pen  and Coloring segments. Capitalizing on our value positioning  we gained market share in all key countries  outperforming in classic and added-value segments. India and African countries continued to recover from the pandemic and achieved high-double-digit growth. In Brazil  the strong recovery of the Stationery market  which grew double-digit year-to-date  coupled with a strong commercial execution from our teams  should support a solid 2022-2023 Back-to-School season.Added-value Lighters grew 13% in value and accounted for 35% of the Flame For Life 9M Net Sales. In the US  BIC EZ Reach utility pocket lighter continued to be incremental to the overall category and reached over 5% of the Pocket lighter market  driven by accelerated distribution  notably in convenience stores  and efficient Brand Support.

BIC Blade-Tech B2B business continued to ramp up and contributed to 20% of the total Blade Excellence Year-to-Date Net Sales growth.Input cost inflation and investment in Growth (Brand Support and OPEX) partially offset by favorable pricing and Net Sales operating leverage9M 2022 Gross Profit margin decreased by 2.5 points to 48.9% as reported  and by 2.8 points excluding Inkbox. Input cost inflation (- 5.6 pts) and unfavorable FX (-1.1 pts)  mainly EUR/USD hedging rate (-1.2 pts)  were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption (+2.1 pts)  pricing (+1.7 pts)  and the positive contribution of Inkbox (+0.3 pts). 9M 2022 Adjusted EBIT increased by 8.0%. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.7%  a decrease of 2.1 pts compared to 9M 2021 as reported and -1.2 pts excluding Inkbox.

Q3 adjusted EBIT margin declined -5.9 pts driven by higher Brand Support and OPEX  as well as the negative impact from recent acquisitions investments in growth partially offset by Net Sales Operating leverage.Total input cost inflation weighed 79 million euros on 9M adjusted EBIT (including 31 million euros in Q3). For the balance of the year  we expect approximately 30 million euros headwinds from input cost inflation  including electricity prices. The Full Year impact will be more than offset by volume increase  price adjustments  and additional savings  and allow us to grow adjusted Full-Year EBIT in absolute terms  although at a slower pace than Net Sales.9M Net Cash from Operating Activities reached 208.1 million euros  fueled by solid business performance. The -88.1 million euros change in Net Current Working Capital was driven by Trade and other Receivables (-56.6M‚Ç¨)  as a result of strong Net Sales growth  and by an increase in Inventory levels (-93.5M‚Ç¨  of which 38 million euros of input cost inflation from Raw Materials  Freight  and Electricity).9M 2022 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals was +150.7 million euros.

Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  October 27  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Elsewhere in Europe  activities are growing quickly as the roll-out of fiber-optic networks gets underway in most of the countries where Solutions 30 operates.For the first nine months of 2022  Solutions 30‚Äôs consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨656.8 million  up +0.5% (-1.8% on an organic basis).Revenue by regionFrance: In the third quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of ‚Ç¨96.7 million  down 20.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021.With ‚Ç¨68.9 million in revenue  the telecom business is down 20.0% compared to the third quarter of 2021. This decline in business reflects the maturity of the market after the record levels of activity observed during the COVID crisis  which accelerated the deployment of ultra-fast broadband in France. The industry as a whole‚Äîcustomers as well as service providers and subcontractors‚Äîhas been forced to adapt and adjust to new ways of cooperating and to a temporary lack of visibility brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties. As a result  the operational conditions under which contracts are executed have significantly deteriorated in recent months and been aggravated by the current inflationary situation.This has implications for the entire industry and pricing renegotiations are underway. In this context  Solutions 30 is continuing its operational transition by building on its strong competitive advantages: a diversified customer and business portfolio  a healthy financial structure with little debt  and an agile organization.Revenue from the energy business amounted to ‚Ç¨11.5 million  compared with ‚Ç¨19.7 million a year earlier. This decline of 41.4% is due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France (activity down 79.6%). Even though revenue from the new energy transition and electric mobility verticals is still suffering from supply chain disruptions  it increased by 31%. However  this growth does not yet compensate for the decline in the company‚Äôs historic verticals.The IT business posted revenue of ‚Ç¨11.2 million  stable compared to last year‚Äôs third quarter  while the security and payments business is up 12.9%  generating ‚Ç¨5.1 million in revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨4.5 million a year earlier.Over the first nine months of the year  revenue is down 18.7% to ‚Ç¨318.6 million.Benelux: Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨53.6 million compared to ‚Ç¨39.3 million a year earlier  representing pure organic growth of 36.5% and reflecting the excellent dynamics of the Belgian and Dutch markets.The growth of the telecom business is accelerating due to the rapid ramp-up of the contracts signed with Fiberklaar  Open Dutch Fiber  and Unifiber. Revenue from fiber activities alone increased 4.5 times over the quarter  growing the telecom business by 40.1% and resulting in quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨40.3 million compared to ‚Ç¨28.8 million a year earlier.For the energy business  revenue was ‚Ç¨9.5 million compared to ‚Ç¨6.6 million a year earlier  a purely organic increase of 43.0%  thanks to the deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius.Quarterly revenue from the IT business remained stable at ‚Ç¨2.1 million while revenue from the retail and security businesses was ‚Ç¨1.7 million  compared to ‚Ç¨1.8 million for the third quarter of 2021.Over the first nine months of 2022  revenue grew by 33.2% to ‚Ç¨152.1 million  compared to ‚Ç¨114.2 million a year earlier.In all other countries  the group posted quaterly revenue of ‚Ç¨62.1 million  an increase of 21.0% (10.4% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue began to grow again and is up 7% to ‚Ç¨16.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨15.1 million a year earlier. As expected  the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization  as well as updated pricing conditions for certain major contracts  are starting to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 19% in the third quarter of 2022 to ‚Ç¨14.8 million  driven by the pursuit of TIM‚Äôs ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley  which began in the first quarter of 2021.On the Iberian peninsula  revenue grew by 8% to ‚Ç¨14.4 million  thanks to positive dynamics in the telecommunications sector (fiber and 5th generation mobile networks)  a strong uptick in installations of charging stations for electric vehicles  and pricing increases obtained from several customers.In Poland  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨7.9 million  up 35% (23% organic growth). Solutions 30 continues to gain market share in this country  while the integration of Sirtel into the portfolio of activities for 5G networks is progressing well. The organization put in place will ensure the company‚Äôs ability to support its customers‚Äô growth. The mobile networks business is growing rapidly and now accounts for nearly 10% of revenue.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted ‚Ç¨8.8 million in revenue during the quarter  up 92% (-11% on an organic basis). Solutions 30 has streamlined its operations to focus on higher-potential markets and the diversification of its services into fiber-optic networks  while the integration of Mono‚Äôs operations continues.In all these countries  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨186.1 million for the first nine months of 2022  an increase of 26.2% (15.8% on an organic basis) compared to the first nine months of 2021.OutlookIn response to current inflationary pressure  Solutions 30 is increasing its prices  both on new and existing contracts. The group has also taken measures to strictly control operating costs with the aim of preserving a solid financial structure with little debt. Such a structure will protect its ability to finance growth through acquisitions  increase its agility  strengthen its competitive advantages  and preserve its future capacity to pursue consolidation in its sector.In France  the market is in transition  which has led to limited short-term visibility. Against this backdrop  Solutions 30 will pursue its action plan to restore growth and a more normal level of profitability. This plan involves (i) winning marketshare in the mature telecoms sector where a second phase of consolidation is expected to take place; (ii) developing new  high-growth activities  especially in the energy sector where demand remains strong  driven by the major challenges of energy independence  the transition to new energies  and the electrification of vehicles; and (iii) seeking out synergies between the various businesses  accompanied by a reallocation of technicians to businesses with greater potential.In the Benelux and other countries  growth will remain strong through the end of the year  with the same momentum it saw in the third quarter.For the group as a whole  the fourth-quarter trend should be in line with the first nine months of the year and 2022 revenue should remain at the same levels as in 2021. The increase in the EBITDA margin at the end of the year is subject to ongoing price negotiations.From 2023  Solutions 30 should return to more dynamic growth  driven by the development momentum of its activities outside France. It should also see an overall improvement in its profitability. The group has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will help it consolidate its position at the crossroads of the digital transformation and the energy transition.Upcoming event2022 Q4 Revenue and 2022 Annual Revenue Reports | January 26  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  the Group recorded growth of 14.0%  despite persistent supply chain issues in its various businesses  particularly in agricultural spraying and sugar beet harvesters.The change in consolidation scope arising from the Group‚Äôs two recent acquisitions (EXEL Yachting and G.F.) contributed ‚Ç¨5.2 million to fourth quarter sales.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 37.8%After peaking in spring 2022  accentuated by the conflict in Ukraine  agricultural commodity prices fell slightly during the summer and stabilized at levels still well above pre-COVID prices. Against this backdrop  demand remained strong in all regions  particularly North America  while the component shortage shows no sign of abating.The exceptionally well-stocked order book enabled the various Group companies to mitigate sales seasonality and carry out a significant amount of billing during the quarter.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 18.9%After a third quarter particularly impacted by component shortages and a resurgence of COVID in Germany  business caught up strongly in the fourth quarter  resulting in record billings for sales of sugar beet harvesters.LEISURE: UP 21.7%The garden equipment market declined in the Group‚Äôs three main operating regions (the United Kingdom  France and Italy). In this context and after a series of challenging quarters (IT migration)  Q4 business came close to the previous year‚Äôs levels  bolstered by a more favorable basis of comparison than in previous quarters.The EXEL Yachting business posted a satisfactory quarterly performance with deliveries in line with forecasts.INDUSTRY: UP 5.1%At constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates  business was stable during the quarter: technical hoses and industrial spraying saw a slight slowdown in volumes in Europe  offset by ongoing robust momentum in Asia and  to a lower extent  the USA.Situation in Ukraine and RussiaThe new sanctions announced in early October do not affect Group products any more than the previous sanctions. As previously announced  EXEL Industries has maintained its operations in Russia (agricultural equipment and industrial spraying) but has taken care to ensure that deliveries are made in compliance with international regulations. The Group has been able to maintain overall sales volumes in the region.FY 2021‚Äì2022 salesFull-year 2021‚Äì2022 sales amounted to ‚Ç¨977.0 million  up 11.4%. Growth at constant consolidation scope and foreign exchange rates was 4.4%. EXEL Industries‚Äô concern was to adjust prices across all of its business lines  in response to rising raw material and component costs. This policy implemented throughout the year offset certain volume declines due to shortages (mainly agricultural equipment) or to the market slowdown (gardening). The currency effect was particularly favorable to the agricultural spraying and industry segments.The change in consolidation scope represented sales of ‚Ç¨29.8 million for the year.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING: UP 16.1%The agricultural spraying business was impacted by varying trends during the year: on the one hand  Group brands were hard hit by persisting component shortages despite very different production bases (Europe  the USA). Prices were increased throughout the period in order to pass on price increases implemented by supplier. On the other hand  order intake was boosted by the stabilization of agricultural commodity prices at globally high levels  giving the Group clear visibility over the coming fiscal year.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS: UP 8.0%After recovering in 2020‚Äì2021  sales remained strong during the fiscal year ended. In addition  component shortages allowed the Group to clear a large volume of used machine inventories. Lastly  prices were increased to offset increases in production costs (steel and other components).LEISURE: UP 4.9%The gardening business was impacted by three factors during the year. After two exceptional years in terms of volumes  markets returned to pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile  challenges related to the migration of IT systems curbed leisure business volumes by around ‚Ç¨10 million. Prices were increased during the year to offset significant increases in the cost of raw materials and logistics. Lastly  the acquisition of G.F. on February 15  2022  resulted in a scope effect increasing sales for this activity by approximately ‚Ç¨20 million.A new sales  marketing and industrial drive launched in the nautical business is expected to impact the coming years.INDUSTRY: UP 9.5%The underlying markets (mainly automotive  furniture and industry) experienced contrasting trends. However  the industrial spraying business continued to post high volumes throughout the year in line with the previous year.The technical hose division was impacted by declining volumes in the gardening business  while the B2B business was impacted by falling demand towards the end of the year.Yves Belegaud  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group  said:‚ÄúThe strong commitment of our teams in the fourth quarter and the successful integration of our latest acquisitions allowed us to post record sales. This excellent performance was achieved in a challenging and volatile environment in which shortages have not been recovered. However  the Group is confident in its ability to continue its development  underpinned by the various business sectors in which it operates and a well-stocked order book.‚ÄùUpcoming eventsDecember 20  2022  before market opening: 2021‚Äì2022 full-year results.January 25  2023  before market opening: Q1 2022‚Äì2023 sales.About EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.

It covers the 12-months period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. We remark that comparative financials for the past accounting year 2020-21 relate to the 18-months period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021.A full copy of the GeoJunxion Annual Report 2021/22 is attached to this press release and can be found on the company‚Äôs website www.geojunxion.com  under the Investor Relations and Financial News sections.The 2021-22 accounting year was  once again  an eventful period during which the company continued its transformation and turnaround. For the third year in a row  we realized a substantial top line growth  while slightly reducing operating expenses  on a like for like basis. We also achieved Cash-Flow positive  as well as significant improvements on all the other financial KPIs. This is even more remarkable  because it was achieved during a time still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing concerns about the global economy due to the ramifications of the war in Ukraine with high energy prices and increased inflation.A summary of the key financials is provided in the table below:Due to the change in the period of the accounting year 2020-21 (to 18 months)  it is more difficult to analyze and compare the financials of the accounting year 2021-22 with the previous accounting years. As already remarked  the current accounting year covers the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 (12 months)  while the previous accounting year 2020-21 covers the period from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2021 (18 months). Additionally  the accounting year 2019 was based on a 12-month period but from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. To enable easier comparison  we also include below the income statement for the current accounting year and the pro-forma income statement for the two previous years  covering the same 12-months period from 1 July to 30 June the following year. This enables a clearer view of the revenue growth and significant improvements in all financial KPIs  comparing the same period.Revenue increased year-over-year by 40% to ‚Ç¨2.371.000 in 2021-22 compared to ‚Ç¨1.698.000 in the same period in 2020-21. It is very encouraging to highlight that this growth is not only due to non-recurring service revenue  but also the recurring service revenue increased substantially year-over-year (+72%) and recurring licenses remained essentially stable compared with the previous year.Costs for maps and data increased by 20 8% compared to the 12-months period of the prior year. These costs are related to content purchased to maintain and enrich the database and to hosting cost for delivering our data solutions via the cloud.Personnel expenses decreased in 2021-22  showing a 3% saving compared to the same period in 2020-21 despite a 40% higher revenue. The main drivers for this are a reduction in certain management roles in February 2022 and lower use of outsourced resources in the Netherlands and India during the second half of the accounting year.The depreciation cost on tangible fixed assets remained nearly flat year over year while amortization costs on intangible assets slightly increased. This increase is due to higher capitalized development costs and the amortization of these assets. Capitalized development costs are currently amortized over a period of 7 years  while before 2018  they were amortized over a longer period (15 to 20 years). Note that the book value of the database is subject to impairment testing. This means that the book value is compared to the value in use for the company. Per 30 June 2022  an impairment test was executed. This did not show a requirement for any additional impairment loss.Other operating expenses decreased more than 13% compared to the same period in 2020-21. This is the result of the implementation of a strict spending review  cost control measures  integration of tools and simplification of the group structure.Total Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 3% and Net Operating Expenses showed a reduction of 7% compared with the previous 12-months period. This confirms the general positive mood in which the company is operating today  capable of ‚Äúdelivering more with less‚Äù.Operating Result  despite still negative  shows an improvement of 63%  while the Net Loss was reduced by 46%  compared with the previous year.The net cash flow from operating activities in 2021-22 amounted to a positive cash inflow of ‚Ç¨131.000 compared to cash outflow of ‚Ç¨1.035.000 in the same period in 2020-21. This is primarily due to the significant improvement in the operating result and more favorable invoicing and collection terms negotiated with our customers and suppliers. During the accounting year 2021-22 there were no financing transactions  while  during the 2020-21 12-months period  a private placement was completed in December 2020  raising ‚Ç¨825.000 in equity funding.As an independent player  GeoJunxion focuses on creating ‚Äúmap agnostic‚Äù products  i.e.  designed to be fully integrated into any commercial and open-source brand of maps or utilized in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases in different industries and market sectors.GeoJunxion activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with its customers  through the creation of a recurring business model rather than one-off projects or transactions. Although the relationship may start with a proof-of-concept or a one-off project  most of our high value datasets require frequent and continuous updates to maintain or increase their value. As a result  the one-off project or proof-of-concept is often only a first step  followed by a recurring service or a license contract. As a result  converting the initial  one-off project into a recurring  predictable and sustainable revenue stream. In most cases  GeoJunxion also retains the IP and ownership of the newly developed datasets which can then be resold to other customers  thereby leveraging the initial investment and converting it into a virtuous business cycle.The GeoJunxion mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the environmental impact through intelligent solutions which enable more environmentally conscious decisions.GeoJunxion has valued diversity  integration and investment in social responsibility for years. We are committed to offering our daily contribution towards a better and more sustainable work environment. For this reason  the company has applied for PSO certification in 2020. PSO is the Dutch abbreviation for ‚ÄúPrestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen‚Äù  Performance ladder Social Entrepreneurship. In July 2022 we achieved Level 2 PSO certification  as one of the first publicly listed organizations in the Netherlands.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKLooking at the future  despite the general uncertainty pictured by the European Central Bank  GeoJunxion expects to see its top line to continue growing by 25 to 30% year over year. This expectation is built on orders booked in the first quarter of 2022-23 and a solid pipeline of opportunities. As a result of inflationary pressure and growing staff costs to deliver the projects  we expect our cost base to increase by 5 to 10%. GeoJunxion is reasonably confident to convert the above-mentioned guidance into positive EBITDA and EBIT close to break-even. On this basis  cash flow is  once again  expected to be positive for the accounting year 2022-23.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS / IMPORTANT NOTICEThis document contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial position and results of GeoJunxion.

IFRS STANDARDS AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSIAS29: impact on reported dataDanone has been applying IAS 29 in hyperinflation countries as defined in IFRS  except for Turkey in view of the unmaterial impact. Adoption of IAS 29 in these hyperinflationary countries requires its non-monetary assets and liabilities and its income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general pricing power of its functional currency  leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover  its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.IAS 29: impact on reported data‚Ç¨ million except % Q3 2022 Sales 1.4 Sales growth (%) +0.02%Breakdown by quarter of 9M 2022 sales after application of IAS 299M 2022 sales correspond to the addition of:Q3 2022 reported sales;Q1 and Q2 2022 sales resulting from the application of IAS29 until September 30  2022 to sales of entities of hyperinflation countries (application of the inflation rate until September 30  2022 and translation into euros using September 30  2022 closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data).‚Ç¨ million Q1 20221 Q2 20222 Q3 2022 9M 2022 Europe 2 114 2 267 2 246 6 628 North America 1 477 1 662 1 813 4 953 China  North Asia & Oceania 735 936 940 2 611 Rest of the World 1 936 2 237 2 335 6 509 Total 6 263 7 103 7 334 20 7001Results from the application of IAS29 until September 30  2022 to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.2Results from the application of IAS29 until September 30  2022 to Q2 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.Financial indicators not defined in IFRSDue to rounding  the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

Adjusted net profit rose by 25% to EUR 426 million.Business income was up 7% to EUR 1 208 million  reflecting continued solid growth of Euroclear's business lines. The diversification of the business has provided a hedge against market volatility over recent months. Interest  banking  and other income increased by 179% to EUR 182 million.Operating Expenses increased to EUR 811 million  up 12% compared to the prior year  as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering  as well as being impacted by inflation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Overall  Euroclear expects expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023 as a result of accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.The key operating metrics  shown below  underpinned the strong business performance during the period.Market volatility remains high  driving transaction volumes to record levels.Equity market valuations have fallen significantly during 2022 which has led to declines in assets under custody and fund asset under custody during the period.The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.Euroclear sees sustained demand for collateral management and lending services from a broad range of market participants as they seek to reduce credit risk in volatile financial market conditions.Q3 YTD 2022 Change vs Q3 YTD 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 34.9 trillion -3.5 % Number of Transactions 229 million +4.3 % Turnover EUR 791.8 trillion +8.1 % Fund Assets under Custody EUR 2.8 trillion -2.7 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.9 trillion +7.5 %In the third quarter  Euroclear outlined its updated strategic vision and targets to its investors. Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors.In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.Illustrating this strategic focus  Euroclear enhanced its offering in sustainable finance through an investment in Impact Cubed  a leading provider of ESG tech-enabled analytics and data science solutions. This investment complements Euroclear's investment in Greenomy  a provider of data and reporting for issuers to comply with EU sustainable finance legislation.International investor appetite for global market access as part of their diversified holdings remains robust and issuers continue to seek to benefit from an international investor base. Euroclear's strategic focus on meeting these demands continued to deliver growth  despite the headwinds resulting from the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Assets under custody from international and emerging markets were up 18% year-on-year to EUR 1.7 trillion.One year ago  Euroclear acquired MFEX as part of its expanded funds platform. Considerable progress has been made to integrate MFEX and enhance the group's end-to-end funds offering. This is reflected through the new MFEXbyEuroclear branding for all group funds solutions.Implications of Russian sanctionsThe sanctions imposed by the US  the EU  and other jurisdictions  as well as Russian countermeasures  resulted in a loss of Russia-related business income which was more than compensated by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of September  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨88.7 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 119.9 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested which  depending on the prevailing interest rates  results in interest income. Over the nine months  revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia was EUR 340 million.With the growth of sanctioned liabilities and the increase of interest rates  the materiality of revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia on the group's financial results is unprecedented. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate these earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board expects interest income to continue to grow materially as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate in a rising interest rate environment.As previously outlined  while this is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet  it should not result in material change in credit risk profile and therefore will not have a meaningful impact on the group's capital ratios.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by retaining any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer""Despite an extraordinary context  we continued to deliver an excellent business performance  with financial results above our strategic 'through-the-cycle"" targets.The group benefits from a diversified business model which allows us to focus on supporting clients through these uncertain times  providing robust infrastructure and fulfilling our duties with respect to the sanctions on Russia.Our results show that we are on the right path. We are now accelerating investments to deliver on our long-term strategy and drive value for all our stakeholders.""AnnexesInterest income is driven by the prevailing interest rates in each currency of the cash balances held by the group. As at 30 September 2022  cash balances totaled EUR 111.7 billion  of which EUR 85.8 billion related to the sanctions on Russia.The proportion of cash balances by currency is as follows:Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

An increasing interest rate environment has impacted Euroclear Investment's intra-group loans (assets) recognised at fair market value in line with IFRS 9. Liabilities have not been impacted  due to being recognised at acquisitioncost  in line with accounting standards. As a result  Euroclear Investments demonstrates a significant loss on non-trading financialassets for Q3 2022 compared to Q3 2021  resulting in a negative operating profit.

Adjusted net profit rose by 25% to EUR 426 million.Business income was up 7% to EUR 1 208 million  reflecting continued solid growth of Euroclear's business lines. The diversification of the business has provided a hedge against market volatility over recent months. Interest  banking  and other income increased by 179% to EUR 182 million.Operating Expenses increased to EUR 811 million  up 12% compared to the prior year  as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering  as well as being impacted by inflation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Overall  Euroclear expects expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023 as a result of accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.The key operating metrics  shown below  underpinned the strong business performance during the period.Market volatility remains high  driving transaction volumes to record levels.Equity market valuations have fallen significantly during 2022 which has led to declines in assets under custody and fund asset under custody during the period.The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.Euroclear sees sustained demand for collateral management and lending services from a broad range of market participants as they seek to reduce credit risk in volatile financial market conditions.Q3 YTD 2022 Change vs Q3 YTD 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 34.9 trillion -3.5 % Number of Transactions 229 million +4.3 % Turnover EUR 791.8 trillion +8.1 % Fund Assets under Custody EUR 2.8 trillion -2.7 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.9 trillion +7.5 %In the third quarter  Euroclear outlined its updated strategic vision and targets to its investors. Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors.In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.Illustrating this strategic focus  Euroclear enhanced its offering in sustainable finance through an investment in Impact Cubed  a leading provider of ESG tech-enabled analytics and data science solutions. This investment complements Euroclear's investment in Greenomy  a provider of data and reporting for issuers to comply with EU sustainable finance legislation.International investor appetite for global market access as part of their diversified holdings remains robust and issuers continue to seek to benefit from an international investor base. Euroclear's strategic focus on meeting these demands continued to deliver growth  despite the headwinds resulting from the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Assets under custody from international and emerging markets were up 18% year-on-year to EUR 1.7 trillion.One year ago  Euroclear acquired MFEX as part of its expanded funds platform. Considerable progress has been made to integrate MFEX and enhance the group's end-to-end funds offering. This is reflected through the new MFEXbyEuroclear branding for all group funds solutions.Implications of Russian sanctionsThe sanctions imposed by the US  the EU  and other jurisdictions  as well as Russian countermeasures  resulted in a loss of Russia-related business income which was more than compensated by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of September  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨88.7 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 119.9 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested which  depending on the prevailing interest rates  results in interest income. Over the nine months  revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia was EUR 340 million.With the growth of sanctioned liabilities and the increase of interest rates  the materiality of revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia on the group's financial results is unprecedented. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate these earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board expects interest income to continue to grow materially as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate in a rising interest rate environment.As previously outlined  while this is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet  it should not result in material change in credit risk profile and therefore will not have a meaningful impact on the group's capital ratios.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by retaining any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer""Despite an extraordinary context  we continued to deliver an excellent business performance  with financial results above our strategic 'through-the-cycle"" targets.The group benefits from a diversified business model which allows us to focus on supporting clients through these uncertain times  providing robust infrastructure and fulfilling our duties with respect to the sanctions on Russia.Our results show that we are on the right path.

Financial Summary Euroclear continued to deliver,"BRUSSELS  Oct. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Euroclear today provides an update on its performance to the end of the third quarter 2022.Financial SummaryEuroclear continued to deliver a strong financial performance to the end of the third quarter 2022  with the underlying business performing well and benefitting from its diversified  resilient business model.The group also reported higher interest earnings due to rising interest rates on cash balances as well as increased cash balances from frozen assets due to Russian sanctions.At the end of the third quarter  2022 net profit increased 95% to EUR 667 million  of which EUR 426 million resulted from the strong underlying business performance.Euroclear Holding(‚Ç¨ m) YTDSept 2021 YTDSept 2022 Russiansanctionsimpacts YTDSept 2022Underlying Underlyingvs 2021Operating income 1 199 1 725 335 1 390 191 16 % Business income 1 133 1 202 -5 1 208 74 7 % Interest  banking & other income 65 522 340 182 117 179 %Operating expenses -723 -824 -13 -811 -88 -12 %Operating profit before Impairment 476 901 322 579 103 22 %Impairment -16 -13 -1 -12 4Pre tax profit 460 888 321 567 107 23 % Tax -118 -221 -80 -140 -22 -19 % Net profit 342 667 241 426 84 25 %EPS 110.3 211.9135.5Business income operating margin 36.2 % 31.5 %32.9 %EBITDA margin (EBITDA/oper.income) 46.2 % 57.0 %47.5 %Note: 2021 figures (except for EPS) have been restated to includeMFEX pro forma  in order to allow like-for-like comparison.Year-to-date operating income was up 44% year-on-year to EUR 1 725 million.An increase of 92% in earnings per share to EUR 211.9 per share  reflected the increase in net profit.Underlying Business Performance & HighlightsExcluding the impact of frozen assets due to the Russian sanctions  Euroclear's underlying business continues to perform strongly. Adjusted net profit rose by 25% to EUR 426 million.Business income was up 7% to EUR 1 208 million  reflecting continued solid growth of Euroclear's business lines. The diversification of the business has provided a hedge against market volatility over recent months. Interest  banking  and other income increased by 179% to EUR 182 million.Operating Expenses increased to EUR 811 million  up 12% compared to the prior year  as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering  as well as being impacted by inflation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Overall  Euroclear expects expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023 as a result of accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.The key operating metrics  shown below  underpinned the strong business performance during the period.Market volatility remains high  driving transaction volumes to record levels.Equity market valuations have fallen significantly during 2022 which has led to declines in assets under custody and fund asset under custody during the period.The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.Euroclear sees sustained demand for collateral management and lending services from a broad range of market participants as they seek to reduce credit risk in volatile financial market conditions.Q3 YTD 2022 Change vs Q3 YTD 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 34.9 trillion -3.5 % Number of Transactions 229 million +4.3 % Turnover EUR 791.8 trillion +8.1 % Fund Assets under Custody EUR 2.8 trillion -2.7 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.9 trillion +7.5 %In the third quarter  Euroclear outlined its updated strategic vision and targets to its investors. Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors.In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.Illustrating this strategic focus  Euroclear enhanced its offering in sustainable finance through an investment in Impact Cubed  a leading provider of ESG tech-enabled analytics and data science solutions. This investment complements Euroclear's investment in Greenomy  a provider of data and reporting for issuers to comply with EU sustainable finance legislation.International investor appetite for global market access as part of their diversified holdings remains robust and issuers continue to seek to benefit from an international investor base. Euroclear's strategic focus on meeting these demands continued to deliver growth  despite the headwinds resulting from the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Assets under custody from international and emerging markets were up 18% year-on-year to EUR 1.7 trillion.One year ago  Euroclear acquired MFEX as part of its expanded funds platform. Considerable progress has been made to integrate MFEX and enhance the group's end-to-end funds offering. This is reflected through the new MFEXbyEuroclear branding for all group funds solutions.Implications of Russian sanctionsThe sanctions imposed by the US  the EU  and other jurisdictions  as well as Russian countermeasures  resulted in a loss of Russia-related business income which was more than compensated by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of September  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨88.7 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 119.9 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested which  depending on the prevailing interest rates  results in interest income. Over the nine months  revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia was EUR 340 million.With the growth of sanctioned liabilities and the increase of interest rates  the materiality of revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia on the group's financial results is unprecedented. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate these earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board expects interest income to continue to grow materially as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate in a rising interest rate environment.As previously outlined  while this is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet  it should not result in material change in credit risk profile and therefore will not have a meaningful impact on the group's capital ratios.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by retaining any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer""Despite an extraordinary context  we continued to deliver an excellent business performance  with financial results above our strategic 'through-the-cycle"" targets.The group benefits from a diversified business model which allows us to focus on supporting clients through these uncertain times  providing robust infrastructure and fulfilling our duties with respect to the sanctions on Russia.Our results show that we are on the right path. We are now accelerating investments to deliver on our long-term strategy and drive value for all our stakeholders.""AnnexesInterest income is driven by the prevailing interest rates in each currency of the cash balances held by the group. As at 30 September 2022  cash balances totaled EUR 111.7 billion  of which EUR 85.8 billion related to the sanctions on Russia.The proportion of cash balances by currency is as follows:Cash balances related to Sanctions on Russia""Business as usual"" Cash BalancesEuroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

An increasing interest rate environment has impacted Euroclear Investment's intra-group loans (assets) recognised at fair market value in line with IFRS 9. Liabilities have not been impacted  due to being recognised at acquisitioncost  in line with accounting standards. As a result  Euroclear Investments demonstrates a significant loss on non-trading financialassets for Q3 2022 compared to Q3 2021  resulting in a negative operating profit.

The board therefore believes that it is important and in the interests of all shareholders that Tomas Hammargren has a personal long-term ownership commitment in Amplicon  which can be expected to contribute to an increased interest in Amplicon's operations and earnings development as well as increase the CEO's motivation and align interests with the Company and its shareholders.Therefore  the board of Emplicure  conditional on the approval of the general meeting  has decided to offer Tomas Hammargren to acquire shares in Amplicon according to the following conditions:Tomas Hammargren or a company wholly owned by Tomas Hammargren is offered to acquire 1 250 shares in Amplicon  corresponding to five percent of the total number of outstanding shares in Amplicon.The price for the shares amounts to a total of SEK 805 000  which corresponds to the board's assessment of the market value of the shares. The board's assessment is based on a valuation of Amplicon carried out by BDO on behalf of the Company.The transfer must be conditional on Emplicure and Tomas Hammargren entering into a customary shareholder agreement.The transfer requires the approval of the general meeting in Emplicure according to chapter 16 in the Companies Act. The board proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the transfer of shares in Amplicon to Thomas Hammargren or a company wholly owned by Thomas Hammargren on the terms stated above. For its validity  the resolution requires the support of shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Information at the Extraordinary General MeetingThe board of directors and the managing director shall  upon request by any shareholder and where the board of directors determines that it can be done without material harm to the Company  provide information of circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda.DocumentationDocuments according to the Swedish Companies Act will  where applicable  be held available at the Company's office with address Virdings all√© 32B  754 50 Uppsala no later than two weeks before the meeting  at the latest 31 October 2022.

Adjusted net profit rose by 25% to EUR 426 million.-Advertisement-Business income was up 7% to EUR 1 208 million  reflecting continued solid growth of Euroclear‚Äôs business lines. The diversification of the business has provided a hedge against market volatility over recent months. Interest  banking  and other income increased by 179% to EUR 182 million.Operating Expenses increased to EUR 811 million  up 12% compared to the prior year  as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering  as well as being impacted by inflation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Overall  Euroclear expects expenditure to remain above its ‚Äúthrough-the-cycle‚Äù target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023 as a result of accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.The key operating metrics  shown below  underpinned the strong business performance during the period.Market volatility remains high  driving transaction volumes to record levels.Equity market valuations have fallen significantly during 2022 which has led to declines in assets under custody and fund asset under custody during the period.The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group‚Äôs diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group‚Äôs business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.Euroclear sees sustained demand for collateral management and lending services from a broad range of market participants as they seek to reduce credit risk in volatile financial market conditions.Q3 YTD 2022 Change vs Q3 YTD 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 34.9 trillion -3.5 % Number of Transactions 229 million +4.3 % Turnover EUR 791.8 trillion +8.1 % Fund Assets under Custody EUR 2.8 trillion -2.7 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.9 trillion +7.5 %In the third quarter  Euroclear outlined its updated strategic vision and targets to its investors. Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors.-Advertisement-In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.Illustrating this strategic focus  Euroclear enhanced its offering in sustainable finance through an investment in Impact Cubed  a leading provider of ESG tech-enabled analytics and data science solutions. This investment complements Euroclear‚Äôs investment in Greenomy  a provider of data and reporting for issuers to comply with EU sustainable finance legislation.International investor appetite for global market access as part of their diversified holdings remains robust and issuers continue to seek to benefit from an international investor base. Euroclear‚Äôs strategic focus on meeting these demands continued to deliver growth  despite the headwinds resulting from the Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Assets under custody from international and emerging markets were up 18% year-on-year to EUR 1.7 trillion.One year ago  Euroclear acquired MFEX as part of its expanded funds platform. Considerable progress has been made to integrate MFEX and enhance the group‚Äôs end-to-end funds offering. This is reflected through the new MFEXbyEuroclear branding for all group funds solutions.Implications of Russian sanctionsThe sanctions imposed by the US  the EU  and other jurisdictions  as well as Russian countermeasures  resulted in a loss of Russia-related business income which was more than compensated by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of September  Euroclear Bank‚Äôs balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨88.7 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 119.9 billion.-Advertisement-As per Euroclear‚Äôs standard process  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested which  depending on the prevailing interest rates  results in interest income. Over the nine months  revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia was EUR 340 million.With the growth of sanctioned liabilities and the increase of interest rates  the materiality of revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia on the group‚Äôs financial results is unprecedented. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate these earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company‚Äôs performance and resources.The Board expects interest income to continue to grow materially as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate in a rising interest rate environment.As previously outlined  while this is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet  it should not result in material change in credit risk profile and therefore will not have a meaningful impact on the group‚Äôs capital ratios.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by retaining any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.-Advertisement-Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer‚ÄúDespite an extraordinary context  we continued to deliver an excellent business performance  with financial results above our strategic ‚Äòthrough-the-cycle‚Äù targets.The group benefits from a diversified business model which allows us to focus on supporting clients through these uncertain times  providing robust infrastructure and fulfilling our duties with respect to the sanctions on Russia.Our results show that we are on the right path. We are now accelerating investments to deliver on our long-term strategy and drive value for all our stakeholders.‚ÄùAnnexesInterest income is driven by the prevailing interest rates in each currency of the cash balances held by the group. As at 30 September 2022  cash balances totaled EUR 111.7 billion  of which EUR 85.8 billion related to the sanctions on Russia.The proportion of cash balances by currency is as follows:Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities. The summary income statements and financial positions at Q3 YTD for both entities are shown below.-Advertisement-Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Variance Euroclear Bank Income Statement Net interest income 550.9 69.3 481.6 Net fee and commission income 771.2 686.7 84.5 Other income -12.5 7.2 -19.7 Total operating income 1 309.6 763.2 546.4 Administrative expenses -485.2 -440.8 -44.4 Operating profit before impairment and taxation 824.4 322.4 502.0 Result for the period 618.4 244.2 374.3 Euroclear Bank Statement of Financial Position Shareholders‚Äô equity 2 424.2 1 924.7 499.5 Debt securities issued and funds borrowed (incl. subordinated debt) 5 191.8 6 869.7 -1 678.0 Total assets 119 887.7 31 209.1 88 678.6 Euroclear Investments Income Statement Dividend 313.4 540.1 -226.7 Net gains/(losses) on non trading financial assets at FVPL -473.6 -43.5 -430.1 Other income 2.9 1.4 1.6 Total operating income -157.3 498.0 -655.3 Administrative expenses -3.4 -1.1 -2.3 Operating profit before impairment and taxation -160.7 496.9 -657.6 Result for the period -42.9 507.3 -550.3 Euroclear Investments Statement of Financial Position Shareholders‚Äô equity 460.8 757.3 -296.6 Debt securities issued and funds borrowed 1 654.7 1 653.3 1.5 Total assets of which 2 116.0 2 449.1 -333.1 Loans and advances at amortised cost (excluding intercompany) 85.9 55.8 30.1 Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) financial assets 299.0 311.1 -12.1 Intercompany loans (at amortised cost and FVPL) 853.4 1 275.9 -422.5 Note: At the end of Q3  Euroclear Investments received a dividend from Euroclear SA which was more than offset by unrealised fairmarket valuation. An increasing interest rate environment has impacted Euroclear Investment‚Äôs intra-group loans (assets) recognised at fair market value in line with IFRS 9. Liabilities have not been impacted  due to being recognised at acquisitioncost  in line with accounting standards. As a result  Euroclear Investments demonstrates a significant loss on non-trading financialassets for Q3 2022 compared to Q3 2021  resulting in a negative operating profit. This accounting treatment has no impact onEuroclear group‚Äôs earnings capacity nor on the ability for Euroclear Investments to reimburse its debt.Note to editorsEuroclear group is the financial industry‚Äôs trusted provider of post trade services.

The shortlisted post-trade services providers have all experienced great years and achieved outstanding performance. Learn more about our shortlisted candidates below  including DTCC  Deutsche B√∂rse  Euronext  LCH and OSTTRA.DTCCEarlier this year  the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation‚Äôs (DTCC) went live with its distributed ledger technology (DLT) based settlement platform in a parallel production environment  processing up to 160 000 transactions per day. Named Project Ion  the platform has been in the works since May 2020  with a view to support a netted T+0 settlement cycle  as well as T+2  T+1 and extended cycles.Going live in parallel to existing settlement infrastructure  the project is processing an average of over 100 000 bilateral equity transactions per day  and almost 160 000 transactions on peak days. The Depository Trust Company‚Äôs (DTC) classic settlement systems remaining the authoritative record. Project ION has been developed in collaboration with the likes of BNY Mellon  Citi and JP Morgan.Elsewhere  DTCC Institutional Trade Processing (ITP) provides an open  post-trade infrastructure that aims to remove redundancies and manual processing across asset classes in an effort to create a place where users can manage the entire trade lifecycle  from post-execution to settlement  on one platform.Deutsche B√∂rseDeutsche B√∂rse Group‚Äôs clearing houses  Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG  act as central counterparties  i.e. as buyer to each seller and as seller to each buyer  to minimise credit default risk. The clearing houses offer efficient clearing of a wide range of transaction types  both on-exchange and over-the-counter (OTC).Deutsche B√∂rse recently acquired the North American Nodal Exchange by the EEX Group  adding a third clearing house  Nodal Clear  to its roster.Towards the end of last year  Deutsche B√∂rse rolled out a major technology overhaul with the launch of digital post-trade platform. The fully digital post-trade platform provides same-day-issuance and paperless  automated straight-through processing for the entire value chain of issuance  custody  settlement  and asset servicing for digital securities.Working with distributed ledger technology (DLT) specialist  Digital Asset  as a partner on the project  the German exchange group‚Äôs new initiative uses a cloud-backed and DLT-ready platform to enable the digitisation of financial products with continuing access to both existing central and distributed infrastructures and markets.EuronextEuronext serves as the largest pan-European exchange and market infrastructure  connecting seven markets across the continent. The last year has proved fruitful for the exchange with surging trading volumes alongside a series of successful acquisitions.In August  Euronext reported a particularly ‚Äòsolid‚Äô Q2 driven by the sustained dynamism of non-volume activities and of trading operations. The exchange reported a 14% increase in revenue and income in Q2 of this year  compared to the same period last year  which reached ‚Ç¨374.7 million ‚Äì driven by the growth of non-volume related business and trading activities.Non-volume related revenue accounted for 59% of Euronext‚Äôs Q2 total revenue this year  while trading revenue grew to ‚Ç¨129.2 million  a 15.6% increase compared to the same period last year ‚Äì a result linked to robust performance across all asset classes in a volatile market environment. Growth was also driven by the recent Borsa Italiana acquisition  which also bumped up the exchange‚Äôs strong Q1 results.Elsewhere  Euronext reported that net income  share of the parent company shareholders was up 37.2% to ‚Ç¨118.9 million  an increase by ‚Ç¨32.2 million compared to the same period last year.LCHGlobal clearing house LCH  which is part of the post-trade division of London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)  has had an impressive year with several revenue increases across its business. LCH continues to partner with market participants globally to offer clearing services and provide risk management capabilities across a range of asset classes  including OTC and listed interest rates  fixed income  FX  CDS  equities and commodities.The clearing house has helped reduce systemic risk and strengthen stability in financial markets alongside allowing participants to benefit from capital and operational efficiencies. In 2021  LSEG post-trade experienced improved revenue figures  with total income rising to ¬£483 million  which was an increase by 8.5% compared to 2022.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application...","Marketing authorisation in the European Economic Area anticipated in H1 2023LEIDEN  Netherlands  Oct. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib has been validated for scientific evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The application  submitted earlier in October 2022  is for the investigational drug  leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adolescents and adults 12 years or older.Pharming Group N.V. logoIn August 2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's CHMP. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the European Economic Area is anticipated in H1 2023.The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""EMA's validation for review of our MAA under an accelerated assessment pathway highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advance leniolisib as a targeted treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with APDS. We anticipate that leniolisib will fill an unmet need for patients with APDS  who currently rely on supportive therapies to treat their primary symptoms. This review constitutes a key milestone in Pharming's effort to give healthcare providers and their patients global access to leniolisib. We look forward to collaborating with EMA as needed throughout the regulatory process.""Story continuesAbout Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Aut‚Ä¶","Marketing authorisation in the European Economic Area anticipated in H1 2023LEIDEN  Netherlands  Oct. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib has been validated for scientific evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The application  submitted earlier in October 2022  is for the investigational drug  leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adolescents and adults 12 years or older.In August 2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's CHMP. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the European Economic Area is anticipated in H1 2023.The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""EMA's validation for review of our MAA under an accelerated assessment pathway highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advance leniolisib as a targeted treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with APDS. We anticipate that leniolisib will fill an unmet need for patients with APDS  who currently rely on supportive therapies to treat their primary symptoms. This review constitutes a key milestone in Pharming's effort to give healthcare providers and their patients global access to leniolisib. We look forward to collaborating with EMA as needed throughout the regulatory process.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The strong performance of our professional business compensated lower consumer demand and the continued slowdown in China. We managed to improve profitability compared to the second quarter despite the impact of energy costs and currency movements. As expected  our free cash flow generation strengthened  driven by improved profitability and the stabilization of our working capital. Given the uncertain near-term outlook  the continued softness of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. Regarding the adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow  we are targeting the lower end of both guidance ranges ‚Äù said CEO Eric Rondolat.‚ÄúAs we enter the final quarter of 2022  we have shifted gears to adapt the company to a structurally weaker external environment in the coming quarters  when current headwinds and volatility are likely to persist. We will therefore focus on measures to control costs and cash flow  in line with our track record of delivering margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation in difficult environments. While some areas will be more affected  connected energy efficient lighting solutions will continue to benefit from strong demand given the energy prices surge.‚ÄùStory continuesBrighter Lives  Better World 2025In the third quarter of the year  Signify continued to deliver on its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Double the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track  mainly driven by energy-efficient and connected LED lightingDouble Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues were at 30% and on track. This positive trend is driven by serviceable and circular luminairesDouble Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues increased to 28%  mainly driven by the Safety & security and consumer well-being portfoliosDouble the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 27%  stable with Q2. Signify continued to create action plans to address gaps and accelerate its progress. In addition  Signify published its first-ever Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion report.OutlookGiven the uncertain near-term outlook and the continued softness both of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. We are targeting the lower end of the range for both the 11.0-11.4% Adjusted EBITA margin guidance and the 5-7% free cash flow guidance.Financial reviewThird quarter Nine months 2021 2022 change in millions of EUR  except percentages 2021 2022 change 4.3 % Comparable sales growth 5.3 % 8.1 % Effects of currency movements 6.6 % 4.0 % Consolidation and other changes 2.2 % 1 643 1 912 16.3 % Sales 4 852 5 536 14.1 % 634 713 12.6 % Adjusted gross margin 1 909 2 072 8.6 % 38.6% 37.3% Adj. gross margin (as % of sales) 39.3% 37.4% -415 -471 Adj.

Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 8.1%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD  and a positive effect of 4.0% from the Q2 acquisitions of Fluence and Pierlite.The Adjusted gross margin decreased by 130 bps to 37.3%. While continued price increases more than offset the input cost increases and the surge in energy costs  the Adjusted gross margin was impacted by an adverse currency effect. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 80 bps to 28.6%  driven by operating leverage and strengthened cost discipline.Adjusted EBITA was EUR 199 million  up 9.1% vs. Q3 2021. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 70 bps to 10.4%  with price increases more than offsetting higher input costs. Yet  the Adjusted EBITA margin was negatively affected by a 220bps currency effect  being the combination both from the weakening of the EUR versus the USD and CNY  and from a temporary FX hedging headwind. Excluding this temporary adverse hedging effect  the Adjusted EBITA margin was stable vs Q3 21.Adjusted items were EUR -6 million. Restructuring costs decreased year on year to EUR -6 million  while acquisition-related charges of EUR -10 million were fully compensated by incidental items of EUR 10 million. The incidental items benefited from a release of tax indemnification liabilities. Net income increased by 18.4% from EUR 94 million to EUR 112 million.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 37 069 at the end of Q3 21 to 34 273 at the end of Q3 22. The employee base was exceptionally high in Q3 21  due to the strong volume recovery and additional staff requirements in factories  following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.1 This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

Given the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the steps taken by the Company  the suspension of the listing of the Company's shares (ISIN: FR0010879056) is maintained until further notice.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the ‚Äúmicrobial dark matter‚Äù. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['DEINOVE REQUESTS RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDINGS', 'proc√©dure de redressement judiciaire', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'employee representative bodies', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'Montpellier Commercial Court', 'urgent, global challenge', 'best possible conditions', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'English French', 'antibiotic resistance', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'd√©claration', 'business activity', 'recovery plan', 'sale plan', 'current activities', 'observation period', 'financial markets', 'press release', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'The Company', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'receivership proceedings', 'DEINOVE', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'declaration', 'cessation', 'payments', 'paiements', 'request', 'advance', 'purpose', 'solutions', 'employment', 'liabilities', 'process', 'investors', 'framework', 'way', 'continuation', 'decision', 'listing', 'shares', 'October', 'opening', 'trading', 'publication', 'notice', 'uncertainty', 'outcome', 'steps', 'suspension', 'ISIN', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '9']",2022-10-28,2022-10-28,globenewswire.com

Organic growth was 8.7%. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 7.3%.The 8.7% organic revenue growth was notably led by a strong performance in Buildings & Infrastructure (+11.0% in Q3)  Industry (+10.6% in Q3)  Marine & Offshore (+9.7%)  as well as Agri-Food & Commodities (+9.6%) in Q3. The diversity of Bureau Veritas portfolio  its solid sales pipeline and its leadership in terms of Sustainability and ESG solutions  position Bureau Veritas well to grow in a sustained manner in the medium term. Around 55% of Bureau Veritas sales  in the first 9-month of the year  are related to Sustainability through the BV Green Line of services & solutions.By geography  activities in the Americas strongly outperformed the rest of Bureau Veritas (29% of revenue; up 15.0% organically)  led by a 9.5% increase in North America (Buildings & Infrastructure driven) and by a 25.3% increase in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). The activity in Asia Pacific (31% of revenue; up 4.6% organically) benefited from robust growth in Australia as well as strong growth in South-East Asian countries (notably Vietnam). Europe (31% of revenue) delivered homogeneous growth across the board; up 6.0% organically  with above-average performance in Italy and France  notably. Finally  in Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue)  business increased by 16.2% on an organic basis  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 1.3%  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized since the beginning of 2022  alongside those of the prior year.Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 7.0%  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies.2022 outlook confirmed:Based on the year-to-date performance  the significant growth opportunities related to its sustainabilityrange of services and solutions  and excluding the full-year impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns in China Bureau Veritas still expects for 2022 to:Achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;Improve the adjusted operating margin;Generate sustained strong cash flow  with a cash conversion above 90%.For more information: https://group.bureauveritas.comConstantia Flexibles‚Äî9 months total growth of +31.6%  with record organic growth of 23.7% mainly driven by price increases but also through volume growth and mix improvement(Full consolidation)Sales in the first nine months of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨1 537.9 million  up +23.7% on an organic basis with strong performance across both markets  Consumer and Pharma both posted above 20% organic growth. Sales are up +31.6% in total over the period  driven mostly by necessary price increases enabling to compensate for the inflationary input costs pressure. Since the start of the year  despite raw material shortages  Constantia has experienced an encouraging return to market share gains  thereby confirming the good momentum instilled by the new management team‚Äôs commercial initiatives. The market in India remains challenging and management is rolling out successfully the ‚ÄúRestoring Success program‚Äù to return to profitability whilst reviewing various strategic options for this division.Year-to-date activity also benefited from the acquisition of Propak in June 2021 and FFP Packaging Solutions in August 2022 (impact of +4.0%). Foreign exchange had a +4.0% positive impact on sales.Constantia is carefully managing the inflationary cost environment as well as the availability of energy supply and raw materials. The Company is focusing its efforts on preserving the profitability working both on the passthrough of input costs as well as pursuing its cost control program. Constantia is also actively working on its supply base and energy supply sources in the context of a potential shortage of gas in Europe in the coming months.In August 2022  Constantia Flexibles has signed an agreement  to acquire 100% of FFP Packaging Solutions  a leading player for sustainable  flexible packaging in the film consumer market from Northampton  UK. This acquisition aligns well with Vision 2025 growth strategy of investing in competitive businesses with potential for future growth. FFP Packaging Solutions joining the Constantia Flexibles Group will expand its overall market position. Its significant experience and credibility allow for strong relationships across the UK food industry. The transaction closed in August.Stahl‚ÄîSales up 11.5% with organic growth of 7.8% mostly driven by price increases to offset input cost inflation(Full consolidation)Stahl  the world leader in coating layers and surface treatments for flexible materials  posted total sales of ‚Ç¨696.4 million in the first nine months of 2022  representing an increase of +11.5% over the period. Organic growth stood at +7.8% while FX contributed positively (+3.7%)  mostly through USD strengthening.Activity for the period is above expectations at group level  with a strong growth in Coatings and Leather over the past nine months. Growth was largely led by price/mix effects as volumes declined  notably due to (i) slowdown in certain end markets  (ii) China lockdowns and (iii) continued supply disruptions in automotive.Across all segments  price increases have been implemented since the beginning of the year to mitigate the strong impact of rising input costs. The company has taken and is ready to take additional measures to protect its margin where needed. Stahl‚Äôs management continues to closely monitor the inflationary environment  as well as the supply chain and potential energy disruptions.The order book slightly decreased following the strong commercial activity in H1 2022 but remains at high levels compared to historical standards.Stahl announced on July 5  2022  the submission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target  aligned with the most recent guidance provided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).Stahl‚Äôs SBTi submission includes a specific commitment regarding the company‚Äôs Scope 3 upstream emissions  which Stahl aims to reduce by at least 25% over the next 10 years  compared with the base year (2021). Stahl‚Äôs Scope 3 emissions currently represent over 90% of its carbon footprint. This reduction would primarily be achieved by Stahl replacing its fossil-based raw materials with lower-carbon alternatives. The target is a major step towards the objective of limiting global warming temperature increase to 1.5 ¬∞C above pre-industrial levels by 2050  as agreed at the 2015 Paris Climate Accords.Stahl‚Äôs extended commitment builds on the company‚Äôs existing targets to reduce its emission for Scopes 1 and 2  which were set shortly after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Stahl has since reduced its Scope 1 and 2 (direct) GHG emissions by more than 30%  thanks to operational efficiency gains and by decarbonizing its energy supply.In September 2022  Stahl has been awarded the highest EcoVadis Platinum rating  placing it within the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis. The award underlines Stahl‚Äôs commitment to collaborating with its partners to reduce its environmental impact and build a more responsible and transparent supply chain.Crisis Prevention Institute‚Äî9 months revenue growth of +16.1% as compared with 2021  +17.7% organically(Full consolidation since March 11  2022)Crisis Prevention Institute recorded revenue of $88.8 million in the first nine months of 2022  up +16.1% in total compared to the same period in 2021 and +17.7% organically. Foreign exchange impact was -1.6%. This performance reflects several factors:The return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù business conditions has made it easier for customers  particularly for schools and hospitals  to prioritize and schedule training  allowing Certified Instructors to conduct internal training;The success of new program launches  including specialty topics such as Trauma  Autism  and Advanced Physical Skills  which now collectively represent more than 20% of Initial Certifications for the first nine months;The international expansion strategy outside of North America  notably in English-speaking countries  with a growth rate of nearly +23%;A continued mix shift toward digital solutions for both new CIs and renewals  which supplement required in-person training components of programs. Virtual Learner Materials continue to comprise a strong share of overall delivery  accounting for 44% of total Learner Materials sales.During the quarter  CPI‚Äôs President Susan Driscoll and J√©r√¥me Richard  Operating Partner at Wendel  were added to the CPI Board. Susan Driscoll has held multiple executive positions across training and education businesses over the course of her career  including serving as President of the professional and education and nurse learning divisions during her seven-year tenure at Wolters Kluwer Health. Susan has served as President of Crisis Prevention Institute since 2017.ACAMS‚ÄìStrong year-to-date performance for ACAMS  with reported revenue3 up +7.8% and +17.8% pro forma for conference timing. Carve-out process on track.(Full consolidation since March 11  2022)On March 10  2022  Wendel acquired ACAMS  a global leader in training and certifications for anti-financial crime prevention professionals. ACAMS‚Äôs separation from its prior parent company is on schedule and expected to be fully completed early 2023.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  ACAMS reported revenue of $69.5 million4 up +7.8% vs. the same period in 2021. Organic growth for these first nine months was +8.0%  and the impact of foreign exchange was -0.3%. ACAMS‚Äôs flagship Las Vegas conference  the largest organized by ACAMS  was held in October 2022  one month later than that of the prior year in September 2021  skewing the year-over-year comparison. Normalized for the timing of this event  pro forma growth over the first 9 months would have been +17.8%.The pro forma revenue growth was driven by post-COVID conference recovery and greater sales of Certifications  Memberships and Training  primarily a result of sales to larger enterprise customers. Revenue growth should ease and return to more normative levels for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.Tarkett‚ÄìQ3 turnover growth driven by solid performance in Sports and sales price increases(Accounted for by the equity method since 07.07.2021)The company reported its Q3 2022 sales on October 25  2022.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Aut‚Ä¶","Marketing authorisation in the European Economic Area anticipated in H1 2023LEIDEN  Netherlands  Oct. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM /Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib has been validated for scientific evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The application  submitted earlier in October 2022  is for the investigational drug  leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adolescents and adults 12 years or older.In August 2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's CHMP. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the European Economic Area is anticipated in H1 2023.The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""EMA's validation for review of our MAA under an accelerated assessment pathway highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advance leniolisib as a targeted treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with APDS. We anticipate that leniolisib will fill an unmet need for patients with APDS  who currently rely on supportive therapies to treat their primary symptoms. This review constitutes a key milestone in Pharming's effort to give healthcare providers and their patients global access to leniolisib. We look forward to collaborating with EMA as needed throughout the regulatory process.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

This is the first time in five years that SATO is investing in new homes in the city.Despite the uncertainty in the market  SATO has succeeded in improving the occupancy rate.Summary for 1 July to 30 September 2022 (1 July to 30 September 2021)The economic occupancy rate in Finland was 95. 6 % (9 5 . 1 ).Net sales totalled EUR 7 2 . 6 million (7 4 . 9 ).Net rental income was EUR 5 4 . 0 million ( 57 .3) .Profit before taxes was EUR 38 . 4 million ( 40.5 ).The unrealised change in the fair value of investment properties included in the result was EUR 2. 9 million ( 2 . 4 ).Housing investments amounted to EUR 5 3 . 6 million ( 57 . 3 ) .Earnings per share were EUR 0.5 4 (0. 5 7).A total of 1 rental apartments (0)  0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 Flex Homes (0) were acquired or completed.President and CEO Antti Aarnio:During the period under review (1 July to 30 September 2022)  SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate improved and was 95.6% (95.1). Demand for rental homes picked up from the early months of the year  and the higher occupancy rate has mainly been attributable to growth in service consumption and the consequent improvement in service-sector employment rate as well as to upper secondary education resuming contact teaching. Economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in particular  the continued high level of new housing production has sustained intense competition for good tenants. Due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer increasing maintenance costs in full to apartment rents.With the choice available for those looking for a home growing  a successful customer experience plays an important role. SATO is investing strongly in its operations in 24/7 digital services and in presence close to customers.In August  SATO signed a contract under which we buy an apartment building from builders Lujatalo constructed in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental homes. This is the first time in five years that SATO is investing in new homes in the city. Construction started in August and the homes will be move-in ready in late October 2023.SATO is developing 257 new rental homes in the Finnoo district of Espoo  close to the new metro station. Construction started in August 2022 and the homes will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. Peijinkuja project is grounded in long-running development efforts where  together with the City of Espoo  we drafted a new local detailed plan for the terraced house property owned by SATO in the old Hannus area of detached houses that is now on its way to become the new Finnoo district of Espoo.In September  we published our Sustainability Programme for 2023‚àí2026. The programme is themed on sustainable housing  wellbeing in communities and sustainable profitability. We aim to be a forerunner in sustainable rental housing. SATO‚Äôs new Sustainability Programme is based on an analysis  conducted with stakeholders  of the elements of sustainability that are perceived to be the most important. The Sustainability Programme and its targets will serve as guidance in both day-to-day decision-making and more long-term development efforts.I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Story continuesOperating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO‚Äôs operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  the constant rise in costs and  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  the continued high level of rental housing supply.Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine that started in February is still continuing and has made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain and accelerated inflation. Exceptionally high inflation has forced central banks to respond to the situation by making rapid interest rate hikes. In September  the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the key interest rates by 75 basis points to 1.25%. The previous hike took place in July and was 50 basis points. The war in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty is eroding consumer confidence. Consumer confidence has remained at a very low level already since the spring and is dampening private consumption.In particular the surge in energy and food prices coinciding with climbing interest rates will reverse economic growth towards the end of the year. According to the Bank of Finland forecast of 15 September 2022  Finland‚Äôs economy is projected to grow by 2.2% this year following a robust start to the current year but then decline to 0.3% next year. The outlook is highly uncertain  but the forecast anticipates that the upward trend in prices will subside in late 2023 and the economy will resume slow growth in 2024.The record-high rate of construction seen for a long period of time will slow due to the economic uncertainty. Sales volumes of both new and old homes have decreased. Statistics published by the Federation of Real Estate Agency in August show a decrease in sales volumes of new and old homes compared with the figures reported for the spring and early summer. The figure was down by 21% compared with July 2021. According to data released by Statistics Finland in August  there was a 35% year-on-year decrease in building permits granted and a 12% year-on-year decrease in building projects started in Q2 of 2022. The number of residential units to be completed  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  will  however  remain at a high level during the rest of 2022 as well as throughout 2023  maintaining intense competition for tenants.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental homes and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Outside growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes home ownership in a growth centre even more challenging for people coming from those areas.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2022 (1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2021)Net sales and profitIn January‚ÄìSeptember 2022  SATO Corporation‚Äôs consolidated net sales totalled EUR 219.8 million (223.2).Operating profit was EUR 217.0 million (245.4).

The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war‚Äôs biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food and materials as well as in supply chains. The surge in prices has resulted in a rapid increase in the interest rate level. The increase in energy  food and consumer goods prices may slow economic growth  continue to considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company issued an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio.SATO currently has 522 apartments in St Petersburg. Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. SATO has made a decision in principle to exit the business in Russia. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has looked into opportunities to exit the business in Russia. According to the explorations  a speedy exit has not been possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent out the homes in St Petersburg for the time being until an exit method is found. The company is actively seeking a solution. There are risks related to the business environment in our St Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk  with related hedging options examined in accordance with our treasury policy. It is expected that the operating environment in Russia will be highly uncertain for a long period of time and could result in disruptions to SATO's business activities in Russia and with parties related to business in Russia. It may impact the ability of SATO to make payments to its suppliers  employees and authorities as well as receive payments from its customers  which could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on SATO's business in Russia and even result in SATO limiting or ceasing its operations in Russia and with parties related to Russia for a long period of time. Should the war in Ukraine be prolonged  carrying out business in Russia may have negative impacts on the company‚Äôs reputation and may hamper business in Finland or have adverse effects on the company‚Äôs ability to access finance in the market  which may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  financial costs or value of SATO-owned properties.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group‚Äôs website and Annual Report for 2021 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level.Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine that started in February is still continuing and has made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain and accelerated inflation. Exceptionally high inflation has forced central banks to respond to the situation by making rapid interest rate hikes. In September  the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the key interest rates by 75 basis points to 1.25%. The previous hike took place in July and was 50 basis points. The war in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty is eroding consumer confidence. Consumer confidence has remained at a very low level already since the spring and is dampening private consumption.In particular the surge in energy and food prices coinciding with climbing interest rates will reverse economic growth towards the end of the year. According to the Bank of Finland forecast of 15 September 2022  Finland‚Äôs economy is projected to grow by 2.2% this year following a robust start to the current year but then decline to 0.3% next year. The outlook is highly uncertain  but the forecast anticipates that the upward trend in prices will subside in late 2023 and the economy will resume slow growth in 2024.The surge in energy prices has a direct impact on the company‚Äôs profitability  as it is currently not possible to transfer costs in full directly to rents due to the intense competitive situation.The record-high rate of construction seen for a long period of time will slow due to the economic uncertainty. Sales volumes of both new and old homes have decreased. Statistics published by the Federation of Real Estate Agency in August show a decrease in sales volumes of new and old homes compared with the figures reported for the spring and early summer. The figure was down by 21% compared with July 2021. According to data released by Statistics Finland in August  there was a 35% year-on-year decrease in building permits granted and a 12% year-on-year decrease in building projects started in Q2 of 2022. The number of residential units to be completed  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  will  however  remain at a high level during the rest of 2022 as well as throughout 2023  maintaining intense competition for tenants. The improved service-sector employment rate and the resumption of contact teaching in upper secondary education have resulted in demand for rental homes picking up  which is reflected in an improved occupancy rate. The economic uncertainty  pressure for interest rate hikes and increases in consumer prices have also been in part reflected in increased demand for rental homes.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants and was reflected over the period under review in SATO‚Äôs business as a slight decrease in average rents year on year. With greater choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.SATO Corporation‚Äôs shareholders on 30 September 2022Largest shareholders and their holdingsno. of shares % Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder) 31 971 535 56.3%Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool 12 811 647 22.6%Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company 7 233 081 12.7%State Pension Fund of Finland 2 796 200 4.9%Valkila Erkka 385 000 0.7%SATO Corporation 166 000 0.3%Entel√§ Tuula 159 000 0.3%Heinonen Erkki 146 684 0.3%Tradeka-invest Ltd 126 500 0.2%Others (118 shareholders) 987 420 1.7%On 30 September 2022  SATO had 56 783 067 shares and 127 shareholders registered in the book-entry system.

The strong performance of our professional business compensated lower consumer demand and the continued slowdown in China. We managed to improve profitability compared to the second quarter despite the impact of energy costs and currency movements. As expected  our free cash flow generation strengthened  driven by improved profitability and the stabilization of our working capital. Given the uncertain near-term outlook  the continued softness of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. Regarding the adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow  we are targeting the lower end of both guidance ranges ‚Äù said CEO Eric Rondolat.‚ÄúAs we enter the final quarter of 2022  we have shifted gears to adapt the company to a structurally weaker external environment in the coming quarters  when current headwinds and volatility are likely to persist. We will therefore focus on measures to control costs and cash flow  in line with our track record of delivering margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation in difficult environments. While some areas will be more affected  connected energy efficient lighting solutions will continue to benefit from strong demand given the energy prices surge.‚ÄùBrighter Lives  Better World 2025In the third quarter of the year  Signify continued to deliver on its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Double the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track  mainly driven by energy-efficient and connected LED lightingDouble Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues were at 30% and on track. This positive trend is driven by serviceable and circular luminairesDouble Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues increased to 28%  mainly driven by the Safety & security and consumer well-being portfoliosDouble the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 27%  stable with Q2. Signify continued to create action plans to address gaps and accelerate its progress. In addition  Signify published its first-ever Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion report.OutlookGiven the uncertain near-term outlook and the continued softness both of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. We are targeting the lower end of the range for both the 11.0-11.4% Adjusted EBITA margin guidance and the 5-7% free cash flow guidance.Financial reviewThird quarter Nine months 2021 2022 change in millions of EUR  except percentages 2021 2022 change 4.3 % Comparable sales growth 5.3 % 8.1 % Effects of currency movements 6.6 % 4.0 % Consolidation and other changes 2.2 % 1 643 1 912 16.3 % Sales 4 852 5 536 14.1 % 634 713 12.6 % Adjusted gross margin 1 909 2 072 8.6 % 38.6% 37.3% Adj. gross margin (as % of sales) 39.3% 37.4% -415 -471 Adj.

Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 8.1%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD  and a positive effect of 4.0% from the Q2 acquisitions of Fluence and Pierlite.The Adjusted gross margin decreased by 130 bps to 37.3%. While continued price increases more than offset the input cost increases and the surge in energy costs  the Adjusted gross margin was impacted by an adverse currency effect. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 80 bps to 28.6%  driven by operating leverage and strengthened cost discipline.Adjusted EBITA was EUR 199 million  up 9.1% vs. Q3 2021. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 70 bps to 10.4%  with price increases more than offsetting higher input costs. Yet  the Adjusted EBITA margin was negatively affected by a 220bps currency effect  being the combination both from the weakening of the EUR versus the USD and CNY  and from a temporary FX hedging headwind. Excluding this temporary adverse hedging effect  the Adjusted EBITA margin was stable vs Q3 21.Adjusted items were EUR -6 million. Restructuring costs decreased year on year to EUR -6 million  while acquisition-related charges of EUR -10 million were fully compensated by incidental items of EUR 10 million. The incidental items benefited from a release of tax indemnification liabilities. Net income increased by 18.4% from EUR 94 million to EUR 112 million.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 37 069 at the end of Q3 21 to 34 273 at the end of Q3 22. The employee base was exceptionally high in Q3 21  due to the strong volume recovery and additional staff requirements in factories  following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.1 This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

(NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30  2022. Further details can be found in the supplemental presentation accompanying this release and published in the investor relations section of our website.Record backlog of $2 254.1 million (+104% versus prior year) is our eighth consecutive record backlog quarter  surpassing $2 billion for the first time in our historyRecord sales of $412.1 million (+25.5% versus prior year) including foreign exchange headwinds and project timing movementsRecord reported gross margin of $104.6 million (+39.7% versus prior year) reflected volume  pricing  productivity and cost control actions and resulted in reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4%  the highest since the first quarter of 2021 (adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales of 27.3%)Record reported operating income of $41.7 million (+202.2% versus prior year) contributed to record reported non-diluted earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS)‚Äù of $1.15 and record adjusted non-diluted EPS of $1.49Reported 10.1% operating income as a percent of sales (adjusted 12.6%) was our highest since the third quarter 2020 and including this quarter has only been achieved four times in ten yearsThird quarter 2022 orders of $729.4 million  including 71 orders each over $1 million  a 108% increase compared to the third quarter 2021Received Full Notice to Proceed (‚ÄúFNTP‚Äù) on Venture Global Plaquemine‚Äôs Phase 2 Big LNG project  resulting in a third quarter order of $91.8 millionInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (‚ÄúIRA‚Äù) continues to accelerate commercial activity  thereby increasing our estimated total addressable market (‚ÄúTAM‚Äù) for Specialty Products in the near-term to $9.65 billion (prior was $7.65 billion) and 2030 TAM to $49.25 billion (prior was $42.0 billion)2022 full-year sales guidance range of $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion (prior guidance of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion); associated 2022 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance is in the range of $5.00 to $5.25 (prior guidance of $5.20 to 5.60) on 35.87 million shares outstanding (prior 35.86 million shares) and a tax rate of 17% (prior tax rate of 20%)2023 full-year sales outlook range of $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion; associated 2023 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS outlook is in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 on 35.87 million shares outstanding and a tax rate of 19%Story continuesThird quarter 2022 was all-time record backlog  sales  reported gross margin  reported operating income  reported non-diluted EPS and adjusted non-diluted EPS  amongst numerous other historical records within the business.Our third quarter 2022 orders of $729.4 million (second highest in our history with our top three quarters all occurring in 2022) contributed to our eighth consecutive quarter of record backlog ($2 254.1 million); backlog is 104% higher than one year ago and sequentially 15% higher than the second quarter 2022  which was our highest order quarter in our history. Both Heat Transfer Systems (‚ÄúHTS‚Äù) and Specialty Products have record backlogs as of the third quarter 2022. Additionally  all three of quarters in 2022 to date have had book-to-bill ratios above 1.8  which is a contributor to our outlook for 2023 sales to grow between 23% and 30% year-over-year over.We posted record sales of $412.1 million (an increase of 25.5% versus prior year) in the quarter  which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange (‚ÄúFX‚Äù) headwinds primarily in our Cryo Tank Solutions (‚ÄúCTS‚Äù) segment and as is typical between quarters  project timing movements related to liquefaction projects in Specialty Products. We estimate that foreign exchange headwinds had a $17 million negative impact on sales  with the U.S. dollar appreciating versus the Euro and the Indian Rupee. Note that we do not addback or adjust for foreign exchange impacts in our adjusted EPS. In addition to our total record sales  we set sales records in the quarter for mobile equipment  brazed aluminum heat exchangers  systems  space exploration  L.A. Turbine‚Äôs aftermarket and VRV.Third quarter 2022 reported gross margin of $104.6 million was the highest in our history and 39.7% higher than the third quarter 2021  reflecting our increasing positive margin mix  pricing actions taken  productivity and cost control. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4% was the highest since the second quarter of 2021  and when adjusted for one-time items including restructuring and start and capacity expansion costs was 27.3%; three of our four segments reported gross margin as a percent of sales increased by more than 170 basis points sequentially compared to the second quarter 2022 with HTS increasing 720 basis points. This contributed to record reported operating income of $41.7 million  an increase of 202.2% compared to the third quarter 2021 and when adjusted for one-time items such as deal-related costs and restructuring  record adjusted operating income of $51.9 million. The third quarter 2022 was only the fourth time in the past decade that we had reported operating income as a percent of sales of 10.1% (adjusted 12.6%). HTS also had record operating income and operating income as a percent of sales in the quarter.Third quarter 2022 reported non-diluted EPS of $1.15 is a historical record and reflects the ongoing efforts of our global flexible manufacturing footprint to optimize ‚Äúwhere we make what‚Äù; when adjusted for one-time items primarily related to deal costs  year-one integrations and organic startup & capacity expenses  our adjusted non-diluted EPS is $1.49  also a record. As noted above  we did not addback the negative impact to sales or EPS from FX rate changes and we anticipate that these will continue to be variable in the coming quarters. We estimate the third quarter 2022 impact from the foreign exchange rate changes to be approximately net negative $0.06 to EPS (net of translation and transaction).Macro tailwinds are bolstering demand for multiple solutions in our portfolio; including energy security & access (LNG) and government actions such as the IRA (accelerating activity in Specialty Products).Macro TailwindsEnergy security  resiliency  access and independence continues to be a priority for countries around the world  with meaningful focus on Europe. This has been further heightened as winter nears  as well as the supply-demand linkage of available LNG. It is anticipated that gas demand increases each year globally between now and 2035  and in turn  more LNG supply capacity is anticipated to move to Final Investment Decision (‚ÄúFID‚Äù) and construction this decade. Additionally  United States rig count is at pre-pandemic levels  and we are seeing an increase in air cooler equipment sales.As we stated at the end of the second quarter 2022  and we reiterate now  the increase in immediacy for energy security has not come at the expense of the clean energy transition ‚Äì rather there is a heightened focus on all energy. Additionally  the third quarter 2022 brought further tailwinds to many of the end markets we serve with our Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢ - clean power  clean water  clean food and clean industrials. One such tailwind was the passing of the IRA in August 2022  which approved $300 billion in spending for energy and climate change  with multiple areas of the IRA directly supporting investments being made by our customers in hydrogen  carbon capture  water  and industrial manufacturing. And hydrogen is not only limited to commercialization as the result of the IRA ‚Äì global funding commitments to 2030 now total $240 billion  up approximately 50% from a year ago  and cover the European Union and 22 other countries.In addition to the IRA  CO2 shortage continues to drive global interest in carbon capture solutions from small-scale (Chart‚Äôs Earthly Labs small-scale CiCi solution) to large industrial scale (Chart‚Äôs SES cryogenic carbon capture solution) and this 30% shortage is expected to continue with further permanent reductions in availability  thereby making CO2 recovery more important to the resolution of this challenge  as well as being a key part of the carbon emission reduction public and private sector targets.In summary  in the $729.4 million of orders booked in the third quarter 2022 there were 71 orders greater than $1 million each  bringing the year-to-date number to 197. Year-to-date through September 30  2022  individual orders each greater than $1 million grew 29.6% compared to the same period in 2021 and is at 87% of the full year 2021.In addition to our commercial pipeline for potential orders in the next 24 months being over $9.5 billion in active  various stage discussions  we have continued to see broad-based demand in October 2022 to start the fourth quarter. Month-to-date as of October 26  2022  we have received 17 orders each greater than $1 million dollars; of these larger orders  the range was wide ‚Äì from two multi-million dollar space exploration orders to regas to a refurbishment of a cold box  to multiple air cooler orders  to LNG fueling stations to a large bulk tank order for an industrial gas customer and a $3 million water treatment order.LNG  LNG  LNG.As winter approaches  in particular in the European Union  energy security and access are creating new and more imminent LNG opportunities  resulting in the continued increase in the four categories of LNG that we serve:Big LNG: In the third quarter 2022  we received FNTP on the remaining 12 cold box systems for Venture Global Plaquemines Phase 2 LNG export project. The third quarter order totaled $91.8 million  bringing our year-to-date Big LNG related orders to $620.7 million. Additionally  we have seen incremental increases to our potential future Big LNG orders since February 2022  driven by more international interest in modular mid-scale terminals  interest in our heavy hydrocarbon (‚ÄúHHC‚Äù) removal and nitrogen-rejection unit (‚ÄúNRU‚Äù) capabilities and more projects intending to move to FID. Currently our ‚Äúnot yet booked‚Äù commercial opportunities for Big LNG total $5.68 billion  inclusive of retrofit; this is an increase to our pipeline since the end of the second quarter 2022 of $330 million  even after booking another $91.8 million related to the Venture Global Plaquemines 2 project in the third quarter 2022. Small-scale and floating LNG: We received commitments from three customers for small-scale and floating liquefaction projects in the third quarter  totaling $175 million. Even considering these orders  our commercial pipeline continues to grow for this category of LNG (318 potential projects globally)  with floating LNG opportunities at their all-time high. LNG infrastructure: We sell various equipment into the LNG infrastructure end-market and continue to see demand for fueling stations (12 ordered in the third quarter 2022)  regas systems  and other related tanks and trailers. ISO containers had record demand in the third quarter 2022  with 226 units sold. We had two regas orders in the quarter and growth in our vehicle fueling stations business compared to the third quarter 2021. And while year-to-date 2022 demand for HLNG over-the-road vehicle tanks has been meaningfully weaker than the same period in 2021  we saw a nearly 200% increase sequentially from the second quarter 2022 in these orders. LNG retrofits  refurbishments  repairs: We continue to see orders related to modifications and extensions of regas stations  with orders in the third quarter 2022 from Italgas. Additionally  we are receiving inbound requests for retrofits and refurbishments as well as expansions of brownfield facilities. This trend is expected to continue  in particular as timing of construction of new builds does not address the immediate need for additional gas supply  and numerous customers are looking for long-term lifecycle services more so than previously.IRA accelerating activity in Specialty Products.The IRA in the United States is accelerating activity in our business in key areas that benefit within the IRA  including carbon capture  hydrogen  fuel refueling  water and industrial facilities. We believe that the IRA will accelerate certain investments and purchases from our customers in carbon capture and storage (‚ÄúCCUS‚Äù)  hydrogen and water in particular. In the third quarter 2022  Specialty Products orders were $202.9 million  our second consecutive quarter with Specialty Products orders above $200 million  and bringing year-to-date to $569.1 million  over 88% of the full year 2021 Specialty Products orders. With seven consecutive quarters having Specialty Products orders greater than $100 million each  the business is proving to be a consistent and increasing contributor to our overall growth.Hydrogen orders of $102.4 million in the third quarter 2022 included a large hydrogen liquefaction order from a North American customer bringing our year-to-date 2022 hydrogen related orders above our full year 2021 of $282.1 million. Additionally  the same customer has signed a letter of intent (not booked as an order or in backlog) with Chart for process and equipment for the additional three phases of the project  each 250 Megawatts  with the same content as the first phase. Also  in the quarter we received a $6.2 million order for hydrogen systems and equipment from a European shipyard  who  with Chart  is working closely with a large European cruise line on a hydrogen powered vessel  a $5.8 million order for two of the first transportable fuel stations for hydrogen fuel cell trucks and liquid hydrogen tank orders for a major industrial gas customer‚Äôs liquefaction plant in Europe. Importantly  this is another example of the global adoption of liquid hydrogen (historically Europe was predominantly focused on gaseous hydrogen). While not yet booked  we also received a letter of intent (‚ÄúLOI‚Äù) from one of our industrial gas customers for a hydrogen liquefaction plant  which we expect could move to order in 2023.We saw meaningfully more inbound interest in our CCUS offering since the IRA was approved than we had prior  including a pipeline of 363 customers and potential customers (+142% since December 31  2021). In our Earthly Labs‚Äô small-scale CCUS business  we successfully installed a CiCi unit at a large winery  shipping our first Earthly Labs‚Äô units to New Zealand  Australia and the United Kingdom early this quarter. Additionally  new inbound opportunities in our small-scale Earthly Labs carbon capture business totaled $9.22 million in the 75 days following the IRA announcement  compared to new opportunities in the 60 days prior to the IRA of $5.56 million. In the third quarter 2022  we booked orders for our SES cryogenic carbon capture solutions (‚ÄúSES CCC‚Äù) with a customer in Saudi Arabia  as well as with a European energy infrastructure company. We signed 4 Memorandums of Understanding (‚ÄúMOUs‚Äù) related to CCUS in the third quarter 2022  including one with C.A.T. Group and one with Koch for partnering on CCUS project work. We received an order for a feasibility study with Fluxys  with whom we are excited to collaborate on the application of our SES CCC technology to their emissions sources to support their net zero emissions target.We received $16.7 million in orders for water treatment systems in the third quarter 2022  the second highest in our history  and multiple orders for full treatment solutions  each over $2 million  such as an order from Smith Construction for Madera County  California manganese treatment for drinking water  another from Garney Construction for Brighton  Colorado nitrate treatment for drinking water  and a $4.67 million order in India.We have also been seeing an increase in clean air (methane emission elimination) activity  which also will benefit from the IRA  with $5.6M in orders through Q3 and new commitments equaling that total in the first 3 weeks Q4. And not to be left out  we received record ISO container orders (226) in the quarter  as well as the largest order of the year-to-date in food & beverage for QT‚Äôs new convenience Stores. As the result of this continued and consistent order activity as well as the IRA adding more certainty to this decade opportunities  we are increasing our estimated total addressable market in the near-term from $7.7 billion to $9.65 billion for Specialty Products  and to $49.25 billion through 2030 from $42.0 billion.Third quarter 2022: Eight MOUs and partnerships executed  eight new certifications received  79 additional new customer orders  17 new first-of-a-kind (‚ÄúFOAK‚Äù) orders and expanded organic capacity drive further differentiation of the Chart business.We continue to expand our business globally through partnerships  leading regional certifications in our specialty markets  and utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to serve new customers and new applications with our cryogenic expertise.In the third quarter 2022 we executed eight MOUs of which two included master supply agreements. Four were related to carbon capture and CO2 equipment  and two for hydrogen  and one each for liquefaction and LNG  further demonstrating the breadth of our solution offering and penetration across the Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢. One of the master supply agreements was for LNG equipment with Yanchange and Shell Petroleum  while another was with a major beverage company for carbon capture and storage technology and equipment.Our 79 new customers this quarter (bringing year-to-date through third quarter 2022 to 248) were across a broad reach of geographies. 43% of the third quarter 2022 new customers were North American  37% Asia Pacific and approximately 20% were in Europe and the Middle East.FOAK orders of 17 in the third quarter 2022 were also comprised of geographic and application breadth. We kicked off the first feasibility study with Bioveritas for carbon capture with bio-based food ingredients  booked an order with Firefly for a space exploration application  and welcomed new customer PT Arohera in Asia Pacific for food and beverage equipment for their end user  a global food manufacturer.Certifications globally and regionally in cryogenic equipment are a key differentiator  especially in newer end markets that have localized requirements. In the third quarter 2022  we received numerous new certifications (11  not including normal course of business renewals)  including approvals for specific product lines for use in Australia  Canada  and Korea (specifics can be found on slide 21 of the supplemental presentation).Our organic capacity expansions remain on track  and in some cases are ahead of schedule where we were able to accelerate toward completion as demand continues to increase. September 2022 marked the exciting arrival of our brazing furnace at our Tulsa  Oklahoma flexible manufacturing facility. We will begin post brazing in the fourth quarter 2022 at this site  offering additional capacity and shorter lead-times for certain brazed aluminum heat exchangers. Our Goch  Germany trailer facility expansion remains on track for second half 2023 production and is an example of our incorporation of ESG into our manufacturing  with the design including heat pumps with low energy consumption and extra insulation for less energy usage.Margin improvement resulting from our actions taken to respond to cost changes with pricing and surcharges and ongoing improving productivity; despite ongoing macroeconomic inflationary and supply chain challenges.In the third quarter 2022  input costs were similar to the second quarter 2022 (i.e. indexes are stabilizing)  yet with the backdrop of continued geopolitical and inflationary uncertainty. Gas and energy prices are a key driver in component availability and costs  in particular in the EU  and while recent prices have been declining  they are still over five times the 2019 standard price. In the EU  the shortage of supply and the rising energy prices could impact raw material producers  and therefore we have and continue to proactively fortify our supply chain channels both globally and locally to reduce the associated risks. Examples of this include future volume commitments on material and components that are more readily available now  and ensuring that we can access material locally in all geographies in which we manufacture in. Despite the ongoing and well-discussed supply chain challenges  12 of our manufacturing facilities had 100% on-time delivery in the third quarter 2022.Third quarter 2022 reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4% was 27.3% when adjusting for organic startup and capacity  year-one integration and other one-time expenses  our highest gross margin as a percent of sales quarter since the second quarter 2021 and in line with our sequential quarterly anticipated margin improvement  which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter 2022. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales increased more than 200 basis points sequentially in the third quarter 2022 when compared to the second quarter 2022 in three of our four segments  with HTS at 21.6% (an increase of 720 bps sequentially) and RSL at 38.4% (an increase of 410 bps sequentially). CTS reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 18.0% reflected our first quarter of sequential margin improvement in a year  in part driven by the pull in of lower margin backlog to the second quarter 2022. Specialty Products  which typically has volume and mix movements between quarters  had lower than anticipated sales driven by the timing shifts of two projects‚Äô revenue recognition due to timing of inbound components  which are anticipated to be recognized in the fourth quarter 2022. This project mix shift negatively impacted reported gross margin as a percent of sales for Specialty Products  which was 31.6% for the third quarter 2022. Also impacting the segment was the continued low volume in higher margined HLNG vehicle tanks and one large customer freight revenue which had no associated margin  neither of which are considered adjustments to our adjusted gross profit or adjusted operating profit. We did finalize our year-one integrations for AdEdge and L.A. Turbine  and when adjusting for integration  startup/capacity and restructuring costs in Specialty Products  adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.6%  similar to the second quarter 2022 adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales of 35.8%.Our reported operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 of 10.1% was an increase of 590 basis points compared to the third quarter 2021. It is also worth noting that in the third quarter 2021  we did not include any short-term incentive compensation expense as we were not hitting the threshold. In each quarter of 2022  including the third quarter  we have been booking our short-term incentive costs through SG&A. Therefore  the increase in reported operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 compared to the third quarter 2021 is operationally even more significant (an increase of 710 basis points). When adjusted for one-time and unusual items  adjusted operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 was 12.6%.‚ÄúThe third quarter of 2022 not only reinforced our customers‚Äô continued broad-based demand for LNG and solutions across our Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢ serving power  water  food and industrials  our outlook for 2023 and the coming decade was further bolstered by the passing of the IRA at a macro level and our record backlog  sales  gross profit  operating profit and EPS ‚Äù stated Jill Evanko  Chart‚Äôs CEO and President. ‚ÄúWe continue to execute our margin expansion activities ranging from pricing to organic productivity  which was reflected in the sequential margin improvement and our anticipated sequential margin expansion in the fourth quarter 2022 and into 2023.‚ÄùFree cash flow generation.In the third quarter 2022  we generated $37 million cash from operations  had $18 million of capital expenditures related activity  and $17 million of unusual addback items (including $2 million for escrow payments for Earthly Labs)  resulting in adjusted free cash flow (‚ÄúFCF‚Äù) of $36 million. This brings year-to-date adjusted FCF to $68 million. Considering the expected timing of larger project milestone payments (over $100 million expected) in the fourth quarter 2022  our full year FCF outlook is approximately $175 million. We accelerated certain capital projects expenditures related to capacity expansions into the third quarter 2022 as we continue to see lead-time and increased demand for deliveries across the next 24 months. Specifically  we pulled ahead capital to accelerate our ability to produce in our expanded roof-covered facility in New Iberia  Louisiana (cold box shop) and certain activities in our Tulsa  Oklahoma flexible manufacturing facility. As of the end of the third quarter 2022  our net leverage ratio is 2.92  and during the quarter we repaid $80M million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during the third quarter 2022.2022 Guidance.Our outlook for 2022 for sales is in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion  with associated adjusted non-diluted EPS in the range of $5.00 to $5.25 on approximately 35.87 million weighted shares outstanding with an assumed tax rate of 17%. The change to our prior sales guidance of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion is driven by currency headwinds and timing of specific project revenue recognition  which is typical in our business.2023 first outlook with increased confidence driven by record backlog  multiple global tailwinds and customers‚Äô forecasts.Our outlook for 2023 for sales is in a range of $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion  which includes only Big LNG projects that are in backlog as of September 30  2022. Associated adjusted non-diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 on 35.87 million weighted shares outstanding. This assumes a tax rate of 19%. Note that this outlook does not include any new or additional mid-size or large projects that could come into the order book between now and the end of the first half 2023 which we would anticipate having sales associated with them in the year. If one or more mid or large-size project comes into the order book between now and the end of the first quarter 2023  we would anticipate recognizing between $50 to $75 million dollars more of revenue into the full year.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) presents its preliminary  unaudited financial report for the first nine months ended September 30  2022.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:""In the first nine months of 2022 Pharming continued to perform well despite challenging industry conditions. Our commercialized asset RUCONEST¬Æ saw increased sales of 3% or US$151.0 million  compared to the same period last year  highlighting the continued need for a safe and effective acute hereditary angioedema therapy.From a strategic perspective  we continued to make significant progress delivering on a number of important regulatory milestones for leniolisib  a rare immunodeficiency disease. Of note  our New Drug Application for leniolisib was accepted by the US FDA for Priority Review with a PDUFA goal date of March 29  2023. Furthermore  we submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for the product to the European Medicines Agency following the grant of accelerated assessment. We remain on track for the anticipated marketing authorization of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in key markets next year.Looking ahead  the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib will be supported by our strong balance sheet and the steady sales of RUCONEST¬Æ. We will continue focusing on our strategic objectives and the internal review of our pipeline as we look to bring the unserved rare disease patient the solutions they need. We look forward to presenting more detailed plans at our full year financial results.""Strategic highlightsDuring the first nine months of 2022  we continued to execute on our strategic objectives of building a sustainable business by focusing on RUCONEST¬Æ sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline as we prioritize our efforts on rare diseases.As announced during the half year financial results in August 2022  we initiated an internal review of our pipeline with a greater and renewed focus towards rare diseases. As a result  we will advance the development of our pipeline through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib  as well as OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition of new  late-stage assets through in-licensing and M&A opportunities.We believe these potential acquisitions and in-licensing will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST¬Æ business  anticipated future leniolisib business  as well as available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming will access additional funding from the capital markets.Pipeline developmentleniolisibFor leniolisib  Pharming has a three-step approach planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated marketing authorization and commercial launch of leniolisib for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older in the US during the first half of 2023. This will be followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK in the second half of 2023 and early 2024  respectively  dependent upon regulatory approval. The Company will evaluate additional countries and regions and will commercialize the product either directly or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes the marketing authorization and commercial launch of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in children as young as one year of age.The third step is the continued life cycle management of the leniolisib compound into further indications which will be disclosed when decisions have been taken.US marketWe remain on track for the anticipated commercial approval of leniolisib in the first quarter of 2023  subject to approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  followed by the commercial launch of leniolisib in the second quarter of 2023.In the third quarter of 2022  we delivered on a number of important regulatory milestones including the filing and acceptance of a New Drug Application (NDA) for Priority Review by the FDA.As a result of receiving Priority Review  Pharming's NDA for leniolisib was assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023.In anticipation of a positive outcome from the FDA  we continued to grow our US field force and leverage our marketing capabilities for the commercialization of leniolisib.Finally  the ICD-10-CM code for APDS took effect on October 1  2022. The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code enables physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.European Economic Area (EEA) and UK marketIn the EEA  we announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Upon further request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days.Further positive milestones were reached in October 2022 when we announced that we had submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for leniolisib to the EMA. We expect to receive EMA validation of the MAA at the end of October 2022  with anticipated marketing authorization in H1 2023.Moving on to the UK market  in April 2022  the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS. A PIM designation is an early indication that leniolisib is a candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme. This scheme provides an opportunity for treatment options to be used in clinical practice in parallel with the later stages of the regulatory process.Finally  on September 30  2022  the UK government took the decision to extend the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP) by 12 months  until December 31  2023. The ECDRP allows a company to submit a product that has received approval from EMA to the UK's MHRA. The MHRA can grant a license relying on the EMA's decision  thereby ensuring a less time consuming in-country review.The extension of the ECDRP has several benefits including aligned EU and UK dossiers  consistent labeling across the EU and UK  and the potential for an earlier Marketing Authorisation Approval. As such  Pharming has decided that the ECDRP procedure will be used for the application of leniolisib to the MHRA. Under ECDRP  if the submission of an application is made within five days of an EMA CHMP positive opinion  the MHRA will aim to determine a decision within a 67-day timeline. The anticipated MHRA decision should be known in H2 2023.Pediatric clinical developmentAs previously announced  we intend to expand access to leniolisib for the treatment of pediatric APDS. As a result  Pharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age. During the first half of the year  positive decisions were received from EMA and MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned  global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS aged 4 to 11 with a second study in patients aged 1 to 6. These two studies will support regulatory filings worldwide. Pharming expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib in the fourth quarter of 2022.OTL-105Pharming's strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is ongoing. The program has made good progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)As announced at our half year 2022 financial results  following an internal review of our pipeline  we have taken the strategic decision to discontinue further development of rhC1INH therapy for Acute Kidney Injury. We are considering strategic options to gain value from the work done to date and have de-prioritized further development and investment in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd. The herd is being maintained to allow all possible outcomes to be explored.The ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial is continuing as we evaluate these strategic options.We will update the market at our full year 2022 financial results on further progress in this area.PompeWe continue the preclinical investigation of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease and will update the market on the results as appropriate.Financial SummaryAmounts in US$m except per share data YTD 2022 YTD 2021 % Change Income StatementRevenues 151.0 146.1 3 % Gross profit 139.7 130.6 7 % Operating profit 28.4 15.3 86 % Profit for the year 28.3 13.9 104 % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 189.9 184.8 3 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.043 0.022 95 % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.040 0.018 122 %Financial highlightsYTD Q3 2022Revenues for the first nine months of 2022 were US$151.0 million  a 3% increase compared to the first nine months of 2021 (US$146.1 million).Gross profit for the first nine months of 2022 increased 7% to US$139.7 million. This increase was driven by growth in revenues  production efficiencies and a favorable tailwind in currency translation effects.Operating costs for the first nine months of 2022 increased by US$9.8 million to US$126.9 million versus the same period last year. The increase results from a combination of increased R&D expenditure  launch preparation and manufacturing costs for leniolisib  and an increase in travel related expenses post-COVID-19. This increase was partly offset by significant one-off costs in Q3 2021 relating to the in-licensing of OTL-105 from Orchard Therapeutics.Operating profit for the first nine months of 2022 was US$28.4 million  increasing 86% versus the same period last year. This was mainly driven by the increase in other income of US$13.8 million as a result of a reduced minority stake in BioConnection communicated in our H1 2022 press release.Net profit for the first nine months of 2022 was US$28.3 million  a 104% increase compared to the same period last year (US$13.9 million). This was driven by the increase in other income of US$13.8 million.Cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  decreased from US$193.0 million at the end of 2021  to US$189.9 million at the end of the third quarter 2022.OutlookFor the financial year of 2022:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST¬Æ sales. Quarterly fluctuations are expected.Subject to a positive outcome from the FDA review  we anticipate marketing authorization in the US for leniolisib at the end of Q1 2023  with an anticipated launch and commercialization in Q2 2023.Subject to a positive outcome from the EMA review  we anticipate a positive opinion from the CHMP for leniolisib  followed by the issuance of an MAA by the European Commission towards the end of H1 2023. Initial commercial launches in EU markets are planned for H2 2023.Following an anticipated positive CHMP opinion  we intend to submit an ECDRP filing for leniolisib with the MHRA in the UK in H2 2023.Pharming will continue to allocate resources towards the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib with the view of accelerating future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will continue to impact profit for the remainder of 2022 and throughout 2023. However  no additional financing to support the current business is expected with the continued cash flow from RUCONEST¬Æ funding these investments.Investment and continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of new  late- stage development opportunities and assets in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.No further specific financial guidance for 2022 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation will be available on the Pharming.com website from 10:30 CET on October 27  2022.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CET on October 27  2022.

Normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT do not have a standard calculation method and AB InBev‚Äôs definition of normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT may not be comparable to that of other companies.NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev‚Äôs underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. Scope changes represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company‚Äôs performance. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting  starting from the 3Q18 results release in which we accounted for the hyperinflation impact for the first nine months of 2018. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations and are identified separately in the annexes within the column labeled ‚ÄúHyperinflation restatement‚Äù for the quarter and within the column ‚ÄúCurrency translation‚Äù year to date. In 9M22  we reported a positive impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 52 million USD. The impact in 9M22 normalized EPS was 0.03 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 3Q22 and 9M22 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 012 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 006 million shares for 3Q21 and 9M21.Legal disclaimerThis release contains ‚Äúforward-looking statements‚Äù.

The situation in the United Kingdom served as a reminder that governments have little financial leeway and that fiscal and monetary policies need to be aligned. As expected  global growth forecasts have been downgraded.Bankruptcies are continuing to rise  especially in developed countries. Coface maintains its prudent reserving policy on Russia. This environment did not prevent Coface from achieving record net income of ‚Ç¨84m in the third quarter  with the YTD figure now totalling ‚Ç¨228m  higher than in fiscal year 2021. This corresponds to annualised return on tangible equity of 16.4%.Investments in adjacent businesses are continuing. Information services (+15.6%) and factoring (+13.0%) recorded continued growth in turnover. Coface is also continuing to focus on service quality  reflected in the record high retention rate and an improvement in the net promoter score (NPS) to 38%.We welcome Moody‚Äôs decision to assign our credit rating a positive outlook. This acknowledges the work done by all of Coface's teams over the past few years and our strengths at the beginning of a more complex stage in the economic cycle.""Key figures at 30 September 2022The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the consolidated financial statements at 30 September 2022 (non-audited figures) at its meeting of 27 October 2022.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of ‚Ç¨1 363.1m over the first nine months of 2022  up +15.2% at constant FX and perimeter compared to 9M-21. On a reported basis (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover was up +17.7%.Revenues from insurance activities (including bonding and Single Risk) increased by +16.6% at constant FX and perimeter (and by +18.8% at current FX) compared to 9M-21. Growth benefited from an increase in client activity and continued high retention.The retention rate reached a record level of 93.5%  up +1.4% compared to 9M-21. New business totalled ‚Ç¨82m  down ‚Ç¨20m compared to 9M-21 in an increasingly competitive market.The growth in Coface‚Äôs client activity had a positive impact of +11.1% over 9M-22. This record increase for the first nine months reflects the scale of the recent economic recovery and inflation. The price effect continued to reverse  coming in at -3.0% in 9M-22  in line with the -3.0% fall in H1-22. This is largely due to previous very low loss experience.Revenues from other activities were up +7.9% compared to 9M-21  still with contrasting trends in the different businesses. Turnover from factoring rose +13.0%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Poland. Revenues from information services continued to grow  rising +15.6% (vs. +13.4% in 9M-21). Fee and commission income (collection fees) was impacted by the decline in claims to be recovered and dropped -37.9% while commissions were up by +6.7%.Total revenue - in ‚Ç¨m(by country of invoicing) 9M-21 9M-22 Variation %ex.

Trade credit insurance benefited from the increase in client activity and a high retention rate. Factoring turnover increased by +7.0%.In Western Europe  turnover was up by +14.8% at constant FX (+16.0% at current FX) thanks to a high retention rate and client activity.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover was up by +16.8% and by +17.6% at constant FX  due to high retention  and growth in trade credit insurance driven by client activity. Factoring turnover continued to increase significantly  rising by +36.9%.In Mediterranean and Africa  a region driven by Italy and Spain  turnover grew by +17.2% and by +15.4% at current FX. This was due to high levels of new business and high retention. Revenues from services increased by +27.7%.In North America  turnover increased +12.4% at constant FX and +26.0% as reported  driven by high client activity and positive FX effect  which were partially offset by premium refunds.In Latin America  turnover was up +29.8% at constant FX and +41.3% at current FX  driven by strong retention as well as growth in client activity driven by the rise in commodity prices.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +16.6% at constant FX and +25.7% at current FX. This growth was driven by high retention and increased client activity as well as a positive currency effect.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio  net of reinsurance  stood at 63.8% for 9M-22 (a rise of 7.7 points compared to 9M-21).(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 30.2%  up 5.0 ppts compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims close to pre-Covid levels and the return of relatively large claims  which nevertheless remain below average. Coface increased its provisions relating to the residual exposure in Russia.The Group‚Äôs reserving policy remains unchanged. Strict management of past claims enabled Coface to record 53.1 ppts of recoveries. The loss ratio for the 2022 underwriting year is still high at 80.9%  signalling that Coface anticipates an increase in the number of bankruptcies in the coming quarters  and an increase in reserves on Russia.The loss ratio net of reinsurance came out at 36.9%  up by 11.5 ppts compared to 9M-21.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is following its strict policy of cost management. In the third quarter 2022  costs rose by +16.0% at constant FX and perimeter  and +20.1% at current FX. This increase is in line with the growth in turnover  even though Coface continued to invest. The cost ratio before reinsurance was 32.2%  an improvement of 0.8 ppt over one year.The cost ratio  net of reinsurance was 26.9% for the first nine months  an improvement of 3.8 ppts year-on-year  reflecting lower gross cost ratio and higher reinsurance commissions.Financial resultNet financial income for 9M-22 was ‚Ç¨39.1m  up by ‚Ç¨8.2m compared to 9M-21. This figure includes ‚Ç¨10.7m in realised capital gains and positive hedging results as well as a currency effect of ‚Ç¨3.2m. This performance was achieved against a particularly turbulent market backdrop  primarily due to the effectiveness of hedging policies.The portfolio‚Äôs current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX impact) is ‚Ç¨29.5m (compared to ‚Ç¨25.2m in 9M-21). The accounting yield3  excluding capital gains and depreciation  stood at 1.0% in 9M-22  up compared to the previous year (0.9%)  mainly due to higher reinvestment rates.Operating income and net incomeOperating income for 9M-22 was ‚Ç¨329.8m  up +24.3%  mainly due to increased growth and a still low loss ratio.The effective tax rate was 26%  compared to 24% for 9M-21.In total  net income (group share) was ‚Ç¨228.4m  up +19.6% compared to 9M-21  of which ‚Ç¨84.0m in Q3-22.3. Shareholders‚Äô equity & solvencyAt 30 September 2022  Group shareholders‚Äô equity stood at ‚Ç¨1 955.2m  down ‚Ç¨185.8m  or -8.7% (compared to ‚Ç¨2 141.0m at 31 December 2021).This change is mainly due to the positive net income of ‚Ç¨228.4m  the payment of the dividend (-‚Ç¨224.8m) and the fall in unrealised capital gains (-‚Ç¨240.5m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 16.4% at 30 September 2022  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.4. OutlookThe risks threatening global growth were confirmed in the third quarter. The leading central banks continued to tighten monetary policy in a bid to curb inflation  which remains high. There was no improvement in the conflict in Ukraine and the energy crisis in Europe remains acute. European countries are taking substantial financial measures to limit the consequences of the crisis but there are considerable disparities in the extent of their intervention and the lack of coordination is undermining their effectiveness. The Chinese economy continues to be periodically affected by local lockdowns and is facing the consequences of the bursting of the property market bubble.As expected  growth forecasts for the global economy continue to be downgraded. Coface has lowered its financial outlook for 49 economic sectors  following significant downgrades to its country risk assessments in the second quarter.It is continuing to monitor the worsening economic environment. With its strong underwriting discipline and its reserving policy  which remains unchanged  Coface is well positioned to successfully navigate this more complex stage in the economic cycle. The raising of its credit rating outlook by Moody‚Äôs attests to the robustness of Coface's business model and its careful risk management.Coface is continuing to invest in expanding its service activities such as information services (growth of +15.6%) and factoring (+13.0%). Its record retention rate (93.5%) and the steady rise in its net promoter score (NPS) to 38% reflect client recognition of its constant focus on service quality.Conference call for financial analystsCoface‚Äôs results for 9M-2022 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Thursday 27 October at 18.00 (Paris time).

Operating EBITA margin increased to 10.3% (last year: 9.5%)  driven by improved performance across the GBAs.Peter Oosterveer  CEO Arcadis  comments:‚ÄúDuring the last quarter  we have continued to see growing client demand across our three Global Business Areas. Our Resilience business continues to benefit from increased client demand for sustainability advisory  energy transition and climate adaptation solutions. In our Places business we have enjoyed large wins in North America and Germany  and increased demand from manufacturing and governmental clients. For our Mobility business  significant rail wins in the Netherlands and a growing demand for smart mobility solutions from highways and public transport clients created strong results.We have also made significant progress in optimizing our portfolio and focusing our efforts on geographies where we see the most attractive opportunities. This has resulted in the divestments of operations in Singapore  Malaysia  our Design and Engineering business in Hong Kong  Switzerland and our environmental restoration business in France. These follow the divestments made earlier on in the year; of our operations in Thailand  Czech Republic and Slovakia.As we look ahead to 2023  our focus is on fully embedding both IBI and DPS into our four Global Business Areas  and the shaping of our fourth GBA ‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù. Through these acquisitions  we not only significantly grow our presence in North America and Europe  but we will also be in the position to provide complementary client services and solutions in high growth markets  including life sciences  semiconductors  and industrial manufacturing.Although the evolving geo-political situation and inflationary headwinds remain firmly on our radar  our record backlog and continued focus on the optimization of our portfolio  combined with the exciting new growth opportunities IBI  DPS and Giftge Consulting offer  position us well to meet our strategic targets. I can only be very proud of all the teams across Arcadis that have kept the right focus on our clients in these busy and exciting times for our company.‚ÄùKEY FIGURESAs the acquisition of the IBI Group has been formally closed on 27th of September 2022  the Arcadis consolidated financial statements include IBI consolidated data for balance sheet items (those items having an impact on NWC% and DSO calculated for Arcadis as a whole). Arcadis backlog includes IBI backlog as well. As the three days of P&L of IBI Group between September 27th and September 30th have been considered as non-significant  P&L data and corresponding KPI‚Äôs (e.g. EBITDA  order intake  FCF) for the third quarter represent Arcadis standalone data.in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Gross revenues 1 003 828 21% 2 851 2 489 15% Net revenues 740 636 16% 2 158 1 912 13% Organic growth1) 10.9% 4.8% 8.2% 3.9% Operating EBITDA2) 101 83 21% 284 252 12% Operating EBITDA margin 13.6% 13.1% 13.2% 13.2% EBITA 27 57 -52% 158 171 -8% EBITA margin 3.7% 9.0% 7.3% 9.0% Operating EBITA2) 76 60 26% 208 177 18% Operating EBITA margin 10.3% 9.5% 9.7% 9.2% Free Cash Flow3) 38 75 -50% 27 105 -74% Net Working Capital %4) 13.8% 14.0% Days Sales Outstanding4) 72 74 Net Debt4) 880 298 195% Backlog net revenues4) 2 813 2 126 32% Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 5.0%1) Underlying growth excluding the impact of currency movements  acquisitions or footprint reductions  such as the Middle East  winddowns or divestments2) This excludes the net result on divestment of consolidated companies  and acquisitions  restructuring  and integration-related costs. The Operating EBITDA is used when calculating the strategic target: average net debt / (Operating) EBITDA  guided for 1.5-2.5x3) Free Cash flow: Cash Flow from Operations corrected for Capex and Lease liabilities4) Including IBI Group  transaction closing per 27th of September 2022INCOME STATEMENTNet revenues totaled ‚Ç¨740 million and increased organically by 10.9%. Growth was driven by all three GBAs  with Resilience and Mobility being exceptionally strong in North America and the UK. The currency impact was 9%. The operating EBITA margin improved to 10.3% (Q3‚Äò21: 9.5%)  driven by all three GBAs  and a significant year-on-year improvement driven by Places from improved operational efficiencies  despite lower working days in the UK and Australia due to Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs funeral.Non-operating costs were ‚Ç¨49 million and include transaction costs related to the three recently announced acquisitions  and a net loss on divestments of operations in Singapore  Malaysia  Hong Kong (Design & Engineering business)  Switzerland and France (Environmental Restoration business). These net losses had no impact on Free Cash Flow.ORDER INTAKE &BACKLOGAt the end of September 2022 backlog reached a record high level of ‚Ç¨2 813 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨2 126 million)  of which ‚Ç¨530 million was added through the acquisition of the IBI Group. Strong order intake  with almost no cancellations in the quarter resulted in a solid organic backlog growth of 5.0% year-over-year  with a positive contribution of all three GBAs.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues was 13.8% (Q3‚Äò21: 14.0%)  globally in line with last year performance. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased to 72 days (Q3‚Äò21: 74 days). Net debt increased to ‚Ç¨880 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨298 million)  including the ‚Ç¨600 million bridge loan for IBI acquisition and IBI net debt of ‚Ç¨54 million.Free cash flow generation during the quarter was ‚Ç¨38 million and below last year‚Äôs (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨75 million)  driven by sharp revenue growth elevating working capital levels  and some transaction costs relating to the recent acquisitions. Free cash flow generation year-to-date was ‚Ç¨27 million (Q3‚Äò21: ‚Ç¨105 million)  which was impacted by a normalization of working capital levels compared to 2021.STRATEGIC PROGRESSFocus & Scale is one of the three key pillars of our ‚ÄúMaximizing Impact‚Äù business strategy for 2021-2023. Arcadis has focused on driving operational efficiencies through the implementation of the GBA model  focus on key clients  and greater use of the Global Excellence Centers (GECs)  as well as investing in high growth markets  for instance through the acquisitions of IBI  DPS and Giftge Consult.At the same time  ‚ÄúFocus & Scale‚Äù triggered a portfolio assessment  reviewing operations on their scalability  growth potential  financial performance  and scope of services. This has resulted in the following divestment of non-core operations  from a geographic or business point of view: Singapore  Malaysia  Hong Kong (Design & Engineering business)  Switzerland and France (Environmental Restoration business)  representing ~900 people and ‚Ç¨47 million of annual net revenues. This was in addition to the divestments of Czech Republic  Slovakia and Thailand that occurred in the first half of 2022  representing ~190 people and ‚Ç¨11 million of annual net revenues.The recent acquisitions of IBI  DPS and Giftge  together with the divestments  have rebalanced the geographic and business portfolio  and repositioned Arcadis towards high growth and resilient markets such as placemaking and urban planning in North America  and industrial manufacturing engineering in the US and Europe. The creation of the fourth GBA ‚ÄúIntelligence""  will enhance Arcadis‚Äô position as a digital leader  and ability to serve its clients in a more efficient way across all phases of the asset lifecycle. The backlog for Intelligence at the end of the third quarter was ‚Ç¨112 million  representing 4% of the total Arcadis backlog.PERFORMANCE BY GLOBAL BUSINESS AREARESILIENCE(43% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 320 259 24% 909 771 18% Organic growth1) 13.7% 9.7% Backlog net revenues 943 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 5.4%Resilience showed continued solid revenue and backlog growth for the third quarter  driven by continued strong client demand in energy transition  climate adaptation and mitigation  including a new commission as lead designer of a flood defense for Battery Park  New York City  complementing resiliency work for southeast and lower Manhattan. Revenue growth was supported by the successful onboarding of new hires  especially in the US.The Resilience business closed the quarter at a backlog of ‚Ç¨943 million  representing 34% of total Arcadis backlog.PLACES(32% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 234 209 12% 697 656 6% Organic growth1) 3.6% 2.8% Backlog net revenues 1 216 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 2.1%Revenue and backlog growth in the third quarter were driven by a strong Continental Europe and US  with good demand for sustainable and intelligent buildings  including the development of datacenters and automotive giga-factories for electric vehicle battery production. Revenue and backlog growth was somewhat hampered by weakening market circumstances in China.The absolute backlog of Places increased by 29% year-on-year to ‚Ç¨1 216 million. The position includes the backlog of IBI Group  which was marked by strong order intake in the third quarter and excludes the divested countries in Southeast Asia. These strategic decisions led to a significant repositioning of the Places backlog  now representing 43% of total Arcadis backlog  with an increased focus on North America and Europe.MOBILITY(25% of net revenues) in ‚Ç¨ millions Third quarter Year-to-date Period ended 30 September 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 186 168 11% 552 485 14% Organic growth1) 15.4% 12.5% Backlog net revenues 542 Backlog organic growth (y-o-y)1) 9.0%Stellar revenue growth for Mobility in the third quarter was driven by the UK  Australia and the US. A strong backlog development came from large highway and rail wins; such as for ProRail in the Netherlands  and a growing demand for smart mobility solutions from highways and public transport clients. At the end of Q3  mobility backlog amounted to ‚Ç¨542 million  representing 19% of total Arcadis backlog.IBI‚Äôs experience in developing digital tools including Travel-IQ will further help to pursue new opportunities and strengthen our Mobility business both in North America and across the world.Financial calendar:16 February 2023 ‚Äì Q4 & FY 2022 Results4 May 2023 ‚Äì Q1 2023 Trading Update27 July 2023 ‚Äì Q2 & HY 2023 Results26 October 2023 ‚Äì Q3 2023 Trading UpdateFor further information please contact:Arcadis Investor RelationsChristine DischMobile: +31 (0)6 1537 6020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comArcadis Corporate CommunicationsTanno MassarMobile: +31 (0)6 1158 9121E-mail: tanno.massar@arcadis.comAnalyst meetingArcadis will hold an analyst webcast to discuss the Q3results for 2022.

Given the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the steps taken by the Company  the suspension of the listing of the Company's shares (ISIN: FR0010879056) is maintained until further notice.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the ‚Äúmicrobial dark matter‚Äù. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.Story continuesThis breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts.
