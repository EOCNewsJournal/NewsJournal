Adjusted net profit rose by 25% to EUR 426 million.Business income was up 7% to EUR 1 208 million  reflecting continued solid growth of Euroclear's business lines. The diversification of the business has provided a hedge against market volatility over recent months. Interest  banking  and other income increased by 179% to EUR 182 million.Operating Expenses increased to EUR 811 million  up 12% compared to the prior year  as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering  as well as being impacted by inflation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Overall  Euroclear expects expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023 as a result of accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.The key operating metrics  shown below  underpinned the strong business performance during the period.Market volatility remains high  driving transaction volumes to record levels.Equity market valuations have fallen significantly during 2022 which has led to declines in assets under custody and fund asset under custody during the period.The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.Euroclear sees sustained demand for collateral management and lending services from a broad range of market participants as they seek to reduce credit risk in volatile financial market conditions.Q3 YTD 2022 Change vs Q3 YTD 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 34.9 trillion -3.5 % Number of Transactions 229 million +4.3 % Turnover EUR 791.8 trillion +8.1 % Fund Assets under Custody EUR 2.8 trillion -2.7 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.9 trillion +7.5 %In the third quarter  Euroclear outlined its updated strategic vision and targets to its investors. Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors.In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.Illustrating this strategic focus  Euroclear enhanced its offering in sustainable finance through an investment in Impact Cubed  a leading provider of ESG tech-enabled analytics and data science solutions. This investment complements Euroclear's investment in Greenomy  a provider of data and reporting for issuers to comply with EU sustainable finance legislation.International investor appetite for global market access as part of their diversified holdings remains robust and issuers continue to seek to benefit from an international investor base. Euroclear's strategic focus on meeting these demands continued to deliver growth  despite the headwinds resulting from the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Assets under custody from international and emerging markets were up 18% year-on-year to EUR 1.7 trillion.One year ago  Euroclear acquired MFEX as part of its expanded funds platform. Considerable progress has been made to integrate MFEX and enhance the group's end-to-end funds offering. This is reflected through the new MFEXbyEuroclear branding for all group funds solutions.Implications of Russian sanctionsThe sanctions imposed by the US  the EU  and other jurisdictions  as well as Russian countermeasures  resulted in a loss of Russia-related business income which was more than compensated by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of September  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨88.7 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 119.9 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested which  depending on the prevailing interest rates  results in interest income. Over the nine months  revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia was EUR 340 million.With the growth of sanctioned liabilities and the increase of interest rates  the materiality of revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia on the group's financial results is unprecedented. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate these earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board expects interest income to continue to grow materially as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate in a rising interest rate environment.As previously outlined  while this is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet  it should not result in material change in credit risk profile and therefore will not have a meaningful impact on the group's capital ratios.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society. Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by retaining any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer""Despite an extraordinary context  we continued to deliver an excellent business performance  with financial results above our strategic 'through-the-cycle"" targets.The group benefits from a diversified business model which allows us to focus on supporting clients through these uncertain times  providing robust infrastructure and fulfilling our duties with respect to the sanctions on Russia.Our results show that we are on the right path. We are now accelerating investments to deliver on our long-term strategy and drive value for all our stakeholders.""AnnexesInterest income is driven by the prevailing interest rates in each currency of the cash balances held by the group. As at 30 September 2022  cash balances totaled EUR 111.7 billion  of which EUR 85.8 billion related to the sanctions on Russia.The proportion of cash balances by currency is as follows:Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

An increasing interest rate environment has impacted Euroclear Investment's intra-group loans (assets) recognised at fair market value in line with IFRS 9. Liabilities have not been impacted  due to being recognised at acquisitioncost  in line with accounting standards. As a result  Euroclear Investments demonstrates a significant loss on non-trading financialassets for Q3 2022 compared to Q3 2021  resulting in a negative operating profit. This accounting treatment has no impact onEuroclear group's earnings capacity nor on the ability for Euroclear Investments to reimburse its debt.Note to editorsEuroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

Adjusted net profit rose by 25% to EUR 426 million.Business income was up 7% to EUR 1 208 million  reflecting continued solid growth of Euroclear's business lines. The diversification of the business has provided a hedge against market volatility over recent months. Interest  banking  and other income increased by 179% to EUR 182 million.Operating Expenses increased to EUR 811 million  up 12% compared to the prior year  as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering  as well as being impacted by inflation.Inflationary pressures on costs  as well as the broader impact of the macro-economic environment  are monitored at the level of each of operating entity. Only Euroclear Bank benefits directly from the compensating effect of higher interest rates.Overall  Euroclear expects expenditure to remain above its ""through-the-cycle"" target of 4-6% p.a. in 2023 as a result of accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. However  profitability is expected to rise as inflation headwinds are more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases.The key operating metrics  shown below  underpinned the strong business performance during the period.Market volatility remains high  driving transaction volumes to record levels.Equity market valuations have fallen significantly during 2022 which has led to declines in assets under custody and fund asset under custody during the period.The impact of lower equity markets is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model. Approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations.Euroclear sees sustained demand for collateral management and lending services from a broad range of market participants as they seek to reduce credit risk in volatile financial market conditions.Q3 YTD 2022 Change vs Q3 YTD 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 34.9 trillion -3.5 % Number of Transactions 229 million +4.3 % Turnover EUR 791.8 trillion +8.1 % Fund Assets under Custody EUR 2.8 trillion -2.7 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.9 trillion +7.5 %In the third quarter  Euroclear outlined its updated strategic vision and targets to its investors. Through its strategy  the group will continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of all financial market participants from issuers to investors.In addition  Euroclear will increase its focus on ESG  data-driven and digital innovations and expanding its global reach.Illustrating this strategic focus  Euroclear enhanced its offering in sustainable finance through an investment in Impact Cubed  a leading provider of ESG tech-enabled analytics and data science solutions. This investment complements Euroclear's investment in Greenomy  a provider of data and reporting for issuers to comply with EU sustainable finance legislation.International investor appetite for global market access as part of their diversified holdings remains robust and issuers continue to seek to benefit from an international investor base. Euroclear's strategic focus on meeting these demands continued to deliver growth  despite the headwinds resulting from the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Assets under custody from international and emerging markets were up 18% year-on-year to EUR 1.7 trillion.One year ago  Euroclear acquired MFEX as part of its expanded funds platform. Considerable progress has been made to integrate MFEX and enhance the group's end-to-end funds offering. This is reflected through the new MFEXbyEuroclear branding for all group funds solutions.Implications of Russian sanctionsThe sanctions imposed by the US  the EU  and other jurisdictions  as well as Russian countermeasures  resulted in a loss of Russia-related business income which was more than compensated by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of September  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by ‚Ç¨88.7 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 119.9 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested which  depending on the prevailing interest rates  results in interest income. Over the nine months  revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia was EUR 340 million.With the growth of sanctioned liabilities and the increase of interest rates  the materiality of revenues on cash balances arising from sanctions on Russia on the group's financial results is unprecedented. As such  the Board considers it necessary to separate these earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.The Board expects interest income to continue to grow materially as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate in a rising interest rate environment.As previously outlined  while this is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet  it should not result in material change in credit risk profile and therefore will not have a meaningful impact on the group's capital ratios.The Board recognises that the unexpected profit should be managed prudently  in line with its corporate purpose and considering its responsibilities towards stakeholders and society.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application...","Marketing authorisation in the European Economic Area anticipated in H1 2023LEIDEN  Netherlands  Oct. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib has been validated for scientific evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The application  submitted earlier in October 2022  is for the investigational drug  leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adolescents and adults 12 years or older.Pharming Group N.V. logoIn August 2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's CHMP. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the European Economic Area is anticipated in H1 2023.The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""EMA's validation for review of our MAA under an accelerated assessment pathway highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advance leniolisib as a targeted treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with APDS. We anticipate that leniolisib will fill an unmet need for patients with APDS  who currently rely on supportive therapies to treat their primary symptoms. This review constitutes a key milestone in Pharming's effort to give healthcare providers and their patients global access to leniolisib. We look forward to collaborating with EMA as needed throughout the regulatory process.""Story continuesAbout Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

There will be no attendance quorum for this EGM.At the EGM  shareholders will be requested to approve various aspects of the comprehensive recapitalization transaction which was announced by the Company on 1 September 2022.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Aut‚Ä¶","Marketing authorisation in the European Economic Area anticipated in H1 2023LEIDEN  Netherlands  Oct. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib has been validated for scientific evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The application  submitted earlier in October 2022  is for the investigational drug  leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adolescents and adults 12 years or older.In August 2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's CHMP. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the European Economic Area is anticipated in H1 2023.The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""EMA's validation for review of our MAA under an accelerated assessment pathway highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advance leniolisib as a targeted treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with APDS. We anticipate that leniolisib will fill an unmet need for patients with APDS  who currently rely on supportive therapies to treat their primary symptoms. This review constitutes a key milestone in Pharming's effort to give healthcare providers and their patients global access to leniolisib. We look forward to collaborating with EMA as needed throughout the regulatory process.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The strong performance of our professional business compensated lower consumer demand and the continued slowdown in China. We managed to improve profitability compared to the second quarter despite the impact of energy costs and currency movements. As expected  our free cash flow generation strengthened  driven by improved profitability and the stabilization of our working capital. Given the uncertain near-term outlook  the continued softness of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. Regarding the adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow  we are targeting the lower end of both guidance ranges ‚Äù said CEO Eric Rondolat.‚ÄúAs we enter the final quarter of 2022  we have shifted gears to adapt the company to a structurally weaker external environment in the coming quarters  when current headwinds and volatility are likely to persist. We will therefore focus on measures to control costs and cash flow  in line with our track record of delivering margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation in difficult environments. While some areas will be more affected  connected energy efficient lighting solutions will continue to benefit from strong demand given the energy prices surge.‚ÄùStory continuesBrighter Lives  Better World 2025In the third quarter of the year  Signify continued to deliver on its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Double the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track  mainly driven by energy-efficient and connected LED lightingDouble Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues were at 30% and on track. This positive trend is driven by serviceable and circular luminairesDouble Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues increased to 28%  mainly driven by the Safety & security and consumer well-being portfoliosDouble the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 27%  stable with Q2. Signify continued to create action plans to address gaps and accelerate its progress. In addition  Signify published its first-ever Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion report.OutlookGiven the uncertain near-term outlook and the continued softness both of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. We are targeting the lower end of the range for both the 11.0-11.4% Adjusted EBITA margin guidance and the 5-7% free cash flow guidance.Financial reviewThird quarter Nine months 2021 2022 change in millions of EUR  except percentages 2021 2022 change 4.3 % Comparable sales growth 5.3 % 8.1 % Effects of currency movements 6.6 % 4.0 % Consolidation and other changes 2.2 % 1 643 1 912 16.3 % Sales 4 852 5 536 14.1 % 634 713 12.6 % Adjusted gross margin 1 909 2 072 8.6 % 38.6% 37.3% Adj. gross margin (as % of sales) 39.3% 37.4% -415 -471 Adj.

Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 8.1%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD  and a positive effect of 4.0% from the Q2 acquisitions of Fluence and Pierlite.The Adjusted gross margin decreased by 130 bps to 37.3%. While continued price increases more than offset the input cost increases and the surge in energy costs  the Adjusted gross margin was impacted by an adverse currency effect. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 80 bps to 28.6%  driven by operating leverage and strengthened cost discipline.Adjusted EBITA was EUR 199 million  up 9.1% vs. Q3 2021. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 70 bps to 10.4%  with price increases more than offsetting higher input costs. Yet  the Adjusted EBITA margin was negatively affected by a 220bps currency effect  being the combination both from the weakening of the EUR versus the USD and CNY  and from a temporary FX hedging headwind. Excluding this temporary adverse hedging effect  the Adjusted EBITA margin was stable vs Q3 21.Adjusted items were EUR -6 million. Restructuring costs decreased year on year to EUR -6 million  while acquisition-related charges of EUR -10 million were fully compensated by incidental items of EUR 10 million. The incidental items benefited from a release of tax indemnification liabilities. Net income increased by 18.4% from EUR 94 million to EUR 112 million.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 37 069 at the end of Q3 21 to 34 273 at the end of Q3 22. The employee base was exceptionally high in Q3 21  due to the strong volume recovery and additional staff requirements in factories  following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.1 This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

Given the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the steps taken by the Company  the suspension of the listing of the Company's shares (ISIN: FR0010879056) is maintained until further notice.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the ‚Äúmicrobial dark matter‚Äù. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,negative,0.0,0.17,0.83,True,English,"['DEINOVE REQUESTS RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDINGS', 'proc√©dure de redressement judiciaire', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'employee representative bodies', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'Montpellier Commercial Court', 'urgent, global challenge', 'best possible conditions', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'English French', 'antibiotic resistance', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'd√©claration', 'business activity', 'recovery plan', 'sale plan', 'current activities', 'observation period', 'financial markets', 'press release', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'The Company', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'receivership proceedings', 'DEINOVE', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'declaration', 'cessation', 'payments', 'paiements', 'request', 'advance', 'purpose', 'solutions', 'employment', 'liabilities', 'process', 'investors', 'framework', 'way', 'continuation', 'decision', 'listing', 'shares', 'October', 'opening', 'trading', 'publication', 'notice', 'uncertainty', 'outcome', 'steps', 'suspension', 'ISIN', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '9']",2022-10-28,2022-10-29,globenewswire.com

Organic growth was 8.7%. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 7.3%.The 8.7% organic revenue growth was notably led by a strong performance in Buildings & Infrastructure (+11.0% in Q3)  Industry (+10.6% in Q3)  Marine & Offshore (+9.7%)  as well as Agri-Food & Commodities (+9.6%) in Q3. The diversity of Bureau Veritas portfolio  its solid sales pipeline and its leadership in terms of Sustainability and ESG solutions  position Bureau Veritas well to grow in a sustained manner in the medium term. Around 55% of Bureau Veritas sales  in the first 9-month of the year  are related to Sustainability through the BV Green Line of services & solutions.By geography  activities in the Americas strongly outperformed the rest of Bureau Veritas (29% of revenue; up 15.0% organically)  led by a 9.5% increase in North America (Buildings & Infrastructure driven) and by a 25.3% increase in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). The activity in Asia Pacific (31% of revenue; up 4.6% organically) benefited from robust growth in Australia as well as strong growth in South-East Asian countries (notably Vietnam). Europe (31% of revenue) delivered homogeneous growth across the board; up 6.0% organically  with above-average performance in Italy and France  notably. Finally  in Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue)  business increased by 16.2% on an organic basis  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 1.3%  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized since the beginning of 2022  alongside those of the prior year.Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 7.0%  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies.2022 outlook confirmed:Based on the year-to-date performance  the significant growth opportunities related to its sustainabilityrange of services and solutions  and excluding the full-year impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns in China Bureau Veritas still expects for 2022 to:Achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;Improve the adjusted operating margin;Generate sustained strong cash flow  with a cash conversion above 90%.For more information: https://group.bureauveritas.comConstantia Flexibles‚Äî9 months total growth of +31.6%  with record organic growth of 23.7% mainly driven by price increases but also through volume growth and mix improvement(Full consolidation)Sales in the first nine months of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨1 537.9 million  up +23.7% on an organic basis with strong performance across both markets  Consumer and Pharma both posted above 20% organic growth. Sales are up +31.6% in total over the period  driven mostly by necessary price increases enabling to compensate for the inflationary input costs pressure. Since the start of the year  despite raw material shortages  Constantia has experienced an encouraging return to market share gains  thereby confirming the good momentum instilled by the new management team‚Äôs commercial initiatives. The market in India remains challenging and management is rolling out successfully the ‚ÄúRestoring Success program‚Äù to return to profitability whilst reviewing various strategic options for this division.Year-to-date activity also benefited from the acquisition of Propak in June 2021 and FFP Packaging Solutions in August 2022 (impact of +4.0%). Foreign exchange had a +4.0% positive impact on sales.Constantia is carefully managing the inflationary cost environment as well as the availability of energy supply and raw materials. The Company is focusing its efforts on preserving the profitability working both on the passthrough of input costs as well as pursuing its cost control program. Constantia is also actively working on its supply base and energy supply sources in the context of a potential shortage of gas in Europe in the coming months.In August 2022  Constantia Flexibles has signed an agreement  to acquire 100% of FFP Packaging Solutions  a leading player for sustainable  flexible packaging in the film consumer market from Northampton  UK. This acquisition aligns well with Vision 2025 growth strategy of investing in competitive businesses with potential for future growth. FFP Packaging Solutions joining the Constantia Flexibles Group will expand its overall market position. Its significant experience and credibility allow for strong relationships across the UK food industry. The transaction closed in August.Stahl‚ÄîSales up 11.5% with organic growth of 7.8% mostly driven by price increases to offset input cost inflation(Full consolidation)Stahl  the world leader in coating layers and surface treatments for flexible materials  posted total sales of ‚Ç¨696.4 million in the first nine months of 2022  representing an increase of +11.5% over the period. Organic growth stood at +7.8% while FX contributed positively (+3.7%)  mostly through USD strengthening.Activity for the period is above expectations at group level  with a strong growth in Coatings and Leather over the past nine months. Growth was largely led by price/mix effects as volumes declined  notably due to (i) slowdown in certain end markets  (ii) China lockdowns and (iii) continued supply disruptions in automotive.Across all segments  price increases have been implemented since the beginning of the year to mitigate the strong impact of rising input costs. The company has taken and is ready to take additional measures to protect its margin where needed. Stahl‚Äôs management continues to closely monitor the inflationary environment  as well as the supply chain and potential energy disruptions.The order book slightly decreased following the strong commercial activity in H1 2022 but remains at high levels compared to historical standards.Stahl announced on July 5  2022  the submission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target  aligned with the most recent guidance provided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).Stahl‚Äôs SBTi submission includes a specific commitment regarding the company‚Äôs Scope 3 upstream emissions  which Stahl aims to reduce by at least 25% over the next 10 years  compared with the base year (2021). Stahl‚Äôs Scope 3 emissions currently represent over 90% of its carbon footprint. This reduction would primarily be achieved by Stahl replacing its fossil-based raw materials with lower-carbon alternatives. The target is a major step towards the objective of limiting global warming temperature increase to 1.5 ¬∞C above pre-industrial levels by 2050  as agreed at the 2015 Paris Climate Accords.Stahl‚Äôs extended commitment builds on the company‚Äôs existing targets to reduce its emission for Scopes 1 and 2  which were set shortly after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Stahl has since reduced its Scope 1 and 2 (direct) GHG emissions by more than 30%  thanks to operational efficiency gains and by decarbonizing its energy supply.In September 2022  Stahl has been awarded the highest EcoVadis Platinum rating  placing it within the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis. The award underlines Stahl‚Äôs commitment to collaborating with its partners to reduce its environmental impact and build a more responsible and transparent supply chain.Crisis Prevention Institute‚Äî9 months revenue growth of +16.1% as compared with 2021  +17.7% organically(Full consolidation since March 11  2022)Crisis Prevention Institute recorded revenue of $88.8 million in the first nine months of 2022  up +16.1% in total compared to the same period in 2021 and +17.7% organically. Foreign exchange impact was -1.6%.

ACAMS‚Äôs flagship Las Vegas conference  the largest organized by ACAMS  was held in October 2022  one month later than that of the prior year in September 2021  skewing the year-over-year comparison. Normalized for the timing of this event  pro forma growth over the first 9 months would have been +17.8%.The pro forma revenue growth was driven by post-COVID conference recovery and greater sales of Certifications  Memberships and Training  primarily a result of sales to larger enterprise customers. Revenue growth should ease and return to more normative levels for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.Tarkett‚ÄìQ3 turnover growth driven by solid performance in Sports and sales price increases(Accounted for by the equity method since 07.07.2021)The company reported its Q3 2022 sales on October 25  2022.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Aut‚Ä¶","Marketing authorisation in the European Economic Area anticipated in H1 2023LEIDEN  Netherlands  Oct. 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM /Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib has been validated for scientific evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The application  submitted earlier in October 2022  is for the investigational drug  leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adolescents and adults 12 years or older.In August 2022  Pharming announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA's CHMP. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorisation for leniolisib in the European Economic Area is anticipated in H1 2023.The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""EMA's validation for review of our MAA under an accelerated assessment pathway highlights Pharming's ongoing commitment to advance leniolisib as a targeted treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with APDS. We anticipate that leniolisib will fill an unmet need for patients with APDS  who currently rely on supportive therapies to treat their primary symptoms. This review constitutes a key milestone in Pharming's effort to give healthcare providers and their patients global access to leniolisib. We look forward to collaborating with EMA as needed throughout the regulatory process.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

This is the first time in five years that SATO is investing in new homes in the city.Despite the uncertainty in the market  SATO has succeeded in improving the occupancy rate.Summary for 1 July to 30 September 2022 (1 July to 30 September 2021)The economic occupancy rate in Finland was 95. 6 % (9 5 . 1 ).Net sales totalled EUR 7 2 . 6 million (7 4 . 9 ).Net rental income was EUR 5 4 . 0 million ( 57 .3) .Profit before taxes was EUR 38 . 4 million ( 40.5 ).The unrealised change in the fair value of investment properties included in the result was EUR 2. 9 million ( 2 . 4 ).Housing investments amounted to EUR 5 3 . 6 million ( 57 . 3 ) .Earnings per share were EUR 0.5 4 (0. 5 7).A total of 1 rental apartments (0)  0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 Flex Homes (0) were acquired or completed.President and CEO Antti Aarnio:During the period under review (1 July to 30 September 2022)  SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate improved and was 95.6% (95.1). Demand for rental homes picked up from the early months of the year  and the higher occupancy rate has mainly been attributable to growth in service consumption and the consequent improvement in service-sector employment rate as well as to upper secondary education resuming contact teaching. Economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in particular  the continued high level of new housing production has sustained intense competition for good tenants. Due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer increasing maintenance costs in full to apartment rents.With the choice available for those looking for a home growing  a successful customer experience plays an important role. SATO is investing strongly in its operations in 24/7 digital services and in presence close to customers.In August  SATO signed a contract under which we buy an apartment building from builders Lujatalo constructed in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental homes. This is the first time in five years that SATO is investing in new homes in the city. Construction started in August and the homes will be move-in ready in late October 2023.SATO is developing 257 new rental homes in the Finnoo district of Espoo  close to the new metro station. Construction started in August 2022 and the homes will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. Peijinkuja project is grounded in long-running development efforts where  together with the City of Espoo  we drafted a new local detailed plan for the terraced house property owned by SATO in the old Hannus area of detached houses that is now on its way to become the new Finnoo district of Espoo.In September  we published our Sustainability Programme for 2023‚àí2026. The programme is themed on sustainable housing  wellbeing in communities and sustainable profitability. We aim to be a forerunner in sustainable rental housing. SATO‚Äôs new Sustainability Programme is based on an analysis  conducted with stakeholders  of the elements of sustainability that are perceived to be the most important. The Sustainability Programme and its targets will serve as guidance in both day-to-day decision-making and more long-term development efforts.I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Story continuesOperating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO‚Äôs operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  the constant rise in costs and  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  the continued high level of rental housing supply.Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine that started in February is still continuing and has made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain and accelerated inflation. Exceptionally high inflation has forced central banks to respond to the situation by making rapid interest rate hikes. In September  the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the key interest rates by 75 basis points to 1.25%. The previous hike took place in July and was 50 basis points. The war in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty is eroding consumer confidence. Consumer confidence has remained at a very low level already since the spring and is dampening private consumption.In particular the surge in energy and food prices coinciding with climbing interest rates will reverse economic growth towards the end of the year. According to the Bank of Finland forecast of 15 September 2022  Finland‚Äôs economy is projected to grow by 2.2% this year following a robust start to the current year but then decline to 0.3% next year. The outlook is highly uncertain  but the forecast anticipates that the upward trend in prices will subside in late 2023 and the economy will resume slow growth in 2024.The record-high rate of construction seen for a long period of time will slow due to the economic uncertainty. Sales volumes of both new and old homes have decreased. Statistics published by the Federation of Real Estate Agency in August show a decrease in sales volumes of new and old homes compared with the figures reported for the spring and early summer. The figure was down by 21% compared with July 2021. According to data released by Statistics Finland in August  there was a 35% year-on-year decrease in building permits granted and a 12% year-on-year decrease in building projects started in Q2 of 2022. The number of residential units to be completed  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  will  however  remain at a high level during the rest of 2022 as well as throughout 2023  maintaining intense competition for tenants.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental homes and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Outside growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes home ownership in a growth centre even more challenging for people coming from those areas.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2022 (1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2021)Net sales and profitIn January‚ÄìSeptember 2022  SATO Corporation‚Äôs consolidated net sales totalled EUR 219.8 million (223.2).Operating profit was EUR 217.0 million (245.4).

The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war‚Äôs biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food and materials as well as in supply chains. The surge in prices has resulted in a rapid increase in the interest rate level. The increase in energy  food and consumer goods prices may slow economic growth  continue to considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company issued an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio.SATO currently has 522 apartments in St Petersburg. Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. SATO has made a decision in principle to exit the business in Russia. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has looked into opportunities to exit the business in Russia. According to the explorations  a speedy exit has not been possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent out the homes in St Petersburg for the time being until an exit method is found. The company is actively seeking a solution. There are risks related to the business environment in our St Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk  with related hedging options examined in accordance with our treasury policy. It is expected that the operating environment in Russia will be highly uncertain for a long period of time and could result in disruptions to SATO's business activities in Russia and with parties related to business in Russia. It may impact the ability of SATO to make payments to its suppliers  employees and authorities as well as receive payments from its customers  which could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on SATO's business in Russia and even result in SATO limiting or ceasing its operations in Russia and with parties related to Russia for a long period of time. Should the war in Ukraine be prolonged  carrying out business in Russia may have negative impacts on the company‚Äôs reputation and may hamper business in Finland or have adverse effects on the company‚Äôs ability to access finance in the market  which may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  financial costs or value of SATO-owned properties.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group‚Äôs website and Annual Report for 2021 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level.Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine that started in February is still continuing and has made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain and accelerated inflation. Exceptionally high inflation has forced central banks to respond to the situation by making rapid interest rate hikes. In September  the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the key interest rates by 75 basis points to 1.25%. The previous hike took place in July and was 50 basis points. The war in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty is eroding consumer confidence. Consumer confidence has remained at a very low level already since the spring and is dampening private consumption.In particular the surge in energy and food prices coinciding with climbing interest rates will reverse economic growth towards the end of the year. According to the Bank of Finland forecast of 15 September 2022  Finland‚Äôs economy is projected to grow by 2.2% this year following a robust start to the current year but then decline to 0.3% next year. The outlook is highly uncertain  but the forecast anticipates that the upward trend in prices will subside in late 2023 and the economy will resume slow growth in 2024.The surge in energy prices has a direct impact on the company‚Äôs profitability  as it is currently not possible to transfer costs in full directly to rents due to the intense competitive situation.The record-high rate of construction seen for a long period of time will slow due to the economic uncertainty. Sales volumes of both new and old homes have decreased. Statistics published by the Federation of Real Estate Agency in August show a decrease in sales volumes of new and old homes compared with the figures reported for the spring and early summer. The figure was down by 21% compared with July 2021. According to data released by Statistics Finland in August  there was a 35% year-on-year decrease in building permits granted and a 12% year-on-year decrease in building projects started in Q2 of 2022. The number of residential units to be completed  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  will  however  remain at a high level during the rest of 2022 as well as throughout 2023  maintaining intense competition for tenants. The improved service-sector employment rate and the resumption of contact teaching in upper secondary education have resulted in demand for rental homes picking up  which is reflected in an improved occupancy rate. The economic uncertainty  pressure for interest rate hikes and increases in consumer prices have also been in part reflected in increased demand for rental homes.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants and was reflected over the period under review in SATO‚Äôs business as a slight decrease in average rents year on year. With greater choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.SATO Corporation‚Äôs shareholders on 30 September 2022Largest shareholders and their holdingsno. of shares % Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder) 31 971 535 56.3%Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool 12 811 647 22.6%Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company 7 233 081 12.7%State Pension Fund of Finland 2 796 200 4.9%Valkila Erkka 385 000 0.7%SATO Corporation 166 000 0.3%Entel√§ Tuula 159 000 0.3%Heinonen Erkki 146 684 0.3%Tradeka-invest Ltd 126 500 0.2%Others (118 shareholders) 987 420 1.7%On 30 September 2022  SATO had 56 783 067 shares and 127 shareholders registered in the book-entry system.

The strong performance of our professional business compensated lower consumer demand and the continued slowdown in China. We managed to improve profitability compared to the second quarter despite the impact of energy costs and currency movements. As expected  our free cash flow generation strengthened  driven by improved profitability and the stabilization of our working capital. Given the uncertain near-term outlook  the continued softness of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. Regarding the adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow  we are targeting the lower end of both guidance ranges ‚Äù said CEO Eric Rondolat.‚ÄúAs we enter the final quarter of 2022  we have shifted gears to adapt the company to a structurally weaker external environment in the coming quarters  when current headwinds and volatility are likely to persist. We will therefore focus on measures to control costs and cash flow  in line with our track record of delivering margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation in difficult environments. While some areas will be more affected  connected energy efficient lighting solutions will continue to benefit from strong demand given the energy prices surge.‚ÄùBrighter Lives  Better World 2025In the third quarter of the year  Signify continued to deliver on its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Double the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track  mainly driven by energy-efficient and connected LED lightingDouble Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues were at 30% and on track. This positive trend is driven by serviceable and circular luminairesDouble Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues increased to 28%  mainly driven by the Safety & security and consumer well-being portfoliosDouble the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 27%  stable with Q2. Signify continued to create action plans to address gaps and accelerate its progress. In addition  Signify published its first-ever Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion report.OutlookGiven the uncertain near-term outlook and the continued softness both of the consumer segment and of the Chinese market  we now expect to achieve comparable sales growth between 2% and 3% for the full year 2022. We are targeting the lower end of the range for both the 11.0-11.4% Adjusted EBITA margin guidance and the 5-7% free cash flow guidance.Financial reviewThird quarter Nine months 2021 2022 change in millions of EUR  except percentages 2021 2022 change 4.3 % Comparable sales growth 5.3 % 8.1 % Effects of currency movements 6.6 % 4.0 % Consolidation and other changes 2.2 % 1 643 1 912 16.3 % Sales 4 852 5 536 14.1 % 634 713 12.6 % Adjusted gross margin 1 909 2 072 8.6 % 38.6% 37.3% Adj. gross margin (as % of sales) 39.3% 37.4% -415 -471 Adj.

Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 8.1%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD  and a positive effect of 4.0% from the Q2 acquisitions of Fluence and Pierlite.The Adjusted gross margin decreased by 130 bps to 37.3%. While continued price increases more than offset the input cost increases and the surge in energy costs  the Adjusted gross margin was impacted by an adverse currency effect. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 80 bps to 28.6%  driven by operating leverage and strengthened cost discipline.Adjusted EBITA was EUR 199 million  up 9.1% vs. Q3 2021. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 70 bps to 10.4%  with price increases more than offsetting higher input costs. Yet  the Adjusted EBITA margin was negatively affected by a 220bps currency effect  being the combination both from the weakening of the EUR versus the USD and CNY  and from a temporary FX hedging headwind. Excluding this temporary adverse hedging effect  the Adjusted EBITA margin was stable vs Q3 21.Adjusted items were EUR -6 million. Restructuring costs decreased year on year to EUR -6 million  while acquisition-related charges of EUR -10 million were fully compensated by incidental items of EUR 10 million. The incidental items benefited from a release of tax indemnification liabilities. Net income increased by 18.4% from EUR 94 million to EUR 112 million.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 37 069 at the end of Q3 21 to 34 273 at the end of Q3 22. The employee base was exceptionally high in Q3 21  due to the strong volume recovery and additional staff requirements in factories  following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.1 This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

(NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30  2022. Further details can be found in the supplemental presentation accompanying this release and published in the investor relations section of our website.Record backlog of $2 254.1 million (+104% versus prior year) is our eighth consecutive record backlog quarter  surpassing $2 billion for the first time in our historyRecord sales of $412.1 million (+25.5% versus prior year) including foreign exchange headwinds and project timing movementsRecord reported gross margin of $104.6 million (+39.7% versus prior year) reflected volume  pricing  productivity and cost control actions and resulted in reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4%  the highest since the first quarter of 2021 (adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales of 27.3%)Record reported operating income of $41.7 million (+202.2% versus prior year) contributed to record reported non-diluted earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS)‚Äù of $1.15 and record adjusted non-diluted EPS of $1.49Reported 10.1% operating income as a percent of sales (adjusted 12.6%) was our highest since the third quarter 2020 and including this quarter has only been achieved four times in ten yearsThird quarter 2022 orders of $729.4 million  including 71 orders each over $1 million  a 108% increase compared to the third quarter 2021Received Full Notice to Proceed (‚ÄúFNTP‚Äù) on Venture Global Plaquemine‚Äôs Phase 2 Big LNG project  resulting in a third quarter order of $91.8 millionInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (‚ÄúIRA‚Äù) continues to accelerate commercial activity  thereby increasing our estimated total addressable market (‚ÄúTAM‚Äù) for Specialty Products in the near-term to $9.65 billion (prior was $7.65 billion) and 2030 TAM to $49.25 billion (prior was $42.0 billion)2022 full-year sales guidance range of $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion (prior guidance of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion); associated 2022 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance is in the range of $5.00 to $5.25 (prior guidance of $5.20 to 5.60) on 35.87 million shares outstanding (prior 35.86 million shares) and a tax rate of 17% (prior tax rate of 20%)2023 full-year sales outlook range of $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion; associated 2023 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS outlook is in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 on 35.87 million shares outstanding and a tax rate of 19%Story continuesThird quarter 2022 was all-time record backlog  sales  reported gross margin  reported operating income  reported non-diluted EPS and adjusted non-diluted EPS  amongst numerous other historical records within the business.Our third quarter 2022 orders of $729.4 million (second highest in our history with our top three quarters all occurring in 2022) contributed to our eighth consecutive quarter of record backlog ($2 254.1 million); backlog is 104% higher than one year ago and sequentially 15% higher than the second quarter 2022  which was our highest order quarter in our history. Both Heat Transfer Systems (‚ÄúHTS‚Äù) and Specialty Products have record backlogs as of the third quarter 2022. Additionally  all three of quarters in 2022 to date have had book-to-bill ratios above 1.8  which is a contributor to our outlook for 2023 sales to grow between 23% and 30% year-over-year over.We posted record sales of $412.1 million (an increase of 25.5% versus prior year) in the quarter  which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange (‚ÄúFX‚Äù) headwinds primarily in our Cryo Tank Solutions (‚ÄúCTS‚Äù) segment and as is typical between quarters  project timing movements related to liquefaction projects in Specialty Products. We estimate that foreign exchange headwinds had a $17 million negative impact on sales  with the U.S. dollar appreciating versus the Euro and the Indian Rupee. Note that we do not addback or adjust for foreign exchange impacts in our adjusted EPS. In addition to our total record sales  we set sales records in the quarter for mobile equipment  brazed aluminum heat exchangers  systems  space exploration  L.A. Turbine‚Äôs aftermarket and VRV.Third quarter 2022 reported gross margin of $104.6 million was the highest in our history and 39.7% higher than the third quarter 2021  reflecting our increasing positive margin mix  pricing actions taken  productivity and cost control. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4% was the highest since the second quarter of 2021  and when adjusted for one-time items including restructuring and start and capacity expansion costs was 27.3%; three of our four segments reported gross margin as a percent of sales increased by more than 170 basis points sequentially compared to the second quarter 2022 with HTS increasing 720 basis points. This contributed to record reported operating income of $41.7 million  an increase of 202.2% compared to the third quarter 2021 and when adjusted for one-time items such as deal-related costs and restructuring  record adjusted operating income of $51.9 million. The third quarter 2022 was only the fourth time in the past decade that we had reported operating income as a percent of sales of 10.1% (adjusted 12.6%). HTS also had record operating income and operating income as a percent of sales in the quarter.Third quarter 2022 reported non-diluted EPS of $1.15 is a historical record and reflects the ongoing efforts of our global flexible manufacturing footprint to optimize ‚Äúwhere we make what‚Äù; when adjusted for one-time items primarily related to deal costs  year-one integrations and organic startup & capacity expenses  our adjusted non-diluted EPS is $1.49  also a record. As noted above  we did not addback the negative impact to sales or EPS from FX rate changes and we anticipate that these will continue to be variable in the coming quarters. We estimate the third quarter 2022 impact from the foreign exchange rate changes to be approximately net negative $0.06 to EPS (net of translation and transaction).Macro tailwinds are bolstering demand for multiple solutions in our portfolio; including energy security & access (LNG) and government actions such as the IRA (accelerating activity in Specialty Products).Macro TailwindsEnergy security  resiliency  access and independence continues to be a priority for countries around the world  with meaningful focus on Europe. This has been further heightened as winter nears  as well as the supply-demand linkage of available LNG. It is anticipated that gas demand increases each year globally between now and 2035  and in turn  more LNG supply capacity is anticipated to move to Final Investment Decision (‚ÄúFID‚Äù) and construction this decade. Additionally  United States rig count is at pre-pandemic levels  and we are seeing an increase in air cooler equipment sales.As we stated at the end of the second quarter 2022  and we reiterate now  the increase in immediacy for energy security has not come at the expense of the clean energy transition ‚Äì rather there is a heightened focus on all energy. Additionally  the third quarter 2022 brought further tailwinds to many of the end markets we serve with our Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢ - clean power  clean water  clean food and clean industrials. One such tailwind was the passing of the IRA in August 2022  which approved $300 billion in spending for energy and climate change  with multiple areas of the IRA directly supporting investments being made by our customers in hydrogen  carbon capture  water  and industrial manufacturing. And hydrogen is not only limited to commercialization as the result of the IRA ‚Äì global funding commitments to 2030 now total $240 billion  up approximately 50% from a year ago  and cover the European Union and 22 other countries.In addition to the IRA  CO2 shortage continues to drive global interest in carbon capture solutions from small-scale (Chart‚Äôs Earthly Labs small-scale CiCi solution) to large industrial scale (Chart‚Äôs SES cryogenic carbon capture solution) and this 30% shortage is expected to continue with further permanent reductions in availability  thereby making CO2 recovery more important to the resolution of this challenge  as well as being a key part of the carbon emission reduction public and private sector targets.In summary  in the $729.4 million of orders booked in the third quarter 2022 there were 71 orders greater than $1 million each  bringing the year-to-date number to 197. Year-to-date through September 30  2022  individual orders each greater than $1 million grew 29.6% compared to the same period in 2021 and is at 87% of the full year 2021.In addition to our commercial pipeline for potential orders in the next 24 months being over $9.5 billion in active  various stage discussions  we have continued to see broad-based demand in October 2022 to start the fourth quarter. Month-to-date as of October 26  2022  we have received 17 orders each greater than $1 million dollars; of these larger orders  the range was wide ‚Äì from two multi-million dollar space exploration orders to regas to a refurbishment of a cold box  to multiple air cooler orders  to LNG fueling stations to a large bulk tank order for an industrial gas customer and a $3 million water treatment order.LNG  LNG  LNG.As winter approaches  in particular in the European Union  energy security and access are creating new and more imminent LNG opportunities  resulting in the continued increase in the four categories of LNG that we serve:Big LNG: In the third quarter 2022  we received FNTP on the remaining 12 cold box systems for Venture Global Plaquemines Phase 2 LNG export project. The third quarter order totaled $91.8 million  bringing our year-to-date Big LNG related orders to $620.7 million. Additionally  we have seen incremental increases to our potential future Big LNG orders since February 2022  driven by more international interest in modular mid-scale terminals  interest in our heavy hydrocarbon (‚ÄúHHC‚Äù) removal and nitrogen-rejection unit (‚ÄúNRU‚Äù) capabilities and more projects intending to move to FID. Currently our ‚Äúnot yet booked‚Äù commercial opportunities for Big LNG total $5.68 billion  inclusive of retrofit; this is an increase to our pipeline since the end of the second quarter 2022 of $330 million  even after booking another $91.8 million related to the Venture Global Plaquemines 2 project in the third quarter 2022. Small-scale and floating LNG: We received commitments from three customers for small-scale and floating liquefaction projects in the third quarter  totaling $175 million. Even considering these orders  our commercial pipeline continues to grow for this category of LNG (318 potential projects globally)  with floating LNG opportunities at their all-time high. LNG infrastructure: We sell various equipment into the LNG infrastructure end-market and continue to see demand for fueling stations (12 ordered in the third quarter 2022)  regas systems  and other related tanks and trailers. ISO containers had record demand in the third quarter 2022  with 226 units sold. We had two regas orders in the quarter and growth in our vehicle fueling stations business compared to the third quarter 2021. And while year-to-date 2022 demand for HLNG over-the-road vehicle tanks has been meaningfully weaker than the same period in 2021  we saw a nearly 200% increase sequentially from the second quarter 2022 in these orders. LNG retrofits  refurbishments  repairs: We continue to see orders related to modifications and extensions of regas stations  with orders in the third quarter 2022 from Italgas. Additionally  we are receiving inbound requests for retrofits and refurbishments as well as expansions of brownfield facilities. This trend is expected to continue  in particular as timing of construction of new builds does not address the immediate need for additional gas supply  and numerous customers are looking for long-term lifecycle services more so than previously.IRA accelerating activity in Specialty Products.The IRA in the United States is accelerating activity in our business in key areas that benefit within the IRA  including carbon capture  hydrogen  fuel refueling  water and industrial facilities. We believe that the IRA will accelerate certain investments and purchases from our customers in carbon capture and storage (‚ÄúCCUS‚Äù)  hydrogen and water in particular. In the third quarter 2022  Specialty Products orders were $202.9 million  our second consecutive quarter with Specialty Products orders above $200 million  and bringing year-to-date to $569.1 million  over 88% of the full year 2021 Specialty Products orders. With seven consecutive quarters having Specialty Products orders greater than $100 million each  the business is proving to be a consistent and increasing contributor to our overall growth.Hydrogen orders of $102.4 million in the third quarter 2022 included a large hydrogen liquefaction order from a North American customer bringing our year-to-date 2022 hydrogen related orders above our full year 2021 of $282.1 million. Additionally  the same customer has signed a letter of intent (not booked as an order or in backlog) with Chart for process and equipment for the additional three phases of the project  each 250 Megawatts  with the same content as the first phase. Also  in the quarter we received a $6.2 million order for hydrogen systems and equipment from a European shipyard  who  with Chart  is working closely with a large European cruise line on a hydrogen powered vessel  a $5.8 million order for two of the first transportable fuel stations for hydrogen fuel cell trucks and liquid hydrogen tank orders for a major industrial gas customer‚Äôs liquefaction plant in Europe. Importantly  this is another example of the global adoption of liquid hydrogen (historically Europe was predominantly focused on gaseous hydrogen). While not yet booked  we also received a letter of intent (‚ÄúLOI‚Äù) from one of our industrial gas customers for a hydrogen liquefaction plant  which we expect could move to order in 2023.We saw meaningfully more inbound interest in our CCUS offering since the IRA was approved than we had prior  including a pipeline of 363 customers and potential customers (+142% since December 31  2021). In our Earthly Labs‚Äô small-scale CCUS business  we successfully installed a CiCi unit at a large winery  shipping our first Earthly Labs‚Äô units to New Zealand  Australia and the United Kingdom early this quarter. Additionally  new inbound opportunities in our small-scale Earthly Labs carbon capture business totaled $9.22 million in the 75 days following the IRA announcement  compared to new opportunities in the 60 days prior to the IRA of $5.56 million. In the third quarter 2022  we booked orders for our SES cryogenic carbon capture solutions (‚ÄúSES CCC‚Äù) with a customer in Saudi Arabia  as well as with a European energy infrastructure company. We signed 4 Memorandums of Understanding (‚ÄúMOUs‚Äù) related to CCUS in the third quarter 2022  including one with C.A.T. Group and one with Koch for partnering on CCUS project work. We received an order for a feasibility study with Fluxys  with whom we are excited to collaborate on the application of our SES CCC technology to their emissions sources to support their net zero emissions target.We received $16.7 million in orders for water treatment systems in the third quarter 2022  the second highest in our history  and multiple orders for full treatment solutions  each over $2 million  such as an order from Smith Construction for Madera County  California manganese treatment for drinking water  another from Garney Construction for Brighton  Colorado nitrate treatment for drinking water  and a $4.67 million order in India.We have also been seeing an increase in clean air (methane emission elimination) activity  which also will benefit from the IRA  with $5.6M in orders through Q3 and new commitments equaling that total in the first 3 weeks Q4. And not to be left out  we received record ISO container orders (226) in the quarter  as well as the largest order of the year-to-date in food & beverage for QT‚Äôs new convenience Stores. As the result of this continued and consistent order activity as well as the IRA adding more certainty to this decade opportunities  we are increasing our estimated total addressable market in the near-term from $7.7 billion to $9.65 billion for Specialty Products  and to $49.25 billion through 2030 from $42.0 billion.Third quarter 2022: Eight MOUs and partnerships executed  eight new certifications received  79 additional new customer orders  17 new first-of-a-kind (‚ÄúFOAK‚Äù) orders and expanded organic capacity drive further differentiation of the Chart business.We continue to expand our business globally through partnerships  leading regional certifications in our specialty markets  and utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to serve new customers and new applications with our cryogenic expertise.In the third quarter 2022 we executed eight MOUs of which two included master supply agreements. Four were related to carbon capture and CO2 equipment  and two for hydrogen  and one each for liquefaction and LNG  further demonstrating the breadth of our solution offering and penetration across the Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢. One of the master supply agreements was for LNG equipment with Yanchange and Shell Petroleum  while another was with a major beverage company for carbon capture and storage technology and equipment.Our 79 new customers this quarter (bringing year-to-date through third quarter 2022 to 248) were across a broad reach of geographies. 43% of the third quarter 2022 new customers were North American  37% Asia Pacific and approximately 20% were in Europe and the Middle East.FOAK orders of 17 in the third quarter 2022 were also comprised of geographic and application breadth. We kicked off the first feasibility study with Bioveritas for carbon capture with bio-based food ingredients  booked an order with Firefly for a space exploration application  and welcomed new customer PT Arohera in Asia Pacific for food and beverage equipment for their end user  a global food manufacturer.Certifications globally and regionally in cryogenic equipment are a key differentiator  especially in newer end markets that have localized requirements. In the third quarter 2022  we received numerous new certifications (11  not including normal course of business renewals)  including approvals for specific product lines for use in Australia  Canada  and Korea (specifics can be found on slide 21 of the supplemental presentation).Our organic capacity expansions remain on track  and in some cases are ahead of schedule where we were able to accelerate toward completion as demand continues to increase. September 2022 marked the exciting arrival of our brazing furnace at our Tulsa  Oklahoma flexible manufacturing facility. We will begin post brazing in the fourth quarter 2022 at this site  offering additional capacity and shorter lead-times for certain brazed aluminum heat exchangers. Our Goch  Germany trailer facility expansion remains on track for second half 2023 production and is an example of our incorporation of ESG into our manufacturing  with the design including heat pumps with low energy consumption and extra insulation for less energy usage.Margin improvement resulting from our actions taken to respond to cost changes with pricing and surcharges and ongoing improving productivity; despite ongoing macroeconomic inflationary and supply chain challenges.In the third quarter 2022  input costs were similar to the second quarter 2022 (i.e. indexes are stabilizing)  yet with the backdrop of continued geopolitical and inflationary uncertainty. Gas and energy prices are a key driver in component availability and costs  in particular in the EU  and while recent prices have been declining  they are still over five times the 2019 standard price. In the EU  the shortage of supply and the rising energy prices could impact raw material producers  and therefore we have and continue to proactively fortify our supply chain channels both globally and locally to reduce the associated risks. Examples of this include future volume commitments on material and components that are more readily available now  and ensuring that we can access material locally in all geographies in which we manufacture in. Despite the ongoing and well-discussed supply chain challenges  12 of our manufacturing facilities had 100% on-time delivery in the third quarter 2022.Third quarter 2022 reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4% was 27.3% when adjusting for organic startup and capacity  year-one integration and other one-time expenses  our highest gross margin as a percent of sales quarter since the second quarter 2021 and in line with our sequential quarterly anticipated margin improvement  which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter 2022. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales increased more than 200 basis points sequentially in the third quarter 2022 when compared to the second quarter 2022 in three of our four segments  with HTS at 21.6% (an increase of 720 bps sequentially) and RSL at 38.4% (an increase of 410 bps sequentially). CTS reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 18.0% reflected our first quarter of sequential margin improvement in a year  in part driven by the pull in of lower margin backlog to the second quarter 2022. Specialty Products  which typically has volume and mix movements between quarters  had lower than anticipated sales driven by the timing shifts of two projects‚Äô revenue recognition due to timing of inbound components  which are anticipated to be recognized in the fourth quarter 2022. This project mix shift negatively impacted reported gross margin as a percent of sales for Specialty Products  which was 31.6% for the third quarter 2022. Also impacting the segment was the continued low volume in higher margined HLNG vehicle tanks and one large customer freight revenue which had no associated margin  neither of which are considered adjustments to our adjusted gross profit or adjusted operating profit. We did finalize our year-one integrations for AdEdge and L.A. Turbine  and when adjusting for integration  startup/capacity and restructuring costs in Specialty Products  adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.6%  similar to the second quarter 2022 adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales of 35.8%.Our reported operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 of 10.1% was an increase of 590 basis points compared to the third quarter 2021. It is also worth noting that in the third quarter 2021  we did not include any short-term incentive compensation expense as we were not hitting the threshold. In each quarter of 2022  including the third quarter  we have been booking our short-term incentive costs through SG&A. Therefore  the increase in reported operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 compared to the third quarter 2021 is operationally even more significant (an increase of 710 basis points). When adjusted for one-time and unusual items  adjusted operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 was 12.6%.‚ÄúThe third quarter of 2022 not only reinforced our customers‚Äô continued broad-based demand for LNG and solutions across our Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢ serving power  water  food and industrials  our outlook for 2023 and the coming decade was further bolstered by the passing of the IRA at a macro level and our record backlog  sales  gross profit  operating profit and EPS ‚Äù stated Jill Evanko  Chart‚Äôs CEO and President. ‚ÄúWe continue to execute our margin expansion activities ranging from pricing to organic productivity  which was reflected in the sequential margin improvement and our anticipated sequential margin expansion in the fourth quarter 2022 and into 2023.‚ÄùFree cash flow generation.In the third quarter 2022  we generated $37 million cash from operations  had $18 million of capital expenditures related activity  and $17 million of unusual addback items (including $2 million for escrow payments for Earthly Labs)  resulting in adjusted free cash flow (‚ÄúFCF‚Äù) of $36 million. This brings year-to-date adjusted FCF to $68 million. Considering the expected timing of larger project milestone payments (over $100 million expected) in the fourth quarter 2022  our full year FCF outlook is approximately $175 million. We accelerated certain capital projects expenditures related to capacity expansions into the third quarter 2022 as we continue to see lead-time and increased demand for deliveries across the next 24 months. Specifically  we pulled ahead capital to accelerate our ability to produce in our expanded roof-covered facility in New Iberia  Louisiana (cold box shop) and certain activities in our Tulsa  Oklahoma flexible manufacturing facility. As of the end of the third quarter 2022  our net leverage ratio is 2.92  and during the quarter we repaid $80M million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during the third quarter 2022.2022 Guidance.Our outlook for 2022 for sales is in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion  with associated adjusted non-diluted EPS in the range of $5.00 to $5.25 on approximately 35.87 million weighted shares outstanding with an assumed tax rate of 17%. The change to our prior sales guidance of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion is driven by currency headwinds and timing of specific project revenue recognition  which is typical in our business.2023 first outlook with increased confidence driven by record backlog  multiple global tailwinds and customers‚Äô forecasts.Our outlook for 2023 for sales is in a range of $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion  which includes only Big LNG projects that are in backlog as of September 30  2022. Associated adjusted non-diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 on 35.87 million weighted shares outstanding. This assumes a tax rate of 19%. Note that this outlook does not include any new or additional mid-size or large projects that could come into the order book between now and the end of the first half 2023 which we would anticipate having sales associated with them in the year. If one or more mid or large-size project comes into the order book between now and the end of the first quarter 2023  we would anticipate recognizing between $50 to $75 million dollars more of revenue into the full year.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Given the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the steps taken by the Company  the suspension of the listing of the Company's shares (ISIN: FR0010879056) is maintained until further notice.ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the ‚Äúmicrobial dark matter‚Äù. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.Story continuesThis breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI ‚Äì code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial and Administrative Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72communication@deinove.comAttachment",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.16,0.69,True,English,"['DEINOVE REQUESTS RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDINGS', 'proc√©dure de redressement judiciaire', 'Phase II clinical trial', 'severe Clostridioides difficile infection', 'first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms', 'world-class academic, technological, industrial', 'employee representative bodies', 'microbial dark matter', 'several development programs', 'low concentrated compounds', 'first antibiotic candidate', 'complex chemical structures', 'Montpellier Commercial Court', 'urgent, global challenge', 'best possible conditions', 'French biotech company', 'French biotechnology company', 'new bacterial micro-factories', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'first emergencies', 'industrial production', 'antibiotic resistance', 'global health', 'economic challenge', 'chemical synthesis', 'bacterial biodiversity', 'new domain', 'new therapies', 'bacterial extracts', 'EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ', 'd√©claration', 'business activity', 'recovery plan', 'sale plan', 'current activities', 'observation period', 'financial markets', 'press release', 'metabolic potential', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'life-threatening infections', 'high speed', 'breakthrough approach', 'unique collection', 'other issue', 'Euromedecine park', 'institutional partners', 'Mario Alcaraz', 'Chief Financial', 'Administrative Officer', 'ATCG Partners', 'The Company', 'rare bacteria', '10,000 rare strains', 'receivership proceedings', 'Deinove', 'ALDEI', 'pioneer', 'exploration', 'exploitation', 'declaration', 'cessation', 'payments', 'paiements', 'request', 'advance', 'purpose', 'solutions', 'employment', 'liabilities', 'process', 'investors', 'framework', 'way', 'continuation', 'decision', 'listing', 'shares', 'October', 'opening', 'trading', 'publication', 'notice', 'uncertainty', 'outcome', 'steps', 'suspension', 'ISIN', 'superbugs', 'microbes', 'antimicrobials', 'Story', 'rise', 'thousands', 'race', 'heart', 'code', '45 employees', 'network', 'CONTACTS', 'Media', 'communication', 'Attachment', '9']",2022-10-28,2022-10-29,finance.yahoo.com
12358,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550699-flow-traders-a-hedge-against-the-next-volatility-spike,Flow Traders Stock: A Hedge Against The Next Volatility Spike (OTCMKTS:FLTDF),Flow Traders posted a better than expected quarter which incited a rally. See why we believe FLTDF stock is a tough hold for investors.,DNY59Flow Traders (OTCPK:FLTDF) profits from volatile situations in the financial markets. It often earns the most on the worst days in the market as volatility spikes. The company offered a good hedge in the past. It grows through the cycle as it expands its reach into more markets and products.I believe it's impossible to predict what will cause the next volatility spike. Hence I don't know when such a spike would happen. There are many scenarios that could cause distress such as an invasion in Taiwan  further escalation of the war in Ukraine  or a rougher recession than the markets anticipate.Flow Traders is a Dutch company and its figures are in EUR.Business CaseAs a liquidity provider of financial products  Flow Traders makes money on the small difference between the bid and ask prices and market mispricing between financial markets. It reduces the spread of financial products while providing liquidity. It sounds complicated  but it's actually pretty simple if you think about it. Flow Traders improves the market and profits from tiny anomalies in the market.As it earns more money during volatile times  it's a bit of a hedge against financial market turmoil with high volatility. It's not the same as hedging against the market as Flow Traders also makes money during normal times.GrowthFlow Traders' YoY and QoQ growth are hard to catch. Its revenue and profits swing a lot depending on volatility. Its results are also tough to predict. This 'black box' effect isn't liked by analysts as its earnings often differ far from their expectations. Periods with extremely high volatility like March 2020 guarantee rocketing earnings. Recent volatility spikes were a lot lower and didn't fuel outstanding earnings.The long-term growth of Flower Traders is measurable through the ETP AUM (Exchange Traded Products Assets Under Management) evolution and the ETP value traded.Flow Traders Investor RelationsThese graphs show a steady increase throughout the years. The strategy of adding new markets and trade products works for Flow Traders. It enhances its coverage of fixed-income products  currencies  and cryptocurrencies. Its value traded tripled since 2017 (31.7% CAGR growth) and ETP AUM increased by 22.5% since 2014.Net trading income grew slower than value traded since 2017 at a CAGR of 23.5%. Still impressive.Future GrowthThe overall outlook for Flow Traders looks positive. Its potential markets expand quickly.BlackRockThe trends for Flow Traders are positive. ETFs AUM is expected to grow by 40% in just two years. The drivers behind this strong ETF growth are simple: costs  efficiency  liquidity  and almost endless investment-style possibilities.Flow Traders' latest ETP and non-ETP value traded shows the differentiation into fixed income and currency  crypto  and commodity products works.Flow TradersThe steep reduction in ETP value traded in Q3 was partially compensated by its non-ETP value traded.Free Cash Flow And Shareholder ReturnsFree cash flow is vital as this is what a company could use for shareholder returns. Potential buybacks or dividends are only possible if the company produces enough cash. Flow Traders produces positive free cash flows that are on average in line with its net profits.Flow TradersThe first half of 2022 was rather weak compared to the ‚Ç¨63.5M net profit with ‚Ç¨24.6M operating cash flow and ‚Ç¨21M free cash flow. I expect the company to increase free cash flow again in the next six to twelve months.Dividend And BuybacksFlow Traders pays a half-yearly dividend in May and August. It reduced its payout ratio to 51% since Q4 2021 to retain capital for trading opportunities and growth activities. It makes sense as fixed-income markets see a revival. It wasn't appreciated by shareholders who didn't expect the payout reduction. The previous payout ratio was 60% to 80%.It also regularly uses buyback programs to return cash to shareholders. Its latest program of ‚Ç¨25M just increased to ‚Ç¨40M. ‚Ç¨30.9M remains available for repurchases. The program converts to a ~4% buyback yield.The TTM dividend yield looks good too at ~5%. It's clearly a shareholder-friendly management with consistent returns to stockholders.Looking forward  the dividend yield could easily remain above 5% with the 51% payout ratio. A total dividend of at least ‚Ç¨1.31 can be expected with the current 2022 EPS (excluding Q4).ValuationAs I've indicated earlier  the black-box nature of Flow Traders' results makes them hard to predict. This probably causes a discount that won't fade soon. Still  the company increased its AUM impressively and doesn't trade much higher than in 2017.Seeking Alpha Seeking AlphaFlow Traders' PS and PE ratio was only lower in 2020 when it earned phenomenally during the covid crash. Such extraordinary results deform the valuation as it isn't sustainable. Today  its earnings are what can be expected during normal times.Flow Traders is cheaply valued. It earned ‚Ç¨2.67 EPS over the first nine months of 2022. Even if the fourth quarter doesn't add any earnings  it would trade at an 8.8 PE ratio. It earned ‚Ç¨2.63 EPS in 2021  it now trades at 8.9 times 2021 earnings.ConclusionThe stock is cheaply priced but often took a beating on results over the past few quarters. The last quarter caused an upward spike again and could be a turn in sentiment.Almost every earnings release is a volatile event for Flow Traders. This makes it a tough stock to hold for a lot of investors. I've personally taken some profits in 2021 and repurchased these shares recently. I expect the earnings volatility will remain as both analysts and investors don't like the unpredictability.I see a long-term opportunity to partially hedge my portfolio against black swans and coinciding volatility spikes. I don't mind the fluctuations in earnings. In the meantime  the company pays a decent dividend in May and August.The Flow Traders' stock on the U.S. market has low liquidity.

This is the first time in five years that SATO is investing in new homes in the city.Despite the uncertainty in the market  SATO has succeeded in improving the occupancy rate.Summary for 1 July to 30 September 2022 (1 July to 30 September 2021)The economic occupancy rate in Finland was 95. 6 % (9 5 . 1 ).Net sales totalled EUR 7 2 . 6 million (7 4 . 9 ).Net rental income was EUR 5 4 . 0 million ( 57 .3) .Profit before taxes was EUR 38 . 4 million ( 40.5 ).The unrealised change in the fair value of investment properties included in the result was EUR 2. 9 million ( 2 . 4 ).Housing investments amounted to EUR 5 3 . 6 million ( 57 . 3 ) .Earnings per share were EUR 0.5 4 (0. 5 7).A total of 1 rental apartments (0)  0 owner-occupied apartments (0) and 0 Flex Homes (0) were acquired or completed.President and CEO Antti Aarnio:During the period under review (1 July to 30 September 2022)  SATO‚Äôs occupancy rate improved and was 95.6% (95.1). Demand for rental homes picked up from the early months of the year  and the higher occupancy rate has mainly been attributable to growth in service consumption and the consequent improvement in service-sector employment rate as well as to upper secondary education resuming contact teaching. Economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in particular  the continued high level of new housing production has sustained intense competition for good tenants. Due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer increasing maintenance costs in full to apartment rents.With the choice available for those looking for a home growing  a successful customer experience plays an important role. SATO is investing strongly in its operations in 24/7 digital services and in presence close to customers.In August  SATO signed a contract under which we buy an apartment building from builders Lujatalo constructed in Skanssi  Turku. The eight-storey building at the address Sorakatu 9 will have 77 new rental homes. This is the first time in five years that SATO is investing in new homes in the city. Construction started in August and the homes will be move-in ready in late October 2023.SATO is developing 257 new rental homes in the Finnoo district of Espoo  close to the new metro station. Construction started in August 2022 and the homes will be completed in stages during autumn 2024. Peijinkuja project is grounded in long-running development efforts where  together with the City of Espoo  we drafted a new local detailed plan for the terraced house property owned by SATO in the old Hannus area of detached houses that is now on its way to become the new Finnoo district of Espoo.In September  we published our Sustainability Programme for 2023‚àí2026. The programme is themed on sustainable housing  wellbeing in communities and sustainable profitability. We aim to be a forerunner in sustainable rental housing. SATO‚Äôs new Sustainability Programme is based on an analysis  conducted with stakeholders  of the elements of sustainability that are perceived to be the most important. The Sustainability Programme and its targets will serve as guidance in both day-to-day decision-making and more long-term development efforts.I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Operating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO‚Äôs operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  the constant rise in costs and  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  the continued high level of rental housing supply.Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine that started in February is still continuing and has made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain and accelerated inflation. Exceptionally high inflation has forced central banks to respond to the situation by making rapid interest rate hikes. In September  the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the key interest rates by 75 basis points to 1.25%. The previous hike took place in July and was 50 basis points. The war in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty is eroding consumer confidence. Consumer confidence has remained at a very low level already since the spring and is dampening private consumption.In particular the surge in energy and food prices coinciding with climbing interest rates will reverse economic growth towards the end of the year. According to the Bank of Finland forecast of 15 September 2022  Finland‚Äôs economy is projected to grow by 2.2% this year following a robust start to the current year but then decline to 0.3% next year. The outlook is highly uncertain  but the forecast anticipates that the upward trend in prices will subside in late 2023 and the economy will resume slow growth in 2024.The record-high rate of construction seen for a long period of time will slow due to the economic uncertainty. Sales volumes of both new and old homes have decreased. Statistics published by the Federation of Real Estate Agency in August show a decrease in sales volumes of new and old homes compared with the figures reported for the spring and early summer. The figure was down by 21% compared with July 2021. According to data released by Statistics Finland in August  there was a 35% year-on-year decrease in building permits granted and a 12% year-on-year decrease in building projects started in Q2 of 2022. The number of residential units to be completed  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  will  however  remain at a high level during the rest of 2022 as well as throughout 2023  maintaining intense competition for tenants.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental homes and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Outside growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes home ownership in a growth centre even more challenging for people coming from those areas.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2022 (1 JANUARY TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2021)Net sales and profitIn January‚ÄìSeptember 2022  SATO Corporation‚Äôs consolidated net sales totalled EUR 219.8 million (223.2).Operating profit was EUR 217.0 million (245.4).

The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war‚Äôs biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food and materials as well as in supply chains. The surge in prices has resulted in a rapid increase in the interest rate level. The increase in energy  food and consumer goods prices may slow economic growth  continue to considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company issued an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio.SATO currently has 522 apartments in St Petersburg. Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. SATO has made a decision in principle to exit the business in Russia. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has looked into opportunities to exit the business in Russia. According to the explorations  a speedy exit has not been possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent out the homes in St Petersburg for the time being until an exit method is found. The company is actively seeking a solution. There are risks related to the business environment in our St Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk  with related hedging options examined in accordance with our treasury policy. It is expected that the operating environment in Russia will be highly uncertain for a long period of time and could result in disruptions to SATO's business activities in Russia and with parties related to business in Russia. It may impact the ability of SATO to make payments to its suppliers  employees and authorities as well as receive payments from its customers  which could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on SATO's business in Russia and even result in SATO limiting or ceasing its operations in Russia and with parties related to Russia for a long period of time. Should the war in Ukraine be prolonged  carrying out business in Russia may have negative impacts on the company‚Äôs reputation and may hamper business in Finland or have adverse effects on the company‚Äôs ability to access finance in the market  which may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  financial costs or value of SATO-owned properties.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group‚Äôs website and Annual Report for 2021 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level.Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine that started in February is still continuing and has made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain and accelerated inflation. Exceptionally high inflation has forced central banks to respond to the situation by making rapid interest rate hikes. In September  the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the key interest rates by 75 basis points to 1.25%. The previous hike took place in July and was 50 basis points. The war in Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty is eroding consumer confidence. Consumer confidence has remained at a very low level already since the spring and is dampening private consumption.In particular the surge in energy and food prices coinciding with climbing interest rates will reverse economic growth towards the end of the year. According to the Bank of Finland forecast of 15 September 2022  Finland‚Äôs economy is projected to grow by 2.2% this year following a robust start to the current year but then decline to 0.3% next year. The outlook is highly uncertain  but the forecast anticipates that the upward trend in prices will subside in late 2023 and the economy will resume slow growth in 2024.The surge in energy prices has a direct impact on the company‚Äôs profitability  as it is currently not possible to transfer costs in full directly to rents due to the intense competitive situation.The record-high rate of construction seen for a long period of time will slow due to the economic uncertainty. Sales volumes of both new and old homes have decreased. Statistics published by the Federation of Real Estate Agency in August show a decrease in sales volumes of new and old homes compared with the figures reported for the spring and early summer. The figure was down by 21% compared with July 2021. According to data released by Statistics Finland in August  there was a 35% year-on-year decrease in building permits granted and a 12% year-on-year decrease in building projects started in Q2 of 2022. The number of residential units to be completed  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  will  however  remain at a high level during the rest of 2022 as well as throughout 2023  maintaining intense competition for tenants. The improved service-sector employment rate and the resumption of contact teaching in upper secondary education have resulted in demand for rental homes picking up  which is reflected in an improved occupancy rate. The economic uncertainty  pressure for interest rate hikes and increases in consumer prices have also been in part reflected in increased demand for rental homes.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants and was reflected over the period under review in SATO‚Äôs business as a slight decrease in average rents year on year. With greater choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.SATO Corporation‚Äôs shareholders on 30 September 2022Largest shareholders and their holdingsno. of shares % Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder) 31 971 535 56.3%Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool 12 811 647 22.6%Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company 7 233 081 12.7%State Pension Fund of Finland 2 796 200 4.9%Valkila Erkka 385 000 0.7%SATO Corporation 166 000 0.3%Entel√§ Tuula 159 000 0.3%Heinonen Erkki 146 684 0.3%Tradeka-invest Ltd 126 500 0.2%Others (118 shareholders) 987 420 1.7%On 30 September 2022  SATO had 56 783 067 shares and 127 shareholders registered in the book-entry system.

Organic growth was 8.7%. This brought the 9-month organic revenue growth to 7.3%.The 8.7% organic revenue growth was notably led by a strong performance in Buildings & Infrastructure (+11.0% in Q3)  Industry (+10.6% in Q3)  Marine & Offshore (+9.7%)  as well as Agri-Food & Commodities (+9.6%) in Q3. The diversity of Bureau Veritas portfolio  its solid sales pipeline and its leadership in terms of Sustainability and ESG solutions  position Bureau Veritas well to grow in a sustained manner in the medium term. Around 55% of Bureau Veritas sales  in the first 9-month of the year  are related to Sustainability through the BV Green Line of services & solutions.By geography  activities in the Americas strongly outperformed the rest of Bureau Veritas (29% of revenue; up 15.0% organically)  led by a 9.5% increase in North America (Buildings & Infrastructure driven) and by a 25.3% increase in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). The activity in Asia Pacific (31% of revenue; up 4.6% organically) benefited from robust growth in Australia as well as strong growth in South-East Asian countries (notably Vietnam). Europe (31% of revenue) delivered homogeneous growth across the board; up 6.0% organically  with above-average performance in Italy and France  notably. Finally  in Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue)  business increased by 16.2% on an organic basis  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 1.3%  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized since the beginning of 2022  alongside those of the prior year.Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 7.0%  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies.2022 outlook confirmed:Based on the year-to-date performance  the significant growth opportunities related to its sustainabilityrange of services and solutions  and excluding the full-year impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns in China Bureau Veritas still expects for 2022 to:Achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;Improve the adjusted operating margin;Generate sustained strong cash flow  with a cash conversion above 90%.For more information: https://group.bureauveritas.comConstantia Flexibles‚Äî9 months total growth of +31.6%  with record organic growth of 23.7% mainly driven by price increases but also through volume growth and mix improvement(Full consolidation)Sales in the first nine months of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨1 537.9 million  up +23.7% on an organic basis with strong performance across both markets  Consumer and Pharma both posted above 20% organic growth. Sales are up +31.6% in total over the period  driven mostly by necessary price increases enabling to compensate for the inflationary input costs pressure. Since the start of the year  despite raw material shortages  Constantia has experienced an encouraging return to market share gains  thereby confirming the good momentum instilled by the new management team‚Äôs commercial initiatives. The market in India remains challenging and management is rolling out successfully the ‚ÄúRestoring Success program‚Äù to return to profitability whilst reviewing various strategic options for this division.Year-to-date activity also benefited from the acquisition of Propak in June 2021 and FFP Packaging Solutions in August 2022 (impact of +4.0%). Foreign exchange had a +4.0% positive impact on sales.Constantia is carefully managing the inflationary cost environment as well as the availability of energy supply and raw materials. The Company is focusing its efforts on preserving the profitability working both on the passthrough of input costs as well as pursuing its cost control program. Constantia is also actively working on its supply base and energy supply sources in the context of a potential shortage of gas in Europe in the coming months.In August 2022  Constantia Flexibles has signed an agreement  to acquire 100% of FFP Packaging Solutions  a leading player for sustainable  flexible packaging in the film consumer market from Northampton  UK. This acquisition aligns well with Vision 2025 growth strategy of investing in competitive businesses with potential for future growth. FFP Packaging Solutions joining the Constantia Flexibles Group will expand its overall market position. Its significant experience and credibility allow for strong relationships across the UK food industry. The transaction closed in August.Stahl‚ÄîSales up 11.5% with organic growth of 7.8% mostly driven by price increases to offset input cost inflation(Full consolidation)Stahl  the world leader in coating layers and surface treatments for flexible materials  posted total sales of ‚Ç¨696.4 million in the first nine months of 2022  representing an increase of +11.5% over the period. Organic growth stood at +7.8% while FX contributed positively (+3.7%)  mostly through USD strengthening.Activity for the period is above expectations at group level  with a strong growth in Coatings and Leather over the past nine months. Growth was largely led by price/mix effects as volumes declined  notably due to (i) slowdown in certain end markets  (ii) China lockdowns and (iii) continued supply disruptions in automotive.Across all segments  price increases have been implemented since the beginning of the year to mitigate the strong impact of rising input costs. The company has taken and is ready to take additional measures to protect its margin where needed. Stahl‚Äôs management continues to closely monitor the inflationary environment  as well as the supply chain and potential energy disruptions.The order book slightly decreased following the strong commercial activity in H1 2022 but remains at high levels compared to historical standards.Stahl announced on July 5  2022  the submission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target  aligned with the most recent guidance provided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).Stahl‚Äôs SBTi submission includes a specific commitment regarding the company‚Äôs Scope 3 upstream emissions  which Stahl aims to reduce by at least 25% over the next 10 years  compared with the base year (2021). Stahl‚Äôs Scope 3 emissions currently represent over 90% of its carbon footprint. This reduction would primarily be achieved by Stahl replacing its fossil-based raw materials with lower-carbon alternatives. The target is a major step towards the objective of limiting global warming temperature increase to 1.5 ¬∞C above pre-industrial levels by 2050  as agreed at the 2015 Paris Climate Accords.Stahl‚Äôs extended commitment builds on the company‚Äôs existing targets to reduce its emission for Scopes 1 and 2  which were set shortly after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Stahl has since reduced its Scope 1 and 2 (direct) GHG emissions by more than 30%  thanks to operational efficiency gains and by decarbonizing its energy supply.In September 2022  Stahl has been awarded the highest EcoVadis Platinum rating  placing it within the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis. The award underlines Stahl‚Äôs commitment to collaborating with its partners to reduce its environmental impact and build a more responsible and transparent supply chain.Crisis Prevention Institute‚Äî9 months revenue growth of +16.1% as compared with 2021  +17.7% organically(Full consolidation since March 11  2022)Crisis Prevention Institute recorded revenue of $88.8 million in the first nine months of 2022  up +16.1% in total compared to the same period in 2021 and +17.7% organically. Foreign exchange impact was -1.6%. This performance reflects several factors:The return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù business conditions has made it easier for customers  particularly for schools and hospitals  to prioritize and schedule training  allowing Certified Instructors to conduct internal training;The success of new program launches  including specialty topics such as Trauma  Autism  and Advanced Physical Skills  which now collectively represent more than 20% of Initial Certifications for the first nine months;The international expansion strategy outside of North America  notably in English-speaking countries  with a growth rate of nearly +23%;A continued mix shift toward digital solutions for both new CIs and renewals  which supplement required in-person training components of programs. Virtual Learner Materials continue to comprise a strong share of overall delivery  accounting for 44% of total Learner Materials sales.During the quarter  CPI‚Äôs President Susan Driscoll and J√©r√¥me Richard  Operating Partner at Wendel  were added to the CPI Board. Susan Driscoll has held multiple executive positions across training and education businesses over the course of her career  including serving as President of the professional and education and nurse learning divisions during her seven-year tenure at Wolters Kluwer Health. Susan has served as President of Crisis Prevention Institute since 2017.ACAMS‚ÄìStrong year-to-date performance for ACAMS  with reported revenue3 up +7.8% and +17.8% pro forma for conference timing. Carve-out process on track.(Full consolidation since March 11  2022)On March 10  2022  Wendel acquired ACAMS  a global leader in training and certifications for anti-financial crime prevention professionals. ACAMS‚Äôs separation from its prior parent company is on schedule and expected to be fully completed early 2023.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  ACAMS reported revenue of $69.5 million4 up +7.8% vs. the same period in 2021. Organic growth for these first nine months was +8.0%  and the impact of foreign exchange was -0.3%. ACAMS‚Äôs flagship Las Vegas conference  the largest organized by ACAMS  was held in October 2022  one month later than that of the prior year in September 2021  skewing the year-over-year comparison. Normalized for the timing of this event  pro forma growth over the first 9 months would have been +17.8%.The pro forma revenue growth was driven by post-COVID conference recovery and greater sales of Certifications  Memberships and Training  primarily a result of sales to larger enterprise customers. Revenue growth should ease and return to more normative levels for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.Tarkett‚ÄìQ3 turnover growth driven by solid performance in Sports and sales price increases(Accounted for by the equity method since 07.07.2021)The company reported its Q3 2022 sales on October 25  2022.

(NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30  2022. Further details can be found in the supplemental presentation accompanying this release and published in the investor relations section of our website.Record backlog of $2 254.1 million (+104% versus prior year) is our eighth consecutive record backlog quarter  surpassing $2 billion for the first time in our historyRecord sales of $412.1 million (+25.5% versus prior year) including foreign exchange headwinds and project timing movementsRecord reported gross margin of $104.6 million (+39.7% versus prior year) reflected volume  pricing  productivity and cost control actions and resulted in reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4%  the highest since the first quarter of 2021 (adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales of 27.3%)Record reported operating income of $41.7 million (+202.2% versus prior year) contributed to record reported non-diluted earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS)‚Äù of $1.15 and record adjusted non-diluted EPS of $1.49Reported 10.1% operating income as a percent of sales (adjusted 12.6%) was our highest since the third quarter 2020 and including this quarter has only been achieved four times in ten yearsThird quarter 2022 orders of $729.4 million  including 71 orders each over $1 million  a 108% increase compared to the third quarter 2021Received Full Notice to Proceed (‚ÄúFNTP‚Äù) on Venture Global Plaquemine‚Äôs Phase 2 Big LNG project  resulting in a third quarter order of $91.8 millionInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (‚ÄúIRA‚Äù) continues to accelerate commercial activity  thereby increasing our estimated total addressable market (‚ÄúTAM‚Äù) for Specialty Products in the near-term to $9.65 billion (prior was $7.65 billion) and 2030 TAM to $49.25 billion (prior was $42.0 billion)2022 full-year sales guidance range of $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion (prior guidance of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion); associated 2022 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance is in the range of $5.00 to $5.25 (prior guidance of $5.20 to 5.60) on 35.87 million shares outstanding (prior 35.86 million shares) and a tax rate of 17% (prior tax rate of 20%)2023 full-year sales outlook range of $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion; associated 2023 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS outlook is in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 on 35.87 million shares outstanding and a tax rate of 19%Third quarter 2022 was all-time record backlog  sales  reported gross margin  reported operating income  reported non-diluted EPS and adjusted non-diluted EPS  amongst numerous other historical records within the business.Our third quarter 2022 orders of $729.4 million (second highest in our history with our top three quarters all occurring in 2022) contributed to our eighth consecutive quarter of record backlog ($2 254.1 million); backlog is 104% higher than one year ago and sequentially 15% higher than the second quarter 2022  which was our highest order quarter in our history. Both Heat Transfer Systems (‚ÄúHTS‚Äù) and Specialty Products have record backlogs as of the third quarter 2022. Additionally  all three of quarters in 2022 to date have had book-to-bill ratios above 1.8  which is a contributor to our outlook for 2023 sales to grow between 23% and 30% year-over-year over.We posted record sales of $412.1 million (an increase of 25.5% versus prior year) in the quarter  which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange (‚ÄúFX‚Äù) headwinds primarily in our Cryo Tank Solutions (‚ÄúCTS‚Äù) segment and as is typical between quarters  project timing movements related to liquefaction projects in Specialty Products. We estimate that foreign exchange headwinds had a $17 million negative impact on sales  with the U.S. dollar appreciating versus the Euro and the Indian Rupee. Note that we do not addback or adjust for foreign exchange impacts in our adjusted EPS. In addition to our total record sales  we set sales records in the quarter for mobile equipment  brazed aluminum heat exchangers  systems  space exploration  L.A. Turbine‚Äôs aftermarket and VRV.Third quarter 2022 reported gross margin of $104.6 million was the highest in our history and 39.7% higher than the third quarter 2021  reflecting our increasing positive margin mix  pricing actions taken  productivity and cost control. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4% was the highest since the second quarter of 2021  and when adjusted for one-time items including restructuring and start and capacity expansion costs was 27.3%; three of our four segments reported gross margin as a percent of sales increased by more than 170 basis points sequentially compared to the second quarter 2022 with HTS increasing 720 basis points. This contributed to record reported operating income of $41.7 million  an increase of 202.2% compared to the third quarter 2021 and when adjusted for one-time items such as deal-related costs and restructuring  record adjusted operating income of $51.9 million. The third quarter 2022 was only the fourth time in the past decade that we had reported operating income as a percent of sales of 10.1% (adjusted 12.6%). HTS also had record operating income and operating income as a percent of sales in the quarter.Third quarter 2022 reported non-diluted EPS of $1.15 is a historical record and reflects the ongoing efforts of our global flexible manufacturing footprint to optimize ‚Äúwhere we make what‚Äù; when adjusted for one-time items primarily related to deal costs  year-one integrations and organic startup & capacity expenses  our adjusted non-diluted EPS is $1.49  also a record. As noted above  we did not addback the negative impact to sales or EPS from FX rate changes and we anticipate that these will continue to be variable in the coming quarters. We estimate the third quarter 2022 impact from the foreign exchange rate changes to be approximately net negative $0.06 to EPS (net of translation and transaction).Macro tailwinds are bolstering demand for multiple solutions in our portfolio; including energy security & access (LNG) and government actions such as the IRA (accelerating activity in Specialty Products).Macro TailwindsEnergy security  resiliency  access and independence continues to be a priority for countries around the world  with meaningful focus on Europe. This has been further heightened as winter nears  as well as the supply-demand linkage of available LNG. It is anticipated that gas demand increases each year globally between now and 2035  and in turn  more LNG supply capacity is anticipated to move to Final Investment Decision (‚ÄúFID‚Äù) and construction this decade. Additionally  United States rig count is at pre-pandemic levels  and we are seeing an increase in air cooler equipment sales.As we stated at the end of the second quarter 2022  and we reiterate now  the increase in immediacy for energy security has not come at the expense of the clean energy transition ‚Äì rather there is a heightened focus on all energy. Additionally  the third quarter 2022 brought further tailwinds to many of the end markets we serve with our Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢ - clean power  clean water  clean food and clean industrials. One such tailwind was the passing of the IRA in August 2022  which approved $300 billion in spending for energy and climate change  with multiple areas of the IRA directly supporting investments being made by our customers in hydrogen  carbon capture  water  and industrial manufacturing. And hydrogen is not only limited to commercialization as the result of the IRA ‚Äì global funding commitments to 2030 now total $240 billion  up approximately 50% from a year ago  and cover the European Union and 22 other countries.In addition to the IRA  CO2 shortage continues to drive global interest in carbon capture solutions from small-scale (Chart‚Äôs Earthly Labs small-scale CiCi solution) to large industrial scale (Chart‚Äôs SES cryogenic carbon capture solution) and this 30% shortage is expected to continue with further permanent reductions in availability  thereby making CO2 recovery more important to the resolution of this challenge  as well as being a key part of the carbon emission reduction public and private sector targets.In summary  in the $729.4 million of orders booked in the third quarter 2022 there were 71 orders greater than $1 million each  bringing the year-to-date number to 197. Year-to-date through September 30  2022  individual orders each greater than $1 million grew 29.6% compared to the same period in 2021 and is at 87% of the full year 2021.In addition to our commercial pipeline for potential orders in the next 24 months being over $9.5 billion in active  various stage discussions  we have continued to see broad-based demand in October 2022 to start the fourth quarter. Month-to-date as of October 26  2022  we have received 17 orders each greater than $1 million dollars; of these larger orders  the range was wide ‚Äì from two multi-million dollar space exploration orders to regas to a refurbishment of a cold box  to multiple air cooler orders  to LNG fueling stations to a large bulk tank order for an industrial gas customer and a $3 million water treatment order.LNG  LNG  LNG.As winter approaches  in particular in the European Union  energy security and access are creating new and more imminent LNG opportunities  resulting in the continued increase in the four categories of LNG that we serve:Big LNG: In the third quarter 2022  we received FNTP on the remaining 12 cold box systems for Venture Global Plaquemines Phase 2 LNG export project. The third quarter order totaled $91.8 million  bringing our year-to-date Big LNG related orders to $620.7 million. Additionally  we have seen incremental increases to our potential future Big LNG orders since February 2022  driven by more international interest in modular mid-scale terminals  interest in our heavy hydrocarbon (‚ÄúHHC‚Äù) removal and nitrogen-rejection unit (‚ÄúNRU‚Äù) capabilities and more projects intending to move to FID. Currently our ‚Äúnot yet booked‚Äù commercial opportunities for Big LNG total $5.68 billion  inclusive of retrofit; this is an increase to our pipeline since the end of the second quarter 2022 of $330 million  even after booking another $91.8 million related to the Venture Global Plaquemines 2 project in the third quarter 2022. Small-scale and floating LNG: We received commitments from three customers for small-scale and floating liquefaction projects in the third quarter  totaling $175 million. Even considering these orders  our commercial pipeline continues to grow for this category of LNG (318 potential projects globally)  with floating LNG opportunities at their all-time high. LNG infrastructure: We sell various equipment into the LNG infrastructure end-market and continue to see demand for fueling stations (12 ordered in the third quarter 2022)  regas systems  and other related tanks and trailers. ISO containers had record demand in the third quarter 2022  with 226 units sold. We had two regas orders in the quarter and growth in our vehicle fueling stations business compared to the third quarter 2021. And while year-to-date 2022 demand for HLNG over-the-road vehicle tanks has been meaningfully weaker than the same period in 2021  we saw a nearly 200% increase sequentially from the second quarter 2022 in these orders. LNG retrofits  refurbishments  repairs: We continue to see orders related to modifications and extensions of regas stations  with orders in the third quarter 2022 from Italgas. Additionally  we are receiving inbound requests for retrofits and refurbishments as well as expansions of brownfield facilities. This trend is expected to continue  in particular as timing of construction of new builds does not address the immediate need for additional gas supply  and numerous customers are looking for long-term lifecycle services more so than previously.IRA accelerating activity in Specialty Products.The IRA in the United States is accelerating activity in our business in key areas that benefit within the IRA  including carbon capture  hydrogen  fuel refueling  water and industrial facilities. We believe that the IRA will accelerate certain investments and purchases from our customers in carbon capture and storage (‚ÄúCCUS‚Äù)  hydrogen and water in particular. In the third quarter 2022  Specialty Products orders were $202.9 million  our second consecutive quarter with Specialty Products orders above $200 million  and bringing year-to-date to $569.1 million  over 88% of the full year 2021 Specialty Products orders. With seven consecutive quarters having Specialty Products orders greater than $100 million each  the business is proving to be a consistent and increasing contributor to our overall growth.Hydrogen orders of $102.4 million in the third quarter 2022 included a large hydrogen liquefaction order from a North American customer bringing our year-to-date 2022 hydrogen related orders above our full year 2021 of $282.1 million. Additionally  the same customer has signed a letter of intent (not booked as an order or in backlog) with Chart for process and equipment for the additional three phases of the project  each 250 Megawatts  with the same content as the first phase. Also  in the quarter we received a $6.2 million order for hydrogen systems and equipment from a European shipyard  who  with Chart  is working closely with a large European cruise line on a hydrogen powered vessel  a $5.8 million order for two of the first transportable fuel stations for hydrogen fuel cell trucks and liquid hydrogen tank orders for a major industrial gas customer‚Äôs liquefaction plant in Europe. Importantly  this is another example of the global adoption of liquid hydrogen (historically Europe was predominantly focused on gaseous hydrogen). While not yet booked  we also received a letter of intent (‚ÄúLOI‚Äù) from one of our industrial gas customers for a hydrogen liquefaction plant  which we expect could move to order in 2023.We saw meaningfully more inbound interest in our CCUS offering since the IRA was approved than we had prior  including a pipeline of 363 customers and potential customers (+142% since December 31  2021). In our Earthly Labs‚Äô small-scale CCUS business  we successfully installed a CiCi unit at a large winery  shipping our first Earthly Labs‚Äô units to New Zealand  Australia and the United Kingdom early this quarter. Additionally  new inbound opportunities in our small-scale Earthly Labs carbon capture business totaled $9.22 million in the 75 days following the IRA announcement  compared to new opportunities in the 60 days prior to the IRA of $5.56 million. In the third quarter 2022  we booked orders for our SES cryogenic carbon capture solutions (‚ÄúSES CCC‚Äù) with a customer in Saudi Arabia  as well as with a European energy infrastructure company. We signed 4 Memorandums of Understanding (‚ÄúMOUs‚Äù) related to CCUS in the third quarter 2022  including one with C.A.T. Group and one with Koch for partnering on CCUS project work. We received an order for a feasibility study with Fluxys  with whom we are excited to collaborate on the application of our SES CCC technology to their emissions sources to support their net zero emissions target.We received $16.7 million in orders for water treatment systems in the third quarter 2022  the second highest in our history  and multiple orders for full treatment solutions  each over $2 million  such as an order from Smith Construction for Madera County  California manganese treatment for drinking water  another from Garney Construction for Brighton  Colorado nitrate treatment for drinking water  and a $4.67 million order in India.We have also been seeing an increase in clean air (methane emission elimination) activity  which also will benefit from the IRA  with $5.6M in orders through Q3 and new commitments equaling that total in the first 3 weeks Q4. And not to be left out  we received record ISO container orders (226) in the quarter  as well as the largest order of the year-to-date in food & beverage for QT‚Äôs new convenience Stores. As the result of this continued and consistent order activity as well as the IRA adding more certainty to this decade opportunities  we are increasing our estimated total addressable market in the near-term from $7.7 billion to $9.65 billion for Specialty Products  and to $49.25 billion through 2030 from $42.0 billion.Third quarter 2022: Eight MOUs and partnerships executed  eight new certifications received  79 additional new customer orders  17 new first-of-a-kind (‚ÄúFOAK‚Äù) orders and expanded organic capacity drive further differentiation of the Chart business.We continue to expand our business globally through partnerships  leading regional certifications in our specialty markets  and utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to serve new customers and new applications with our cryogenic expertise.In the third quarter 2022 we executed eight MOUs of which two included master supply agreements. Four were related to carbon capture and CO2 equipment  and two for hydrogen  and one each for liquefaction and LNG  further demonstrating the breadth of our solution offering and penetration across the Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢. One of the master supply agreements was for LNG equipment with Yanchange and Shell Petroleum  while another was with a major beverage company for carbon capture and storage technology and equipment.Our 79 new customers this quarter (bringing year-to-date through third quarter 2022 to 248) were across a broad reach of geographies. 43% of the third quarter 2022 new customers were North American  37% Asia Pacific and approximately 20% were in Europe and the Middle East.FOAK orders of 17 in the third quarter 2022 were also comprised of geographic and application breadth. We kicked off the first feasibility study with Bioveritas for carbon capture with bio-based food ingredients  booked an order with Firefly for a space exploration application  and welcomed new customer PT Arohera in Asia Pacific for food and beverage equipment for their end user  a global food manufacturer.Certifications globally and regionally in cryogenic equipment are a key differentiator  especially in newer end markets that have localized requirements. In the third quarter 2022  we received numerous new certifications (11  not including normal course of business renewals)  including approvals for specific product lines for use in Australia  Canada  and Korea (specifics can be found on slide 21 of the supplemental presentation).Our organic capacity expansions remain on track  and in some cases are ahead of schedule where we were able to accelerate toward completion as demand continues to increase. September 2022 marked the exciting arrival of our brazing furnace at our Tulsa  Oklahoma flexible manufacturing facility. We will begin post brazing in the fourth quarter 2022 at this site  offering additional capacity and shorter lead-times for certain brazed aluminum heat exchangers. Our Goch  Germany trailer facility expansion remains on track for second half 2023 production and is an example of our incorporation of ESG into our manufacturing  with the design including heat pumps with low energy consumption and extra insulation for less energy usage.Margin improvement resulting from our actions taken to respond to cost changes with pricing and surcharges and ongoing improving productivity; despite ongoing macroeconomic inflationary and supply chain challenges.In the third quarter 2022  input costs were similar to the second quarter 2022 (i.e. indexes are stabilizing)  yet with the backdrop of continued geopolitical and inflationary uncertainty. Gas and energy prices are a key driver in component availability and costs  in particular in the EU  and while recent prices have been declining  they are still over five times the 2019 standard price. In the EU  the shortage of supply and the rising energy prices could impact raw material producers  and therefore we have and continue to proactively fortify our supply chain channels both globally and locally to reduce the associated risks. Examples of this include future volume commitments on material and components that are more readily available now  and ensuring that we can access material locally in all geographies in which we manufacture in. Despite the ongoing and well-discussed supply chain challenges  12 of our manufacturing facilities had 100% on-time delivery in the third quarter 2022.Third quarter 2022 reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 25.4% was 27.3% when adjusting for organic startup and capacity  year-one integration and other one-time expenses  our highest gross margin as a percent of sales quarter since the second quarter 2021 and in line with our sequential quarterly anticipated margin improvement  which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter 2022. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales increased more than 200 basis points sequentially in the third quarter 2022 when compared to the second quarter 2022 in three of our four segments  with HTS at 21.6% (an increase of 720 bps sequentially) and RSL at 38.4% (an increase of 410 bps sequentially). CTS reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 18.0% reflected our first quarter of sequential margin improvement in a year  in part driven by the pull in of lower margin backlog to the second quarter 2022. Specialty Products  which typically has volume and mix movements between quarters  had lower than anticipated sales driven by the timing shifts of two projects‚Äô revenue recognition due to timing of inbound components  which are anticipated to be recognized in the fourth quarter 2022. This project mix shift negatively impacted reported gross margin as a percent of sales for Specialty Products  which was 31.6% for the third quarter 2022. Also impacting the segment was the continued low volume in higher margined HLNG vehicle tanks and one large customer freight revenue which had no associated margin  neither of which are considered adjustments to our adjusted gross profit or adjusted operating profit. We did finalize our year-one integrations for AdEdge and L.A. Turbine  and when adjusting for integration  startup/capacity and restructuring costs in Specialty Products  adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.6%  similar to the second quarter 2022 adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales of 35.8%.Our reported operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 of 10.1% was an increase of 590 basis points compared to the third quarter 2021. It is also worth noting that in the third quarter 2021  we did not include any short-term incentive compensation expense as we were not hitting the threshold. In each quarter of 2022  including the third quarter  we have been booking our short-term incentive costs through SG&A. Therefore  the increase in reported operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 compared to the third quarter 2021 is operationally even more significant (an increase of 710 basis points). When adjusted for one-time and unusual items  adjusted operating income as a percent of sales in the third quarter 2022 was 12.6%.‚ÄúThe third quarter of 2022 not only reinforced our customers‚Äô continued broad-based demand for LNG and solutions across our Nexus of Clean‚Ñ¢ serving power  water  food and industrials  our outlook for 2023 and the coming decade was further bolstered by the passing of the IRA at a macro level and our record backlog  sales  gross profit  operating profit and EPS ‚Äù stated Jill Evanko  Chart‚Äôs CEO and President. ‚ÄúWe continue to execute our margin expansion activities ranging from pricing to organic productivity  which was reflected in the sequential margin improvement and our anticipated sequential margin expansion in the fourth quarter 2022 and into 2023.‚ÄùFree cash flow generation.In the third quarter 2022  we generated $37 million cash from operations  had $18 million of capital expenditures related activity  and $17 million of unusual addback items (including $2 million for escrow payments for Earthly Labs)  resulting in adjusted free cash flow (‚ÄúFCF‚Äù) of $36 million. This brings year-to-date adjusted FCF to $68 million. Considering the expected timing of larger project milestone payments (over $100 million expected) in the fourth quarter 2022  our full year FCF outlook is approximately $175 million. We accelerated certain capital projects expenditures related to capacity expansions into the third quarter 2022 as we continue to see lead-time and increased demand for deliveries across the next 24 months. Specifically  we pulled ahead capital to accelerate our ability to produce in our expanded roof-covered facility in New Iberia  Louisiana (cold box shop) and certain activities in our Tulsa  Oklahoma flexible manufacturing facility. As of the end of the third quarter 2022  our net leverage ratio is 2.92  and during the quarter we repaid $80M million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during the third quarter 2022.2022 Guidance.Our outlook for 2022 for sales is in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion  with associated adjusted non-diluted EPS in the range of $5.00 to $5.25 on approximately 35.87 million weighted shares outstanding with an assumed tax rate of 17%. The change to our prior sales guidance of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion is driven by currency headwinds and timing of specific project revenue recognition  which is typical in our business.2023 first outlook with increased confidence driven by record backlog  multiple global tailwinds and customers‚Äô forecasts.Our outlook for 2023 for sales is in a range of $2.10 billion to $2.20 billion  which includes only Big LNG projects that are in backlog as of September 30  2022. Associated adjusted non-diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 on 35.87 million weighted shares outstanding. This assumes a tax rate of 19%. Note that this outlook does not include any new or additional mid-size or large projects that could come into the order book between now and the end of the first half 2023 which we would anticipate having sales associated with them in the year. If one or more mid or large-size project comes into the order book between now and the end of the first quarter 2023  we would anticipate recognizing between $50 to $75 million dollars more of revenue into the full year.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

12363,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://biomag1.com/pharming-group-news-102822/,Pharming Group Announces European Medicines Agency (EMA) Validates Its Marketing Authorization Application Under Accelerated Assessment For Leniolisib,The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  sa‚Ä¶,Pharming Group N.V. (‚ÄúPharming‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM /Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that its Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib has been validated for scientific evaluation under an accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency‚Äôs (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).The application  submitted earlier in October 2022  is for the investigational drug  leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  as a treatment for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adolescents and adults 12 years or older.In August 2022  Pharming Group announced the leniolisib MAA was granted accelerated assessment by EMA‚Äôs CHMP. The accelerated assessment reduces the review timeframe from 210 days to 150 days. Upon request  EMA will grant an accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health  and in particular  from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Marketing authorization for leniolisib in the European Economic Area is anticipated in H1 2023.The MAA is supported by positive data from a Phase II/III study of leniolisib  announced on February 2  2022  which met its co-primary endpoints of reduction in lymph node size and increase in percentage of na√Øve B cells in patients with APDS. Furthermore  safety data from the study showed that leniolisib was well tolerated by participants. Also submitted as part of the MAA were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in patients with APDS treated with leniolisib.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming Group  commented:‚ÄúEMA‚Äôs validation for review of our MAA under an accelerated assessment pathway highlights Pharming‚Äôs ongoing commitment to advance leniolisib as a targeted treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with APDS. We anticipate that leniolisib will fill an unmet need for patients with APDS  who currently rely on supportive therapies to treat their primary symptoms. This review constitutes a key milestone in Pharming‚Äôs effort to give healthcare providers and their patients global access to leniolisib. We look forward to collaborating with EMA as needed throughout the regulatory process.‚ÄùAbout Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS): APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.References1.
