Inventiva‚Äôs R&D capabilities and objectives remain unaltered.Fr√©d√©ric Cren  Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and cofounder of Inventiva  stated: ‚ÄúAlthough we are disappointed to see the end of cedirogant‚Äôs clinical program following the analysis of a nonclinical toxicology study  we wish to thank our partner AbbVie for 10 years of collaboration. We are now fully focused on the development of our lead asset lanifibranor  a promising treatment which is currently in Phase III clinical development for the treatment of NASH  a disease for which there are currently no treatments approved by regulatory agencies. We continue to make progress in our NATiV3 pivotal Phase III trial and we recently reached a major milestone in this respect by entering into a partnership with Sino Biopharm  a leading Chinese pharmaceutical group  to develop and potentially commercialize lanifibranor in Greater China.‚ÄùIn 2012  Inventiva and AbbVie signed a multi-year drug discovery collaboration agreement to identify potent RORg inverse agonists for the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. Inventiva‚Äôs and AbbVie‚Äôs joint efforts led to the discovery of cedirogant  which was being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial at the time of AbbVie‚Äôs decision to discontinue further clinical development.Story continuesAbout InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  MPS and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva‚Äôs lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies. In 2020  Inventiva announced positive topline data from its Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of adult patients with NASH and obtained both FDA Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation for lanifibranor in the treatment of NASH. Lanifibranor is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial.Inventiva‚Äôs pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva‚Äôs decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development.

The 99-megawatt (MW) wind farm represents an estimated capital investment of approximately $158 million and generates enough energy to power the equivalent of more than 22 000 average Oklahoma homes annually. The project has provided significant economic and environmental benefits for Grady County and across Oklahoma.During construction  Redbed Plains created 114 full-time equivalent jobs and currently employs nine permanent team members who operate and perform regular maintenance on the site. Redbed Plains has also contributed an estimated $8 million of spending within 50 miles of the project due to the project‚Äôs development. In addition to local investments  the project has paid out more than $2.2 million to landowners through land lease payments and disbursed $5.8 million to local governments  enhancing schools  roads  infrastructure  and other essential services. Redbed Plains also saves more than 176 million gallons of water each year  which is the amount needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the wind farm.‚ÄúEDPR NA takes pride in our close relationship with the community surrounding the Redbed Plains Wind Farm and in safely operating and providing clean  cost-effective energy ‚Äù Larry Martin  Operations Manager ‚Äì Redbed Plains Wind Farm said. ‚ÄúThis five-year anniversary is just the beginning of a long-lasting relationship with our supportive neighbors  and on behalf of EDP Renewables  Connor  Clark & Lunn Infrastructure and Redbed Plains  we look forward to being a contributing community member for years to come.‚ÄùStory continuesEDPR NA and CC&L Infrastructure manage Redbed Plains through a long-term partnership representing more than 560 MW in renewable power generation.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP‚Äôs share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The IOP-lowering effect from baseline for NCX 470 was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits). In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  statistical superiority was not achieved  however the IOP reductions for NCX 470 were numerically greater than those for latanoprost at all 6 timepoints  and statistically significant (p<0.049) at 4 of the 6 timepoints. NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  is currently in a Phase 3 clinical program.‚ÄúThese results demonstrate that NCX 470 has a robust intraocular pressure lowering effect  with good tolerability  and that it clearly met the primary objective of the Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial. NCX 470 is the first non-combination product to demonstrate statistical non-inferiority  and numerically greater intraocular pressure reduction  compared to a prostaglandin analog in a pivotal trial. We are continuing to examine the Mont Blanc data including a number of additional ongoing pre-specified analyses which are important to fully define the profile of NCX 470  as well as further exploring NCX 470‚Äôs activity on retinal cell protection  beyond its intraocular pressure lowering properties.‚Äù said Andreas Segerros  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Glaucoma Mont Blanc Phase 3 Topline Results SummaryIOP-lowering effect from baseline was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg for NCX 470 vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits).Non-inferiority was met vs. latanoprost in the primary efficacy analysis.The upper limit of the 95.1% confidence limit on the difference in the treatment effect between NCX 470 and latanoprost in change from baseline in time-matched IOP to the follow-up visits (week 2  week 6  and month 3) was ‚â§1.5 mmHg and ‚â§1.0 mmHg at all 6 timepoints.In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  NCX 470 was statistically superior (p<0.049) to latanoprost in intraocular pressure reduction from baseline at 4 of the 6 timepoints  and numerically greater at all 6 timepoints but did not reach the overall statistical superiority pre-specified as an secondary efficacy endpoint. The difference in IOP reduction between NCX 470 and latanoprost was up to 1.0 mmHg in favor of NCX 470.NCX 470 was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was ocular hyperemia in 11.9% of the NCX 470 patients vs. 3.3% of latanoprost patients. There were no ocular serious adverse events and no treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events. 4.3% of patients on NCX 470 discontinued compared to 5.1% on latanoprost. ‚ÄúWe would like to acknowledge and thank all patients  clinical investigators and their teams for their contributions to the Mont Blanc trial  particularly during the challenging COVID-19 pandemic period.‚Äù said Doug Hubatsch  Executive Vice President  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Phase 3 Trials DesignsMont Blanc is a randomized  multi-regional  double-masked  parallel group trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution  0.1% compared to latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0.005% in 691 patients. Latanoprost is the most widely prescribed first-line therapy for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Mont Blanc trial enrolled 691 patients in 56 sites in the United States and one site in China. The primary efficacy evaluation was based on reduction from baseline in mean time-matched IOP at 6 timepoints: 8 AM and 4 PM at week 2  week 6 and month 3.The similarly designed  ongoing  second Phase 3 trial  Denali  is being conducted at clinical sites in the U.S. and China  with topline results expected after 2024. The Denali trial also includes a long term safety extension through to 12 months  and is being jointly conducted and equally financed with our Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics.The Mont Blanc and Denali trials have been designed to fulfill the regulatory requirements to support New Drug Application (NDA) submissions in the U.S. and China and will also provide data for other countries accepting the same clinical data package for approval. The design of the efficacy part of the Denali trial is identical to that of Mont Blanc  however there is no guarantee that the results will be the same. Both trials are necessary  and certain additional clinical and non-clinical data will also be required to complete NDA submissions. Should NCX 470 be developed for other territories  for example Europe or Japan  there may be additional requirements.About NCX 470NCX 470 is a novel  nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop that leverages the potent IOP-lowering effects of NO and prostaglandin analogs (PGAs). NCX 470 incorporates Nicox‚Äôs proprietary NO-donating research platform and bimatoprost in a single molecule. NCX 470 is designed to release bimatoprost and NO into the eye to lower IOP by two pathways in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. NO is a well-known  small  naturally-occurring signaling molecule that plays a key role in the regulation of IOP through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). NO brings additional IOP-lowering efficacy by enhancing aqueous humor drainage from the eye via a different mechanism of action than that engaged by prostaglandin analogs. Bimatoprost  marketed under the brand name LUMIGAN¬Æ by AbbVie  Inc.  is the leading branded PGA. PGAs are the most widely used class of drugs for IOP-lowering in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.46,0.21,0.34,True,English,"['First Phase 3 Glaucoma Trial', 'Nicox Reports', 'Primary Objective', 'Mont Blanc', 'NCX 470', 'novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop', 'randomized, multi-regional, double-masked, parallel group trial', 'Glaucoma Mont Blanc Phase 3 Topline Results Summary', '691-patient Mont Blanc Phase 3 clinical trial', 'treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events', 'robust intraocular pressure lowering effect', 'Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial', 'challenging COVID-19 pandemic period', 'ongoing, second Phase 3 trial', 'The Mont Blanc trial', 'long term safety extension', 'NCX 470 Phase 3 Trials Designs', '9.7 mmHg intraocular pre ssure', 'greater intraocular pressure reduction', 'two Phase 3 trials', 'Mont Blanc data', 'Phase 3 clinical program', 'common adverse event', 'ongoing pre-specified analyses', 'The Denali trial', 'international ophthalmology company', 'first non-combination product', 'retinal cell protection', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Executive Vice President', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'The IOP-lowering effect', 'secondary efficacy analysis', 'secondary efficacy endpoint', 'primary efficacy analysis', 'primary efficacy evaluation', 'secondary efficacy objective', 'primary efficacy objective', 'overall statistical superiority', 'NCX 470 ophthalmic solution', 'latanoprost ophthalmic solution', 'pivotal trial', 'open-angle glaucoma', 'clinical investigators', 'primary objective', 'treatment effect', 'clinical sites', 'efficacy requirements', 'ocular hypertension', 'ocular hyperemia', 'United States', 'Daily dosing', 'Sophia Antipolis', 'Euronext Paris', 'good tolerability', 'prostaglandin analog', 'Andreas Segerros', 'upper limit', '95.1% confidence limit', 'Doug Hubatsch', 'first-line therapy', 'one site', 'U.S.', 'IOP reduction', 'statistical non-inferiority', 'up visits', 'time-matched IOP', 'time-matched change', 'Nicox SA', '7.1 to 9.4 mmHg', 'month 3 visits', 'baseline IOP', 'NCX 470 patients', 'latanoprost patients', '1.5 mmHg', '‚â§1.0 mmHg', '56 sites', '691 patients', 'approval', '6 timepoints', 'release', 'France', 'standard', 'care', '8 AM', '4 PM', 'week', 'number', 'additional', 'profile', 'activity', 'properties', 'difference', 'favor', 'teams', 'contributions', 'China', '12 months', '7:30']",2022-10-31,2022-10-31,finance.yahoo.com

Initially  the lengthy delivery times for flat-rolled products on the market had forced distributors to build up stocks in order to meet renewed demand. The sharp fall in the price of aluminium at the end of Q1 then led to a sharp deceleration in orders by distributors and a rapid return to more normal delivery times by rolling mills in the market. Typically  this slowdown in demand from distributors takes several months to be reflected in the Company's sales. In this context  tolling sales continued to be strong until after the end of the period and grew by 18.5% for the half year as a whole.Package Sales  which include metal (16% of half-year sales)  fell by 12.5%  despite the increase in sales in Europe. They were impacted by i) the closure of the Russian market due to the conflict in Ukraine and ii) the continued weakness of the Asian markets due to high costs and long delivery times.During the half year  the macro-economic environment was strongly affected by renewed inflation  which accelerated following the outbreak of war in Ukraine and Russia and its impact on the global economic environment. The company reacted by increasing its prices; however  the growth of its operating expenses  including a significant increase in its energy and raw material costs  weighed on the half-year results.Story continuesDespite the lower results against a high base of comparison in 2021  the Company still managed to maintain a high level of profitability and a strong and healthy balance sheet at 30 June 2022.ResultsThe increase in the Company's sales and the shift in the product mix towards subcontracting were strongly affected by the rise in production costs (energy and raw materials)  which impacted the gross margin for the first half of the year  which rose by only 2.9% compared to the previous year.Increased personnel costs (+5.1%) and other operating expenses (+24%) also affected the Company's operating profitability. EBITDA thus decreased by - ‚Ç¨0.5m compared to the previous year and amounting to ‚Ç¨2.5m  representing 18.1% of sales  compared to 24.4% of sales in the first half of 2021.After depreciation and amortisation down by ‚Ç¨0.4m to ‚Ç¨1.5m  operating profit was ‚Ç¨1.0m  or 7.2% of sales  compared with ‚Ç¨1.1m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(1.9)m in the first half of 2020.The net result for the first half of 2022 is a profit of ‚Ç¨0.85m  compared to ‚Ç¨0.95m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(2.1)m in the first half of 2020.Simplified income statement(‚Ç¨M) 2022 H1 2021 H1 Sales 13.95 12.45 Tolling sales 11.68 9.86 Package sales1 2.27 2.59 EBITDA 2.52 3.04 % of sales 18.1% 24.4% Operating profit 1.01 1.13 % of sales 7.2% 9.1% Income before tax 0.85 0.95 Net income 0.80 0.95 % of sales 5.7% 7.6%ReviewTaking into account the results of the half-year  shareholders' equity at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨30.0m  an increase of ‚Ç¨0.8m compared to 31 December 2021. Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2022 improved to ‚Ç¨3.4m  compared to ‚Ç¨2.2m at 31 December 2021 and ‚Ç¨0.5m at 30 June 2021. Net financial debt at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨4.6m  up ‚Ç¨0.7m on the previous year  and represented 15.3% of equity  compared with 13.4% at 31 December 2021 and 25.2% at 30 June 2021.2022 third quarter salesSales for the third quarter of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨6.7m  up 5.3% on the previous year. Tolling sales decreased(- 3.1%)  while Package Sales grew strongly (+ 38.5%). As a result  sales for the first nine months of the 2022 financial year amounted to ‚Ç¨20.7m  up 9.8% on the same period of the previous year.OutlookIn an increasingly unstable environment  the Company remains cautious and anticipates a continued slowdown in tolling demand towards the end of the year as distributors run down part of their stocks.In order to cope with the significant increases in energy costs in Europe  the Company is gearing its operations in the short term to its Landen site in Belgium  where energy prices are currently lower  and is relying on its high-efficiency Line 6 in Germany as a back-up.At the same time  the company is accelerating its energy efficiency investment projects through an action plan aimed at the sustainable use of renewable energy sources at attractive costs. A solar energy park  developed in partnership with local specialist operators in Germany  came on stream in October 2022; this will make it possible to significantly reduce part of the electricity costs in the medium term at the Bernburg site.More generally  the Company is taking steps to limit the impact of an economic slowdown on its results  relying in particular on the flexibility of its industrial facilities and the continued optimisation of its cost base.The Company is confident in its longer-term development prospects and is capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable and low carbon footprint products to increase the potential of its business.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 October 2022. They are included in the 2022 half-yearly financial report available on the company's financial website (http://investors.coil.be).Agenda2022 annual sales will be published on 26 January 2023 after the close of trading.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes.

Capacity could also be further enhanced in the future with additional limited investment.‚ÄúEUROAPI has a strong legacy in the development of peptides and oligonucleotides since 1976 and 2006 respectively  building upon a dedicated team of researchers and GMP manufacturers ‚Äù said C√©cile Maupas  Chief CDMO Officer  EUROAPI. ‚ÄúPeptides and oligonucleotides constitute a growing market with limited available capacity; we expect this new equipment and debottlenecking to take us one step closer to being a market leader.‚ÄùBy increasing its capacity  EUROAPI expects to meet demand for greater capacity associated with late stage products. It also aims at strengthening the company‚Äôs ability to be a long-term partner for pharmaceutical organizations at the forefront of research  offering services from early development through to the commercial stage for new therapeutic platforms.Peptides and oligonucleotides are priority segments for EUROAPI‚Äôs CDMO business. The global peptide market is valued at ‚Ç¨2 billion with an annual growth rate of +8-10%1 and an outsourcing rate of 65%: circa 500 molecules are in development including 30 that are expected to be approved by 2025. The oligonucleotide market is growing even faster at a + 12-14%2 rate and is almost entirely outsourced to CDMOs: circa 1 200 molecules are in development (including 1 000 in preclinical and phase I  with 200 in later phases). EUROAPI is well-equipped to manufacture the most complex peptides and oligonucleotides such as conjugated or pegylated ones. For context  since 2010 around 30% of peptides entering the clinical development phase have been conjugates. EUROAPI‚Äôs strategic ambition is to develop a one-stop-shop for these high growth molecules.Peptides and oligonucleotides are large molecules with complex structures and various applications including oncology  genetic disorders  metabolic or infectious diseases and type 2 diabetes. Oligonucleotides are an emerging modality with the potential to treat or manage a wide range of diseases and address patients‚Äô needs. EUROAPI is currently working on 14 CDMO large molecule projects (including peptides  oligonucleotides and lipids) as part of a portfolio of 64 projects  as of June 30  2022.About EUROAPIEUROAPI is focused on reinventing active ingredient solutions to sustainably meet customers‚Äô and patients‚Äô needs around the world.

The 99-megawatt (MW) wind farm represents an estimated capital investment of approximately $158 million and generates enough energy to power the equivalent of more than 22 000 average Oklahoma homes annually. The project has provided significant economic and environmental benefits for Grady County and across Oklahoma.During construction  Redbed Plains created 114 full-time equivalent jobs and currently employs nine permanent team members who operate and perform regular maintenance on the site. Redbed Plains has also contributed an estimated $8 million of spending within 50 miles of the project due to the project‚Äôs development. In addition to local investments  the project has paid out more than $2.2 million to landowners through land lease payments and disbursed $5.8 million to local governments  enhancing schools  roads  infrastructure  and other essential services. Redbed Plains also saves more than 176 million gallons of water each year  which is the amount needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the wind farm.‚ÄúEDPR NA takes pride in our close relationship with the community surrounding the Redbed Plains Wind Farm and in safely operating and providing clean  cost-effective energy ‚Äù Larry Martin  Operations Manager ‚Äì Redbed Plains Wind Farm said. ‚ÄúThis five-year anniversary is just the beginning of a long-lasting relationship with our supportive neighbors  and on behalf of EDP Renewables  Connor  Clark & Lunn Infrastructure and Redbed Plains  we look forward to being a contributing community member for years to come.‚ÄùEDPR NA and CC&L Infrastructure manage Redbed Plains through a long-term partnership representing more than 560 MW in renewable power generation.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP‚Äôs share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate. VGP operates a fully integrated business model with capabilities and longstanding expertise across the value chain.

Initially  the lengthy delivery times for flat-rolled products on the market had forced distributors to build up stocks in order to meet renewed demand. The sharp fall in the price of aluminium at the end of Q1 then led to a sharp deceleration in orders by distributors and a rapid return to more normal delivery times by rolling mills in the market. Typically  this slowdown in demand from distributors takes several months to be reflected in the Company's sales. In this context  tolling sales continued to be strong until after the end of the period and grew by 18.5% for the half year as a whole.Package Sales  which include metal (16% of half-year sales)  fell by 12.5%  despite the increase in sales in Europe. They were impacted by i) the closure of the Russian market due to the conflict in Ukraine and ii) the continued weakness of the Asian markets due to high costs and long delivery times.During the half year  the macro-economic environment was strongly affected by renewed inflation  which accelerated following the outbreak of war in Ukraine and Russia and its impact on the global economic environment. The company reacted by increasing its prices; however  the growth of its operating expenses  including a significant increase in its energy and raw material costs  weighed on the half-year results.Despite the lower results against a high base of comparison in 2021  the Company still managed to maintain a high level of profitability and a strong and healthy balance sheet at 30 June 2022.ResultsThe increase in the Company's sales and the shift in the product mix towards subcontracting were strongly affected by the rise in production costs (energy and raw materials)  which impacted the gross margin for the first half of the year  which rose by only 2.9% compared to the previous year.Increased personnel costs (+5.1%) and other operating expenses (+24%) also affected the Company's operating profitability. EBITDA thus decreased by - ‚Ç¨0.5m compared to the previous year and amounting to ‚Ç¨2.5m  representing 18.1% of sales  compared to 24.4% of sales in the first half of 2021.After depreciation and amortisation down by ‚Ç¨0.4m to ‚Ç¨1.5m  operating profit was ‚Ç¨1.0m  or 7.2% of sales  compared with ‚Ç¨1.1m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(1.9)m in the first half of 2020.The net result for the first half of 2022 is a profit of ‚Ç¨0.85m  compared to ‚Ç¨0.95m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(2.1)m in the first half of 2020.Simplified income statement(‚Ç¨M) 2022 H1 2021 H1 Sales 13.95 12.45 Tolling sales 11.68 9.86 Package sales1 2.27 2.59 EBITDA 2.52 3.04 % of sales 18.1% 24.4% Operating profit 1.01 1.13 % of sales 7.2% 9.1% Income before tax 0.85 0.95 Net income 0.80 0.95 % of sales 5.7% 7.6%ReviewTaking into account the results of the half-year  shareholders' equity at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨30.0m  an increase of ‚Ç¨0.8m compared to 31 December 2021. Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2022 improved to ‚Ç¨3.4m  compared to ‚Ç¨2.2m at 31 December 2021 and ‚Ç¨0.5m at 30 June 2021. Net financial debt at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨4.6m  up ‚Ç¨0.7m on the previous year  and represented 15.3% of equity  compared with 13.4% at 31 December 2021 and 25.2% at 30 June 2021.2022 third quarter salesSales for the third quarter of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨6.7m  up 5.3% on the previous year. Tolling sales decreased(- 3.1%)  while Package Sales grew strongly (+ 38.5%). As a result  sales for the first nine months of the 2022 financial year amounted to ‚Ç¨20.7m  up 9.8% on the same period of the previous year.OutlookIn an increasingly unstable environment  the Company remains cautious and anticipates a continued slowdown in tolling demand towards the end of the year as distributors run down part of their stocks.In order to cope with the significant increases in energy costs in Europe  the Company is gearing its operations in the short term to its Landen site in Belgium  where energy prices are currently lower  and is relying on its high-efficiency Line 6 in Germany as a back-up.At the same time  the company is accelerating its energy efficiency investment projects through an action plan aimed at the sustainable use of renewable energy sources at attractive costs. A solar energy park  developed in partnership with local specialist operators in Germany  came on stream in October 2022; this will make it possible to significantly reduce part of the electricity costs in the medium term at the Bernburg site.More generally  the Company is taking steps to limit the impact of an economic slowdown on its results  relying in particular on the flexibility of its industrial facilities and the continued optimisation of its cost base.The Company is confident in its longer-term development prospects and is capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable and low carbon footprint products to increase the potential of its business.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 October 2022.

The IOP-lowering effect from baseline for NCX 470 was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits). In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  statistical superiority was not achieved  however the IOP reductions for NCX 470 were numerically greater than those for latanoprost at all 6 timepoints  and statistically significant (p<0.049) at 4 of the 6 timepoints. NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  is currently in a Phase 3 clinical program.‚ÄúThese results demonstrate that NCX 470 has a robust intraocular pressure lowering effect  with good tolerability  and that it clearly met the primary objective of the Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial. NCX 470 is the first non-combination product to demonstrate statistical non-inferiority  and numerically greater intraocular pressure reduction  compared to a prostaglandin analog in a pivotal trial. We are continuing to examine the Mont Blanc data including a number of additional ongoing pre-specified analyses which are important to fully define the profile of NCX 470  as well as further exploring NCX 470‚Äôs activity on retinal cell protection  beyond its intraocular pressure lowering properties.‚Äù said Andreas Segerros  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Glaucoma Mont Blanc Phase 3 Topline Results SummaryIOP-lowering effect from baseline was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg for NCX 470 vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits).Non-inferiority was met vs. latanoprost in the primary efficacy analysis.The upper limit of the 95.1% confidence limit on the difference in the treatment effect between NCX 470 and latanoprost in change from baseline in time-matched IOP to the follow-up visits (week 2  week 6  and month 3) was ‚â§1.5 mmHg and ‚â§1.0 mmHg at all 6 timepoints.The upper limit of the 95.1% confidence limit on the difference in the treatment effect between NCX 470 and latanoprost in change from baseline in time-matched IOP to the follow-up visits (week 2  week 6  and month 3) was ‚â§1.5 mmHg and ‚â§1.0 mmHg at all 6 timepoints. In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  NCX 470 was statistically superior (p<0.049) to latanoprost in intraocular pressure reduction from baseline at 4 of the 6 timepoints  and numerically greater at all 6 timepoints but did not reach the overall statistical superiority pre-specified as an secondary efficacy endpoint. The difference in IOP reduction between NCX 470 and latanoprost was up to 1.0 mmHg in favor of NCX 470.NCX 470 was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was ocular hyperemia in 11.9% of the NCX 470 patients vs. 3.3% of latanoprost patients. There were no ocular serious adverse events and no treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events. 4.3% of patients on NCX 470 discontinued compared to 5.1% on latanoprost. ‚ÄúWe would like to acknowledge and thank all patients  clinical investigators and their teams for their contributions to the Mont Blanc trial  particularly during the challenging COVID-19 pandemic period.‚Äù said Doug Hubatsch  Executive Vice President  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Phase 3 Trials DesignsMont Blanc is a randomized  multi-regional  double-masked  parallel group trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution  0.1% compared to latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0.005% in 691 patients. Latanoprost is the most widely prescribed first-line therapy for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Mont Blanc trial enrolled 691 patients in 56 sites in the United States and one site in China. The primary efficacy evaluation was based on reduction from baseline in mean time-matched IOP at 6 timepoints: 8 AM and 4 PM at week 2  week 6 and month 3.The similarly designed  ongoing  second Phase 3 trial  Denali  is being conducted at clinical sites in the U.S. and China  with topline results expected after 2024. The Denali trial also includes a long term safety extension through to 12 months  and is being jointly conducted and equally financed with our Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics.The Mont Blanc and Denali trials have been designed to fulfill the regulatory requirements to support New Drug Application (NDA) submissions in the U.S. and China and will also provide data for other countries accepting the same clinical data package for approval. The design of the efficacy part of the Denali trial is identical to that of Mont Blanc  however there is no guarantee that the results will be the same. Both trials are necessary  and certain additional clinical and non-clinical data will also be required to complete NDA submissions. Should NCX 470 be developed for other territories  for example Europe or Japan  there may be additional requirements.About NCX 470NCX 470 is a novel  nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop that leverages the potent IOP-lowering effects of NO and prostaglandin analogs (PGAs). NCX 470 incorporates Nicox‚Äôs proprietary NO-donating research platform and bimatoprost in a single molecule. NCX 470 is designed to release bimatoprost and NO into the eye to lower IOP by two pathways in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. NO is a well-known  small  naturally-occurring signaling molecule that plays a key role in the regulation of IOP through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). NO brings additional IOP-lowering efficacy by enhancing aqueous humor drainage from the eye via a different mechanism of action than that engaged by prostaglandin analogs. Bimatoprost  marketed under the brand name LUMIGAN¬Æ by AbbVie  Inc.  is the leading branded PGA. PGAs are the most widely used class of drugs for IOP-lowering in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.39,0.24,0.37,True,English,"['First Phase 3 Glaucoma Trial', 'Nicox Reports', 'Primary Objective', 'Mont Blanc', 'NCX 470', 'novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop', 'randomized, multi-regional, double-masked, parallel group trial', 'Glaucoma Mont Blanc Phase 3 Topline Results Summary', '691-patient Mont Blanc Phase 3 clinical trial', 'treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events', 'robust intraocular pressure lowering effect', 'Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial', 'challenging COVID-19 pandemic period', 'The Mont Blanc trial', 'NCX 470 Phase 3 Trials Designs', '9.7 mmHg intraocular pre ssure', 'greater intraocular pressure reduction', 'Phase 3 clinical program', 'two Phase 3 trials', 'Mont Blanc data', 'common adverse event', 'international ophthalmology company', 'first non-combination product', 'ongoing pre-specified analyses', 'retinal cell protection', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Executive Vice President', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'ongoing, second Pha', 'The IOP-lowering effect', 'secondary efficacy analysis', 'secondary efficacy endpoint', 'primary efficacy analysis', 'primary efficacy evaluation', 'secondary efficacy objective', 'primary efficacy objective', 'overall statistical superiority', 'NCX 470 ophthalmic solution', 'latanoprost ophthalmic solution', 'pivotal trial', 'open-angle glaucoma', 'clinical investigators', 'primary objective', 'treatment effect', 'efficacy requirements', 'ocular hypertension', 'ocular hyperemia', 'United States', 'Daily dosing', 'Sophia Antipolis', 'Euronext Paris', 'good tolerability', 'prostaglandin analog', 'Andreas Segerros', 'upper limit', '95.1% confidence limit', 'Doug Hubatsch', 'first-line therapy', 'one site', 'statistical non-inferiority', 'up visits', 'IOP reduction', 'mean time-matched', '7.1 to 9.4 mmHg', 'Nicox SA', 'time-matched IOP', 'month 3 visits', 'time-matched change', 'baseline IOP', 'NCX 470 patients', 'latanoprost patients', '1.5 mmHg', '‚â§1.0 mmHg', '691 patients', 'approval', '6 timepoints', 'release', 'France', 'standard', 'care', '8 AM', '4 PM', 'week', 'number', 'additional', 'profile', 'activity', 'properties', 'difference', 'follow', 'favor', 'teams', 'contributions', 'safety', '56 sites', 'China', '7:30']",2022-10-31,2022-10-31,globenewswire.com
