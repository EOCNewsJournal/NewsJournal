Inventiva‚Äôs R&D capabilities and objectives remain unaltered.Fr√©d√©ric Cren  Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and cofounder of Inventiva  stated: ‚ÄúAlthough we are disappointed to see the end of cedirogant‚Äôs clinical program following the analysis of a nonclinical toxicology study  we wish to thank our partner AbbVie for 10 years of collaboration. We are now fully focused on the development of our lead asset lanifibranor  a promising treatment which is currently in Phase III clinical development for the treatment of NASH  a disease for which there are currently no treatments approved by regulatory agencies. We continue to make progress in our NATiV3 pivotal Phase III trial and we recently reached a major milestone in this respect by entering into a partnership with Sino Biopharm  a leading Chinese pharmaceutical group  to develop and potentially commercialize lanifibranor in Greater China.‚ÄùIn 2012  Inventiva and AbbVie signed a multi-year drug discovery collaboration agreement to identify potent RORg inverse agonists for the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. Inventiva‚Äôs and AbbVie‚Äôs joint efforts led to the discovery of cedirogant  which was being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial at the time of AbbVie‚Äôs decision to discontinue further clinical development.Story continuesAbout InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  MPS and other diseases with significant unmet medical need.

In 2020  Inventiva announced positive topline data from its Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of adult patients with NASH and obtained both FDA Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation for lanifibranor in the treatment of NASH. Lanifibranor is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial.Inventiva‚Äôs pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva‚Äôs decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development.

The 99-megawatt (MW) wind farm represents an estimated capital investment of approximately $158 million and generates enough energy to power the equivalent of more than 22 000 average Oklahoma homes annually. The project has provided significant economic and environmental benefits for Grady County and across Oklahoma.During construction  Redbed Plains created 114 full-time equivalent jobs and currently employs nine permanent team members who operate and perform regular maintenance on the site. Redbed Plains has also contributed an estimated $8 million of spending within 50 miles of the project due to the project‚Äôs development. In addition to local investments  the project has paid out more than $2.2 million to landowners through land lease payments and disbursed $5.8 million to local governments  enhancing schools  roads  infrastructure  and other essential services. Redbed Plains also saves more than 176 million gallons of water each year  which is the amount needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the wind farm.‚ÄúEDPR NA takes pride in our close relationship with the community surrounding the Redbed Plains Wind Farm and in safely operating and providing clean  cost-effective energy ‚Äù Larry Martin  Operations Manager ‚Äì Redbed Plains Wind Farm said. ‚ÄúThis five-year anniversary is just the beginning of a long-lasting relationship with our supportive neighbors  and on behalf of EDP Renewables  Connor  Clark & Lunn Infrastructure and Redbed Plains  we look forward to being a contributing community member for years to come.‚ÄùStory continuesEDPR NA and CC&L Infrastructure manage Redbed Plains through a long-term partnership representing more than 560 MW in renewable power generation.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP‚Äôs share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The IOP-lowering effect from baseline for NCX 470 was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits). In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  statistical superiority was not achieved  however the IOP reductions for NCX 470 were numerically greater than those for latanoprost at all 6 timepoints  and statistically significant (p<0.049) at 4 of the 6 timepoints. NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  is currently in a Phase 3 clinical program.‚ÄúThese results demonstrate that NCX 470 has a robust intraocular pressure lowering effect  with good tolerability  and that it clearly met the primary objective of the Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial. NCX 470 is the first non-combination product to demonstrate statistical non-inferiority  and numerically greater intraocular pressure reduction  compared to a prostaglandin analog in a pivotal trial. We are continuing to examine the Mont Blanc data including a number of additional ongoing pre-specified analyses which are important to fully define the profile of NCX 470  as well as further exploring NCX 470‚Äôs activity on retinal cell protection  beyond its intraocular pressure lowering properties.‚Äù said Andreas Segerros  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Glaucoma Mont Blanc Phase 3 Topline Results SummaryIOP-lowering effect from baseline was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg for NCX 470 vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits).Non-inferiority was met vs. latanoprost in the primary efficacy analysis.The upper limit of the 95.1% confidence limit on the difference in the treatment effect between NCX 470 and latanoprost in change from baseline in time-matched IOP to the follow-up visits (week 2  week 6  and month 3) was ‚â§1.5 mmHg and ‚â§1.0 mmHg at all 6 timepoints.In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  NCX 470 was statistically superior (p<0.049) to latanoprost in intraocular pressure reduction from baseline at 4 of the 6 timepoints  and numerically greater at all 6 timepoints but did not reach the overall statistical superiority pre-specified as an secondary efficacy endpoint. The difference in IOP reduction between NCX 470 and latanoprost was up to 1.0 mmHg in favor of NCX 470.NCX 470 was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was ocular hyperemia in 11.9% of the NCX 470 patients vs. 3.3% of latanoprost patients. There were no ocular serious adverse events and no treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events. 4.3% of patients on NCX 470 discontinued compared to 5.1% on latanoprost. ‚ÄúWe would like to acknowledge and thank all patients  clinical investigators and their teams for their contributions to the Mont Blanc trial  particularly during the challenging COVID-19 pandemic period.‚Äù said Doug Hubatsch  Executive Vice President  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Phase 3 Trials DesignsMont Blanc is a randomized  multi-regional  double-masked  parallel group trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution  0.1% compared to latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0.005% in 691 patients. Latanoprost is the most widely prescribed first-line therapy for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Mont Blanc trial enrolled 691 patients in 56 sites in the United States and one site in China. The primary efficacy evaluation was based on reduction from baseline in mean time-matched IOP at 6 timepoints: 8 AM and 4 PM at week 2  week 6 and month 3.The similarly designed  ongoing  second Phase 3 trial  Denali  is being conducted at clinical sites in the U.S. and China  with topline results expected after 2024. The Denali trial also includes a long term safety extension through to 12 months  and is being jointly conducted and equally financed with our Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics.The Mont Blanc and Denali trials have been designed to fulfill the regulatory requirements to support New Drug Application (NDA) submissions in the U.S. and China and will also provide data for other countries accepting the same clinical data package for approval. The design of the efficacy part of the Denali trial is identical to that of Mont Blanc  however there is no guarantee that the results will be the same. Both trials are necessary  and certain additional clinical and non-clinical data will also be required to complete NDA submissions. Should NCX 470 be developed for other territories  for example Europe or Japan  there may be additional requirements.About NCX 470NCX 470 is a novel  nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop that leverages the potent IOP-lowering effects of NO and prostaglandin analogs (PGAs). NCX 470 incorporates Nicox‚Äôs proprietary NO-donating research platform and bimatoprost in a single molecule. NCX 470 is designed to release bimatoprost and NO into the eye to lower IOP by two pathways in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. NO is a well-known  small  naturally-occurring signaling molecule that plays a key role in the regulation of IOP through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC).

Initially  the lengthy delivery times for flat-rolled products on the market had forced distributors to build up stocks in order to meet renewed demand. The sharp fall in the price of aluminium at the end of Q1 then led to a sharp deceleration in orders by distributors and a rapid return to more normal delivery times by rolling mills in the market. Typically  this slowdown in demand from distributors takes several months to be reflected in the Company's sales. In this context  tolling sales continued to be strong until after the end of the period and grew by 18.5% for the half year as a whole.Package Sales  which include metal (16% of half-year sales)  fell by 12.5%  despite the increase in sales in Europe. They were impacted by i) the closure of the Russian market due to the conflict in Ukraine and ii) the continued weakness of the Asian markets due to high costs and long delivery times.During the half year  the macro-economic environment was strongly affected by renewed inflation  which accelerated following the outbreak of war in Ukraine and Russia and its impact on the global economic environment. The company reacted by increasing its prices; however  the growth of its operating expenses  including a significant increase in its energy and raw material costs  weighed on the half-year results.Story continuesDespite the lower results against a high base of comparison in 2021  the Company still managed to maintain a high level of profitability and a strong and healthy balance sheet at 30 June 2022.ResultsThe increase in the Company's sales and the shift in the product mix towards subcontracting were strongly affected by the rise in production costs (energy and raw materials)  which impacted the gross margin for the first half of the year  which rose by only 2.9% compared to the previous year.Increased personnel costs (+5.1%) and other operating expenses (+24%) also affected the Company's operating profitability. EBITDA thus decreased by - ‚Ç¨0.5m compared to the previous year and amounting to ‚Ç¨2.5m  representing 18.1% of sales  compared to 24.4% of sales in the first half of 2021.After depreciation and amortisation down by ‚Ç¨0.4m to ‚Ç¨1.5m  operating profit was ‚Ç¨1.0m  or 7.2% of sales  compared with ‚Ç¨1.1m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(1.9)m in the first half of 2020.The net result for the first half of 2022 is a profit of ‚Ç¨0.85m  compared to ‚Ç¨0.95m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(2.1)m in the first half of 2020.Simplified income statement(‚Ç¨M) 2022 H1 2021 H1 Sales 13.95 12.45 Tolling sales 11.68 9.86 Package sales1 2.27 2.59 EBITDA 2.52 3.04 % of sales 18.1% 24.4% Operating profit 1.01 1.13 % of sales 7.2% 9.1% Income before tax 0.85 0.95 Net income 0.80 0.95 % of sales 5.7% 7.6%ReviewTaking into account the results of the half-year  shareholders' equity at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨30.0m  an increase of ‚Ç¨0.8m compared to 31 December 2021. Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2022 improved to ‚Ç¨3.4m  compared to ‚Ç¨2.2m at 31 December 2021 and ‚Ç¨0.5m at 30 June 2021. Net financial debt at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨4.6m  up ‚Ç¨0.7m on the previous year  and represented 15.3% of equity  compared with 13.4% at 31 December 2021 and 25.2% at 30 June 2021.2022 third quarter salesSales for the third quarter of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨6.7m  up 5.3% on the previous year. Tolling sales decreased(- 3.1%)  while Package Sales grew strongly (+ 38.5%). As a result  sales for the first nine months of the 2022 financial year amounted to ‚Ç¨20.7m  up 9.8% on the same period of the previous year.OutlookIn an increasingly unstable environment  the Company remains cautious and anticipates a continued slowdown in tolling demand towards the end of the year as distributors run down part of their stocks.In order to cope with the significant increases in energy costs in Europe  the Company is gearing its operations in the short term to its Landen site in Belgium  where energy prices are currently lower  and is relying on its high-efficiency Line 6 in Germany as a back-up.At the same time  the company is accelerating its energy efficiency investment projects through an action plan aimed at the sustainable use of renewable energy sources at attractive costs. A solar energy park  developed in partnership with local specialist operators in Germany  came on stream in October 2022; this will make it possible to significantly reduce part of the electricity costs in the medium term at the Bernburg site.More generally  the Company is taking steps to limit the impact of an economic slowdown on its results  relying in particular on the flexibility of its industrial facilities and the continued optimisation of its cost base.The Company is confident in its longer-term development prospects and is capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable and low carbon footprint products to increase the potential of its business.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 October 2022. They are included in the 2022 half-yearly financial report available on the company's financial website (http://investors.coil.be).Agenda2022 annual sales will be published on 26 January 2023 after the close of trading.About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes.

With this project  EUROAPI expects to meet the growing Contra‚Ä¶,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:EUROAPI (Paris:EAPI) announces an initial ‚Ç¨18 million investment for the installation of new state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment at its Frankfurt site. With this project  EUROAPI expects to meet the growing Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) demand for peptides and oligonucleotides. It will bolster the company‚Äôs German operations and reinforce EUROAPI‚Äôs commitment to advancing innovation in differentiated segments of active pharmaceutical ingredients to serve the needs of both customers and patients.The investment will be focused on the debottlenecking of the current capacity with the objective of increasing EUROAPI‚Äôs peptide and oligonucleotide output to circa 500 kilograms per year by 2025. This investment will be made in several stages  which will enable EUROAPI to gradually increase capacity over this period  with no downtime. Capacity could also be further enhanced in the future with additional limited investment.‚ÄúEUROAPI has a strong legacy in the development of peptides and oligonucleotides since 1976 and 2006 respectively  building upon a dedicated team of researchers and GMP manufacturers ‚Äù said C√©cile Maupas  Chief CDMO Officer  EUROAPI. ‚ÄúPeptides and oligonucleotides constitute a growing market with limited available capacity; we expect this new equipment and debottlenecking to take us one step closer to being a market leader.‚ÄùBy increasing its capacity  EUROAPI expects to meet demand for greater capacity associated with late stage products. It also aims at strengthening the company‚Äôs ability to be a long-term partner for pharmaceutical organizations at the forefront of research  offering services from early development through to the commercial stage for new therapeutic platforms.Peptides and oligonucleotides are priority segments for EUROAPI‚Äôs CDMO business.

The 99-megawatt (MW) wind farm represents an estimated capital investment of approximately $158 million and generates enough energy to power the equivalent of more than 22 000 average Oklahoma homes annually. The project has provided significant economic and environmental benefits for Grady County and across Oklahoma.During construction  Redbed Plains created 114 full-time equivalent jobs and currently employs nine permanent team members who operate and perform regular maintenance on the site. Redbed Plains has also contributed an estimated $8 million of spending within 50 miles of the project due to the project‚Äôs development. In addition to local investments  the project has paid out more than $2.2 million to landowners through land lease payments and disbursed $5.8 million to local governments  enhancing schools  roads  infrastructure  and other essential services. Redbed Plains also saves more than 176 million gallons of water each year  which is the amount needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the wind farm.‚ÄúEDPR NA takes pride in our close relationship with the community surrounding the Redbed Plains Wind Farm and in safely operating and providing clean  cost-effective energy ‚Äù Larry Martin  Operations Manager ‚Äì Redbed Plains Wind Farm said. ‚ÄúThis five-year anniversary is just the beginning of a long-lasting relationship with our supportive neighbors  and on behalf of EDP Renewables  Connor  Clark & Lunn Infrastructure and Redbed Plains  we look forward to being a contributing community member for years to come.‚ÄùEDPR NA and CC&L Infrastructure manage Redbed Plains through a long-term partnership representing more than 560 MW in renewable power generation.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP‚Äôs share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate. VGP operates a fully integrated business model with capabilities and longstanding expertise across the value chain.

Initially  the lengthy delivery times for flat-rolled products on the market had forced distributors to build up stocks in order to meet renewed demand. The sharp fall in the price of aluminium at the end of Q1 then led to a sharp deceleration in orders by distributors and a rapid return to more normal delivery times by rolling mills in the market. Typically  this slowdown in demand from distributors takes several months to be reflected in the Company's sales. In this context  tolling sales continued to be strong until after the end of the period and grew by 18.5% for the half year as a whole.Package Sales  which include metal (16% of half-year sales)  fell by 12.5%  despite the increase in sales in Europe. They were impacted by i) the closure of the Russian market due to the conflict in Ukraine and ii) the continued weakness of the Asian markets due to high costs and long delivery times.During the half year  the macro-economic environment was strongly affected by renewed inflation  which accelerated following the outbreak of war in Ukraine and Russia and its impact on the global economic environment. The company reacted by increasing its prices; however  the growth of its operating expenses  including a significant increase in its energy and raw material costs  weighed on the half-year results.Despite the lower results against a high base of comparison in 2021  the Company still managed to maintain a high level of profitability and a strong and healthy balance sheet at 30 June 2022.ResultsThe increase in the Company's sales and the shift in the product mix towards subcontracting were strongly affected by the rise in production costs (energy and raw materials)  which impacted the gross margin for the first half of the year  which rose by only 2.9% compared to the previous year.Increased personnel costs (+5.1%) and other operating expenses (+24%) also affected the Company's operating profitability. EBITDA thus decreased by - ‚Ç¨0.5m compared to the previous year and amounting to ‚Ç¨2.5m  representing 18.1% of sales  compared to 24.4% of sales in the first half of 2021.After depreciation and amortisation down by ‚Ç¨0.4m to ‚Ç¨1.5m  operating profit was ‚Ç¨1.0m  or 7.2% of sales  compared with ‚Ç¨1.1m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(1.9)m in the first half of 2020.The net result for the first half of 2022 is a profit of ‚Ç¨0.85m  compared to ‚Ç¨0.95m in the first half of 2021 and a loss of ‚Ç¨(2.1)m in the first half of 2020.Simplified income statement(‚Ç¨M) 2022 H1 2021 H1 Sales 13.95 12.45 Tolling sales 11.68 9.86 Package sales1 2.27 2.59 EBITDA 2.52 3.04 % of sales 18.1% 24.4% Operating profit 1.01 1.13 % of sales 7.2% 9.1% Income before tax 0.85 0.95 Net income 0.80 0.95 % of sales 5.7% 7.6%ReviewTaking into account the results of the half-year  shareholders' equity at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨30.0m  an increase of ‚Ç¨0.8m compared to 31 December 2021. Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2022 improved to ‚Ç¨3.4m  compared to ‚Ç¨2.2m at 31 December 2021 and ‚Ç¨0.5m at 30 June 2021. Net financial debt at 30 June 2022 was ‚Ç¨4.6m  up ‚Ç¨0.7m on the previous year  and represented 15.3% of equity  compared with 13.4% at 31 December 2021 and 25.2% at 30 June 2021.2022 third quarter salesSales for the third quarter of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨6.7m  up 5.3% on the previous year. Tolling sales decreased(- 3.1%)  while Package Sales grew strongly (+ 38.5%). As a result  sales for the first nine months of the 2022 financial year amounted to ‚Ç¨20.7m  up 9.8% on the same period of the previous year.OutlookIn an increasingly unstable environment  the Company remains cautious and anticipates a continued slowdown in tolling demand towards the end of the year as distributors run down part of their stocks.In order to cope with the significant increases in energy costs in Europe  the Company is gearing its operations in the short term to its Landen site in Belgium  where energy prices are currently lower  and is relying on its high-efficiency Line 6 in Germany as a back-up.At the same time  the company is accelerating its energy efficiency investment projects through an action plan aimed at the sustainable use of renewable energy sources at attractive costs. A solar energy park  developed in partnership with local specialist operators in Germany  came on stream in October 2022; this will make it possible to significantly reduce part of the electricity costs in the medium term at the Bernburg site.More generally  the Company is taking steps to limit the impact of an economic slowdown on its results  relying in particular on the flexibility of its industrial facilities and the continued optimisation of its cost base.The Company is confident in its longer-term development prospects and is capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable and low carbon footprint products to increase the potential of its business.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 October 2022.

The IOP-lowering effect from baseline for NCX 470 was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits). In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  statistical superiority was not achieved  however the IOP reductions for NCX 470 were numerically greater than those for latanoprost at all 6 timepoints  and statistically significant (p<0.049) at 4 of the 6 timepoints. NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  is currently in a Phase 3 clinical program.‚ÄúThese results demonstrate that NCX 470 has a robust intraocular pressure lowering effect  with good tolerability  and that it clearly met the primary objective of the Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial. NCX 470 is the first non-combination product to demonstrate statistical non-inferiority  and numerically greater intraocular pressure reduction  compared to a prostaglandin analog in a pivotal trial. We are continuing to examine the Mont Blanc data including a number of additional ongoing pre-specified analyses which are important to fully define the profile of NCX 470  as well as further exploring NCX 470‚Äôs activity on retinal cell protection  beyond its intraocular pressure lowering properties.‚Äù said Andreas Segerros  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Glaucoma Mont Blanc Phase 3 Topline Results SummaryIOP-lowering effect from baseline was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg for NCX 470 vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost (reduction in time-matched IOP at 8 AM and 4 PM across the week 2  week 6 and month 3 visits).Non-inferiority was met vs. latanoprost in the primary efficacy analysis.The upper limit of the 95.1% confidence limit on the difference in the treatment effect between NCX 470 and latanoprost in change from baseline in time-matched IOP to the follow-up visits (week 2  week 6  and month 3) was ‚â§1.5 mmHg and ‚â§1.0 mmHg at all 6 timepoints.The upper limit of the 95.1% confidence limit on the difference in the treatment effect between NCX 470 and latanoprost in change from baseline in time-matched IOP to the follow-up visits (week 2  week 6  and month 3) was ‚â§1.5 mmHg and ‚â§1.0 mmHg at all 6 timepoints. In a pre-specified secondary efficacy analysis of time-matched change from baseline IOP  NCX 470 was statistically superior (p<0.049) to latanoprost in intraocular pressure reduction from baseline at 4 of the 6 timepoints  and numerically greater at all 6 timepoints but did not reach the overall statistical superiority pre-specified as an secondary efficacy endpoint. The difference in IOP reduction between NCX 470 and latanoprost was up to 1.0 mmHg in favor of NCX 470.NCX 470 was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was ocular hyperemia in 11.9% of the NCX 470 patients vs. 3.3% of latanoprost patients. There were no ocular serious adverse events and no treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events. 4.3% of patients on NCX 470 discontinued compared to 5.1% on latanoprost. ‚ÄúWe would like to acknowledge and thank all patients  clinical investigators and their teams for their contributions to the Mont Blanc trial  particularly during the challenging COVID-19 pandemic period.‚Äù said Doug Hubatsch  Executive Vice President  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox.NCX 470 Phase 3 Trials DesignsMont Blanc is a randomized  multi-regional  double-masked  parallel group trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution  0.1% compared to latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0.005% in 691 patients. Latanoprost is the most widely prescribed first-line therapy for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Mont Blanc trial enrolled 691 patients in 56 sites in the United States and one site in China. The primary efficacy evaluation was based on reduction from baseline in mean time-matched IOP at 6 timepoints: 8 AM and 4 PM at week 2  week 6 and month 3.The similarly designed  ongoing  second Phase 3 trial  Denali  is being conducted at clinical sites in the U.S. and China  with topline results expected after 2024. The Denali trial also includes a long term safety extension through to 12 months  and is being jointly conducted and equally financed with our Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics.The Mont Blanc and Denali trials have been designed to fulfill the regulatory requirements to support New Drug Application (NDA) submissions in the U.S. and China and will also provide data for other countries accepting the same clinical data package for approval. The design of the efficacy part of the Denali trial is identical to that of Mont Blanc  however there is no guarantee that the results will be the same. Both trials are necessary  and certain additional clinical and non-clinical data will also be required to complete NDA submissions. Should NCX 470 be developed for other territories  for example Europe or Japan  there may be additional requirements.About NCX 470NCX 470 is a novel  nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop that leverages the potent IOP-lowering effects of NO and prostaglandin analogs (PGAs). NCX 470 incorporates Nicox‚Äôs proprietary NO-donating research platform and bimatoprost in a single molecule. NCX 470 is designed to release bimatoprost and NO into the eye to lower IOP by two pathways in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. NO is a well-known  small  naturally-occurring signaling molecule that plays a key role in the regulation of IOP through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). NO brings additional IOP-lowering efficacy by enhancing aqueous humor drainage from the eye via a different mechanism of action than that engaged by prostaglandin analogs. Bimatoprost  marketed under the brand name LUMIGAN¬Æ by AbbVie  Inc.  is the leading branded PGA. PGAs are the most widely used class of drugs for IOP-lowering in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.39,0.24,0.37,True,English,"['First Phase 3 Glaucoma Trial', 'Nicox Reports', 'Primary Objective', 'Mont Blanc', 'NCX 470', 'novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop', 'randomized, multi-regional, double-masked, parallel group trial', 'Glaucoma Mont Blanc Phase 3 Topline Results Summary', '691-patient Mont Blanc Phase 3 clinical trial', 'treatment-related non-ocular serious adverse events', 'robust intraocular pressure lowering effect', 'Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial', 'challenging COVID-19 pandemic period', 'The Mont Blanc trial', 'NCX 470 Phase 3 Trials Designs', '9.7 mmHg intraocular pre ssure', 'greater intraocular pressure reduction', 'Phase 3 clinical program', 'two Phase 3 trials', 'Mont Blanc data', 'common adverse event', 'international ophthalmology company', 'first non-combination product', 'ongoing pre-specified analyses', 'retinal cell protection', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Executive Vice President', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'ongoing, second Pha', 'The IOP-lowering effect', 'secondary efficacy analysis', 'secondary efficacy endpoint', 'primary efficacy analysis', 'primary efficacy evaluation', 'secondary efficacy objective', 'primary efficacy objective', 'overall statistical superiority', 'NCX 470 ophthalmic solution', 'latanoprost ophthalmic solution', 'pivotal trial', 'open-angle glaucoma', 'clinical investigators', 'primary objective', 'treatment effect', 'efficacy requirements', 'ocular hypertension', 'ocular hyperemia', 'United States', 'Daily dosing', 'Sophia Antipolis', 'Euronext Paris', 'good tolerability', 'prostaglandin analog', 'Andreas Segerros', 'upper limit', '95.1% confidence limit', 'Doug Hubatsch', 'first-line therapy', 'one site', 'statistical non-inferiority', 'up visits', 'IOP reduction', 'mean time-matched', '7.1 to 9.4 mmHg', 'Nicox SA', 'time-matched IOP', 'month 3 visits', 'time-matched change', 'baseline IOP', 'NCX 470 patients', 'latanoprost patients', '1.5 mmHg', '‚â§1.0 mmHg', '691 patients', 'approval', '6 timepoints', 'release', 'France', 'standard', 'care', '8 AM', '4 PM', 'week', 'number', 'additional', 'profile', 'activity', 'properties', 'difference', 'follow', 'favor', 'teams', 'contributions', 'safety', '56 sites', 'China', '7:30']",2022-10-31,2022-11-01,globenewswire.com

Regarding the phase 2-3 COVA clinical study evaluating Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of COVID-19-related respiratory failure  we took into account the evolution of the pandemic and decided to suspend patient recruitment at the 237th patient in order to be able to report the results of this study as soon as possible. We believe that the top line results from this study  which were released early September 2022  and will be followed by full results  are very promising. They show tolerance of Sarconeos (BIO101) in treated patients  a 39% reduction in the risk of respiratory failure or early death. We are very encouraged by the data and are currently working on the best strategy to further develop Sarconeos in COVID-19 and provide early access to this product in several countries. To this end  we intend to hold discussions with the relevant regulatory authorities in the near future  notably in Europe  the US and Brazil  a country where we had already obtained an EAP in February 2022.In parallel  our teams worked to finalize the protocol for Phase 3 of our SARA programme. We have interacted extensively with European (EMA) and American (FDA) experts and regulatory authorities to design the first phase 3 ever conducted worldwide in sarcopenia (SARA project). These interactions allowed us to propose a new protocol currently under review by these agencies. The outline of this Phase 3 trial was presented in June 2022 at the SCWD International Congress in Lisbon. In parallel  we are looking for partner laboratories to support us in this study which we intend to initiate once these agreements have been signed and the final regulatory steps have been completed.Finally  we reinitiated our efforts to launch our MYODA clinical trial  aiming to open the first centre in the first half of 2023. Our MYODA programme aims to offer a new therapeutic alternative to children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by improving the respiratory function of these patients.With 26 [employees?] as of June 30  2022  we remain a small team and carrying out all of these activities concurrently have strongly mobilised our staff. I would like to thank them for their strong involvement.Given our strong mobilisation  our cash position as of June 30  2022 and the financial tools at our disposal  we can look forward to the coming months with confidence and continue to develop Biophytis' assets serenely.""RestatementThe financial statements for the year ended December 31st  2021 will be restated to correct the accounting treatment of the Kr√©os financing contract signed in November 2021.

Awilco Drilling has explored various alternatives for maintaining the VPS registration  and has concluded that the only feasible alternative is to structure the VPS registration by way of Norwegian Depository Receipts.Since DNB Verdipapirservice currently does not offer Norwegian Depository Receipts as a product  Awilco Drilling will terminate the current registrar agreement with DNB Verdipapirservice effective from 1 November 2022 and has entered into a new registrar agreement with Nordic Issuer Services AS effective from the same date. Accordingly  Nordic Issuer Services AS will be the issuer account operator of Awilco Drilling from 1 November 2022  and will from this date be registered as the nominal holder of all the shares of Awilco Drilling in the register of members.The change from SSL registration to registration of Norwegian Depository Receipts has not yet been implemented  but will be so before the deadline for ceasing SSL registration.

NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION  IN WHOLE OR IN PART  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  INTO ...,"SalMar ASANo correction in english version  only in norwegian version.NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION  IN WHOLE OR IN PART  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  INTO OR WITHIN CANADA  AUSTRALIA  NEW ZEALAND  SOUTH AFRICA  HONG KONG  JAPAN OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION OR RELEASE WOULD BE UNLAWFULFr√∏ya  31 October 2022Reference is made to the offer document dated 17 March 2022 (the ""Offer Document"") for the recommended voluntary offer (the ""Offer"") by SalMar ASA (‚ÄúSalMar‚Äù or the ""Offeror"") to acquire all outstanding shares in NTS ASA (‚ÄúNTS‚Äù)  and the subsequent stock exchange announcements relating thereto.Reference is also made to the merger between SalMar and Norway Royal Salmon ASA (‚ÄúNRS‚Äù) (the ‚ÄúMerger‚Äù) pursuant to the merger plan dated 30 May 2022 (the ‚ÄúMerger Plan‚Äù) approved by the extraordinary general meetings of SalMar and NRS on 30 June 2022 (as amended by resolutions of the extraordinary general meetings of SalMar and NRS on 27 and 28 October 2022  respectively).Clearance received from the European CommissionThe European Commission has today declared SalMar‚Äôs acquisition of a majority of the shares in NTS pursuant the Offer to be compatible with the EU Merger Regulations  and consequently also the Merger.In connection with the clearance from the European Commission  SalMar has undertaken a commitment to divest the 16 346 824 shares in Arctic Fish Holding AS (‚ÄúArctic Fish‚Äù) currently held by NRS that will be assumed by SalMar upon completion of the Merger. The shares represent approximately 51.28% of the shares and votes in Arctic Fish. SalMar has entered into an agreement with Mowi ASA (‚ÄúMowi‚Äù) whereby Mowi will acquire these shares for a price of NOK 115 per share  subject to (i) completion of the Offer and the Merger  (ii) approval by the European Commission of Mowi as buyer of the shares and of the agreed terms of sale  and (iii) certain other customary closing conditions.Story continuesStrong strategic and operational rationale for a completion of the Merger and the OfferDespite an uncertain situation for SalMar  NTS and NRS caused by the new tax system proposed by Government  the strategic and operational rationale for proceeding with the transaction remains  with strong backing from both owners  employees and the local communities where we operate.The combination will strengthen the activities in the regions where we operate. These are the core regions in an industry in which Norway is the world leader. The position has been won through creativity  effort and passion over decades  from employees  management and shareholders. SalMar  NTS  NRS and SalmoNor are great companies  and will continue this work together. We believe  in spite of a tax proposal creating uncertainty in this industry  that striving for continued sustainability  operational excellence  and efficient use of resources remains the best path to protect jobs and value creation in this rurally based production.The parties have a long track-record in salmon farming  both in Central and Northern Norway. It is expected that a combination of the parties will realize significant synergies through a more efficient utilization of the parties' common resources. The combination will facilitate improved capacity utilization of the combined MAB and site portfolio  as well as the implementation of operational excellence  which in total are expected to provide even better biological results and lower production costs. Further  the parties have strong expertise within sales and distribution  and the combination will provide improved security for delivery of our products to customers worldwide.The parties have strong company cultures  and the anticipated production growth they expect going forward will strengthen the combined company‚Äôs position as an attractive employer requiring a competent workforce in the local communities.By unconditionally clearing the transaction  both the Norwegian Competition Authority and the European Commission have confirmed that the transaction will not lead to any significant impediment of effective competition in the market for farming of Norwegian salmon.SalMar has considered the need for a revision of the offer terms  given the major adverse setback for the industry experienced by the government‚Äôs tax proposals. This would have put the combination as such in jeopardy. While the industry will have to scale back and reduce planned investments going forward  the need to seek efficiency and economies of scale has become even greater. SalMar will pursue ambitious synergy targets and expects the transaction to increase shareholder value going forward. The entire industry will have to reassess its growth strategies and structures  and SalMar welcomes the increased resource base and operational leverage the transaction entails.More details on will be given in the upcoming quarterly presentation from SalMar on the 10th of November 2022.Completion of the MergerBased on the clearance from the European Commission and the Settlement Notification with respect to the Offer described below  SalMar and NRS have resolved to proceed to complete the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Plan.In accordance with the Merger Plan  NRS will immediately prior to completion of the Merger complete the agreed acquisition of SalmoNor AS from NTS  with settlement in cash and NRS shares.It is expected that final registration of completion of the Merger in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises will take place after close of trading on Oslo B√∏rs on 7 November 2022 (the ‚ÄúMerger Effective Date‚Äù)  which will be the last day of trading in the NRS shares.Shareholders of NRS will receive merger consideration consisting of 0.303933 shares in SalMar and NOK 52.84 in cash for each share in NRS they own as at the expiry of the Merger Effective Date  as such shareholders appear in NRS‚Äô shareholders register with Euronext Securites Oslo (VPS) as at the expiry of 9 November 2022 (the ‚ÄúMerger Record Date‚Äù).

We could not fully pass on the higher energy costs nor the inbound freight costs due to the low water levels in the rivers. Particularly pig farmers and layer farmers were affected by the (financial) consequences of outbreaks of animal diseases. We consequently saw our volumes in these sectors drop. In Poland  however  we again sold more feed to broiler farmers and our volumes were also up in the ruminant sector in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Raw material prices were somewhat lower than in the second quarter. This was a positive development for all farmers  but not yet sufficient for pig farmers. In general  they continued to produce at a loss. The increase of gross profit was not enough to cover the higher operating expenses  which included energy costs which were roughly twice as high as a year before. This consequently resulted in our consolidated underlying EBITDA being a few million lower than a year earlier. On a quarterly basis this translates into a relatively high percentage. Excluding the higher energy costs  underlying EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 would have been roughly the same as in the third quarter of 2021.Our markets are and will likely continue to be volatile. In such challenging markets we are well aware that we can rely on loyal customers and dedicated employees. They make the difference  and we are grateful for that. We remain committed to our customers and other stakeholders and will provide more insight into how we intend to continue to do so in the coming years on 17 November. Moreover  we hope to soon be able to provide more clarity on the planned joint venture with 2Agriculture in the United Kingdom  with which we will further strengthen our position in the poultry sector.‚ÄùRead the full press release on our website or download the file at the bottom of this message.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information within the meaning of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For further information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director of Investor RelationsM +31 (0)6 10 94 91 61 ‚Ä¢ E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAbout ForFarmersForFarmers N.V. is an international organisation that provides complete innovative feed solutions to the livestock farming industry.

The recent acquisition  development  and redevelopment properties comprise more than 50 million square feet  or 25% of the portfolio  and are generating significant growth. And our long-standing focus on utilizing a disciplined balance sheet provides exceptional capital access to execute on a wide set of potential opportunities in the evolving macro environment. We are well-positioned heading into 2023.‚ÄùHighlights for the Three Months Ended September 30  2022Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $15.38 per diluted share.Reported core FFO allocable to common shareholders (‚ÄúCore FFO‚Äù) of $4.13 per diluted share  an increase of 20.8% relative to the same period in 2021.Increased Same Store (as defined below) direct net operating income by 16.5%  resulting from a 14.7% increase in Same Store revenues.Achieved 80.3% Same Store direct net operating income margin  an increase of 1.6% relative to the same period in 2021.Acquired 24 self-storage facilities with 1.7 million net rentable square feet for $250.6 million. Subsequent to September 30  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 33 self-storage facilities with 1.7 million net rentable square feet  for $262.6 million.Opened five newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects with 0.5 million net rentable square feet costing $69.7 million. At September 30  2022  we had various facilities in development and expansion with 5.1 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $1.0 billion.Distributed a one-time dividend of $13.15 per common share totaling $2.3 billion in August 2022  in connection with the sale of our equity investment of PS Business Park  Inc. (‚ÄúPSB‚Äù)  upon completion of its merger transaction with the affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (‚ÄúBlackstone‚Äù) on July 20  2022.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30  2022For the three months ended September 30  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $2 712.2 million or $15.38 per diluted common share  compared to $442.3 million or $2.52 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $2 269.9 million or $12.86 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB  (ii) a $148.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income  and (iii) a $59.3 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  partially offset by (iv) a $32.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  (v) a $24.7 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to the sale of our equity investment in PSB  and (vi) a $10.4 million increase in interest expense.The $148.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $91.9 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $56.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 14.7% or $105.4 million in the three months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot  partially offset by decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 7.7% or $13.5 million in the three months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  marketing expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $56.5 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30  2022For the nine months ended September 30  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $3 779.7 million or $21.44 per diluted common share  compared to $1 174.4 million or $6.70 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $2 605.3 million or $14.74 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB  (ii) a $476.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income  and (iii) a $163.7 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  partially offset by (iv) a $153.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  and (v) a $39.2 million increase in interest expense.The $476.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the nine months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $283.2 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $193.4 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.4% or $315.9 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot  partially offset by decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 6.2% or $32.7 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  on-site property manager payroll expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $193.4 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFunds from Operations (‚ÄúFFO‚Äù) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization  which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges  which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute these measures differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.For the three months ended September 30  2022  FFO was $4.66 per diluted common share as compared to $3.61 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 29.1%.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  FFO was $13.08 per diluted common share  as compared to $9.69 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 35.0%.We also present ‚ÄúCore FFO‚Äù and ‚ÄúCore FFO per share ‚Äù non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  the impact of loss contingency accruals and casualties  unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs  severance of a senior executive  and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share (unaudited):Three Months Ended September 30  Nine Months Ended September 30  2022 2021 PercentageChange 2022 2021 PercentageChange (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO: Net income allocable to common shareholders $ 2 712 161 $ 442 327 513.2 % $ 3 779 666 $ 1 174 386 221.8 % Eliminate items excluded from FFO: Depreciation and amortization 218 963 187 611 657 131 505 218 Depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investments 10 599 19 209 44 985 54 485 Depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders (1 843 ) (1 318 ) (4 841 ) (3 413 ) Gains on sale of real estate investments  including our equity share from investments (1 219 ) (12 572 ) (54 403 ) (31 156 ) Gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc.

The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020  2021  and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2 282 facilities (149.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 74% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at September 30  2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended September 30  Nine Months Ended September 30  2022 2021 PercentageChange 2022 2021 PercentageChange (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 795 700 $ 695 556 14.4 % $ 2 286 214 $ 1 984 053 15.2 % Late charges and administrative fees 26 827 21 553 24.5 % 74 521 60 798 22.6 % Total revenues 822 527 717 109 14.7 % 2 360 735 2 044 851 15.4 % Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 72 716 70 021 3.8 % 213 947 204 287 4.7 % On-site property manager payroll 29 538 28 189 4.8 % 89 769 82 583 8.7 % Repairs and maintenance 14 605 13 121 11.3 % 43 350 39 249 10.4 % Utilities 12 020 11 133 8.0 % 33 609 31 308 7.3 % Marketing 12 492 9 180 36.1 % 32 380 30 653 5.6 % Other direct property costs 20 890 18 894 10.6 % 61 209 55 569 10.1 % Total direct cost of operations 162 261 150 538 7.8 % 474 264 443 649 6.9 % Direct net operating income (b) 660 266 566 571 16.5 % 1 886 471 1 601 202 17.8 % Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (8 329 ) (8 362 ) (0.4 )% (26 635 ) (27 906 ) (4.6 )% Centralized management costs (16 058 ) (13 808 ) 16.3 % (46 382 ) (40 136 ) 15.6 % Share-based compensation (3 309 ) (3 736 ) (11.4 )% (10 936 ) (13 825 ) (20.9 )% Net operating income (c) $ 632 570 $ 540 665 17.0 % $ 1 802 518 $ 1 519 335 18.6 % Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 80.3 % 79.0 % 1.6 % 79.9 % 78.3 % 2.0 % Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 76.9 % 75.4 % 2.0 % 76.4 % 74.3 % 2.8 % Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 94.5 % 96.8 % (2.4 )% 95.3 % 96.5 % (1.2 )% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 22.52 $ 19.22 17.2 % $ 21.39 $ 18.34 16.6 % Available square foot $ 21.28 $ 18.60 14.4 % $ 20.39 $ 17.69 15.3 % At September 30: Square foot occupancy 93.3 % 95.7 % (2.5 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 22.94 $ 19.49 17.7 %(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (‚ÄúDirect NOI‚Äù)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (‚ÄúREVPAF‚Äù) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations ‚Äì Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2 282 Same Store Facilities  we have 554 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2020 or that we did not own as of January 1  2020  including 338 facilities that were acquired  59 newly developed facilities  91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 66 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the ‚ÄúNon-Same Store Facilities‚Äù). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in ‚ÄúManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‚Äù under ‚ÄúAnalysis of Net Income ‚Äì Self-Storage Operations‚Äù in our September 30  2022 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended September 30  2022  we acquired 24 self-storage facilities (ten in Oklahoma  three in South Carolina  two each in Alabama and Texas  and one each in Arizona  Florida  Iowa  Nevada  New Jersey  North Carolina and Ohio) with 1.7 million net rentable square feet for $250.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30  2022  we acquired 44 self-storage facilities (ten in Oklahoma  seven in Texas  four in North Carolina  three in South Carolina  two each in Alabama  Arizona  Florida  Maryland and Nevada  and one each in Colorado  Georgia  Indiana  Iowa  Minnesota  New Jersey  Ohio  Oregon  Pennsylvania and Tennessee) with 3.2 million net rentable square feet for $501.9 million.Additionally  on July 8  2022  we acquired from PSB the commercial interests in five properties at three sites jointly occupied with our self-storage facilities located in Maryland and Virginia  for $47.3 million.Subsequent to September 30  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 33 self-storage facilities across six states with 1.7 million net rentable square feet  for $262.6 million.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $74.7 million  NOI of $59.0 million (including Direct NOI of $61.1 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 90.1% for the nine months ended September 30  2022.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $57.3 million  NOI of $33.5 million (including Direct NOI of $35.7 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 79.3% for the nine months ended September 30  2022.During the three months ended September 30  2022  we opened five newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.5 million net rentable square feet ‚Äì 0.1 million each in Florida  Illinois  Kentucky  Michigan and Texas) costing $69.7 million. During nine months ended September 30  2022  we opened five newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.9 million net rentable square feet ‚Äì 0.2 million each in Florida and Minnesota  and 0.1 million each in Illinois  Kentucky  Michigan  New Jersey and Texas) costing $126.0 million. At September 30  2022  we had various facilities in development (2.1 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $421.0 million and various expansion projects (3.0 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $590.9 million. Our aggregate 5.1 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.8 million in California  0.6 million in Texas  0.5 million in Florida  0.4 million in Maryland  0.3 million in Washington  0.2 million each in Hawaii  Michigan  Nevada  New Jersey and New York  and 0.5 million in other states. The remaining $605.5 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On April 24  2022  PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby affiliates of Blackstone agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of PSB‚Äôs common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. On July 20  2022  PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit  including a $5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit  and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit  for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction  we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $2.1 billion  which was classified within gain on sale of our equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc. in the Consolidated Statement of Income.In connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB  on August 4  2022  we paid a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share  totaling approximately $2.3 billion  to shareholders of record as of August 1  2022.On August 15  2022  the Company redeemed its 2.370% Senior Notes due September 15  2022  with an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million.Distributions DeclaredOn October 26  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on December 29  2022 to shareholders of record as of December 14  2022.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31  2022The following table outlines the Company‚Äôs Core FFO per share estimate and certain underlying assumptions for the year ending December 31  2022  including the impact of the sale of our investment in PSB to Blackstone on July 20  2022:Guidance Ranges for 2022 Low High (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Same Store: Revenue growth 13.50% 15.00% Expense growth 6.00% 8.00% Net operating income growth 15.40% 18.00% Acquisitions $800 000 Development openings $250 000 Non-Same Store net operating income $500 000 $510 000 Ancillary net operating income $160 000 $165 000 General and administrative expense $105 000 $111 000 Interest expense $140 000 Preferred dividends $195 000 Capital expenditures $400 000 $450 000 Core FFO per share (before the impact of the sale of PSB) $15.57 $15.97 Impact of the sale of PSB (0.22) (0.22) Core FFO per share $15.35 $15.75 Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2023 and beyond) $157 000Forward-looking Core FFO per share measures exclude estimates for the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items such as loss contingency accruals  casualties  transactional due diligence  and advisory costs. Public Storage is unable to provide a reconciliation of Core FFO per share guidance measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future U.S. GAAP results.Third Quarter Conference CallA conference call is scheduled for November 2  2022 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the third quarter earnings results.

We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment  debt repayment and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FAD is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute this measure differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. (b) A special dividend of $13.15 per common share was paid on August 4  2022  in connection with the gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB on July 20  2022. (c) Supplemental payout ratio  excluding the impact of the special dividend  which was due to the gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB. This supplemental measure is presented to portray regular dividends  because FAD excludes the gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB.PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Reconciliation of Self-Storage Net Operating Income to Net Income (Unaudited ‚Äì amounts in thousands) Three Months EndedSeptember 30  Nine Months EndedSeptember 30  2022 2021 2022 2021 Self-storage revenues for: Same Store Facilities $ 822 527 $ 717 109 $ 2 360 735 $ 2 044 851 Acquired facilities 108 989 51 007 290 858 94 502 Newly developed and expanded facilities 71 362 52 806 197 337 140 497 Other non-same store facilities 24 496 19 588 68 745 54 000 Self-storage revenues 1 027 374 840 510 2 917 675 2 333 850 Self-storage cost of operations for: Same Store Facilities 189 957 176 444 558 217 525 516 Acquired facilities 38 058 16 555 101 949 35 693 Newly developed and expanded facilities 21 265 18 075 59 986 52 710 Other non-same store facilities 6 190 5 925 18 801 17 780 Self-storage cost of operations 255 470 216 999 738 953 631 699 Self-storage NOI for: Same Store Facilities 632 570 540 665 1 802 518 1 519 335 Acquired facilities 70 931 34 452 188 909 58 809 Newly developed and expanded facilities 50 097 34 731 137 351 87 787 Other non-same store facilities 18 306 13 663 49 944 36 220 Self-storage NOI (a) 771 904 623 511 2 178 722 1 702 151 Ancillary revenues 60 757 54 421 175 946 157 658 Ancillary cost of operations (21 572 ) (19 735 ) (54 297 ) (52 044 ) Depreciation and amortization (220 772 ) (188 552 ) (661 608 ) (508 139 ) General and administrative expense (29 501 ) (31 682 ) (81 401 ) (78 996 ) Interest and other income 12 736 3 356 26 394 9 321 Interest expense (34 113 ) (23 736 ) (100 178 ) (60 980 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities 8 180 32 860 100 129 81 382 Gain on sale of real estate 1 503 279 1 503 13 683 Gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc. 2 128 860 ‚Äî 2 128 860 ‚Äî Foreign currency exchange gain 100 170 40 906 237 270 73 584 Net income on our income statement $ 2 778 152 $ 491 628 $ 3 951 340 $ 1 337 620,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.77,0.22,0.01,True,English,"['Public Storage Reports Results', 'Nine Months', 'Three', 'Same Store direct net operating income margin', '1.7 million net rentable square feet', '0.5 million net rentable square feet', '5.1 million net rentable square feet', 'higher realized annual rent', 'other direct property costs', 'unconsolidated real estate entities', 'self-storage net operating income', 'foreign currency exchange gains', '50 million square feet', 'direct operating margins', 'several industry-leading platforms', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'digital innovation centers', 'enhanced customer service', 'disciplined balance sheet', 'exceptional capital access', 'evolving macro environment', 'Blackstone Real Estate', 'Euro denominated notes', 'centralized management costs', 'property tax expense', 'Non-Same Store Facilities', 'PS Business Park', 'Same Store revenues', 'net income', 'various expansion projects', 'square foot', 'diluted common share', 'operating results', '24 self-storage facilities', '33 self-storage facilities', 'self-storage industry', '$24.7 million decrease', 'same period', 'various facilities', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'management team', '$148.4 million increase', '$59.3 million increase', '$32.2 million increase', '$10.4 million increase', '$91.9 million increase', '$56.5 million increase', '$476.6 million increase', '$163.7 million increase', 'amortization expense', 'interest expense', 'marketing expense', 'common shareholders', 'nine months', 'Public Storage', 'Joe Russell', 'recent acquisition', 'redevelopment properties', 'significant growth', 'long-standing focus', 'wide set', 'potential opportunities', 'core FFO', 'one-time dividend', 'merger transaction', '$2.1 billion gain', 'Three Months', 'equity investment', '14.7% increase', 'GLENDALE', 'Calif.', 'PSA', 'performance', 'improved', 'strength', 'quality', 'assets', 'President', 'excess', 'portfolio', 'Highlights', 'September', 'contract', 'five', 'August', 'connection', 'sale', 'Inc.', 'PSB', 'completion', 'affiliates', 'July', 'depreciation', 'earnings', 'decline', 'occupancy', 'operations', 'impact', 'fill-up', '2021']",2022-11-01,2022-11-01,businesswire.com
