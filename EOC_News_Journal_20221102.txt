12444,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/frankfurt-steps-up-efforts-to-shift-euro-clearing-from-london-1180915,Frankfurt steps up efforts to shift euro clearing from London,By Huw Jones LONDON (Reuters) -   Deutsche Boerse&#039;s derivatives division stepped up efforts on Tuesday to attract a bigger slice of multi-trillion euro derivatives clearing from London to its base in Frankfurt ahead of anticipated European Union legislat‚Ä¶,Brussels has likened the need to cut the EU‚Äôs heavy reliance on London for euro derivatives clearing since Brexit to the bloc‚Äôs need to wean itself off Russian energy.Deutsche Boerse‚Äôs Eurex Clearing said buyside customers  such as asset managers  could qualify for up to 50 000 euros ($49 655) for running an active account for clearing interest rate and other types of swaps during 2023. This would add to existing incentive schemes.‚ÄúWith this targeted incentive programme for buyside clients  we again demonstrate our strong commitment for a market-led solution which is designed to further accelerate the development of a liquid  EU-based alternative for the clearing of OTC interest rate swaps ‚Äù said Matthias Graulich  a member of Eurex Clearing‚Äôs executive board.Based on Eurex‚Äôs current eligible client base  the incentive pool is worth up to 25 million euros  it said.Since Britain fully left the EU at the end of 2020  its financial sector has lost its unfettered access to the bloc  but Brussels has allowed EU market participants to continue using UK clearing houses until June 2025  to give time for them to shift business to the EU.The London Stock Exchange Group‚Äôs LCH business clears the bulk of euro interest rate swaps  and the EU‚Äôs executive European Commission is due in early December to put forward legislation to ‚Äúincentivise‚Äù a shift from London to the EU.Derivatives industry officials expect the EU draft law to include forcing EU market participants to have an ‚Äúactive‚Äù account with a clearing house in the bloc  with perhaps minimum volume requirements.The EU‚Äôs securities watchdog ESMA has recommended that pension funds in the bloc should be made to clear their swap trades inside the EU from June 2023 to further boost volumes. Banking regulators in the EU could use existing powers to force banks to hold more capital on exposures to clearers in based in London.More than 600 clearing members and buy-side clients have been signed up by Eurex Clearing for swaps clearing  but many of the accounts are inactive.Eurex said that notional outstanding in interest rate swap contracts at its clearing house has risen by 40% since the beginning of the year to 28 trillion in mid-October  indicating a global market share of about 20%  with LCH accounting for the rest.LSEG has repeatedly said there has been no material shift in volumes from London to Frankfurt  and some 75% of euro interest rate swaps are traded among non-EU counterparts in any case.Banks say privately that mandating a shift in euro clearing would hit EU banks most as they benefit from LCH‚Äôs multi-currency pool  while Eurex focuses on the euro.Global banks say they can also shift clearing to U.S. clearers which have open ended permission from Brussels to serve customers in the EU.($1 = 1.0069 euros)(Reporting by Huw Jones.

Awilco Drilling has explored various alternatives for maintaining the VPS registration  and has concluded that the only feasible alternative is to structure the VPS registration by way of Norwegian Depository Receipts.Since DNB Verdipapirservice currently does not offer Norwegian Depository Receipts as a product  Awilco Drilling will terminate the current registrar agreement with DNB Verdipapirservice effective from 1 November 2022 and has entered into a new registrar agreement with Nordic Issuer Services AS effective from the same date. Accordingly  Nordic Issuer Services AS will be the issuer account operator of Awilco Drilling from 1 November 2022  and will from this date be registered as the nominal holder of all the shares of Awilco Drilling in the register of members.The change from SSL registration to registration of Norwegian Depository Receipts has not yet been implemented  but will be so before the deadline for ceasing SSL registration.

NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION  IN WHOLE OR IN PART  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  INTO ...,"SalMar ASANo correction in english version  only in norwegian version.NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION  IN WHOLE OR IN PART  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  INTO OR WITHIN CANADA  AUSTRALIA  NEW ZEALAND  SOUTH AFRICA  HONG KONG  JAPAN OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION OR RELEASE WOULD BE UNLAWFULFr√∏ya  31 October 2022Reference is made to the offer document dated 17 March 2022 (the ""Offer Document"") for the recommended voluntary offer (the ""Offer"") by SalMar ASA (‚ÄúSalMar‚Äù or the ""Offeror"") to acquire all outstanding shares in NTS ASA (‚ÄúNTS‚Äù)  and the subsequent stock exchange announcements relating thereto.Reference is also made to the merger between SalMar and Norway Royal Salmon ASA (‚ÄúNRS‚Äù) (the ‚ÄúMerger‚Äù) pursuant to the merger plan dated 30 May 2022 (the ‚ÄúMerger Plan‚Äù) approved by the extraordinary general meetings of SalMar and NRS on 30 June 2022 (as amended by resolutions of the extraordinary general meetings of SalMar and NRS on 27 and 28 October 2022  respectively).Clearance received from the European CommissionThe European Commission has today declared SalMar‚Äôs acquisition of a majority of the shares in NTS pursuant the Offer to be compatible with the EU Merger Regulations  and consequently also the Merger.In connection with the clearance from the European Commission  SalMar has undertaken a commitment to divest the 16 346 824 shares in Arctic Fish Holding AS (‚ÄúArctic Fish‚Äù) currently held by NRS that will be assumed by SalMar upon completion of the Merger. The shares represent approximately 51.28% of the shares and votes in Arctic Fish. SalMar has entered into an agreement with Mowi ASA (‚ÄúMowi‚Äù) whereby Mowi will acquire these shares for a price of NOK 115 per share  subject to (i) completion of the Offer and the Merger  (ii) approval by the European Commission of Mowi as buyer of the shares and of the agreed terms of sale  and (iii) certain other customary closing conditions.Story continuesStrong strategic and operational rationale for a completion of the Merger and the OfferDespite an uncertain situation for SalMar  NTS and NRS caused by the new tax system proposed by Government  the strategic and operational rationale for proceeding with the transaction remains  with strong backing from both owners  employees and the local communities where we operate.The combination will strengthen the activities in the regions where we operate. These are the core regions in an industry in which Norway is the world leader. The position has been won through creativity  effort and passion over decades  from employees  management and shareholders. SalMar  NTS  NRS and SalmoNor are great companies  and will continue this work together. We believe  in spite of a tax proposal creating uncertainty in this industry  that striving for continued sustainability  operational excellence  and efficient use of resources remains the best path to protect jobs and value creation in this rurally based production.The parties have a long track-record in salmon farming  both in Central and Northern Norway. It is expected that a combination of the parties will realize significant synergies through a more efficient utilization of the parties' common resources. The combination will facilitate improved capacity utilization of the combined MAB and site portfolio  as well as the implementation of operational excellence  which in total are expected to provide even better biological results and lower production costs. Further  the parties have strong expertise within sales and distribution  and the combination will provide improved security for delivery of our products to customers worldwide.The parties have strong company cultures  and the anticipated production growth they expect going forward will strengthen the combined company‚Äôs position as an attractive employer requiring a competent workforce in the local communities.By unconditionally clearing the transaction  both the Norwegian Competition Authority and the European Commission have confirmed that the transaction will not lead to any significant impediment of effective competition in the market for farming of Norwegian salmon.SalMar has considered the need for a revision of the offer terms  given the major adverse setback for the industry experienced by the government‚Äôs tax proposals. This would have put the combination as such in jeopardy. While the industry will have to scale back and reduce planned investments going forward  the need to seek efficiency and economies of scale has become even greater. SalMar will pursue ambitious synergy targets and expects the transaction to increase shareholder value going forward. The entire industry will have to reassess its growth strategies and structures  and SalMar welcomes the increased resource base and operational leverage the transaction entails.More details on will be given in the upcoming quarterly presentation from SalMar on the 10th of November 2022.Completion of the MergerBased on the clearance from the European Commission and the Settlement Notification with respect to the Offer described below  SalMar and NRS have resolved to proceed to complete the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Plan.In accordance with the Merger Plan  NRS will immediately prior to completion of the Merger complete the agreed acquisition of SalmoNor AS from NTS  with settlement in cash and NRS shares.It is expected that final registration of completion of the Merger in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises will take place after close of trading on Oslo B√∏rs on 7 November 2022 (the ‚ÄúMerger Effective Date‚Äù)  which will be the last day of trading in the NRS shares.Shareholders of NRS will receive merger consideration consisting of 0.303933 shares in SalMar and NOK 52.84 in cash for each share in NRS they own as at the expiry of the Merger Effective Date  as such shareholders appear in NRS‚Äô shareholders register with Euronext Securites Oslo (VPS) as at the expiry of 9 November 2022 (the ‚ÄúMerger Record Date‚Äù).

We could not fully pass on the higher energy costs nor the inbound freight costs due to the low water levels in the rivers. Particularly pig farmers and layer farmers were affected by the (financial) consequences of outbreaks of animal diseases. We consequently saw our volumes in these sectors drop. In Poland  however  we again sold more feed to broiler farmers and our volumes were also up in the ruminant sector in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Raw material prices were somewhat lower than in the second quarter. This was a positive development for all farmers  but not yet sufficient for pig farmers. In general  they continued to produce at a loss. The increase of gross profit was not enough to cover the higher operating expenses  which included energy costs which were roughly twice as high as a year before. This consequently resulted in our consolidated underlying EBITDA being a few million lower than a year earlier. On a quarterly basis this translates into a relatively high percentage. Excluding the higher energy costs  underlying EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 would have been roughly the same as in the third quarter of 2021.Our markets are and will likely continue to be volatile. In such challenging markets we are well aware that we can rely on loyal customers and dedicated employees. They make the difference  and we are grateful for that. We remain committed to our customers and other stakeholders and will provide more insight into how we intend to continue to do so in the coming years on 17 November. Moreover  we hope to soon be able to provide more clarity on the planned joint venture with 2Agriculture in the United Kingdom  with which we will further strengthen our position in the poultry sector.‚ÄùRead the full press release on our website or download the file at the bottom of this message.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information within the meaning of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For further information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director of Investor RelationsM +31 (0)6 10 94 91 61 ‚Ä¢ E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAbout ForFarmersForFarmers N.V. is an international organisation that provides complete innovative feed solutions to the livestock farming industry.

These significant steps will lead to the establishment of DSM-Firmenich  a purpose-led leading creation and innovation partner in nutrition  beauty and well-being.""Q3 HighlightsContinuing Operations:Health  Nutrition & Bioscience delivered a solid quarter with sales up 20%  organic sales growth of 9% and Adjusted EBITDA up +3%Animal Nutrition & Health: +6% organic sales growthHealth  Nutrition & Care: +11% organic sales growthFood & Beverage: +14% organic sales growthKey figures ‚Äì Continuing Operationsin ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 % Change Volume Price/mix FX Other Sales 2 182 1 824 20 % 2 % 7 % 9 % 2 % HNB 2 169 1 801 20 % 2 % 7 % 9 % 2 % ANH 975 849 15 % 0 % 6 % 9 % 0 % HNC 770 632 22 % 3 % 8 % 11 % 0 % F&B 405 308 31 % 3 % 11 % 8 % 9 % Adjusted EBITDA 356 347 3 %HNB 380 369Corporate -24 -22Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.3 % 19.0 %HNB 17.5 % 20.5 %Q3 saw strong organic sales growth  with ongoing solid end-use demand in an increasingly inflationary environment.Animal Nutrition & Health volumes were in-line with a strong prior year that had delivered 14% volume growth.

The recent acquisition  development  and redevelopment properties comprise more than 50 million square feet  or 25% of the portfolio  and are generating significant growth. And our long-standing focus on utilizing a disciplined balance sheet provides exceptional capital access to execute on a wide set of potential opportunities in the evolving macro environment. We are well-positioned heading into 2023.‚ÄùHighlights for the Three Months Ended September 30  2022Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $15.38 per diluted share.Reported core FFO allocable to common shareholders (‚ÄúCore FFO‚Äù) of $4.13 per diluted share  an increase of 20.8% relative to the same period in 2021.Increased Same Store (as defined below) direct net operating income by 16.5%  resulting from a 14.7% increase in Same Store revenues.Achieved 80.3% Same Store direct net operating income margin  an increase of 1.6% relative to the same period in 2021.Acquired 24 self-storage facilities with 1.7 million net rentable square feet for $250.6 million. Subsequent to September 30  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 33 self-storage facilities with 1.7 million net rentable square feet  for $262.6 million.Opened five newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects with 0.5 million net rentable square feet costing $69.7 million. At September 30  2022  we had various facilities in development and expansion with 5.1 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $1.0 billion.Distributed a one-time dividend of $13.15 per common share totaling $2.3 billion in August 2022  in connection with the sale of our equity investment of PS Business Park  Inc. (‚ÄúPSB‚Äù)  upon completion of its merger transaction with the affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (‚ÄúBlackstone‚Äù) on July 20  2022.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30  2022For the three months ended September 30  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $2 712.2 million or $15.38 per diluted common share  compared to $442.3 million or $2.52 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $2 269.9 million or $12.86 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB  (ii) a $148.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income  and (iii) a $59.3 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  partially offset by (iv) a $32.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  (v) a $24.7 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to the sale of our equity investment in PSB  and (vi) a $10.4 million increase in interest expense.The $148.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $91.9 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $56.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 14.7% or $105.4 million in the three months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot  partially offset by decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 7.7% or $13.5 million in the three months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  marketing expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $56.5 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30  2022For the nine months ended September 30  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $3 779.7 million or $21.44 per diluted common share  compared to $1 174.4 million or $6.70 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $2 605.3 million or $14.74 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB  (ii) a $476.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income  and (iii) a $163.7 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  partially offset by (iv) a $153.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  and (v) a $39.2 million increase in interest expense.The $476.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the nine months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $283.2 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $193.4 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.4% or $315.9 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot  partially offset by decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 6.2% or $32.7 million in the nine months ended September 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  on-site property manager payroll expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $193.4 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFunds from Operations (‚ÄúFFO‚Äù) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization  which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges  which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute these measures differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.For the three months ended September 30  2022  FFO was $4.66 per diluted common share as compared to $3.61 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 29.1%.For the nine months ended September 30  2022  FFO was $13.08 per diluted common share  as compared to $9.69 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 35.0%.We also present ‚ÄúCore FFO‚Äù and ‚ÄúCore FFO per share ‚Äù non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  the impact of loss contingency accruals and casualties  unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs  severance of a senior executive  and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share (unaudited):Three Months Ended September 30  Nine Months Ended September 30  2022 2021 PercentageChange 2022 2021 PercentageChange (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO: Net income allocable to common shareholders $ 2 712 161 $ 442 327 513.2 % $ 3 779 666 $ 1 174 386 221.8 % Eliminate items excluded from FFO: Depreciation and amortization 218 963 187 611 657 131 505 218 Depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investments 10 599 19 209 44 985 54 485 Depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders (1 843 ) (1 318 ) (4 841 ) (3 413 ) Gains on sale of real estate investments  including our equity share from investments (1 219 ) (12 572 ) (54 403 ) (31 156 ) Gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc.

The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020  2021  and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2 282 facilities (149.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 74% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at September 30  2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended September 30  Nine Months Ended September 30  2022 2021 PercentageChange 2022 2021 PercentageChange (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 795 700 $ 695 556 14.4 % $ 2 286 214 $ 1 984 053 15.2 % Late charges and administrative fees 26 827 21 553 24.5 % 74 521 60 798 22.6 % Total revenues 822 527 717 109 14.7 % 2 360 735 2 044 851 15.4 % Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 72 716 70 021 3.8 % 213 947 204 287 4.7 % On-site property manager payroll 29 538 28 189 4.8 % 89 769 82 583 8.7 % Repairs and maintenance 14 605 13 121 11.3 % 43 350 39 249 10.4 % Utilities 12 020 11 133 8.0 % 33 609 31 308 7.3 % Marketing 12 492 9 180 36.1 % 32 380 30 653 5.6 % Other direct property costs 20 890 18 894 10.6 % 61 209 55 569 10.1 % Total direct cost of operations 162 261 150 538 7.8 % 474 264 443 649 6.9 % Direct net operating income (b) 660 266 566 571 16.5 % 1 886 471 1 601 202 17.8 % Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (8 329 ) (8 362 ) (0.4 )% (26 635 ) (27 906 ) (4.6 )% Centralized management costs (16 058 ) (13 808 ) 16.3 % (46 382 ) (40 136 ) 15.6 % Share-based compensation (3 309 ) (3 736 ) (11.4 )% (10 936 ) (13 825 ) (20.9 )% Net operating income (c) $ 632 570 $ 540 665 17.0 % $ 1 802 518 $ 1 519 335 18.6 % Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 80.3 % 79.0 % 1.6 % 79.9 % 78.3 % 2.0 % Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 76.9 % 75.4 % 2.0 % 76.4 % 74.3 % 2.8 % Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 94.5 % 96.8 % (2.4 )% 95.3 % 96.5 % (1.2 )% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 22.52 $ 19.22 17.2 % $ 21.39 $ 18.34 16.6 % Available square foot $ 21.28 $ 18.60 14.4 % $ 20.39 $ 17.69 15.3 % At September 30: Square foot occupancy 93.3 % 95.7 % (2.5 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 22.94 $ 19.49 17.7 %(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (‚ÄúDirect NOI‚Äù)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (‚ÄúREVPAF‚Äù) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations ‚Äì Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2 282 Same Store Facilities  we have 554 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2020 or that we did not own as of January 1  2020  including 338 facilities that were acquired  59 newly developed facilities  91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 66 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the ‚ÄúNon-Same Store Facilities‚Äù). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in ‚ÄúManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‚Äù under ‚ÄúAnalysis of Net Income ‚Äì Self-Storage Operations‚Äù in our September 30  2022 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended September 30  2022  we acquired 24 self-storage facilities (ten in Oklahoma  three in South Carolina  two each in Alabama and Texas  and one each in Arizona  Florida  Iowa  Nevada  New Jersey  North Carolina and Ohio) with 1.7 million net rentable square feet for $250.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30  2022  we acquired 44 self-storage facilities (ten in Oklahoma  seven in Texas  four in North Carolina  three in South Carolina  two each in Alabama  Arizona  Florida  Maryland and Nevada  and one each in Colorado  Georgia  Indiana  Iowa  Minnesota  New Jersey  Ohio  Oregon  Pennsylvania and Tennessee) with 3.2 million net rentable square feet for $501.9 million.Additionally  on July 8  2022  we acquired from PSB the commercial interests in five properties at three sites jointly occupied with our self-storage facilities located in Maryland and Virginia  for $47.3 million.Subsequent to September 30  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 33 self-storage facilities across six states with 1.7 million net rentable square feet  for $262.6 million.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $74.7 million  NOI of $59.0 million (including Direct NOI of $61.1 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 90.1% for the nine months ended September 30  2022.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $57.3 million  NOI of $33.5 million (including Direct NOI of $35.7 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 79.3% for the nine months ended September 30  2022.During the three months ended September 30  2022  we opened five newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.5 million net rentable square feet ‚Äì 0.1 million each in Florida  Illinois  Kentucky  Michigan and Texas) costing $69.7 million. During nine months ended September 30  2022  we opened five newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.9 million net rentable square feet ‚Äì 0.2 million each in Florida and Minnesota  and 0.1 million each in Illinois  Kentucky  Michigan  New Jersey and Texas) costing $126.0 million. At September 30  2022  we had various facilities in development (2.1 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $421.0 million and various expansion projects (3.0 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $590.9 million. Our aggregate 5.1 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.8 million in California  0.6 million in Texas  0.5 million in Florida  0.4 million in Maryland  0.3 million in Washington  0.2 million each in Hawaii  Michigan  Nevada  New Jersey and New York  and 0.5 million in other states. The remaining $605.5 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On April 24  2022  PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby affiliates of Blackstone agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of PSB‚Äôs common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. On July 20  2022  PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit  including a $5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit  and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit  for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction  we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $2.1 billion  which was classified within gain on sale of our equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc. in the Consolidated Statement of Income.In connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB  on August 4  2022  we paid a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share  totaling approximately $2.3 billion  to shareholders of record as of August 1  2022.On August 15  2022  the Company redeemed its 2.370% Senior Notes due September 15  2022  with an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million.Distributions DeclaredOn October 26  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on December 29  2022 to shareholders of record as of December 14  2022.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31  2022The following table outlines the Company‚Äôs Core FFO per share estimate and certain underlying assumptions for the year ending December 31  2022  including the impact of the sale of our investment in PSB to Blackstone on July 20  2022:Guidance Ranges for 2022 Low High (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Same Store: Revenue growth 13.50% 15.00% Expense growth 6.00% 8.00% Net operating income growth 15.40% 18.00% Acquisitions $800 000 Development openings $250 000 Non-Same Store net operating income $500 000 $510 000 Ancillary net operating income $160 000 $165 000 General and administrative expense $105 000 $111 000 Interest expense $140 000 Preferred dividends $195 000 Capital expenditures $400 000 $450 000 Core FFO per share (before the impact of the sale of PSB) $15.57 $15.97 Impact of the sale of PSB (0.22) (0.22) Core FFO per share $15.35 $15.75 Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2023 and beyond) $157 000Forward-looking Core FFO per share measures exclude estimates for the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items such as loss contingency accruals  casualties  transactional due diligence  and advisory costs. Public Storage is unable to provide a reconciliation of Core FFO per share guidance measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future U.S. GAAP results.Third Quarter Conference CallA conference call is scheduled for November 2  2022 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the third quarter earnings results.

We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment  debt repayment and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FAD is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute this measure differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.

Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) up 7% organically; non-recurring revenues up 4%. Digital & services revenues (93% of total revenues) up 7% organically; print declined 4%. Expert solutions revenues (56% of total) up 9% organically.Nine-month adjusted operating profit up 6% in constant currencies. Nine-month adjusted operating profit margin up 50 basis points.Nine-month adjusted free cash flow down 1% in constant currencies.Net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.3x as of September 30  2022.Share buyback 2022: approx. 76% completed to date; on track to reach ‚Ç¨1 billion by year-end.Share buyback 2023: mandate signed to repurchase up to ‚Ç¨100 million in January and February 2023.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: ‚ÄúThrough the first nine months of the year  we have seen sustained strong organic growth in recurring revenues  led by our expert solutions. As expected  organic growth in transactional and other non-recurring revenues slowed in the face of challenging comparables and deteriorating economic conditions. We are investing at high levels in product innovation and in our talented workforce  and I am confident in reiterating our outlook for the full year.‚ÄùNine Months to September 30  20 2 2Total revenues increased 15%  driven to a large extent by the stronger U.S. dollar (‚Ç¨/$1.06 vs. ‚Ç¨/$1.20). In constant currencies  revenues increased 6%  with the impact of disposals (mainly the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021) exceeding the impact of acquisitions on revenues. Excluding currency  acquisitions and disposals  organic revenue growth was 6% (9M 2021: 6%).Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) sustained recent momentum  growing 7% organically in the first nine months (9M 2021: 5%). Non-recurring revenues  which include transactional revenues in Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC)  on-premise software licence and implementation fees  print books  and other ad hoc revenues  grew 4% organically (9M 2021: 9%). Digital and services revenues (93% of total revenues) grew 7% organically  led by expert solutions revenues up 9%. Total print revenues decreased 4% organically (9M 2021: 5% growth)  with print subscriptions down 7% (9M 2021: decline of 6%) and print books up 2% (9M 2021: 20% growth).Story continuesRevenues from North America (64% of total revenues) grew 6% organically (9M 2021: 7%) while revenues from Europe (28% of total) grew 5% (9M 2021: 6%). Revenues from Asia Pacific & Rest of World (8% of total) grew 15% organically (9M 2021: 2%)  sustaining the strong improvement seen in the first half.Nine-month adjusted operating profit increased 17% overall and 6% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased 50 basis points  largely driven by a favorable currency mix and an improvement in the Legal & Regulatory margin. Group-wide adjusted operating costs increased 14% overall and 6% in constant currencies year-on-year  reflecting progress on hiring and increased investment in product development and sales and marketing.Health: Nine-month revenues increased 5% in constant currencies and 5% on an organic basis (9M 2021: 9%). Clinical Solutions achieved 8% organic growth  supported by strong renewals and new customer wins for UpToDate and our drug information solutions. Patient engagement tool Emmi sustained high single-digit organic growth driven by improved retention  upselling  and new customer wins. Health Learning  Research & Practice recorded 2% organic growth against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 11%) mainly related to the ASCO publishing contract (which began in 2021). Print book organic revenue growth moderated to 13%  reflecting a decline in the third quarter. Medical research platform Ovid achieved good subscription renewals  while journal advertising revenues exhibited softness in the third quarter. On September 30  2022  we acquired IJS Publishing Group  a UK-based provider of peer-reviewed open access medical journals focused on surgery.Tax & Accounting: Nine-month revenues increased 9% in constant currencies and 9% organically (9M 2021: 6%). Corporate Performance  which comprises CCH Tagetik and our U.S. Corporate Tax unit  delivered 10% organic growth  driven by cloud software subscriptions and implementation services. The North American Professional Tax & Accounting business recorded 11% organic growth  partly reflecting favorable timing and non-recurring factors  but underpinned by continued strong performance by our cloud-based CCH Axcess platform. TeamMate  our internal audit solution  delivered robust single-digit organic growth  driven by its cloud solution. Professional Tax & Accounting Europe sustained 6% organic growth.Governance  Risk & Compliance: Nine-month revenues increased 6% in constant currencies  including the acquisitions of LicenseLogix in October 2021 and IDS in April 2022. On an organic basis  growth was 5% (9M 2021: 5%). Legal Services recorded significantly slower organic growth of 4% (9M 2021: 11%)  with recurring revenues up 6% but Legal Services transactional revenues broadly flat against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 22%). Financial Services revenues increased 6% on an organic basis (9M 2021: decline of 3%)  driven by recurring software maintenance and cloud subscription revenues in Compliance Solutions  including at eOriginal. Financial Services transactional revenues were flat (9M 2021: decline of 12%)  as sharply lower mortgage-related transaction volumes and the absence of U.S. PPP1 transactional revenues were offset by double-digit growth in transactional revenues in Lien Solutions. Finance  Risk & Reporting recorded 4% organic growth  as growth in professional services around customer implementations was partly offset by the impact of discontinuing business in Russia and Belarus.Legal & Regulatory: Nine-month revenues increased 1% in constant currencies  mainly reflecting the disposal of the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021. Organic growth was 5% (9M 2021: 4%)  lifted by sustained strong organic growth in software. EHS/ORM2 and Legal Software grew 21% (9M 2021: 6%)  driven by strong growth in cloud revenues across the board and higher non-recurring on-premise license and implementation fees for the Enablon EHS/ORM software. Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions revenues grew 2% organically (9M 2021: 3%)  with digital solutions sustaining 7% organic growth  but print products returning to historic rates of decline. The sale of our legal publishing assets in Spain and France  agreed in December 2021 and expected to complete in 2022  remains subject to the Spanish antitrust process.Corporate costs increased 10% in constant currencies in the first nine months  due to higher personnel costs and increased spending on market research and various projects.Cash Flow and Net DebtNine-month adjusted operating cash flow was flat in constant currencies due to lower cash conversion (103%) compared to a year ago (108%)  mainly as a result of higher capital expenditure and lower working capital inflows. Adjusted free cash flow decreased 1% in constant currencies  with higher cash taxes broadly offset by lower net cash outflows related to restructuring.Total cash dividends paid to shareholders amounted to ‚Ç¨401 million in the first nine months. Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was ‚Ç¨69 million in the first nine months  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS in April 2022. Divestiture proceeds  net of cash disposed and transaction costs  were negligible. In the first nine months  ‚Ç¨618 million in cash flow was deployed towards the 2022 share repurchase program.As of September 30  2022  net debt stood at ‚Ç¨2 243 million (compared to ‚Ç¨2 131 million at year-end 2021). Twelve months‚Äô rolling net-debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x compared to 1.4x at year-end 2021. In September  we issued a new ‚Ç¨500 million Eurobond with a 4-year term and 3.0% annual coupon.ESG DevelopmentsIn the year to date  we have made progress on several ESG objectives. In September  we launched our annual all-employee compliance training  covering IT and cybersecurity  data privacy  and business ethics. As of the end of October  99% of employees globally have completed the training program. Our annual engagement survey was kicked off in October. To support employee engagement and diversity  equity  inclusion  and belonging3  we have launched a 12-month inclusive leadership program for executives and people managers and we have started piloting a series of voluntary  employee-led global inclusion networks. On the environmental front  we continued to execute on two key programs that reduce our emissions: as of September 30  2022  our real estate rationalization program has achieved a 3% reduction in our global office footprint (m2) compared to December 31  2021  while our cloud migration program has decommissioned approximately 750 on-premise servers. We have also made progress on the data collection required to measure certain categories of Scope 3 emissions in line with our stated objectives of aligning to the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and of ultimately setting science-based targets.Share Buyback Program sEarly in the year  we announced a 2022 share buyback program of ‚Ç¨600 million  which was later expanded to ‚Ç¨1 billion on August 3  2022. In the year to date  through October 31  2022  we have repurchased ‚Ç¨756 million in shares (7.7 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨97.60). A third party mandate is in place to complete the final tranche of ‚Ç¨244 million in share buybacks in the period starting November 3  2022  up to and including December 28  2022.Looking ahead to 2023  we have this week signed a third-party mandate to execute up to ‚Ç¨100 million in share buybacks for the period starting January 2  2023  up to and including February 20  2023.Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we continue to believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time. Third party mandates are governed by the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans. We remain committed to our anti-dilution policy which aims to offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases.Share Cancellation 2022On August 31  2022  we cancelled 5.0 million shares that were held in treasury  as approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 2022. Following this cancellation  the number of issued ordinary shares is 257 516 153. As of September 30  2022  252.3 million shares were outstanding and 5.2 million shares were held in treasury.Full-Year 202 2 OutlookWe reiterate our full-year guidance as provided on August 3  2022. See table below. Following clarification of new U.S. tax rules on the capitalization of research and development expenses  we now expect adjusted free cash flow in constant currencies to be near the top of our guided range. We continue to expect organic momentum to slow moderately in the fourth quarter  largely due to challenging comparables.Full-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance 2021 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.0%-26.5% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow ‚Ç¨1 025-‚Ç¨1 075 million ‚Ç¨1 010 million ROIC* 14%-15% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS growth Mid- to high-single-digit growth ‚Ç¨3.38 *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of ‚Ç¨/$1.05. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (‚Ç¨/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average ‚Ç¨/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS4.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We continue to expect that restructuring costs will be within our normal range of ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨6 million). We continue to expect adjusted net financing costs5 in constant currencies to be approximately ‚Ç¨55 million  reflecting higher interest income. In addition  assuming current exchange rates persist  we would expect to incur a (non-cash) foreign exchange loss (in net financing result) of around ‚Ç¨30 million on intercompany balances and hedging at year-end.We now expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be at the lower end of our guided range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%) due to an anticipated one-time release of a provision in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditure is expected to increase year-on-year but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We continue to expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels (mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal) and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Tax & Accounting: we continue to expect organic growth to accelerate from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to an expected decline in transactional revenues in the second half. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we continue to expect organic growth to improve on 2021 levels. We expect the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to decline modestly due mainly to the absence of a one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

Transgene anticipates the last patient to be randomized in the trial in H1 2024.Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO  and Dr. Maud Brandely  Chief Medical Officer  MD  PhD  will host an analyst and investor call to discuss the interim analysis at 6:00 pm CET (1:00 pm EST) today (see details below).The Phase II study is evaluating TG4001  an investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine  in combination with avelumab compared to avelumab alone in patients with HPV16-positive anogenital tumors without liver metastases  through a continuing collaboration with the alliance of Merck KGaA  Darmstadt  Germany  and Pfizer  which is supplying avelumab.‚ÄúWe are very pleased with the outcome of this interim analysis ‚Äù said Hedi Ben Brahim  Chief Executive Officer of Transgene. ‚ÄúThe IDMC‚Äôs recommendation to continue the study reinforces our confidence in TG4001  which follows promising data from our earlier Phase Ib/II trial. This also enables us to reduce the number of patients randomized in the trial. We are looking forward to completing this trial in H1 2024 and communicating its results when they are available. We expect that positive final results from this trial will allow us to launch a registration trial to further confirm the benefit of our therapeutic vaccine candidate. TG4001 aims to provide a new solution to patients who currently have very limited treatment options.‚ÄùThe interim analysis was triggered per protocol  by a predefined number of PFS events. Based on the interim results  the IDMC‚Äôs objective was to provide a recommendation on the continuation of the trial and on the final sample size using adaptive sample size re-estimation modeling approach.To date  the treatment has been well tolerated. Adverse events are consistent with previous observations made in the Phase Ib/II trial.TG4001 is based on a MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara) vector  which is engineered to express HPV16 antigens (E6 & E7) and interleukin 2 (IL-2). TG4001 is designed to alert the immune system specifically to cells presenting the HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens that can be found in HPV16-related tumors and to induce a specific cellular immune response against these cancer cells.Phase II trial aims to show superiority of TG4001 + avelumab over avelumab monotherapyThe trial is enrolling patients in the USA and in Europe (France and Spain). It focuses on patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV16-positive anogenital cancer without liver metastases  including cervical  vulvar  vaginal  penile  and anal cancer. Patients are randomized to either receive the combination regimen of the therapeutic vaccine TG4001 and avelumab or avelumab alone.The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR)  disease control rate (DCR)  overall survival (OS) and a series of immunological parameters.A conference call in English is scheduled today  on November 2  2022  at 6 p.m. CET / 1 p.m. EST.Webcast link to English language conference call:https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/transgene/20221102_1/Participant telephone numbers:France: +33 (0) 1 70 37 71 66 United Kingdom: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200 United States: +1 212 999 6659 Confirmation code: TransgeneA replay will be available on the Transgene website (www.transgene.fr) following the live event.About the trialThe multi-center  open label  randomized Phase II trial (NCT03260023) is designed to compare the efficacy of the combination of TG4001 and avelumab versus avelumab alone in patients with advanced  recurrent and/or metastatic HPV16-positive anogenital cancers who have disease progression after a maximum of one line of systemic treatment  or who are not eligible for first-line chemotherapy.Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  M.D.  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i) at the Curie Institute  is the Principal Investigator of the study. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with Merck KGaA  Darmstadt  Germany  and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE)  which are providing avelumab for the trial. Avelumab is co-developed and co-commercialized by Merck KGaA  Darmstadt  Germany and Pfizer Inc. Transgene will continue to be the sponsor of the trial and conduct the trial. Avelumab is not approved alone or in combination for the treatment of HPV16-positive anogenital tumors in any region.Patients will receive TG4001 at the dose of 5x107 pfu  SC  weekly for 6 weeks  every 2 weeks up to six months  and every 12 weeks thereafter  in combination with avelumab or avelumab alone at 800 mg  IV every two weeks  until disease progression. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR)  disease control rate (DCR)  overall survival (OS) and other immunological parameters. The trial will enroll 120 patients.About the Phase Ib/II data of TG4001 + avelumab (single arm trial)The combination of TG4001 and avelumab demonstrated anti-tumor activity (22% ORR) in patients with previously treated recurrent and/or metastatic HPV-related cancers (including patients with oropharyngeal cancers and anogenital cancers). Presence of liver metastases had a profound impact on the outcome in terms of ORR and PFS. In patients without liver metastases  an ORR of 32%  a median PFS of 5.6 months and a median OS of 13.3 months were achieved. The treatment induced HPV-specific T-cell responses and was associated with increased levels of immune cell infiltration in the tumors and expression of genes associated with activation of the immune system. The results from the Phase Ib/II parts of the trial combining TG4001 with avelumab in HPV16-positive recurrent and/or metastatic malignancies have been updated in a R&D day held in September 2022 by Transgene. A first set of data had been presented at SITC 2020 and ESMO IO 2020 [1 2].About TG4001TG4001 is an investigational therapeutic vaccine based on a non-propagative  highly attenuated Vaccinia vector (MVA)  which is engineered to express HPV16 antigens (E6 & E7) and an adjuvant (IL-2). TG4001 is designed to have a two-pronged antiviral approach: to alert the immune system specifically to cells presenting the HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens  that can be found in HPV16-related tumors  and to further stimulate the infection-clearing activity of the immune system through interleukin 2 (IL-2). TG4001 has been administered to more than 350 individuals  demonstrating good safety and promising efficacy results [1  2 ]. Its mechanism of action and good safety profile make TG4001 an excellent candidate for combinations with other therapies in HPV-mediated solid tumors.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

The 4-period  crossover and randomized study was conducted on 40 healthy subjects  with gender  ethnicity and BMI1 diversity (ref ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05026567).The primary objective was met. It was the evaluation of the relative bioavailability of midazolam after injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 0.625mL) compared to injection of DORMICUM¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 2mL) by a conventional syringe with a 30mm needle  into the thigh on bare skin. The bioequivalence was achieved both on Cmax2 and on AUC3  with no change of Tmax4. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [84-98] for Cmax ratio  and [100-108] for AUC ratio.No serious adverse events were reported  and there was no difference in safety profile between the tested conditions. Only 2 subjects dropped out before their fourth and last injection  not for safety but for personal reason.As secondary objectives  the study aimed to test the intramuscular injection of midazolam with ZENEO¬Æ into thigh through clothing  compared to injection into thigh on bare skin with ZENEO¬Æ and with DORMICUM¬Æ. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [87-101] and [79-92] for Cmax ratios  and [87-95] and [91-98] for AUC ratios  with no change in Tmax. These results allow considering a much faster emergency treatment  without having to remove patient‚Äôs clothing in an epileptic seizure situation.In addition  an intramuscular injection with ZENEO¬Æ midazolam in the ventrogluteal site was shown to be bioequivalent to an injection in the thigh on bare skin either with a conventional syringe or with ZENEO¬Æ.Story continuesFinally  ZENEO¬Æ and the syringe with intramucular needle showed a similar and low inter-subject variability of midazolam pharmacokinetics. This is an additional demonstration that an injection with ZENEO reached the muscle in the same way as an injection with a syringe and a 30 mm needle.As a summary  the outcomes of this clinical study are a great achievement for Crossject  as they demonstrate the effectiveness of an intramuscular injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ into thigh with or without clothing  as well as into the ventrogluteal site.Contacts :CrossjectPatrick Alexandreinfo@crossject.com Relations investisseursAeliumJ√©r√¥me Gacoin +33 (0)1 75 77 54 67crossject@aelium.frRelations presseBuzz & CompagnieM√©lanie Voisard +33 (0)3 80 43 54 89melanie.voisard@buzzetcompagnie.comChristelle Distinguin +33 (0)6 09 96 51 70christelle.distinguin@buzzetcompagnie.comAbout CROSSJECT ‚Ä¢ www.crossject.comCROSSJECT (ISIN: FR0011716265; Ticker: ALCJ; LEI: 969500W1VTFNL2D85A65) is developing and is soon to market a portfolio of drugs dedicated to emergency situations: epilepsy  overdose  allergic shock  severe migraine and asthma attack.

Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) up 7% organically; non-recurring revenues up 4%. Digital & services revenues (93% of total revenues) up 7% organically; print declined 4%. Expert solutions revenues (56% of total) up 9% organically.Nine-month adjusted operating profit up 6% in constant currencies. Nine-month adjusted operating profit margin up 50 basis points.Nine-month adjusted free cash flow down 1% in constant currencies.Net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.3x as of September 30  2022.Share buyback 2022: approx. 76% completed to date; on track to reach ‚Ç¨1 billion by year-end.Share buyback 2023: mandate signed to repurchase up to ‚Ç¨100 million in January and February 2023.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: ‚ÄúThrough the first nine months of the year  we have seen sustained strong organic growth in recurring revenues  led by our expert solutions. As expected  organic growth in transactional and other non-recurring revenues slowed in the face of challenging comparables and deteriorating economic conditions. We are investing at high levels in product innovation and in our talented workforce  and I am confident in reiterating our outlook for the full year.‚ÄùNine Months to September 30  20 2 2Total revenues increased 15%  driven to a large extent by the stronger U.S. dollar (‚Ç¨/$1.06 vs. ‚Ç¨/$1.20). In constant currencies  revenues increased 6%  with the impact of disposals (mainly the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021) exceeding the impact of acquisitions on revenues. Excluding currency  acquisitions and disposals  organic revenue growth was 6% (9M 2021: 6%).Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) sustained recent momentum  growing 7% organically in the first nine months (9M 2021: 5%). Non-recurring revenues  which include transactional revenues in Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC)  on-premise software licence and implementation fees  print books  and other ad hoc revenues  grew 4% organically (9M 2021: 9%). Digital and services revenues (93% of total revenues) grew 7% organically  led by expert solutions revenues up 9%. Total print revenues decreased 4% organically (9M 2021: 5% growth)  with print subscriptions down 7% (9M 2021: decline of 6%) and print books up 2% (9M 2021: 20% growth).Revenues from North America (64% of total revenues) grew 6% organically (9M 2021: 7%) while revenues from Europe (28% of total) grew 5% (9M 2021: 6%). Revenues from Asia Pacific & Rest of World (8% of total) grew 15% organically (9M 2021: 2%)  sustaining the strong improvement seen in the first half.Nine-month adjusted operating profit increased 17% overall and 6% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased 50 basis points  largely driven by a favorable currency mix and an improvement in the Legal & Regulatory margin. Group-wide adjusted operating costs increased 14% overall and 6% in constant currencies year-on-year  reflecting progress on hiring and increased investment in product development and sales and marketing.Health: Nine-month revenues increased 5% in constant currencies and 5% on an organic basis (9M 2021: 9%). Clinical Solutions achieved 8% organic growth  supported by strong renewals and new customer wins for UpToDate and our drug information solutions. Patient engagement tool Emmi sustained high single-digit organic growth driven by improved retention  upselling  and new customer wins. Health Learning  Research & Practice recorded 2% organic growth against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 11%) mainly related to the ASCO publishing contract (which began in 2021). Print book organic revenue growth moderated to 13%  reflecting a decline in the third quarter. Medical research platform Ovid achieved good subscription renewals  while journal advertising revenues exhibited softness in the third quarter. On September 30  2022  we acquired IJS Publishing Group  a UK-based provider of peer-reviewed open access medical journals focused on surgery.Tax & Accounting: Nine-month revenues increased 9% in constant currencies and 9% organically (9M 2021: 6%). Corporate Performance  which comprises CCH Tagetik and our U.S. Corporate Tax unit  delivered 10% organic growth  driven by cloud software subscriptions and implementation services. The North American Professional Tax & Accounting business recorded 11% organic growth  partly reflecting favorable timing and non-recurring factors  but underpinned by continued strong performance by our cloud-based CCH Axcess platform. TeamMate  our internal audit solution  delivered robust single-digit organic growth  driven by its cloud solution. Professional Tax & Accounting Europe sustained 6% organic growth.Governance  Risk & Compliance: Nine-month revenues increased 6% in constant currencies  including the acquisitions of LicenseLogix in October 2021 and IDS in April 2022. On an organic basis  growth was 5% (9M 2021: 5%). Legal Services recorded significantly slower organic growth of 4% (9M 2021: 11%)  with recurring revenues up 6% but Legal Services transactional revenues broadly flat against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 22%). Financial Services revenues increased 6% on an organic basis (9M 2021: decline of 3%)  driven by recurring software maintenance and cloud subscription revenues in Compliance Solutions  including at eOriginal. Financial Services transactional revenues were flat (9M 2021: decline of 12%)  as sharply lower mortgage-related transaction volumes and the absence of U.S. PPP1 transactional revenues were offset by double-digit growth in transactional revenues in Lien Solutions. Finance  Risk & Reporting recorded 4% organic growth  as growth in professional services around customer implementations was partly offset by the impact of discontinuing business in Russia and Belarus.Legal & Regulatory: Nine-month revenues increased 1% in constant currencies  mainly reflecting the disposal of the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021. Organic growth was 5% (9M 2021: 4%)  lifted by sustained strong organic growth in software. EHS/ORM2 and Legal Software grew 21% (9M 2021: 6%)  driven by strong growth in cloud revenues across the board and higher non-recurring on-premise license and implementation fees for the Enablon EHS/ORM software. Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions revenues grew 2% organically (9M 2021: 3%)  with digital solutions sustaining 7% organic growth  but print products returning to historic rates of decline. The sale of our legal publishing assets in Spain and France  agreed in December 2021 and expected to complete in 2022  remains subject to the Spanish antitrust process.Corporate costs increased 10% in constant currencies in the first nine months  due to higher personnel costs and increased spending on market research and various projects.Cash Flow and Net DebtNine-month adjusted operating cash flow was flat in constant currencies due to lower cash conversion (103%) compared to a year ago (108%)  mainly as a result of higher capital expenditure and lower working capital inflows. Adjusted free cash flow decreased 1% in constant currencies  with higher cash taxes broadly offset by lower net cash outflows related to restructuring.Total cash dividends paid to shareholders amounted to ‚Ç¨401 million in the first nine months. Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was ‚Ç¨69 million in the first nine months  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS in April 2022. Divestiture proceeds  net of cash disposed and transaction costs  were negligible. In the first nine months  ‚Ç¨618 million in cash flow was deployed towards the 2022 share repurchase program.As of September 30  2022  net debt stood at ‚Ç¨2 243 million (compared to ‚Ç¨2 131 million at year-end 2021). Twelve months‚Äô rolling net-debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x compared to 1.4x at year-end 2021. In September  we issued a new ‚Ç¨500 million Eurobond with a 4-year term and 3.0% annual coupon.ESG DevelopmentsIn the year to date  we have made progress on several ESG objectives. In September  we launched our annual all-employee compliance training  covering IT and cybersecurity  data privacy  and business ethics. As of the end of October  99% of employees globally have completed the training program. Our annual engagement survey was kicked off in October. To support employee engagement and diversity  equity  inclusion  and belonging3  we have launched a 12-month inclusive leadership program for executives and people managers and we have started piloting a series of voluntary  employee-led global inclusion networks. On the environmental front  we continued to execute on two key programs that reduce our emissions: as of September 30  2022  our real estate rationalization program has achieved a 3% reduction in our global office footprint (m2) compared to December 31  2021  while our cloud migration program has decommissioned approximately 750 on-premise servers. We have also made progress on the data collection required to measure certain categories of Scope 3 emissions in line with our stated objectives of aligning to the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and of ultimately setting science-based targets.Share Buyback Program sEarly in the year  we announced a 2022 share buyback program of ‚Ç¨600 million  which was later expanded to ‚Ç¨1 billion on August 3  2022. In the year to date  through October 31  2022  we have repurchased ‚Ç¨756 million in shares (7.7 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨97.60). A third party mandate is in place to complete the final tranche of ‚Ç¨244 million in share buybacks in the period starting November 3  2022  up to and including December 28  2022.Looking ahead to 2023  we have this week signed a third-party mandate to execute up to ‚Ç¨100 million in share buybacks for the period starting January 2  2023  up to and including February 20  2023.Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we continue to believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time. Third party mandates are governed by the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans. We remain committed to our anti-dilution policy which aims to offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases.Share Cancellation 2022On August 31  2022  we cancelled 5.0 million shares that were held in treasury  as approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 2022. Following this cancellation  the number of issued ordinary shares is 257 516 153. As of September 30  2022  252.3 million shares were outstanding and 5.2 million shares were held in treasury.Full-Year 202 2 OutlookWe reiterate our full-year guidance as provided on August 3  2022. See table below. Following clarification of new U.S. tax rules on the capitalization of research and development expenses  we now expect adjusted free cash flow in constant currencies to be near the top of our guided range. We continue to expect organic momentum to slow moderately in the fourth quarter  largely due to challenging comparables.Full-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance 2021 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.0%-26.5% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow ‚Ç¨1 025-‚Ç¨1 075 million ‚Ç¨1 010 million ROIC* 14%-15% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS growth Mid- to high-single-digit growth ‚Ç¨3.38 *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of ‚Ç¨/$1.05. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (‚Ç¨/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average ‚Ç¨/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS4.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We continue to expect that restructuring costs will be within our normal range of ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨6 million). We continue to expect adjusted net financing costs5 in constant currencies to be approximately ‚Ç¨55 million  reflecting higher interest income. In addition  assuming current exchange rates persist  we would expect to incur a (non-cash) foreign exchange loss (in net financing result) of around ‚Ç¨30 million on intercompany balances and hedging at year-end.We now expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be at the lower end of our guided range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%) due to an anticipated one-time release of a provision in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditure is expected to increase year-on-year but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We continue to expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels (mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal) and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Tax & Accounting: we continue to expect organic growth to accelerate from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to an expected decline in transactional revenues in the second half. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we continue to expect organic growth to improve on 2021 levels. We expect the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to decline modestly due mainly to the absence of a one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

This approval was followed by the signing with Bpifrance of the contract on the state aid by the French government  up to 114 million euros for the Gigafactory within the framework of the PIIEC scheme1. The eligibility of the McPhy's project to this scheme was approved by the European Commission last July.Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Officer of McPhy  commented: ""We are very pleased with the decision of our Board of Directors  which is a positive conclusion to the various favorable notices we have recently received about our Gigafactory project. This Gigafactory will be a decisive tool in the development and design of large-scale electrolyzers  which are essential for the use of green hydrogen in ambitious decarbonization projects for industry and heavy mobility. We will soon have an industrial set-up capable of mass-producing a wide range of electrolyzers on a continental scale  that is unmatched by any other player in decarbonized electrolysis in Europe.""Antoine Ressicaud  Chief Operating Officer of McPhy  says: ‚ÄúThis is an inspiring project for the entire McPhy team  with 20 000 sqm dedicated to the manufacture and testing of multi-MW electrolyzers. Our desire is to implement the highest standards of industrial performance on this Belfort facility  through an ambitious social and environmental approach.‚ÄùStory continuesThe commissioning of the future plant on the Belfort site is scheduled from the 1st half of 2024  with a gradual ramp-up aimed at reaching an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The McPhy Group will then have a total annual production capacity of 1.3 GW2  including the capacity of the San Miniato site in Italy  in line with the growth prospects of the green hydrogen markets  particularly in industry.A phased public aid with an initial payment from Bpifrance of 28.5 million euros by the end of 2022The contract signed with Bpifrance provides for the terms and conditions for the implementation of the public aid. McPhy will receive by December 31  2022 an initial payment of 28.5 million euros. Subsequent payments will take the form of reimbursements of expenses incurred  pursuant to the terms of the contract  following the satisfactory achievement of defined milestones  for a total amount  including the initial payment  of up to 114 million euros.A strategic tool for McPhy's technological and industrial ambitionsWith this Gigafactory  McPhy is pursuing 3 objectives:Innovation : through the development of new generation alkaline electrolyzers  in terms of size  components and integration within modules;Industrialization : with large-scale production to meet the needs of the European market in particular  to contribute to the decarbonization of industry  mobility and energy;Collaboration: with numerous partners of the Hydrogen ecosystem in Europe and the dissemination of knowledge with academic  industrial and research stakeholders.The future plant in Belfort will host new developments and production of the large electrolyzers in the ""Augmented McLyzer"" range  a real technological breakthrough  enabling 20  100 MW and beyond (GW) architectures to be equipped with an output pressure of 30 bar. This large-scale R&D and industrialization effort will provide the industry with equipment capable of producing hydrogen from renewable energies at a cost that is competitive compared to alternatives using carbon energy.The Gigafactory will further strengthen the McPhy's industrial set-up with  on one hand  the electrolyzers with the ongoing automation of the San Miniato site  dedicated to the production of electrolyzers of up to 1 MW capacity and  on the other hand  the stations  on the brand-new site in Grenoble.Concurrently  Belfort's location at the crossroads of many European countries  with a genuine research and development ecosystem dedicated to innovation and hydrogen  will foster the multiplication of potential industrial and commercial partnerships.Acceleration of development investments and expenses from the second half of 2022The beginning of the construction and the purchase of the land will result in a cash outflow related to the Gigafactory of 9 million euros by the end of the year. In addition  and as previously indicated  McPhy intends to make further investments in order to be able to meet the growing demand for large-scale equipment and facilities  by increasing its R&D resources and by strengthening its project and service teams. These efforts  which are being implemented now  will result in additional expenses in the second half of 2022 and are expected to lead the year-end cash position to a level comparable to the end of the first half  taking into account the Gigafactory-related Bpifrance initial payment and cash outflows.About McPhySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

(‚ÄúAMG‚Äù  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ‚ÄúAMG‚Äù)  a global critical materials company at the forefront of CO 2 reduction trends  reported third quarter 2022 revenue of $425 million  a 36% increase versus the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 EBITDA of $103 million was the highest in AMG‚Äôs history  and a 210% increase versus the third quarter of 2021.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  ‚ÄúThis outstanding result was largely driven by AMG Lithium. The continued strength in both lithium demand and our low-cost position led to improved profitability in AMG Lithium in Brazil. The mission of AMG Lithium is to be the number one producer of electric vehicle battery materials in Europe by expanding production of battery-grade hydroxide  vertically integrating its Brazilian spodumene production and pursuing additional mineral resources.‚ÄùOutlookGiven the strong performance to date and the visibility into year end  AMG is increasing its EBITDA guidance for the full year 2022 to $320 million or higher  from a previous range of between $280 million and $300 million.Important parameters for 2023 guidance are first and foremost the startup of the expanded production of lithium concentrate in Brazil in the second half of 2023; the market conditions primarily in lithium; and the ramp-up of the Zanesville refinery to full production. In view of this  AMG‚Äôs EBITDA guidance for 2023 is to exceed $400 million. It is important to note that since the increase of spodumene production will occur in the latter half of the year  2023 EBITDA development will be back-end weighted.Strategic HighlightsLithiumThe project to expand the spodumene production in AMG Brazil is under construction. The objective is to be at full capacity in the second half of 2023.The AMG Lithium refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe‚Äôs first lithium hydroxide refinery  is under construction  and commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module of the battery-grade lithium hydroxide upgrader will commence in the fourth quarter of 2023.AMG Lithium‚Äôs battery-grade hydroxide refinery has signed a binding supply agreement with EcoPro  a leading South Korean cathode paste producer  for an initial three-year term to deliver a minimum of 5 000 tons per annum of battery-grade lithium hydroxide to EcoPro‚Äôs cathode materials production plant in Debrecen  Hungary.AMG has negotiated a strategic tolling contract for our spodumene production as well as third-party spodumene to supply technical-grade hydroxide to Bitterfeld.AMG has consolidated its lithium value chain under one legal entity and is currently aligning its lithium management and governance structures to further increase the long-term value of its lithium activities. Accordingly  we are preparing a re-segmentation of AMG to be approved by the Supervisory Board in December and become effective on January 1  2023.VanadiumThe new vanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Zanesville  Ohio  which started operating on October 29  2022  is a clear manifestation of AMG‚Äôs industry leadership in the recycling of hazardous refinery waste globally. We are extremely pleased about the successful startup of both the roaster and the melt shop  and we expect the ramp-up to full production to take between three to four months.Shell & AMG Recycling B.V. (‚ÄúSARBV‚Äù) and its partner  the United Company for Industry (‚ÄúUCI‚Äù)  continue to advance the first project of the Supercenter in conjunction with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (‚ÄúAramco‚Äù). Plant design optimization  site selection and permitting activities are progressing and the FEL3 partnering with Hatch is expected to begin later this month. The SARBV-UCI-Aramco consortium are also developing a pipeline of projects which will conclude with the deployment of AMG‚Äôs LIVA Hybrid Energy Storage System technology.AMG‚Äôs innovative lithium vanadium battery (‚ÄúLIVA‚Äù) for industrial power management applications has successfully started up at our plant in Hauzenberg  Germany.Financial HighlightsRevenue increased by 36% to $425 million in the third quarter of 2022 from $312 million in the third quarter of 2021.EBITDA was a record $103 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 210% versus the third quarter 2021 EBITDA of $33 million.Annualized return on capital employed was 29.5% for the first nine months of 2022  more than double the 10.4% for the same period in 2021.Cash flow from operations was $75 million for the third quarter 2022  driven by the high profitability of AMG Lithium in Brazil.Net income attributable to shareholders for the third quarter of 2022 was $68 million  yielding $2.09 diluted earnings per share  compared to $0.02 diluted loss per share in the third quarter of 2021.AMG‚Äôs liquidity as of September 30  2022 was $489 million  with $306 million of unrestricted cash and $183 million of revolving credit availability.Key FiguresIn 000‚Äôs US dollars Q3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $424 813 $311 946 36% Gross profit 112 071 51 083 119% Gross margin 26.4% 16.4% Operating profit 121 680 17 346 601% Operating margin 28.6% 5.6% Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders 68 146 (599) N/A EPS - Fully diluted 2.09 (0.02) N/A EBIT (1) 91 536 22 475 307% EBITDA (2) 102 603 33 051 210% EBITDA margin 24.2% 10.6% Cash from operating activities 74 747 17 635 324%Notes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

Sales volumes were up due to shipping schedule variances from AMG Brazil. This increase in the third quarter of 2022 includes a catch up from the second quarter as well as additional volumes that shipped in the third quarter that were planned for the fourth quarter.Gross profit before non-recurring items for the quarter increased 304% compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to the increased price environment.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2022 were $12 million  15% higher than the third quarter of 2021  largely due to strategic project costs and higher variable compensation expense in the current quarter.The third quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 364%  to $84 million  from $18 million in the third quarter of 2021  due to the improved gross profit as noted above.AMG Critical MineralsQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $84 935 $79 392 7% Gross profit 674 10 660 (94%) Gross profit before non-recurring items 12 210 10 843 13% Operating profit 40 301 4 028 901% EBITDA 7 327 6 509 13%AMG Critical Minerals‚Äô revenue increased by $6 million  or 7%  to $85 million  driven by higher sales prices in all three businesses.Gross profit before non-recurring items of $12 million in the third quarter was 13% higher compared to the third quarter of 2021. The higher revenue was due to the improved price environment  partially offset by increased raw material prices as well as the ongoing rise in energy and shipping costs.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2022 slightly increased by 3%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2021.Despite ongoing inflationary pressures  the third quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 13% compared to the same period in 2021.Effective January 1  2023  AMG will place its silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  on care and maintenance due to external economic factors and will review this decision on a quarterly basis. The overall EBITDA effect  should there be a shutdown longer than one quarter  is immaterial to AMG‚Äôs overall projected 2023 results.Associated with this shutdown  AMG recorded income from the sale of an existing supply contract which positively impacted operating profit for the quarter. This income was offset by a settlement with a major customer and an impairment of existing assets. The future proceeds are also available to offset potential restructuring expenses in the future. The cost associated with retaining current employees for care and maintenance will be recorded as incurred in accordance with accounting standards.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $151 560 $127 246 19% Gross profit 24 943 20 303 23% Gross profit before non-recurring items 24 990 20 293 23% Operating profit 6 491 3 333 95% EBITDA 11 602 8 513 36%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' third quarter 2022 revenue increased by $24 million  or 19%  compared to the same period in 2021. This improvement was due to increased titanium alloys sales  as well as higher titanium alloy and chrome metal pricing. Third quarter 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items increased by $5 million  or 23%  to $25 million due to the higher volumes and prices.SG&A expenses increased by 9% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021  mainly driven by higher share-based and variable compensation expense and higher professional fees in the current quarter.AMG Critical Materials Technologies‚Äô EBITDA increased to $12 million during the quarter  compared to $9 million in the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to higher profitability in chrome metal and titanium alloys.AMG Engineering signed $93 million in new orders during the third quarter of 2022  driven by strong orders of remelting  induction and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.73x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $211 million as of September 30  2022  17% greater than the $181 million as of June 30  2022.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $39 million in the third quarter of 2022  compared to $10 million in the same period in 2021. This variance was mainly driven by enhanced operating results coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $2 million deferred tax benefit in the third quarter of 2022 (2021: $8 million tax expense). Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company‚Äôs net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $10 million in the third quarter of 2022  compared to tax payments of $4 million in the third quarter of 2021.Exceptional ItemsAMG‚Äôs third quarter 2022 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Change Gross profit $112 071 $51 083 119% Restructuring expense 11 261 (96%) Asset impairment expense (reversal) 11 587 (88) N/A Strategic project expense 1 241 1 095 13% Others ‚Äî 506 N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 124 910 52 857 136%Energy CostsTotal energy costs were $5 million higher in the third quarter of 2022 versus the same period in 2021 due to significant increases in gas and electricity costs during the quarter. The majority of this increase was at our silicon business in Germany  but that business benefited from fully hedged power costs. Other business units benefited from long-term electricity contracts that have no price escalation clauses  and the business units that did experience energy cost increases were able to pass through most of these increased costs to their customers.SG&AAMG‚Äôs third quarter 2022 SG&A expenses were $37 million compared to $34 million in the third quarter of 2021  with the variance largely driven by higher compensation expense due to higher profitability forecasted for the year and increased professional fees associated with strategic projects.Net Other Operating IncomeAMG recorded a net contract settlement benefit of $46 million associated with the cancellation of a supply contract for AMG Silicon  offset by a settlement with a major customer.LiquiditySeptember 30  2022 December 31  2021 Change Senior secured debt $357 685 $371 897 (4%) Cash & cash equivalents 306 416 337 877 (9%) Senior secured net debt 51 269 34 020 51% Other debt 14 926 24 398 (39%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 66 195 58 418 13% Municipal bond debt 319 304 319 476 ‚Äî % Restricted cash 17 069 93 434 (82%) Net debt 368 430 284 460 30%AMG had a net debt position of $368 million as of September 30  2022. This increase was mainly due to the significant investment in growth initiatives during the quarter.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the third quarter. As of September 30  2022  the Company had $306 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $183 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $489 million of total liquidity as of September 30  2022.Net Finance CostsAMG‚Äôs third quarter 2022 net finance costs were $14 million compared to $8 million in the third quarter of 2021. This increase was mainly driven by foreign exchange losses of $6 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances.AMG capitalized $2 million of interest costs in the third quarter of 2022 versus $4 million in the same period in 2021  driven by interest associated with the Company‚Äôs tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio. This decrease is due to a portion of the municipal bond interest costs which are no longer being capitalized due to the ramp-up of production at our Zanesville facility.Profit (loss) for the period to EBITDA reconciliationQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Profit (loss) for the period $68 339 ($310) Income tax expense 38 603 9 904 Net finance cost 13 988 7 543 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 386 1 015 Restructuring expense 11 261 Net contract settlements (46 407) ‚Äî Asset impairment expense (reversal) 11 587 (88) Strategic project expense (1) 3 282 3 311 Share of loss of associates 750 209 Others (3) 630 EBIT 91 536 22 475 Depreciation and amortization 11 067 10 576 EBITDA 102 603 33 051(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium‚Äôs expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

CCEP internal estimates based on Global Data 2023-2027Forward-Looking StatementsThis document contains statements  estimates or projections that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" concerning the financial condition  performance  results  strategy and objectives of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc and its subsidiaries (together CCEP or the Group). Generally  the words ""ambition""  ""target""  ""aim""  ""believe""  ""expect""  ""intend""  ""estimate""  ""anticipate""  ""project""  ""plan""  ""seek""  ""may""  ""could""  ""would""  ""should""  ""might""  ""will""  ""forecast""  ""outlook""  ""guidance""  ""possible""  ""potential""  ""predict""  ""objective"" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements  which generally are not historical in nature.Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from CCEP's historical experience and present expectations or projections  including with respect to the acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil Limited and its subsidiaries (together ""CCL"" or ""API"") completed on 10 May 2021 (the ""Acquisition""). As a result  undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements  which speak only as of the date on which they are made. These risks include but are not limited to:1. those set forth in the ""Risk Factors"" section of CCEP's 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on 15 March 2022 and as updated and supplemented with the additional information set forth in the ""Principal Risks and Risk Factors"" section of the H1 2022 Half-year Report filed with the SEC on 4 August 2022;2. risks and uncertainties relating to the Acquisition  including the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult  time consuming or costly than expected  which could result in additional demands on CCEP's resources  systems  procedures and controls  disruption of its ongoing business and diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;3. the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect CCEP and the results of its operations  financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted  including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic;4. risks and uncertainties relating to the global supply chain  including impact from war in Ukraine  such as the risk that the business will not be able to guarantee sufficient supply of raw materials  supplies  finished goods  natural gas and oil and increased state-sponsored cyber risks;5. risks and uncertainties relating to the global economy and/or a potential recession in one or more countries  including risks from elevated inflation  price increases  price elasticity  disposable income of consumers and employees  pressure on and from suppliers  increased fraud  and the perception or manifestation of a global economic downturn; and6. risks and uncertainties relating to potential global energy crisis  with potential interruptions and shortages in the global energy supply  specifically the natural gas supply in our territories. Energy shortages at our sites  our suppliers and customers could cause interruptions to our supply chain and capability to meet our production and distribution targets. The impacts  including potential increases in energy prices  are expected to be exacerbated during the approaching colder months of the year.Due to these risks  CCEP's actual future results  dividend payments  capital and leverage ratios  growth  including growth in revenue  cost of sales per unit case and operating profit  free cash flow  market share  tax rate  efficiency savings  achievement of sustainability goals  including net zero emissions  and the results of the integration of the businesses following the Acquisition  including expected efficiency and combination savings  may differ materially from the plans  goals  expectations and guidance set out in forward-looking statements (including those issued by CCL prior to the Acquisition). These risks may also adversely affect CCEP's share price. Additional risks that may impact CCEP's future financial condition and performance are identified in filings with the SEC which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. CCEP does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  except as required under applicable rules  laws and regulations. Furthermore  CCEP assumes no responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any forward-looking statements. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this filing and in any other of CCEP's or CCL's public statements (whether prior or subsequent to the Acquisition) may prove to be incorrect.Note Regarding the Presentation of Pro forma financial information and Alternative Performance MeasuresPro forma financial informationPro forma financial information has been provided in order to illustrate the effects of the acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (referred to as CCL pre acquisition  API post acquisition) on the results of operations of CCEP in 2021 and allow for greater comparability of the results of the combined group between periods. The pro forma financial information for 2021 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and because of its nature  addresses a hypothetical situation. It is based on information and assumptions that CCEP believes are reasonable. For further information  refer to our 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on 15 March 2022  which provides further details on our non-GAAP performance measures and reconciles  where applicable  our results as reported under IFRS to Pro forma financial information and non-GAAP performance measures.The Pro forma financial information presented in this document reflects the inclusion of API revenue as if the acquisition had occurred at 1 January 2021 and prepared on a basis consistent with CCEP accounting policies.The pro forma financial information does not intend to represent what CCEP's results of operations actually would have been if the acquisition had been completed on the dates indicated  nor does it intend to represent  predict or estimate the results of operations for any future period or financial position at any future date. In addition  it does not reflect ongoing cost savings that CCEP expects to achieve as a result of the acquisition or the costs necessary to achieve these cost savings or synergies. As pro forma information is prepared to illustrate retrospectively the effects of future transactions  there are limitations that are inherent to the nature of pro forma information. As such  had the acquisition taken place on the dates assumed  the actual effects would not necessarily have been the same as those presented in the Pro Forma financial information contained herein.Alternative Performance MeasuresWe use certain alternative performance measures (non-GAAP performance measures) to make financial  operating and planning decisions and to evaluate and report performance. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors and as such  where clearly identified  we have included certain alternative performance measures in this document to allow investors to better analyse our business performance and allow for greater comparability. To do so  we have excluded items affecting the comparability of period-over-period financial performance as described below. The alternative performance measures included herein should be read in conjunction with and do not replace the directly reconcilable GAAP measures.For purposes of this document  the following terms are defined:''As reported'' are results extracted from our consolidated financial statements.''Pro forma'' includes the results of CCEP and API as if the Acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2021. In this document  the Pro forma financial information adjustments reflect the inclusion of API revenue as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2021 and prepared on a basis consistent with CCEP accounting policies.""Comparable'' is defined as results excluding items impacting comparability  which include restructuring charges  acquisition and integration related costs  inventory fair value step up related to acquisition accounting  the impact of the closure of the GB defined benefit pension scheme  net impact related to European flooding and net tax items relating to rate and law changes. Comparable volume is also adjusted for selling days.''Pro forma Comparable'' is defined as the pro forma results excluding items impacting comparability  as described above.''Fx-neutral'' or ""FXN"" is defined as period results excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Foreign exchange impact is calculated by recasting current year results at prior year exchange rates.''Capex'' or ""Capital expenditures'' is defined as purchases of property  plant and equipment and capitalised software  plus payments of principal on lease obligations  less proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment. Capex is used as a measure to ensure that cash spending on capital investment is in line with the Group's overall strategy for the use of cash.''Free cash flow'' is defined as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures (as defined above) and interest paid. Free cash flow is used as a measure of the Group's cash generation from operating activities  taking into account investments in property  plant and equipment and non-discretionary lease and interest payments. Free cash flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.''Adjusted EBITDA'' is calculated as Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA)  after adding back items impacting the comparability of period over period financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. Further  adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  and although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortised are likely to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements.''Net Debt'' is defined as the net of cash and cash equivalents less borrowings and adjusted for the fair value of hedging instruments related to borrowings and other financial assets/liabilities related to borrowings. We believe that reporting net debt is useful as it reflects a metric used by the Group to assess cash management and leverage.

Invested capital is calculated as the addition of borrowings and equity attributable to shareholders less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. ROIC is used as a measure of capital efficiency and reflects how well the Group generates comparable operating profit relative to the capital invested in the business.''Dividend payout ratio'' is defined as dividends as a proportion of comparable profit after tax.Additionally  within this document  we provide certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial Information  which management uses for planning and measuring performance.

The 4-period  crossover and randomized study was conducted on 40 healthy subjects  with gender  ethnicity and BMI1 diversity (ref ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05026567).The primary objective was met. It was the evaluation of the relative bioavailability of midazolam after injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 0.625mL) compared to injection of DORMICUM¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 2mL) by a conventional syringe with a 30mm needle  into the thigh on bare skin. The bioequivalence was achieved both on Cmax2 and on AUC3  with no change of Tmax4. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [84-98] for Cmax ratio  and [100-108] for AUC ratio.No serious adverse events were reported  and there was no difference in safety profile between the tested conditions. Only 2 subjects dropped out before their fourth and last injection  not for safety but for personal reason.As secondary objectives  the study aimed to test the intramuscular injection of midazolam with ZENEO¬Æ into thigh through clothing  compared to injection into thigh on bare skin with ZENEO¬Æ and with DORMICUM¬Æ. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [87-101] and [79-92] for Cmax ratios  and [87-95] and [91-98] for AUC ratios  with no change in Tmax. These results allow considering a much faster emergency treatment  without having to remove patient‚Äôs clothing in an epileptic seizure situation.In addition  an intramuscular injection with ZENEO¬Æ midazolam in the ventrogluteal site was shown to be bioequivalent to an injection in the thigh on bare skin either with a conventional syringe or with ZENEO¬Æ.Finally  ZENEO¬Æ and the syringe with intramucular needle showed a similar and low inter-subject variability of midazolam pharmacokinetics. This is an additional demonstration that an injection with ZENEO reached the muscle in the same way as an injection with a syringe and a 30 mm needle.As a summary  the outcomes of this clinical study are a great achievement for Crossject  as they demonstrate the effectiveness of an intramuscular injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ into thigh with or without clothing  as well as into the ventrogluteal site.Contacts :CrossjectPatrick Alexandreinfo@crossject.com Relations investisseursAeliumJ√©r√¥me Gacoin +33 (0)1 75 77 54 67crossject@aelium.frRelations presseBuzz & CompagnieM√©lanie Voisard +33 (0)3 80 43 54 89melanie.voisard@buzzetcompagnie.comChristelle Distinguin +33 (0)6 09 96 51 70christelle.distinguin@buzzetcompagnie.comAbout CROSSJECT ‚Ä¢ www.crossject.comCROSSJECT (ISIN: FR0011716265; Ticker: ALCJ; LEI: 969500W1VTFNL2D85A65) is developing and is soon to market a portfolio of drugs dedicated to emergency situations: epilepsy  overdose  allergic shock  severe migraine and asthma attack.

It is the most important one with 600 jobs and its 153 200 sq.m are articulated around four logistic buildings of unitary sizes going from 33 000 to 43 000 sq.m. Renault Group will be the tenant from now on  with a 12 years lease. Located along the A19 highway  which links the A10  A77  A5 and A6 highway  Villeroy is ideally situated to reach the whole of France.That is why  in the short term  the Villeroy site is intended to become the central store for all the spare parts and accessories activity in France  and this  for all the Renault Group brands with a capacity of more than70 000 references which will be quickly increased to more than 90 000. In order to assist this increase  the Group has launched an automation project which will be operational in 2023.A real estate investment plan for the siteThe budget dedicated by ARGAN to this new acquisition includes a major investment plan that will enable the site to be kept up to date with the latest market standards  including the replacement of doors and dock levelers  the refurbishment of roads  the renovation of premises and the expansion of the parking lot.ARGAN has thus added an exceptional Premium site to its portfolio  both in terms of size and the quality of its tenant.Jean-Claude Le Lan  Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN  comments: ""This acquisition marks a major step in the development of ARGAN. Indeed  this site alone will represent 3.5% of the rents that will be collected by our real estate company in 2023. This transaction  initiated before the economic downturn of the last few months  was financed at relatively advantageous rates compared to today's practice. Three years after the acquisition of the CARGO portfolio  ARGAN confirms its ability to invest in large-scale projects and its position as a major player in logistics real estate in France.The transaction was led by CBRE. Renault Group was advised by the law firm Acte 2 and the law firm Franklin.

This approval was followed by the signing with Bpifrance of the contract on the state aid by the French government  up to 114 million euros for the Gigafactory within the framework of the PIIEC scheme1. The eligibility of the McPhy's project to this scheme was approved by the European Commission last July.Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Officer of McPhy  commented: ""We are very pleased with the decision of our Board of Directors  which is a positive conclusion to the various favorable notices we have recently received about our Gigafactory project. This Gigafactory will be a decisive tool in the development and design of large-scale electrolyzers  which are essential for the use of green hydrogen in ambitious decarbonization projects for industry and heavy mobility. We will soon have an industrial set-up capable of mass-producing a wide range of electrolyzers on a continental scale  that is unmatched by any other player in decarbonized electrolysis in Europe.""Antoine Ressicaud  Chief Operating Officer of McPhy  says: ‚ÄúThis is an inspiring project for the entire McPhy team  with 20 000 sqm dedicated to the manufacture and testing of multi-MW electrolyzers. Our desire is to implement the highest standards of industrial performance on this Belfort facility  through an ambitious social and environmental approach.‚ÄùThe commissioning of the future plant on the Belfort site is scheduled from the 1st half of 2024  with a gradual ramp-up aimed at reaching an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The McPhy Group will then have a total annual production capacity of 1.3 GW2  including the capacity of the San Miniato site in Italy  in line with the growth prospects of the green hydrogen markets  particularly in industry.A phased public aid with an initial payment from Bpifrance of 28.5 million euros by the end of 2022The contract signed with Bpifrance provides for the terms and conditions for the implementation of the public aid. McPhy will receive by December 31  2022 an initial payment of 28.5 million euros. Subsequent payments will take the form of reimbursements of expenses incurred  pursuant to the terms of the contract  following the satisfactory achievement of defined milestones  for a total amount  including the initial payment  of up to 114 million euros.A strategic tool for McPhy's technological and industrial ambitionsWith this Gigafactory  McPhy is pursuing 3 objectives:Innovation : through the development of new generation alkaline electrolyzers  in terms of size  components and integration within modules;: through the development of new generation alkaline electrolyzers  in terms of size  components and integration within modules; Industrialization : with large-scale production to meet the needs of the European market in particular  to contribute to the decarbonization of industry  mobility and energy;: with large-scale production to meet the needs of the European market in particular  to contribute to the decarbonization of industry  mobility and energy; Collaboration: with numerous partners of the Hydrogen ecosystem in Europe and the dissemination of knowledge with academic  industrial and research stakeholders.The future plant in Belfort will host new developments and production of the large electrolyzers in the ""Augmented McLyzer"" range  a real technological breakthrough  enabling 20  100 MW and beyond (GW) architectures to be equipped with an output pressure of 30 bar. This large-scale R&D and industrialization effort will provide the industry with equipment capable of producing hydrogen from renewable energies at a cost that is competitive compared to alternatives using carbon energy.The Gigafactory will further strengthen the McPhy's industrial set-up with  on one hand  the electrolyzers with the ongoing automation of the San Miniato site  dedicated to the production of electrolyzers of up to 1 MW capacity and  on the other hand  the stations  on the brand-new site in Grenoble.Concurrently  Belfort's location at the crossroads of many European countries  with a genuine research and development ecosystem dedicated to innovation and hydrogen  will foster the multiplication of potential industrial and commercial partnerships.Acceleration of development investments and expenses from the second half of 2022The beginning of the construction and the purchase of the land will result in a cash outflow related to the Gigafactory of 9 million euros by the end of the year. In addition  and as previously indicated  McPhy intends to make further investments in order to be able to meet the growing demand for large-scale equipment and facilities  by increasing its R&D resources and by strengthening its project and service teams. These efforts  which are being implemented now  will result in additional expenses in the second half of 2022 and are expected to lead the year-end cash position to a level comparable to the end of the first half  taking into account the Gigafactory-related Bpifrance initial payment and cash outflows.About McPhySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

While stronger market conditions have led to increased commercial activity  confirming the expected multi-year upcycle  near-term macro and geopolitical uncertainties resulted in increased volatility and clients‚Äô projects shift. This particularly affected our Sensing and Monitoring business  which will see significant growth in 2023. However  our Data  Digital and Energy transition business remains solid with growth in line with increased E&P Capex. We anticipate a strong Q4 led by Earth Data sales. We remain focused on capturing the upcycle ahead of us and increasing our topline  with the objective of deleveraging our balance sheet. This growth will be supported by our clear technology differentiation  strong focus on our clients‚Äô priorities  and the ongoing development of our Beyond the Core businesses.‚ÄùQ3 2022: A soft quarter as clients‚Äô projects shifted to Q4 and 2023IFRS figures: revenue at $255m  EBITDAs at $115m  OPINC at $28mSegment revenue at $ 2 17 m   down (20%) and down (16)% pro-forma* year-on-year.Geoscience at $69m  up 8% pro-forma* year-on-year mainly driven by Western hemisphere and high-end technology.

Earth Data at $62m  down (33)% year-on-year. Prefunding revenue at $19m was lower than expected due to the shift of some prefunding of North Sea projects from Q3 to Q4 and Brazil projects into 2023.
