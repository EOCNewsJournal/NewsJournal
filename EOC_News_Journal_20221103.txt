Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) up 7% organically; non-recurring revenues up 4%. Digital & services revenues (93% of total revenues) up 7% organically; print declined 4%. Expert solutions revenues (56% of total) up 9% organically.Nine-month adjusted operating profit up 6% in constant currencies. Nine-month adjusted operating profit margin up 50 basis points.Nine-month adjusted free cash flow down 1% in constant currencies.Net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.3x as of September 30  2022.Share buyback 2022: approx. 76% completed to date; on track to reach ‚Ç¨1 billion by year-end.Share buyback 2023: mandate signed to repurchase up to ‚Ç¨100 million in January and February 2023.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: ‚ÄúThrough the first nine months of the year  we have seen sustained strong organic growth in recurring revenues  led by our expert solutions. As expected  organic growth in transactional and other non-recurring revenues slowed in the face of challenging comparables and deteriorating economic conditions. We are investing at high levels in product innovation and in our talented workforce  and I am confident in reiterating our outlook for the full year.‚ÄùNine Months to September 30  20 2 2Total revenues increased 15%  driven to a large extent by the stronger U.S. dollar (‚Ç¨/$1.06 vs. ‚Ç¨/$1.20). In constant currencies  revenues increased 6%  with the impact of disposals (mainly the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021) exceeding the impact of acquisitions on revenues. Excluding currency  acquisitions and disposals  organic revenue growth was 6% (9M 2021: 6%).Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) sustained recent momentum  growing 7% organically in the first nine months (9M 2021: 5%). Non-recurring revenues  which include transactional revenues in Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC)  on-premise software licence and implementation fees  print books  and other ad hoc revenues  grew 4% organically (9M 2021: 9%). Digital and services revenues (93% of total revenues) grew 7% organically  led by expert solutions revenues up 9%. Total print revenues decreased 4% organically (9M 2021: 5% growth)  with print subscriptions down 7% (9M 2021: decline of 6%) and print books up 2% (9M 2021: 20% growth).Story continuesRevenues from North America (64% of total revenues) grew 6% organically (9M 2021: 7%) while revenues from Europe (28% of total) grew 5% (9M 2021: 6%). Revenues from Asia Pacific & Rest of World (8% of total) grew 15% organically (9M 2021: 2%)  sustaining the strong improvement seen in the first half.Nine-month adjusted operating profit increased 17% overall and 6% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased 50 basis points  largely driven by a favorable currency mix and an improvement in the Legal & Regulatory margin. Group-wide adjusted operating costs increased 14% overall and 6% in constant currencies year-on-year  reflecting progress on hiring and increased investment in product development and sales and marketing.Health: Nine-month revenues increased 5% in constant currencies and 5% on an organic basis (9M 2021: 9%). Clinical Solutions achieved 8% organic growth  supported by strong renewals and new customer wins for UpToDate and our drug information solutions. Patient engagement tool Emmi sustained high single-digit organic growth driven by improved retention  upselling  and new customer wins. Health Learning  Research & Practice recorded 2% organic growth against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 11%) mainly related to the ASCO publishing contract (which began in 2021). Print book organic revenue growth moderated to 13%  reflecting a decline in the third quarter. Medical research platform Ovid achieved good subscription renewals  while journal advertising revenues exhibited softness in the third quarter. On September 30  2022  we acquired IJS Publishing Group  a UK-based provider of peer-reviewed open access medical journals focused on surgery.Tax & Accounting: Nine-month revenues increased 9% in constant currencies and 9% organically (9M 2021: 6%). Corporate Performance  which comprises CCH Tagetik and our U.S. Corporate Tax unit  delivered 10% organic growth  driven by cloud software subscriptions and implementation services. The North American Professional Tax & Accounting business recorded 11% organic growth  partly reflecting favorable timing and non-recurring factors  but underpinned by continued strong performance by our cloud-based CCH Axcess platform. TeamMate  our internal audit solution  delivered robust single-digit organic growth  driven by its cloud solution. Professional Tax & Accounting Europe sustained 6% organic growth.Governance  Risk & Compliance: Nine-month revenues increased 6% in constant currencies  including the acquisitions of LicenseLogix in October 2021 and IDS in April 2022. On an organic basis  growth was 5% (9M 2021: 5%). Legal Services recorded significantly slower organic growth of 4% (9M 2021: 11%)  with recurring revenues up 6% but Legal Services transactional revenues broadly flat against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 22%). Financial Services revenues increased 6% on an organic basis (9M 2021: decline of 3%)  driven by recurring software maintenance and cloud subscription revenues in Compliance Solutions  including at eOriginal. Financial Services transactional revenues were flat (9M 2021: decline of 12%)  as sharply lower mortgage-related transaction volumes and the absence of U.S. PPP1 transactional revenues were offset by double-digit growth in transactional revenues in Lien Solutions. Finance  Risk & Reporting recorded 4% organic growth  as growth in professional services around customer implementations was partly offset by the impact of discontinuing business in Russia and Belarus.Legal & Regulatory: Nine-month revenues increased 1% in constant currencies  mainly reflecting the disposal of the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021. Organic growth was 5% (9M 2021: 4%)  lifted by sustained strong organic growth in software. EHS/ORM2 and Legal Software grew 21% (9M 2021: 6%)  driven by strong growth in cloud revenues across the board and higher non-recurring on-premise license and implementation fees for the Enablon EHS/ORM software. Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions revenues grew 2% organically (9M 2021: 3%)  with digital solutions sustaining 7% organic growth  but print products returning to historic rates of decline. The sale of our legal publishing assets in Spain and France  agreed in December 2021 and expected to complete in 2022  remains subject to the Spanish antitrust process.Corporate costs increased 10% in constant currencies in the first nine months  due to higher personnel costs and increased spending on market research and various projects.Cash Flow and Net DebtNine-month adjusted operating cash flow was flat in constant currencies due to lower cash conversion (103%) compared to a year ago (108%)  mainly as a result of higher capital expenditure and lower working capital inflows. Adjusted free cash flow decreased 1% in constant currencies  with higher cash taxes broadly offset by lower net cash outflows related to restructuring.Total cash dividends paid to shareholders amounted to ‚Ç¨401 million in the first nine months. Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was ‚Ç¨69 million in the first nine months  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS in April 2022. Divestiture proceeds  net of cash disposed and transaction costs  were negligible. In the first nine months  ‚Ç¨618 million in cash flow was deployed towards the 2022 share repurchase program.As of September 30  2022  net debt stood at ‚Ç¨2 243 million (compared to ‚Ç¨2 131 million at year-end 2021). Twelve months‚Äô rolling net-debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x compared to 1.4x at year-end 2021. In September  we issued a new ‚Ç¨500 million Eurobond with a 4-year term and 3.0% annual coupon.ESG DevelopmentsIn the year to date  we have made progress on several ESG objectives. In September  we launched our annual all-employee compliance training  covering IT and cybersecurity  data privacy  and business ethics. As of the end of October  99% of employees globally have completed the training program. Our annual engagement survey was kicked off in October. To support employee engagement and diversity  equity  inclusion  and belonging3  we have launched a 12-month inclusive leadership program for executives and people managers and we have started piloting a series of voluntary  employee-led global inclusion networks. On the environmental front  we continued to execute on two key programs that reduce our emissions: as of September 30  2022  our real estate rationalization program has achieved a 3% reduction in our global office footprint (m2) compared to December 31  2021  while our cloud migration program has decommissioned approximately 750 on-premise servers. We have also made progress on the data collection required to measure certain categories of Scope 3 emissions in line with our stated objectives of aligning to the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and of ultimately setting science-based targets.Share Buyback Program sEarly in the year  we announced a 2022 share buyback program of ‚Ç¨600 million  which was later expanded to ‚Ç¨1 billion on August 3  2022. In the year to date  through October 31  2022  we have repurchased ‚Ç¨756 million in shares (7.7 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨97.60). A third party mandate is in place to complete the final tranche of ‚Ç¨244 million in share buybacks in the period starting November 3  2022  up to and including December 28  2022.Looking ahead to 2023  we have this week signed a third-party mandate to execute up to ‚Ç¨100 million in share buybacks for the period starting January 2  2023  up to and including February 20  2023.Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we continue to believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time. Third party mandates are governed by the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans. We remain committed to our anti-dilution policy which aims to offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases.Share Cancellation 2022On August 31  2022  we cancelled 5.0 million shares that were held in treasury  as approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 2022. Following this cancellation  the number of issued ordinary shares is 257 516 153. As of September 30  2022  252.3 million shares were outstanding and 5.2 million shares were held in treasury.Full-Year 202 2 OutlookWe reiterate our full-year guidance as provided on August 3  2022. See table below. Following clarification of new U.S. tax rules on the capitalization of research and development expenses  we now expect adjusted free cash flow in constant currencies to be near the top of our guided range. We continue to expect organic momentum to slow moderately in the fourth quarter  largely due to challenging comparables.Full-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance 2021 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.0%-26.5% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow ‚Ç¨1 025-‚Ç¨1 075 million ‚Ç¨1 010 million ROIC* 14%-15% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS growth Mid- to high-single-digit growth ‚Ç¨3.38 *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of ‚Ç¨/$1.05. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (‚Ç¨/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average ‚Ç¨/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS4.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We continue to expect that restructuring costs will be within our normal range of ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨6 million). We continue to expect adjusted net financing costs5 in constant currencies to be approximately ‚Ç¨55 million  reflecting higher interest income. In addition  assuming current exchange rates persist  we would expect to incur a (non-cash) foreign exchange loss (in net financing result) of around ‚Ç¨30 million on intercompany balances and hedging at year-end.We now expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be at the lower end of our guided range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%) due to an anticipated one-time release of a provision in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditure is expected to increase year-on-year but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We continue to expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels (mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal) and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Tax & Accounting: we continue to expect organic growth to accelerate from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to an expected decline in transactional revenues in the second half. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we continue to expect organic growth to improve on 2021 levels. We expect the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to decline modestly due mainly to the absence of a one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

Transgene anticipates the last patient to be randomized in the trial in H1 2024.Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO  and Dr. Maud Brandely  Chief Medical Officer  MD  PhD  will host an analyst and investor call to discuss the interim analysis at 6:00 pm CET (1:00 pm EST) today (see details below).The Phase II study is evaluating TG4001  an investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine  in combination with avelumab compared to avelumab alone in patients with HPV16-positive anogenital tumors without liver metastases  through a continuing collaboration with the alliance of Merck KGaA  Darmstadt  Germany  and Pfizer  which is supplying avelumab.‚ÄúWe are very pleased with the outcome of this interim analysis ‚Äù said Hedi Ben Brahim  Chief Executive Officer of Transgene. ‚ÄúThe IDMC‚Äôs recommendation to continue the study reinforces our confidence in TG4001  which follows promising data from our earlier Phase Ib/II trial. This also enables us to reduce the number of patients randomized in the trial. We are looking forward to completing this trial in H1 2024 and communicating its results when they are available. We expect that positive final results from this trial will allow us to launch a registration trial to further confirm the benefit of our therapeutic vaccine candidate. TG4001 aims to provide a new solution to patients who currently have very limited treatment options.‚ÄùThe interim analysis was triggered per protocol  by a predefined number of PFS events. Based on the interim results  the IDMC‚Äôs objective was to provide a recommendation on the continuation of the trial and on the final sample size using adaptive sample size re-estimation modeling approach.To date  the treatment has been well tolerated. Adverse events are consistent with previous observations made in the Phase Ib/II trial.TG4001 is based on a MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara) vector  which is engineered to express HPV16 antigens (E6 & E7) and interleukin 2 (IL-2). TG4001 is designed to alert the immune system specifically to cells presenting the HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens that can be found in HPV16-related tumors and to induce a specific cellular immune response against these cancer cells.Phase II trial aims to show superiority of TG4001 + avelumab over avelumab monotherapyThe trial is enrolling patients in the USA and in Europe (France and Spain). It focuses on patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV16-positive anogenital cancer without liver metastases  including cervical  vulvar  vaginal  penile  and anal cancer. Patients are randomized to either receive the combination regimen of the therapeutic vaccine TG4001 and avelumab or avelumab alone.The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR)  disease control rate (DCR)  overall survival (OS) and a series of immunological parameters.A conference call in English is scheduled today  on November 2  2022  at 6 p.m. CET / 1 p.m. EST.Webcast link to English language conference call:https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/transgene/20221102_1/Participant telephone numbers:France: +33 (0) 1 70 37 71 66 United Kingdom: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200 United States: +1 212 999 6659 Confirmation code: TransgeneA replay will be available on the Transgene website (www.transgene.fr) following the live event.About the trialThe multi-center  open label  randomized Phase II trial (NCT03260023) is designed to compare the efficacy of the combination of TG4001 and avelumab versus avelumab alone in patients with advanced  recurrent and/or metastatic HPV16-positive anogenital cancers who have disease progression after a maximum of one line of systemic treatment  or who are not eligible for first-line chemotherapy.Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  M.D.  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i) at the Curie Institute  is the Principal Investigator of the study. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with Merck KGaA  Darmstadt  Germany  and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE)  which are providing avelumab for the trial. Avelumab is co-developed and co-commercialized by Merck KGaA  Darmstadt  Germany and Pfizer Inc. Transgene will continue to be the sponsor of the trial and conduct the trial. Avelumab is not approved alone or in combination for the treatment of HPV16-positive anogenital tumors in any region.Patients will receive TG4001 at the dose of 5x107 pfu  SC  weekly for 6 weeks  every 2 weeks up to six months  and every 12 weeks thereafter  in combination with avelumab or avelumab alone at 800 mg  IV every two weeks  until disease progression. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR)  disease control rate (DCR)  overall survival (OS) and other immunological parameters. The trial will enroll 120 patients.About the Phase Ib/II data of TG4001 + avelumab (single arm trial)The combination of TG4001 and avelumab demonstrated anti-tumor activity (22% ORR) in patients with previously treated recurrent and/or metastatic HPV-related cancers (including patients with oropharyngeal cancers and anogenital cancers). Presence of liver metastases had a profound impact on the outcome in terms of ORR and PFS. In patients without liver metastases  an ORR of 32%  a median PFS of 5.6 months and a median OS of 13.3 months were achieved. The treatment induced HPV-specific T-cell responses and was associated with increased levels of immune cell infiltration in the tumors and expression of genes associated with activation of the immune system. The results from the Phase Ib/II parts of the trial combining TG4001 with avelumab in HPV16-positive recurrent and/or metastatic malignancies have been updated in a R&D day held in September 2022 by Transgene. A first set of data had been presented at SITC 2020 and ESMO IO 2020 [1 2].About TG4001TG4001 is an investigational therapeutic vaccine based on a non-propagative  highly attenuated Vaccinia vector (MVA)  which is engineered to express HPV16 antigens (E6 & E7) and an adjuvant (IL-2). TG4001 is designed to have a two-pronged antiviral approach: to alert the immune system specifically to cells presenting the HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens  that can be found in HPV16-related tumors  and to further stimulate the infection-clearing activity of the immune system through interleukin 2 (IL-2). TG4001 has been administered to more than 350 individuals  demonstrating good safety and promising efficacy results [1  2 ]. Its mechanism of action and good safety profile make TG4001 an excellent candidate for combinations with other therapies in HPV-mediated solid tumors.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

The 4-period  crossover and randomized study was conducted on 40 healthy subjects  with gender  ethnicity and BMI1 diversity (ref ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05026567).The primary objective was met. It was the evaluation of the relative bioavailability of midazolam after injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 0.625mL) compared to injection of DORMICUM¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 2mL) by a conventional syringe with a 30mm needle  into the thigh on bare skin. The bioequivalence was achieved both on Cmax2 and on AUC3  with no change of Tmax4. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [84-98] for Cmax ratio  and [100-108] for AUC ratio.No serious adverse events were reported  and there was no difference in safety profile between the tested conditions. Only 2 subjects dropped out before their fourth and last injection  not for safety but for personal reason.As secondary objectives  the study aimed to test the intramuscular injection of midazolam with ZENEO¬Æ into thigh through clothing  compared to injection into thigh on bare skin with ZENEO¬Æ and with DORMICUM¬Æ. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [87-101] and [79-92] for Cmax ratios  and [87-95] and [91-98] for AUC ratios  with no change in Tmax. These results allow considering a much faster emergency treatment  without having to remove patient‚Äôs clothing in an epileptic seizure situation.In addition  an intramuscular injection with ZENEO¬Æ midazolam in the ventrogluteal site was shown to be bioequivalent to an injection in the thigh on bare skin either with a conventional syringe or with ZENEO¬Æ.Story continuesFinally  ZENEO¬Æ and the syringe with intramucular needle showed a similar and low inter-subject variability of midazolam pharmacokinetics. This is an additional demonstration that an injection with ZENEO reached the muscle in the same way as an injection with a syringe and a 30 mm needle.As a summary  the outcomes of this clinical study are a great achievement for Crossject  as they demonstrate the effectiveness of an intramuscular injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ into thigh with or without clothing  as well as into the ventrogluteal site.Contacts :CrossjectPatrick Alexandreinfo@crossject.com Relations investisseursAeliumJ√©r√¥me Gacoin +33 (0)1 75 77 54 67crossject@aelium.frRelations presseBuzz & CompagnieM√©lanie Voisard +33 (0)3 80 43 54 89melanie.voisard@buzzetcompagnie.comChristelle Distinguin +33 (0)6 09 96 51 70christelle.distinguin@buzzetcompagnie.comAbout CROSSJECT ‚Ä¢ www.crossject.comCROSSJECT (ISIN: FR0011716265; Ticker: ALCJ; LEI: 969500W1VTFNL2D85A65) is developing and is soon to market a portfolio of drugs dedicated to emergency situations: epilepsy  overdose  allergic shock  severe migraine and asthma attack.

Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) up 7% organically; non-recurring revenues up 4%. Digital & services revenues (93% of total revenues) up 7% organically; print declined 4%. Expert solutions revenues (56% of total) up 9% organically.Nine-month adjusted operating profit up 6% in constant currencies. Nine-month adjusted operating profit margin up 50 basis points.Nine-month adjusted free cash flow down 1% in constant currencies.Net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.3x as of September 30  2022.Share buyback 2022: approx. 76% completed to date; on track to reach ‚Ç¨1 billion by year-end.Share buyback 2023: mandate signed to repurchase up to ‚Ç¨100 million in January and February 2023.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: ‚ÄúThrough the first nine months of the year  we have seen sustained strong organic growth in recurring revenues  led by our expert solutions. As expected  organic growth in transactional and other non-recurring revenues slowed in the face of challenging comparables and deteriorating economic conditions. We are investing at high levels in product innovation and in our talented workforce  and I am confident in reiterating our outlook for the full year.‚ÄùNine Months to September 30  20 2 2Total revenues increased 15%  driven to a large extent by the stronger U.S. dollar (‚Ç¨/$1.06 vs. ‚Ç¨/$1.20). In constant currencies  revenues increased 6%  with the impact of disposals (mainly the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021) exceeding the impact of acquisitions on revenues. Excluding currency  acquisitions and disposals  organic revenue growth was 6% (9M 2021: 6%).Recurring revenues (81% of total revenues) sustained recent momentum  growing 7% organically in the first nine months (9M 2021: 5%). Non-recurring revenues  which include transactional revenues in Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC)  on-premise software licence and implementation fees  print books  and other ad hoc revenues  grew 4% organically (9M 2021: 9%). Digital and services revenues (93% of total revenues) grew 7% organically  led by expert solutions revenues up 9%. Total print revenues decreased 4% organically (9M 2021: 5% growth)  with print subscriptions down 7% (9M 2021: decline of 6%) and print books up 2% (9M 2021: 20% growth).Revenues from North America (64% of total revenues) grew 6% organically (9M 2021: 7%) while revenues from Europe (28% of total) grew 5% (9M 2021: 6%). Revenues from Asia Pacific & Rest of World (8% of total) grew 15% organically (9M 2021: 2%)  sustaining the strong improvement seen in the first half.Nine-month adjusted operating profit increased 17% overall and 6% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased 50 basis points  largely driven by a favorable currency mix and an improvement in the Legal & Regulatory margin. Group-wide adjusted operating costs increased 14% overall and 6% in constant currencies year-on-year  reflecting progress on hiring and increased investment in product development and sales and marketing.Health: Nine-month revenues increased 5% in constant currencies and 5% on an organic basis (9M 2021: 9%). Clinical Solutions achieved 8% organic growth  supported by strong renewals and new customer wins for UpToDate and our drug information solutions. Patient engagement tool Emmi sustained high single-digit organic growth driven by improved retention  upselling  and new customer wins. Health Learning  Research & Practice recorded 2% organic growth against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 11%) mainly related to the ASCO publishing contract (which began in 2021). Print book organic revenue growth moderated to 13%  reflecting a decline in the third quarter. Medical research platform Ovid achieved good subscription renewals  while journal advertising revenues exhibited softness in the third quarter. On September 30  2022  we acquired IJS Publishing Group  a UK-based provider of peer-reviewed open access medical journals focused on surgery.Tax & Accounting: Nine-month revenues increased 9% in constant currencies and 9% organically (9M 2021: 6%). Corporate Performance  which comprises CCH Tagetik and our U.S. Corporate Tax unit  delivered 10% organic growth  driven by cloud software subscriptions and implementation services. The North American Professional Tax & Accounting business recorded 11% organic growth  partly reflecting favorable timing and non-recurring factors  but underpinned by continued strong performance by our cloud-based CCH Axcess platform. TeamMate  our internal audit solution  delivered robust single-digit organic growth  driven by its cloud solution. Professional Tax & Accounting Europe sustained 6% organic growth.Governance  Risk & Compliance: Nine-month revenues increased 6% in constant currencies  including the acquisitions of LicenseLogix in October 2021 and IDS in April 2022. On an organic basis  growth was 5% (9M 2021: 5%). Legal Services recorded significantly slower organic growth of 4% (9M 2021: 11%)  with recurring revenues up 6% but Legal Services transactional revenues broadly flat against a challenging comparable (9M 2021: 22%). Financial Services revenues increased 6% on an organic basis (9M 2021: decline of 3%)  driven by recurring software maintenance and cloud subscription revenues in Compliance Solutions  including at eOriginal. Financial Services transactional revenues were flat (9M 2021: decline of 12%)  as sharply lower mortgage-related transaction volumes and the absence of U.S. PPP1 transactional revenues were offset by double-digit growth in transactional revenues in Lien Solutions. Finance  Risk & Reporting recorded 4% organic growth  as growth in professional services around customer implementations was partly offset by the impact of discontinuing business in Russia and Belarus.Legal & Regulatory: Nine-month revenues increased 1% in constant currencies  mainly reflecting the disposal of the U.S. Legal Education business in December 2021. Organic growth was 5% (9M 2021: 4%)  lifted by sustained strong organic growth in software. EHS/ORM2 and Legal Software grew 21% (9M 2021: 6%)  driven by strong growth in cloud revenues across the board and higher non-recurring on-premise license and implementation fees for the Enablon EHS/ORM software. Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions revenues grew 2% organically (9M 2021: 3%)  with digital solutions sustaining 7% organic growth  but print products returning to historic rates of decline. The sale of our legal publishing assets in Spain and France  agreed in December 2021 and expected to complete in 2022  remains subject to the Spanish antitrust process.Corporate costs increased 10% in constant currencies in the first nine months  due to higher personnel costs and increased spending on market research and various projects.Cash Flow and Net DebtNine-month adjusted operating cash flow was flat in constant currencies due to lower cash conversion (103%) compared to a year ago (108%)  mainly as a result of higher capital expenditure and lower working capital inflows. Adjusted free cash flow decreased 1% in constant currencies  with higher cash taxes broadly offset by lower net cash outflows related to restructuring.Total cash dividends paid to shareholders amounted to ‚Ç¨401 million in the first nine months. Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was ‚Ç¨69 million in the first nine months  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS in April 2022. Divestiture proceeds  net of cash disposed and transaction costs  were negligible. In the first nine months  ‚Ç¨618 million in cash flow was deployed towards the 2022 share repurchase program.As of September 30  2022  net debt stood at ‚Ç¨2 243 million (compared to ‚Ç¨2 131 million at year-end 2021). Twelve months‚Äô rolling net-debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x compared to 1.4x at year-end 2021. In September  we issued a new ‚Ç¨500 million Eurobond with a 4-year term and 3.0% annual coupon.ESG DevelopmentsIn the year to date  we have made progress on several ESG objectives. In September  we launched our annual all-employee compliance training  covering IT and cybersecurity  data privacy  and business ethics. As of the end of October  99% of employees globally have completed the training program. Our annual engagement survey was kicked off in October. To support employee engagement and diversity  equity  inclusion  and belonging3  we have launched a 12-month inclusive leadership program for executives and people managers and we have started piloting a series of voluntary  employee-led global inclusion networks. On the environmental front  we continued to execute on two key programs that reduce our emissions: as of September 30  2022  our real estate rationalization program has achieved a 3% reduction in our global office footprint (m2) compared to December 31  2021  while our cloud migration program has decommissioned approximately 750 on-premise servers. We have also made progress on the data collection required to measure certain categories of Scope 3 emissions in line with our stated objectives of aligning to the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and of ultimately setting science-based targets.Share Buyback Program sEarly in the year  we announced a 2022 share buyback program of ‚Ç¨600 million  which was later expanded to ‚Ç¨1 billion on August 3  2022. In the year to date  through October 31  2022  we have repurchased ‚Ç¨756 million in shares (7.7 million shares at an average price of ‚Ç¨97.60). A third party mandate is in place to complete the final tranche of ‚Ç¨244 million in share buybacks in the period starting November 3  2022  up to and including December 28  2022.Looking ahead to 2023  we have this week signed a third-party mandate to execute up to ‚Ç¨100 million in share buybacks for the period starting January 2  2023  up to and including February 20  2023.Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we continue to believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time. Third party mandates are governed by the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs Articles of Association. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans. We remain committed to our anti-dilution policy which aims to offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases.Share Cancellation 2022On August 31  2022  we cancelled 5.0 million shares that were held in treasury  as approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 2022. Following this cancellation  the number of issued ordinary shares is 257 516 153. As of September 30  2022  252.3 million shares were outstanding and 5.2 million shares were held in treasury.Full-Year 202 2 OutlookWe reiterate our full-year guidance as provided on August 3  2022. See table below. Following clarification of new U.S. tax rules on the capitalization of research and development expenses  we now expect adjusted free cash flow in constant currencies to be near the top of our guided range. We continue to expect organic momentum to slow moderately in the fourth quarter  largely due to challenging comparables.Full-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance 2021 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.0%-26.5% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow ‚Ç¨1 025-‚Ç¨1 075 million ‚Ç¨1 010 million ROIC* 14%-15% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS growth Mid- to high-single-digit growth ‚Ç¨3.38 *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of ‚Ç¨/$1.05. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (‚Ç¨/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases of ‚Ç¨1 billion in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average ‚Ç¨/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS4.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We continue to expect that restructuring costs will be within our normal range of ‚Ç¨10-‚Ç¨15 million (FY 2021: ‚Ç¨6 million). We continue to expect adjusted net financing costs5 in constant currencies to be approximately ‚Ç¨55 million  reflecting higher interest income. In addition  assuming current exchange rates persist  we would expect to incur a (non-cash) foreign exchange loss (in net financing result) of around ‚Ç¨30 million on intercompany balances and hedging at year-end.We now expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be at the lower end of our guided range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%) due to an anticipated one-time release of a provision in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditure is expected to increase year-on-year but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We continue to expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels (mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal) and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Tax & Accounting: we continue to expect organic growth to accelerate from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to an expected decline in transactional revenues in the second half. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we continue to expect organic growth to improve on 2021 levels. We expect the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to decline modestly due mainly to the absence of a one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

Our desire is to implement the highest standards of industrial performance on this Belfort facility  through an ambitious social and environmental approach.‚ÄùStory continuesThe commissioning of the future plant on the Belfort site is scheduled from the 1st half of 2024  with a gradual ramp-up aimed at reaching an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The McPhy Group will then have a total annual production capacity of 1.3 GW2  including the capacity of the San Miniato site in Italy  in line with the growth prospects of the green hydrogen markets  particularly in industry.A phased public aid with an initial payment from Bpifrance of 28.5 million euros by the end of 2022The contract signed with Bpifrance provides for the terms and conditions for the implementation of the public aid. McPhy will receive by December 31  2022 an initial payment of 28.5 million euros. Subsequent payments will take the form of reimbursements of expenses incurred  pursuant to the terms of the contract  following the satisfactory achievement of defined milestones  for a total amount  including the initial payment  of up to 114 million euros.A strategic tool for McPhy's technological and industrial ambitionsWith this Gigafactory  McPhy is pursuing 3 objectives:Innovation : through the development of new generation alkaline electrolyzers  in terms of size  components and integration within modules;Industrialization : with large-scale production to meet the needs of the European market in particular  to contribute to the decarbonization of industry  mobility and energy;Collaboration: with numerous partners of the Hydrogen ecosystem in Europe and the dissemination of knowledge with academic  industrial and research stakeholders.The future plant in Belfort will host new developments and production of the large electrolyzers in the ""Augmented McLyzer"" range  a real technological breakthrough  enabling 20  100 MW and beyond (GW) architectures to be equipped with an output pressure of 30 bar. This large-scale R&D and industrialization effort will provide the industry with equipment capable of producing hydrogen from renewable energies at a cost that is competitive compared to alternatives using carbon energy.The Gigafactory will further strengthen the McPhy's industrial set-up with  on one hand  the electrolyzers with the ongoing automation of the San Miniato site  dedicated to the production of electrolyzers of up to 1 MW capacity and  on the other hand  the stations  on the brand-new site in Grenoble.Concurrently  Belfort's location at the crossroads of many European countries  with a genuine research and development ecosystem dedicated to innovation and hydrogen  will foster the multiplication of potential industrial and commercial partnerships.Acceleration of development investments and expenses from the second half of 2022The beginning of the construction and the purchase of the land will result in a cash outflow related to the Gigafactory of 9 million euros by the end of the year. In addition  and as previously indicated  McPhy intends to make further investments in order to be able to meet the growing demand for large-scale equipment and facilities  by increasing its R&D resources and by strengthening its project and service teams. These efforts  which are being implemented now  will result in additional expenses in the second half of 2022 and are expected to lead the year-end cash position to a level comparable to the end of the first half  taking into account the Gigafactory-related Bpifrance initial payment and cash outflows.About McPhySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

(‚ÄúAMG‚Äù  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ‚ÄúAMG‚Äù)  a global critical materials company at the forefront of CO 2 reduction trends  reported third quarter 2022 revenue of $425 million  a 36% increase versus the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 EBITDA of $103 million was the highest in AMG‚Äôs history  and a 210% increase versus the third quarter of 2021.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  ‚ÄúThis outstanding result was largely driven by AMG Lithium. The continued strength in both lithium demand and our low-cost position led to improved profitability in AMG Lithium in Brazil. The mission of AMG Lithium is to be the number one producer of electric vehicle battery materials in Europe by expanding production of battery-grade hydroxide  vertically integrating its Brazilian spodumene production and pursuing additional mineral resources.‚ÄùOutlookGiven the strong performance to date and the visibility into year end  AMG is increasing its EBITDA guidance for the full year 2022 to $320 million or higher  from a previous range of between $280 million and $300 million.Important parameters for 2023 guidance are first and foremost the startup of the expanded production of lithium concentrate in Brazil in the second half of 2023; the market conditions primarily in lithium; and the ramp-up of the Zanesville refinery to full production. In view of this  AMG‚Äôs EBITDA guidance for 2023 is to exceed $400 million. It is important to note that since the increase of spodumene production will occur in the latter half of the year  2023 EBITDA development will be back-end weighted.Strategic HighlightsLithiumThe project to expand the spodumene production in AMG Brazil is under construction. The objective is to be at full capacity in the second half of 2023.The AMG Lithium refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe‚Äôs first lithium hydroxide refinery  is under construction  and commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module of the battery-grade lithium hydroxide upgrader will commence in the fourth quarter of 2023.AMG Lithium‚Äôs battery-grade hydroxide refinery has signed a binding supply agreement with EcoPro  a leading South Korean cathode paste producer  for an initial three-year term to deliver a minimum of 5 000 tons per annum of battery-grade lithium hydroxide to EcoPro‚Äôs cathode materials production plant in Debrecen  Hungary.AMG has negotiated a strategic tolling contract for our spodumene production as well as third-party spodumene to supply technical-grade hydroxide to Bitterfeld.AMG has consolidated its lithium value chain under one legal entity and is currently aligning its lithium management and governance structures to further increase the long-term value of its lithium activities. Accordingly  we are preparing a re-segmentation of AMG to be approved by the Supervisory Board in December and become effective on January 1  2023.VanadiumThe new vanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Zanesville  Ohio  which started operating on October 29  2022  is a clear manifestation of AMG‚Äôs industry leadership in the recycling of hazardous refinery waste globally. We are extremely pleased about the successful startup of both the roaster and the melt shop  and we expect the ramp-up to full production to take between three to four months.Shell & AMG Recycling B.V. (‚ÄúSARBV‚Äù) and its partner  the United Company for Industry (‚ÄúUCI‚Äù)  continue to advance the first project of the Supercenter in conjunction with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (‚ÄúAramco‚Äù).

This increase in the third quarter of 2022 includes a catch up from the second quarter as well as additional volumes that shipped in the third quarter that were planned for the fourth quarter.Gross profit before non-recurring items for the quarter increased 304% compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to the increased price environment.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2022 were $12 million  15% higher than the third quarter of 2021  largely due to strategic project costs and higher variable compensation expense in the current quarter.The third quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 364%  to $84 million  from $18 million in the third quarter of 2021  due to the improved gross profit as noted above.AMG Critical MineralsQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $84 935 $79 392 7% Gross profit 674 10 660 (94%) Gross profit before non-recurring items 12 210 10 843 13% Operating profit 40 301 4 028 901% EBITDA 7 327 6 509 13%AMG Critical Minerals‚Äô revenue increased by $6 million  or 7%  to $85 million  driven by higher sales prices in all three businesses.Gross profit before non-recurring items of $12 million in the third quarter was 13% higher compared to the third quarter of 2021. The higher revenue was due to the improved price environment  partially offset by increased raw material prices as well as the ongoing rise in energy and shipping costs.SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2022 slightly increased by 3%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2021.Despite ongoing inflationary pressures  the third quarter 2022 EBITDA increased 13% compared to the same period in 2021.Effective January 1  2023  AMG will place its silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  on care and maintenance due to external economic factors and will review this decision on a quarterly basis. The overall EBITDA effect  should there be a shutdown longer than one quarter  is immaterial to AMG‚Äôs overall projected 2023 results.Associated with this shutdown  AMG recorded income from the sale of an existing supply contract which positively impacted operating profit for the quarter. This income was offset by a settlement with a major customer and an impairment of existing assets. The future proceeds are also available to offset potential restructuring expenses in the future. The cost associated with retaining current employees for care and maintenance will be recorded as incurred in accordance with accounting standards.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Change Revenue $151 560 $127 246 19% Gross profit 24 943 20 303 23% Gross profit before non-recurring items 24 990 20 293 23% Operating profit 6 491 3 333 95% EBITDA 11 602 8 513 36%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' third quarter 2022 revenue increased by $24 million  or 19%  compared to the same period in 2021. This improvement was due to increased titanium alloys sales  as well as higher titanium alloy and chrome metal pricing. Third quarter 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items increased by $5 million  or 23%  to $25 million due to the higher volumes and prices.SG&A expenses increased by 9% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021  mainly driven by higher share-based and variable compensation expense and higher professional fees in the current quarter.AMG Critical Materials Technologies‚Äô EBITDA increased to $12 million during the quarter  compared to $9 million in the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to higher profitability in chrome metal and titanium alloys.AMG Engineering signed $93 million in new orders during the third quarter of 2022  driven by strong orders of remelting  induction and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.73x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $211 million as of September 30  2022  17% greater than the $181 million as of June 30  2022.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $39 million in the third quarter of 2022  compared to $10 million in the same period in 2021. This variance was mainly driven by enhanced operating results coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $2 million deferred tax benefit in the third quarter of 2022 (2021: $8 million tax expense). Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company‚Äôs net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $10 million in the third quarter of 2022  compared to tax payments of $4 million in the third quarter of 2021.Exceptional ItemsAMG‚Äôs third quarter 2022 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Change Gross profit $112 071 $51 083 119% Restructuring expense 11 261 (96%) Asset impairment expense (reversal) 11 587 (88) N/A Strategic project expense 1 241 1 095 13% Others ‚Äî 506 N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 124 910 52 857 136%Energy CostsTotal energy costs were $5 million higher in the third quarter of 2022 versus the same period in 2021 due to significant increases in gas and electricity costs during the quarter. The majority of this increase was at our silicon business in Germany  but that business benefited from fully hedged power costs. Other business units benefited from long-term electricity contracts that have no price escalation clauses  and the business units that did experience energy cost increases were able to pass through most of these increased costs to their customers.SG&AAMG‚Äôs third quarter 2022 SG&A expenses were $37 million compared to $34 million in the third quarter of 2021  with the variance largely driven by higher compensation expense due to higher profitability forecasted for the year and increased professional fees associated with strategic projects.Net Other Operating IncomeAMG recorded a net contract settlement benefit of $46 million associated with the cancellation of a supply contract for AMG Silicon  offset by a settlement with a major customer.LiquiditySeptember 30  2022 December 31  2021 Change Senior secured debt $357 685 $371 897 (4%) Cash & cash equivalents 306 416 337 877 (9%) Senior secured net debt 51 269 34 020 51% Other debt 14 926 24 398 (39%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 66 195 58 418 13% Municipal bond debt 319 304 319 476 ‚Äî % Restricted cash 17 069 93 434 (82%) Net debt 368 430 284 460 30%AMG had a net debt position of $368 million as of September 30  2022. This increase was mainly due to the significant investment in growth initiatives during the quarter.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the third quarter. As of September 30  2022  the Company had $306 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $183 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $489 million of total liquidity as of September 30  2022.Net Finance CostsAMG‚Äôs third quarter 2022 net finance costs were $14 million compared to $8 million in the third quarter of 2021. This increase was mainly driven by foreign exchange losses of $6 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances.AMG capitalized $2 million of interest costs in the third quarter of 2022 versus $4 million in the same period in 2021  driven by interest associated with the Company‚Äôs tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio. This decrease is due to a portion of the municipal bond interest costs which are no longer being capitalized due to the ramp-up of production at our Zanesville facility.Profit (loss) for the period to EBITDA reconciliationQ3 ‚Äò22 Q3 ‚Äò21 Profit (loss) for the period $68 339 ($310) Income tax expense 38 603 9 904 Net finance cost 13 988 7 543 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 386 1 015 Restructuring expense 11 261 Net contract settlements (46 407) ‚Äî Asset impairment expense (reversal) 11 587 (88) Strategic project expense (1) 3 282 3 311 Share of loss of associates 750 209 Others (3) 630 EBIT 91 536 22 475 Depreciation and amortization 11 067 10 576 EBITDA 102 603 33 051(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium‚Äôs expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

CCEP internal estimates based on Global Data 2023-2027Forward-Looking StatementsThis document contains statements  estimates or projections that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" concerning the financial condition  performance  results  strategy and objectives of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc and its subsidiaries (together CCEP or the Group). Generally  the words ""ambition""  ""target""  ""aim""  ""believe""  ""expect""  ""intend""  ""estimate""  ""anticipate""  ""project""  ""plan""  ""seek""  ""may""  ""could""  ""would""  ""should""  ""might""  ""will""  ""forecast""  ""outlook""  ""guidance""  ""possible""  ""potential""  ""predict""  ""objective"" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements  which generally are not historical in nature.Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from CCEP's historical experience and present expectations or projections  including with respect to the acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil Limited and its subsidiaries (together ""CCL"" or ""API"") completed on 10 May 2021 (the ""Acquisition""). As a result  undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements  which speak only as of the date on which they are made. These risks include but are not limited to:1. those set forth in the ""Risk Factors"" section of CCEP's 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on 15 March 2022 and as updated and supplemented with the additional information set forth in the ""Principal Risks and Risk Factors"" section of the H1 2022 Half-year Report filed with the SEC on 4 August 2022;2. risks and uncertainties relating to the Acquisition  including the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult  time consuming or costly than expected  which could result in additional demands on CCEP's resources  systems  procedures and controls  disruption of its ongoing business and diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;3. the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect CCEP and the results of its operations  financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted  including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic;4. risks and uncertainties relating to the global supply chain  including impact from war in Ukraine  such as the risk that the business will not be able to guarantee sufficient supply of raw materials  supplies  finished goods  natural gas and oil and increased state-sponsored cyber risks;5. risks and uncertainties relating to the global economy and/or a potential recession in one or more countries  including risks from elevated inflation  price increases  price elasticity  disposable income of consumers and employees  pressure on and from suppliers  increased fraud  and the perception or manifestation of a global economic downturn; and6. risks and uncertainties relating to potential global energy crisis  with potential interruptions and shortages in the global energy supply  specifically the natural gas supply in our territories. Energy shortages at our sites  our suppliers and customers could cause interruptions to our supply chain and capability to meet our production and distribution targets. The impacts  including potential increases in energy prices  are expected to be exacerbated during the approaching colder months of the year.Due to these risks  CCEP's actual future results  dividend payments  capital and leverage ratios  growth  including growth in revenue  cost of sales per unit case and operating profit  free cash flow  market share  tax rate  efficiency savings  achievement of sustainability goals  including net zero emissions  and the results of the integration of the businesses following the Acquisition  including expected efficiency and combination savings  may differ materially from the plans  goals  expectations and guidance set out in forward-looking statements (including those issued by CCL prior to the Acquisition). These risks may also adversely affect CCEP's share price. Additional risks that may impact CCEP's future financial condition and performance are identified in filings with the SEC which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. CCEP does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  except as required under applicable rules  laws and regulations. Furthermore  CCEP assumes no responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any forward-looking statements. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this filing and in any other of CCEP's or CCL's public statements (whether prior or subsequent to the Acquisition) may prove to be incorrect.Note Regarding the Presentation of Pro forma financial information and Alternative Performance MeasuresPro forma financial informationPro forma financial information has been provided in order to illustrate the effects of the acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (referred to as CCL pre acquisition  API post acquisition) on the results of operations of CCEP in 2021 and allow for greater comparability of the results of the combined group between periods. The pro forma financial information for 2021 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and because of its nature  addresses a hypothetical situation. It is based on information and assumptions that CCEP believes are reasonable. For further information  refer to our 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on 15 March 2022  which provides further details on our non-GAAP performance measures and reconciles  where applicable  our results as reported under IFRS to Pro forma financial information and non-GAAP performance measures.The Pro forma financial information presented in this document reflects the inclusion of API revenue as if the acquisition had occurred at 1 January 2021 and prepared on a basis consistent with CCEP accounting policies.The pro forma financial information does not intend to represent what CCEP's results of operations actually would have been if the acquisition had been completed on the dates indicated  nor does it intend to represent  predict or estimate the results of operations for any future period or financial position at any future date. In addition  it does not reflect ongoing cost savings that CCEP expects to achieve as a result of the acquisition or the costs necessary to achieve these cost savings or synergies. As pro forma information is prepared to illustrate retrospectively the effects of future transactions  there are limitations that are inherent to the nature of pro forma information. As such  had the acquisition taken place on the dates assumed  the actual effects would not necessarily have been the same as those presented in the Pro Forma financial information contained herein.Alternative Performance MeasuresWe use certain alternative performance measures (non-GAAP performance measures) to make financial  operating and planning decisions and to evaluate and report performance. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors and as such  where clearly identified  we have included certain alternative performance measures in this document to allow investors to better analyse our business performance and allow for greater comparability. To do so  we have excluded items affecting the comparability of period-over-period financial performance as described below. The alternative performance measures included herein should be read in conjunction with and do not replace the directly reconcilable GAAP measures.For purposes of this document  the following terms are defined:''As reported'' are results extracted from our consolidated financial statements.''Pro forma'' includes the results of CCEP and API as if the Acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2021. In this document  the Pro forma financial information adjustments reflect the inclusion of API revenue as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2021 and prepared on a basis consistent with CCEP accounting policies.""Comparable'' is defined as results excluding items impacting comparability  which include restructuring charges  acquisition and integration related costs  inventory fair value step up related to acquisition accounting  the impact of the closure of the GB defined benefit pension scheme  net impact related to European flooding and net tax items relating to rate and law changes. Comparable volume is also adjusted for selling days.''Pro forma Comparable'' is defined as the pro forma results excluding items impacting comparability  as described above.''Fx-neutral'' or ""FXN"" is defined as period results excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Foreign exchange impact is calculated by recasting current year results at prior year exchange rates.''Capex'' or ""Capital expenditures'' is defined as purchases of property  plant and equipment and capitalised software  plus payments of principal on lease obligations  less proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment. Capex is used as a measure to ensure that cash spending on capital investment is in line with the Group's overall strategy for the use of cash.''Free cash flow'' is defined as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures (as defined above) and interest paid. Free cash flow is used as a measure of the Group's cash generation from operating activities  taking into account investments in property  plant and equipment and non-discretionary lease and interest payments. Free cash flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.''Adjusted EBITDA'' is calculated as Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA)  after adding back items impacting the comparability of period over period financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. Further  adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  and although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortised are likely to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements.''Net Debt'' is defined as the net of cash and cash equivalents less borrowings and adjusted for the fair value of hedging instruments related to borrowings and other financial assets/liabilities related to borrowings. We believe that reporting net debt is useful as it reflects a metric used by the Group to assess cash management and leverage. In addition  the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA is used by investors  analysts and credit rating agencies to analyse our operating performance in the context of targeted financial leverage.''ROIC"" or ""Return on invested capital"" is defined as comparable operating profit after tax attributable to shareholders divided by the average of opening and closing invested capital for the year. Invested capital is calculated as the addition of borrowings and equity attributable to shareholders less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. ROIC is used as a measure of capital efficiency and reflects how well the Group generates comparable operating profit relative to the capital invested in the business.''Dividend payout ratio'' is defined as dividends as a proportion of comparable profit after tax.Additionally  within this document  we provide certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial Information  which management uses for planning and measuring performance. We are not able to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures to reported measures without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact or exact timing of items that may impact comparability throughout year.Unless otherwise stated  percent amounts are rounded to the nearest 0.5%.Supplemental Financial Information - Revenue - Reported to Pro Forma ComparableAll pro forma measures presented below relate only to the nine months ended 1 October 2021.RevenuePro forma Revenue CCEP In millions of ‚Ç¨  except per case data which is calculated prior to rounding.

The 4-period  crossover and randomized study was conducted on 40 healthy subjects  with gender  ethnicity and BMI1 diversity (ref ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05026567).The primary objective was met. It was the evaluation of the relative bioavailability of midazolam after injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 0.625mL) compared to injection of DORMICUM¬Æ (10mg midazolam in 2mL) by a conventional syringe with a 30mm needle  into the thigh on bare skin. The bioequivalence was achieved both on Cmax2 and on AUC3  with no change of Tmax4. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [84-98] for Cmax ratio  and [100-108] for AUC ratio.No serious adverse events were reported  and there was no difference in safety profile between the tested conditions. Only 2 subjects dropped out before their fourth and last injection  not for safety but for personal reason.As secondary objectives  the study aimed to test the intramuscular injection of midazolam with ZENEO¬Æ into thigh through clothing  compared to injection into thigh on bare skin with ZENEO¬Æ and with DORMICUM¬Æ. The 90% Confidence Intervals were respectively of [87-101] and [79-92] for Cmax ratios  and [87-95] and [91-98] for AUC ratios  with no change in Tmax. These results allow considering a much faster emergency treatment  without having to remove patient‚Äôs clothing in an epileptic seizure situation.In addition  an intramuscular injection with ZENEO¬Æ midazolam in the ventrogluteal site was shown to be bioequivalent to an injection in the thigh on bare skin either with a conventional syringe or with ZENEO¬Æ.Finally  ZENEO¬Æ and the syringe with intramucular needle showed a similar and low inter-subject variability of midazolam pharmacokinetics. This is an additional demonstration that an injection with ZENEO reached the muscle in the same way as an injection with a syringe and a 30 mm needle.As a summary  the outcomes of this clinical study are a great achievement for Crossject  as they demonstrate the effectiveness of an intramuscular injection with the needle-free autoinjector ZENEO¬Æ into thigh with or without clothing  as well as into the ventrogluteal site.Contacts :CrossjectPatrick Alexandreinfo@crossject.com Relations investisseursAeliumJ√©r√¥me Gacoin +33 (0)1 75 77 54 67crossject@aelium.frRelations presseBuzz & CompagnieM√©lanie Voisard +33 (0)3 80 43 54 89melanie.voisard@buzzetcompagnie.comChristelle Distinguin +33 (0)6 09 96 51 70christelle.distinguin@buzzetcompagnie.comAbout CROSSJECT ‚Ä¢ www.crossject.comCROSSJECT (ISIN: FR0011716265; Ticker: ALCJ; LEI: 969500W1VTFNL2D85A65) is developing and is soon to market a portfolio of drugs dedicated to emergency situations: epilepsy  overdose  allergic shock  severe migraine and asthma attack.

It is the most important one with 600 jobs and its 153 200 sq.m are articulated around four logistic buildings of unitary sizes going from 33 000 to 43 000 sq.m. Renault Group will be the tenant from now on  with a 12 years lease. Located along the A19 highway  which links the A10  A77  A5 and A6 highway  Villeroy is ideally situated to reach the whole of France.That is why  in the short term  the Villeroy site is intended to become the central store for all the spare parts and accessories activity in France  and this  for all the Renault Group brands with a capacity of more than70 000 references which will be quickly increased to more than 90 000. In order to assist this increase  the Group has launched an automation project which will be operational in 2023.A real estate investment plan for the siteThe budget dedicated by ARGAN to this new acquisition includes a major investment plan that will enable the site to be kept up to date with the latest market standards  including the replacement of doors and dock levelers  the refurbishment of roads  the renovation of premises and the expansion of the parking lot.ARGAN has thus added an exceptional Premium site to its portfolio  both in terms of size and the quality of its tenant.Jean-Claude Le Lan  Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN  comments: ""This acquisition marks a major step in the development of ARGAN. Indeed  this site alone will represent 3.5% of the rents that will be collected by our real estate company in 2023. This transaction  initiated before the economic downturn of the last few months  was financed at relatively advantageous rates compared to today's practice. Three years after the acquisition of the CARGO portfolio  ARGAN confirms its ability to invest in large-scale projects and its position as a major player in logistics real estate in France.The transaction was led by CBRE. Renault Group was advised by the law firm Acte 2 and the law firm Franklin.

This approval was followed by the signing with Bpifrance of the contract on the state aid by the French government  up to 114 million euros for the Gigafactory within the framework of the PIIEC scheme1. The eligibility of the McPhy's project to this scheme was approved by the European Commission last July.Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Officer of McPhy  commented: ""We are very pleased with the decision of our Board of Directors  which is a positive conclusion to the various favorable notices we have recently received about our Gigafactory project. This Gigafactory will be a decisive tool in the development and design of large-scale electrolyzers  which are essential for the use of green hydrogen in ambitious decarbonization projects for industry and heavy mobility. We will soon have an industrial set-up capable of mass-producing a wide range of electrolyzers on a continental scale  that is unmatched by any other player in decarbonized electrolysis in Europe.""Antoine Ressicaud  Chief Operating Officer of McPhy  says: ‚ÄúThis is an inspiring project for the entire McPhy team  with 20 000 sqm dedicated to the manufacture and testing of multi-MW electrolyzers. Our desire is to implement the highest standards of industrial performance on this Belfort facility  through an ambitious social and environmental approach.‚ÄùThe commissioning of the future plant on the Belfort site is scheduled from the 1st half of 2024  with a gradual ramp-up aimed at reaching an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The McPhy Group will then have a total annual production capacity of 1.3 GW2  including the capacity of the San Miniato site in Italy  in line with the growth prospects of the green hydrogen markets  particularly in industry.A phased public aid with an initial payment from Bpifrance of 28.5 million euros by the end of 2022The contract signed with Bpifrance provides for the terms and conditions for the implementation of the public aid. McPhy will receive by December 31  2022 an initial payment of 28.5 million euros. Subsequent payments will take the form of reimbursements of expenses incurred  pursuant to the terms of the contract  following the satisfactory achievement of defined milestones  for a total amount  including the initial payment  of up to 114 million euros.A strategic tool for McPhy's technological and industrial ambitionsWith this Gigafactory  McPhy is pursuing 3 objectives:Innovation : through the development of new generation alkaline electrolyzers  in terms of size  components and integration within modules;: through the development of new generation alkaline electrolyzers  in terms of size  components and integration within modules; Industrialization : with large-scale production to meet the needs of the European market in particular  to contribute to the decarbonization of industry  mobility and energy;: with large-scale production to meet the needs of the European market in particular  to contribute to the decarbonization of industry  mobility and energy; Collaboration: with numerous partners of the Hydrogen ecosystem in Europe and the dissemination of knowledge with academic  industrial and research stakeholders.The future plant in Belfort will host new developments and production of the large electrolyzers in the ""Augmented McLyzer"" range  a real technological breakthrough  enabling 20  100 MW and beyond (GW) architectures to be equipped with an output pressure of 30 bar. This large-scale R&D and industrialization effort will provide the industry with equipment capable of producing hydrogen from renewable energies at a cost that is competitive compared to alternatives using carbon energy.The Gigafactory will further strengthen the McPhy's industrial set-up with  on one hand  the electrolyzers with the ongoing automation of the San Miniato site  dedicated to the production of electrolyzers of up to 1 MW capacity and  on the other hand  the stations  on the brand-new site in Grenoble.Concurrently  Belfort's location at the crossroads of many European countries  with a genuine research and development ecosystem dedicated to innovation and hydrogen  will foster the multiplication of potential industrial and commercial partnerships.Acceleration of development investments and expenses from the second half of 2022The beginning of the construction and the purchase of the land will result in a cash outflow related to the Gigafactory of 9 million euros by the end of the year. In addition  and as previously indicated  McPhy intends to make further investments in order to be able to meet the growing demand for large-scale equipment and facilities  by increasing its R&D resources and by strengthening its project and service teams. These efforts  which are being implemented now  will result in additional expenses in the second half of 2022 and are expected to lead the year-end cash position to a level comparable to the end of the first half  taking into account the Gigafactory-related Bpifrance initial payment and cash outflows.About McPhySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

While stronger market conditions have led to increased commercial activity  confirming the expected multi-year upcycle  near-term macro and geopolitical uncertainties resulted in increased volatility and clients‚Äô projects shift. This particularly affected our Sensing and Monitoring business  which will see significant growth in 2023. However  our Data  Digital and Energy transition business remains solid with growth in line with increased E&P Capex. We anticipate a strong Q4 led by Earth Data sales. We remain focused on capturing the upcycle ahead of us and increasing our topline  with the objective of deleveraging our balance sheet. This growth will be supported by our clear technology differentiation  strong focus on our clients‚Äô priorities  and the ongoing development of our Beyond the Core businesses.‚ÄùQ3 2022: A soft quarter as clients‚Äô projects shifted to Q4 and 2023IFRS figures: revenue at $255m  EBITDAs at $115m  OPINC at $28mSegment revenue at $ 2 17 m   down (20%) and down (16)% pro-forma* year-on-year.Geoscience at $69m  up 8% pro-forma* year-on-year mainly driven by Western hemisphere and high-end technology.

Earth Data at $62m  down (33)% year-on-year. Prefunding revenue at $19m was lower than expected due to the shift of some prefunding of North Sea projects from Q3 to Q4 and Brazil projects into 2023.

The reception of persons who have registered for the meeting and the distribution of voting tickets will commence at 9:30 (EET).A. Matters on the agenda of the General MeetingAt the General Meeting  the following matters will be considered:1. Opening of the meeting2. Calling the meeting to order3. Election of persons to scrutinize the minutes and to supervise the counting of votes4. Recording the legality of the meeting5. Recording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votes6. Resolutions required for acquisition of all the shares in Meriaura LtdIn accordance with the company release published on 29 August 2022  Savosolar Plc (the ‚ÄùCompany‚Äù) plans to acquire all the shares in Meriaura Ltd through a share exchange where shares of the Company are used as consideration (the ‚ÄúShare Exchange‚Äù). Further information on the Share Exchange is available in the company releases published by the Company on 29 August 2022 and on 3 November 2022. In addition  the Board of Directors of the Company has obtained a fairness opinion from Access Partners Ltd in order to support decision making of the shareholders  which is presented as an appendix of the notice.In accordance with the company release of the Company published on 29 August 2022  after the transaction defined in the share exchange agreement  Savosolar Plc‚Äôs number of shares rises to approximately 792 997 410 shares and there are approximately 555 098 187 shares directed to Meriaura Ltd‚Äôs sole shareholder VG-Shipping Ltd in the transaction. These amounts have been calculated based on the assumption that the Company‚Äôs warrants 2-2021 (TO9) are used for subscription of shares in full. As this did not happen  Savosolar Plc‚Äôs number of shares after the transaction defined in the share exchange agreement will be 782 723 687 and there are 547 906 581 shares directed to VG-Shipping Ltd in the transaction. As a result of the change in the number of shares  the subscription price per share published on 29 August 2022 will increase from approximately EUR 0.05404 to approximately EUR 0.05475. The change does not affect the implied values of the companies used in the transaction or the exchange ratio previously published by the Company.Story continuesAs part of the share exchange agreement  VG-Shipping Ltd has given a EUR 1 000 000 guarantee for the subscription of shares not subscribed based on warrants 2-2021 (TO9) with the same subscription price as the shares subscribed based on the warrants. This will be carried out as a separate directed offering to VG-Shipping Ltd or parties nominated by it where maximum of 17 857 142 Company‚Äôs new shares are offered for subscription with subscription price of EUR 0 056 per share.As a precondition for execution of the Share Exchange  all subsections (a)-(c) of this Section 6 need to be approved. The subsections form a whole and the Board of Directors proposes that they are resolved with a single resolution.a) Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on a directed share issue to Meriaura Ltd‚Äôs sole shareholder VG-Shipping LtdThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to decide on a directed share issue of Company‚Äôs new shares against consideration in deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive subscription right in accordance with the Limited Liability Companies Act. The directed share issue relates to the share exchange where the Company acquires all the shares in Meriaura Ltd. Meriaura Ltd in turn owns all the shares in Biolaite Ltd (name change to VG-EcoFuel Ltd pending). Therefore  there is a weighty financial reason for the Company to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive subscription right in accordance with the Limited Liability Companies Act.The shares are offered for subscription to VG-Shipping Ltd. in accordance with the share exchange agreement between the Company and Meriaura Ltd‚Äôs sole shareholder VG-Shipping Ltd. The subscription price is paid by means of contribution in kind  which comprises all the shares in Meriaura Ltd.Based on the authorization  the Board of Directors may issue in the directed share issue a maximum of 547 906 581 new shares of the Company to VG-Shipping Ltd. The new shares to be issued represent approximately 70.0 per cent of the Company‚Äôs all shares after execution of the Share Exchange.The Board of Directors is authorized to resolve on final execution of the share issue as well as within the limits of the Limited Liability Companies Act on all other matters and conditions relating to issuance of shares as well as rights relating to shares.The authorization is proposed to be in force until 31 December 2022. The authorization does not cancel previous authorizations to resolve on the issuance of shares or the issuance of options and other special rights entitling to shares.b) Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on issuance of shares  options and other special rightsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to decide  in one or more transactions  on the issuance of shares and the issuance of options and other special rights entitling to shares referred to in Chapter 10 Section 1 of the Companies Act as follows:The number of shares to be issued based on the authorization may in total amount to a maximum of 295 000 000 shares  including the directed share issue of maximum of 17 857 142 new shares to be directed to VG-Shipping Ltd or parties nominated by it in relation to the subscription guarantee given by VG-Shipping Ltd for the Company‚Äôs warrants 2-2021 (TO9).The Board of Directors decides on all the terms and conditions of the issuances of shares and of options and other special rights entitling to shares.

In order to adapt the existing incentive programs‚Äô frameworks and allotment principles to the agreed transfer to Henrik Ager  an amendment is proposed to the earlier resolution from the general meeting regarding resale of warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:1  according to resolution item (A) below  as well as a corresponding amendment to the allotment principles regarding warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:2  according to resolution item (B) below. The proposal does not entail an issue of new warrants and consequently no change of dilutive effect  in relation to what was stated in the resolution of the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022. The resolution items (A) and (B) are mutually conditioned by each other and are resolved upon one resolution.(A) Resolution on adaptation of the allotment principles for warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:1On the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022  the Company resolved to issue 12 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:1. All warrants have initially been subscribed by the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive AB (the ‚ÄúSubsidiary‚Äù)  before intended allotment to selected management and key personnel in the Company. Pursuant to the annual general meeting‚Äôs resolution  the Subsidiary shall transfer no more than 2 500 000 warrants to the CEO.In order to adapt the program‚Äôs allotment principles to the agreed transfer of 10 000 000 warrants to the new CEO Henrik Ager  it is proposed that the extraordinary general meeting approves an amendment of the above-mentioned distribution  in such manner that the number of warrants that may be transferred by the Subsidiary to the CEO is adjusted to 5 631 130 warrants. For the same purpose  it is proposed that the CEO who has received allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:1 is enabled to also receive allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:2 (and vice versa  please refer to the below).The above-mentioned resale to Henrik Ager entails that there are additional 1 228 870 warrants remaining for potential allotment in this incentive program. The remaining warrants will be cancelled.(B) ‚Äì Resolution on adaptation of the allotment principles for warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:2On the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022  the Company resolved to issue 15 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:2. All warrants have initially been subscribed by the Subsidiary  before intended allotment to board members of the Company. Pursuant to the annual general meeting‚Äôs resolution  the Subsidiary shall transfer inter alia no more than 2 000 000 warrants to the board members.In order to adapt the program‚Äôs allotment principles to the agreed transfer of 10 000 000 warrants to the new CEO Henrik Ager  it is proposed that the extraordinary general meeting approves an amendment of the above-mentioned distribution as follows. The warrants held by the Subsidiary within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:2 shall be possible to transfer also to the CEO  whereby the number of warrants that may be transferred to the CEO shall be 4 368 870 warrants. These warrants have thus not been previously allotted to board members. For the same purpose  it is proposed that the CEO  who has received allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:2 is enabled to also receive allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:1 (and vice versa  please refer to the above).The above-mentioned resale entails that there are no additional warrants remaining for potential allotment in this incentive program.Item 10: Resolution on adoption of Incentive program 2022/2026 by way of (A) issue of warrants to the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive AB and (B) approval of transfer of warrants to management and key personnelFollowing allotment of warrants to the CEO in accordance with item 9 above  together with other allotments after the annual general meeting‚Äôs resolution on 18 May 2022  1 228 870 warrants remain in Incentive program 2022/2025:1  which lapse on 18 December 2025. The board of directors intends to propose a new incentive program for management and key personnel ahead of the annual general meeting 2023 but deems it important to already before the annual general meeting 2023 be able to facilitate important recruitment of new staff and  for this purpose  have more warrants with appropriate maturity available than the aforementioned number. For this reason  the board wishes to create space for further allotments corresponding to in total 3 700 000 warrants  which increase and replace ongoing incentive programs. As the Company intends to cancel the above-mentioned remaining 1 228 870 warrants  this will thus correspond to a net increase of approximately 2 470 000 warrants  which entails a dilution of not more than 0.2 percent.Thus  the board of directors of Copperstone proposes that the general meeting resolves to adopt a new incentive program for management and key personnel in the Company. This new incentive program will thus increase and partly replace the remaining warrants in Incentive program 2022/2025:1  which will be cancelled. The new incentive program is proposed to be adopted by way of an issue of warrants to the Subsidiary in accordance with resolution item (A) below  as well as transfer to selected management and key personnel in accordance with resolution item (B). Resolution items (A) and (B) are mutually conditioned by each other and are resolved upon one resolution.The board of directors assesses it as urgent and in the interest of all shareholders that management and key personnel have a long-term interest of a good value development of the Company‚Äôs share. A personal and long-term ownership commitment may be expected to contribute to an increased interest of the Company‚Äôs operations and results  as well as to increase the motivation for the participants‚Äô and affinity with the Company and its shareholders.(A) ‚Äì Issue of warrants to the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive ABThe board of directors proposes that a directed issue of warrants is carried out  by way of issuance of no more than 3 700 000 warrants of series 2022/2026. The subscription right to the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only accrue to the Subsidiary. The intention is that the warrants shall be transferred to management and key personnel in the Company afterwards  in accordance with what is stated in resolution item (B). The reason why the issue is proposed to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right is thus to create incentives for management and key personnel to at all times work for the Company‚Äôs positive development  since these hold management roles or key roles in the Company and accordingly constitute an important part of the Company‚Äôs continued operations. The warrants are issued without consideration. Each warrant shall entitle to subscription right of one (1) share in the Company  to a subscription price per share corresponding to the current share price in connection with the extraordinary general meeting  as will be seen further in the board of directors‚Äô complete proposal  multiplied with 1.5. Subscription of shares by exercising the warrants shall  in accordance with the terms and conditions for the warrants  be enabled until and including 29 May 2026. In the event that all warrants are exercised for subscription of shares  the Company‚Äôs registered share capital will be increased with SEK 370 000. The terms and conditions  including customary provisions of recalculation with regard to certain events related to the Company etc.  which will be set forth in the board of directors‚Äô complete proposal  shall be applied regarding the warrants.(B) - Approval of transfer of warrants to management and key personnel in the CompanyFurthermore  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary shall transfer no more than in total 3 700 000 warrants to management or key personnel (or wholly owned companies by these persons) in the Company  with the distribution stated below.Position / Categories Number of warrants Management and other key personnel  including consultants on a permanent basis Maximum 1 000 000 warrants per person Newly employed management and key personnel Maximum 500 000 warrants per personThe warrants shall be transferred on market-based terms to a price determined on the basis of the calculated market value for the warrants at the time for transfer  by an application of Black & Scholes valuation model (option premium). The calculation of the option premium to management shall be made or controlled by an independent valuation expert or shall be made on the basis of the expert‚Äôs valuation. Furthermore  a so-called offer of first refusal-agreement shall be entered into  according to which the warrant holder shall be obliged to offer the Company to acquire the warrants  or a certain part of these  under certain conditions.DilutionBased on the current number of shares in the Company  and with the assumption that all warrants will be exercised for subscription of shares and that 1 228 870 warrants from Incentive program 2022/2025:1 will be cancelled  the dilution as a consequence of the proposed incentive program will not exceed 0.2 percent of the shares and votes in the Company (not included the Company‚Äôs current incentive programs).Costs for the incentive program and impact on important key figuresThe incentive program 2022/2026 has been prepared in consultation with external advisors and the total costs for this advice is not expected to amount to noteworthy amounts. In addition to the costs for advisors  the board of directors assesses that the incentive program will cause some administrative costs in connection to subscription of shares by exercising of the warrants and registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Furthermore  the Company may link salary-based bonuses to allotments in order to facilitate participation in the program  bonus costs of which in that case will fall within the Company‚Äôs ordinary personnel costs.The stated dilutive effect above refers to  in relation to the Company‚Äôs key figures  the dilution of the number of shares  and affects relevant key figures definitely if the Company‚Äôs value has risen to the degree that exercise is carried out during the maturity period. In such a case  the dilution should be counteracted by the fact that the Company  in the event of full exercise  would (based on the current share price) be added an amount of SEK 6 900 000.Earlier incentive programs in the CompanyThe Company currently has some ongoing share-related incentive programs which include management  and some ongoing share-related incentive programs which include board members. All of the Company‚Äôs warrant programs are presented on the Company‚Äôs website and will be described in the board of directors‚Äô complete proposal. In the event that the incentive program would be fully implemented within the now intended framework in accordance with the board of directors‚Äô proposal above  the total numerical dilutive effect together with the existing warrant programs as per today will not exceed 5 percent. After the resale of warrants under ongoing Incentive program 2022/2025:1 to the new CEO Henrik Ager  1 228 870 warrants will remain in this incentive program. These 1 228 870 warrants will then be cancelled  which entails that the dilution following the proposed incentive program is mitigated.Majority requirementsResolution to adopt incentive programs according to the above stated  is covered by the rules for the board of directors and management in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)  which  for a valid resolution  requires that the proposal under this item is supported by shareholders representing no less than nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the general meeting.Item 11: Resolution on adjustment of terms and conditions for warrants under earlier incentive programsCopperstone has  on the annual general meeting on 20 May 2020  resolved to issue 16 250 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2020/2023  of which the warrant terms and conditions subsequently was partly amended and converted to Incentive program 2020/2023bis  on the annual general meeting on 19 May 2021 resolved to issue 10 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2021/2024:1 and to issue 15 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2021/2024:2  and on the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022 resolved to issue 12 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:1 and 15 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:2. All warrants have initially been subscribed by the Subsidiary before intended allotment and resale to selected management and key personnel or board members.All warrants under the above-mentioned incentive programs are governed by identical warrant terms and conditions  apart from some certain program specific details. For the purpose of facilitating so-called partial exercise of warrants under the Company‚Äôs ongoing incentive programs  i.e. that an option holder may exercise warrants for subscription of shares at more than one occasion and to a lower number than maximum  the Company‚Äôs board of directors proposes  with reference to item 10 in the warrant terms and conditions respectively  that the warrant terms and conditions regarding the warrants in the above-mentioned incentive programs for practical reasons are amended  in the manner that it facilitates for the option holder to subscribe for shares that the warrants are entitling to at multiple different subscription occasions. This change of terms and conditions is assessed to be appropriate and to all option holders‚Äô benefit.For a valid resolution according to this item  it is required that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing no less than nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the general meeting.Right to informationThe board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder requests it and the board of directors believes that it may take place without significant harm to the Company  provide information at the extraordinary general meeting regarding any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda  and any circumstances which may affect the assessment of the Company‚Äôs or a subsidiary‚Äôs financial position as well as the Company‚Äôs relationship to another group company.DocumentsComplete resolution proposals pursuant to the above  including relevant statements  will be presented on the Company‚Äôs website  www.copperstone.se  and be kept available at Copperstone Resources AB (publ)  Fasadv√§gen 43  SE-981 41 Kiruna  no later than three weeks before the extraordinary general meeting and be sent to shareholders who so wishes and state their postal address.Shares and votesThe Company may issue shares of one class. In total  there are 1 330 093 009 shares and votes in the Company. Each share in the Company carries one vote at the extraordinary general meeting. The Company does not hold any own shares._____________________Kiruna in November 2022Copperstone Resources AB (publ)The board of directorsFor more information  please contactChairman of the board J√∂rgen Olsson on +46 (0) 703 - 420 570E-mail: jorgen.olsson@copperstone.seinfo@copperstone.se or www.copperstone.seAbout CopperstoneCopperstone Resources AB is a company now scaling up to become a modern and responsibly producing mining company through the reopening of the Viscaria mine in Kiruna  Sweden.

The reception of persons who have registered for the meeting and the distribution of voting tickets will commence at 9:30 (EET).A. Matters on the agenda of the General MeetingAt the General Meeting  the following matters will be considered:1. Opening of the meeting2. Calling the meeting to order3. Election of persons to scrutinize the minutes and to supervise the counting of votes4. Recording the legality of the meeting5. Recording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votes6. Resolutions required for acquisition of all the shares in Meriaura LtdIn accordance with the company release published on 29 August 2022  Savosolar Plc (the ‚ÄùCompany‚Äù) plans to acquire all the shares in Meriaura Ltd through a share exchange where shares of the Company are used as consideration (the ‚ÄúShare Exchange‚Äù). Further information on the Share Exchange is available in the company releases published by the Company on 29 August 2022 and on 3 November 2022. In addition  the Board of Directors of the Company has obtained a fairness opinion from Access Partners Ltd in order to support decision making of the shareholders  which is presented as an appendix of the notice.In accordance with the company release of the Company published on 29 August 2022  after the transaction defined in the share exchange agreement  Savosolar Plc‚Äôs number of shares rises to approximately 792 997 410 shares and there are approximately 555 098 187 shares directed to Meriaura Ltd‚Äôs sole shareholder VG-Shipping Ltd in the transaction. These amounts have been calculated based on the assumption that the Company‚Äôs warrants 2-2021 (TO9) are used for subscription of shares in full. As this did not happen  Savosolar Plc‚Äôs number of shares after the transaction defined in the share exchange agreement will be 782 723 687 and there are 547 906 581 shares directed to VG-Shipping Ltd in the transaction. As a result of the change in the number of shares  the subscription price per share published on 29 August 2022 will increase from approximately EUR 0.05404 to approximately EUR 0.05475. The change does not affect the implied values of the companies used in the transaction or the exchange ratio previously published by the Company.As part of the share exchange agreement  VG-Shipping Ltd has given a EUR 1 000 000 guarantee for the subscription of shares not subscribed based on warrants 2-2021 (TO9) with the same subscription price as the shares subscribed based on the warrants. This will be carried out as a separate directed offering to VG-Shipping Ltd or parties nominated by it where maximum of 17 857 142 Company‚Äôs new shares are offered for subscription with subscription price of EUR 0 056 per share.As a precondition for execution of the Share Exchange  all subsections (a)-(c) of this Section 6 need to be approved. The subsections form a whole and the Board of Directors proposes that they are resolved with a single resolution.a) Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on a directed share issue to Meriaura Ltd‚Äôs sole shareholder VG-Shipping LtdThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to decide on a directed share issue of Company‚Äôs new shares against consideration in deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive subscription right in accordance with the Limited Liability Companies Act. The directed share issue relates to the share exchange where the Company acquires all the shares in Meriaura Ltd. Meriaura Ltd in turn owns all the shares in Biolaite Ltd (name change to VG-EcoFuel Ltd pending). Therefore  there is a weighty financial reason for the Company to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive subscription right in accordance with the Limited Liability Companies Act.The shares are offered for subscription to VG-Shipping Ltd. in accordance with the share exchange agreement between the Company and Meriaura Ltd‚Äôs sole shareholder VG-Shipping Ltd. The subscription price is paid by means of contribution in kind  which comprises all the shares in Meriaura Ltd.Based on the authorization  the Board of Directors may issue in the directed share issue a maximum of 547 906 581 new shares of the Company to VG-Shipping Ltd. The new shares to be issued represent approximately 70.0 per cent of the Company‚Äôs all shares after execution of the Share Exchange.The Board of Directors is authorized to resolve on final execution of the share issue as well as within the limits of the Limited Liability Companies Act on all other matters and conditions relating to issuance of shares as well as rights relating to shares.The authorization is proposed to be in force until 31 December 2022. The authorization does not cancel previous authorizations to resolve on the issuance of shares or the issuance of options and other special rights entitling to shares.b) Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on issuance of shares  options and other special rightsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to decide  in one or more transactions  on the issuance of shares and the issuance of options and other special rights entitling to shares referred to in Chapter 10 Section 1 of the Companies Act as follows:The number of shares to be issued based on the authorization may in total amount to a maximum of 295 000 000 shares  including the directed share issue of maximum of 17 857 142 new shares to be directed to VG-Shipping Ltd or parties nominated by it in relation to the subscription guarantee given by VG-Shipping Ltd for the Company‚Äôs warrants 2-2021 (TO9).The Board of Directors decides on all the terms and conditions of the issuances of shares and of options and other special rights entitling to shares. The issuance of shares and of options and other special rights entitling to shares may be carried out in deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive rights (directed issue)  if there is a weighty financial reason for the company.Shares may be conveyed either against payment or free of charge in the company‚Äôs share issues. A directed share issue may be a share issue without payment only if there is an especially weighty reason for the same both for the company and in regard to the interests of all shareholders in the company.The authorization is valid until 30 June 2024  and it replaces the authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting on 1 October 2021.c) Execution of the Share ExchangeThe Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting that the Share Exchange is accepted by the resolution of this General Meeting and the Board of Directors is authorized to take other necessary measures required for execution of the Share Exchange and to confirm execution after the necessary conditions precedent (inter alia approval of Nasdaq Stockholm AB) have been fulfilled.7. Amendment to the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes to the Extraordinary General Meeting that the following amendments be made to the Company's Articles of Association:Section 2 of the Articles of Association (Line of business) is amended to read as follows:2 ¬ß Line of businessThe company's line of business is to conduct business related to maritime logistics as well as solar and other renewable energy. The company may have investment activities. The company can operate directly or through its subsidiaries or associated companies.The Board of Directors proposes that the decisions in accordance with this Section 7 be notified to be registered after the Company's Board of Directors has confirmed that the conditions for the execution of the Share Exchange have been met.8. Remuneration of the Board membersSavosolar Plc's Annual General Meeting decided on 26 April 2022 that the members of the Board of Directors be paid the following remuneration for the term that begun at the end of the Annual General Meeting and ends at the end of the next Annual General Meeting: EUR 21 600 for the Chair of the Board and EUR 10 800 for each of the other members of the Board. Approximately 40 per cent of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors will be paid by giving to the Board members company‚Äôs new shares based on the authorization granted to the Board of Directors and approximately 60 per cent in cash. Cash portion of the remuneration will be paid in 12 monthly instalments to the extent it exceeds the amount of tax withholding from the remuneration. The number of remuneration shares will be determined on the basis of the value of the company‚Äôs share in First North Growth Market Finland as follows: the volume weighted average price of the Savosolar Plc‚Äôs share within two (2) weeks following the publication of the half-year report for the period 1 January - 30 June 2022 will be used as the value of share. Members of the Board of Directors are not allowed to transfer the shares obtained as remuneration before their membership in the Board has ended.The Board of Directors proposes to the Extraordinary General Meeting that the Board remuneration decided by the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2022 remain unchanged  however  in such a way that the Board members leaving the Board have the right to 7/12 of the Board remuneration decided and the newly elected Board members to 5/12 of the Board remuneration decided. Accordingly  the current Chair of the Board is entitled to 7/12 of the decided remuneration of the Chair of the Board and 5/12 of the remuneration of the other Board members  and the newly elected Chair of the Board is entitled to 5/12 of the remuneration of the Chair of the Board.9. The number of Board members and electing membersThe Board of Directors proposes to the Extraordinary General Meeting that six (6) members are elected to the Board.The Board of Directors proposes to the Extraordinary General Meeting that the composition of the Board be changed so that the Company's Board members Eero Auranne  Ari Virtanen and Eljas Repo continue as Board members and Kirsi Suopelto  Jussi M√§lki√§ and Ville Jussila are elected as new Board members.

Resolution regarding the guidelines for remuneration to senior executivesThe Board of SkiStar AB (publ) recommends that the Annual General Meeting adopt the following guidelines for remuneration of senior executives. The guidelines apply until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting and are valid for a maximum of four years.ScopeThe guidelines below include the Board of Directors (as applicable)  the CEO and other members of Group management  hereinafter referred to as senior executives. The guidelines are applicable to remuneration under new agreements and amendments to remuneration already agreed after adoption of the new guidelines by the AGM. The guidelines do not apply to remuneration decided on by the general meeting.The guidelines‚Äô promotion of the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilitySkiStar‚Äôs vision is to create memorable mountain experiences. As a listed company  SkiStar aims to create value for the Company‚Äôs shareholders and promote long-term sustainability in all operations. For further information about SkiStar‚Äôs strategy  long-term interests  including financial and operational targets  and sustainability work  see www.skistar.com/en/corporate and the annual report  which will be available at the same web address no later than three weeks prior to the AGM.Successful implementation of the Company‚Äôs business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including sustainability  are contingent on the Company having qualified employees. SkiStar must therefore be able to offer competitive remuneration. The Company‚Äôs remuneration structure in accordance with these guidelines mustcontribute to a consensus between senior executives and shareholders in terms of the long-term perspective of the operations  including promotion of the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability;ensure that senior executives receive remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  enabling the Company to recruit  motivate and retain competent employees;require senior executives‚Äô compliance with the Company‚Äôs code of conduct  policies and directives; andoffer a salary based on the Company‚Äôs financial targets and senior executives‚Äô individual responsibility  competence  performance  duties  experience and position.Variable remuneration covered by these guidelines should aim to promote the Company‚Äôs business strategy and long-term interests  including sustainability.Remuneration and forms of remunerationThe total compensation for senior executives must be reviewed regularly  and at least annually  to ensure that it is market-based. To create well-balanced total compensation that strengthens both short and long-term performance management and target achievement  remuneration may include the following components: fixed cash salary  variable remuneration/bonuses including undertaking to acquire shares  pension benefits and other benefits.Fixed cash salarySenior executives are to be offered a fixed cash salary that is individualised and market-based in relation to responsibility  competence  performance and regional salary levels. The fixed salary is to be determined annually  to apply during the period September to August.Variable remuneration/bonus including undertaking to acquire sharesSenior executives may receive variable cash remuneration/bonuses  based on the current bonus programme for SkiStar‚Äôs senior executives as decided by the Board for each financial year. Bonuses must be related to measurable criteria defined by the Board  which may be financial or non-financial  qualitative or quantitative  and must be based on factors that support SkiStar‚Äôs business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by having a clear link to value creation  committed long-term ownership and SkiStar‚Äôs development. The criteria may  for example  relate to the Company‚Äôs performance on earnings per share  return on equity  operating margin and organic growth  measured for each financial year. If the Board considers that the business strategy and the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  would be better promoted if the criteria were supplemented or changed  these guidelines allow such changes to be made.The bonus to the CEO may amount to a maximum of 80 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary  which consequently is the bonus cap for the CEO. Bonuses to other senior executives may amount to a maximum of 60 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary  which consequently is the bonus cap for these executives.The level of fulfilment of the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration is to be determined at the end of the measurement period. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the CEO‚Äôs variable cash remuneration assessment. Where the assessment of target achievement is concerned  the CEO is responsible for the assessment in relation to other senior executives‚Äô variable cash remuneration. Financial targets shall be based on the most recent financial report published by the Company.Should it be established that the criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration have not been met in whole or in part  the Board of Directors has the possibility to decide that variable remuneration is nevertheless to be paid to senior executives on an individual basis in extraordinary circumstances  up to an amount not exceeding half of the bonus cap  i.e. a maximum of 40 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary for the CEO  and a maximum of 30 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary for other senior executives. Such extraordinary arrangements are only to be applied either for the purpose of recruitment or retention  or as remuneration for extraordinary work in addition to the person‚Äôs regular duties. Decisions on such remuneration are to be taken by the Board of Directors  for both the CEO and other senior executives  on the proposal of the Remuneration Committee. Variable remuneration is paid in October of the year after it was earned.Under an agreement with the Company  senior executives who receive bonuses must undertake to acquire shares in the Company for long-term ownership (a period of at least three years)  investing at least 1/3 of their post-tax bonuses. The purchase price paid for any SkiStar shares acquired by a senior executive during a given vesting year may be included in the amount that the executive has committed to invest in SkiStar shares if a bonus is received for that vesting year. The purpose is to create involvement and engagement by offering senior executives the opportunity to become shareholders in a structured way. Through the criteria that determine the outcome as described above  incentives are created for senior executives to contribute to realisation of the Company‚Äôs business strategy and safeguarding of the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  and therefore long-term value creation.If a senior executive contravenes the above conditions by  for example  prematurely selling shares acquired under said conditions  the senior executive must  in accordance with the agreement with the Company  be required to repay the full amount (including income tax but not social security contributions) paid for the shares acquired.Pension benefitsSenior executives are entitled to pension arrangements under collective agreements and agreements with SkiStar AB. All pension obligations are defined-contribution plans. For the CEO  the Company pays pension contributions corresponding to 30 percent of the pensionable salary. For other senior executives  pension payments are made according to the standard ITP plan. Salary waivers may be used for increased pension provisions through one-time pension premium payments under salary and bonus sacrifice arrangements. The retirement age for senior executives who are Swedish citizens is 65. For others  it is as specified in their own country‚Äôs pension rules.Car benefitsSenior executives may be offered car benefits.Other benefitsSenior executives may be entitled to other benefits such as health insurance as well as the benefits available to other SkiStar employees. The total value of these benefits may not exceed five percent of a senior executive‚Äôs fixed cash salary.In addition  the CEO may be entitled to private travel between home and work (including air travel)  an official residence in Stockholm including cleaning allowance for the residence  tax return assistance and supplementary health insurance in addition to collectively agreed health insurance. The total value of these benefits may not exceed ten percent of the CEO‚Äôs fixed cash salary.OtherEmployment conditions for senior executives who are subject to rules other than Swedish rules on pension and other benefits may be duly adjusted to ensure compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines as far as possible.Period of notice and termination benefitsThe maximum period of notice is initially 12 months for termination of employment initiated by SkiStar and six months for termination by the senior executive. Termination benefits shall only be paid when termination of employment is initiated by the Company. Termination benefits shall only to be paid up to the date on which the individual in question obtains other employment. Termination benefits are calculated on the fixed cash salary and are not pensionable. Total fixed salary during the period of notice and any termination benefits must not exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed salary for 24 months.Decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board‚Äôs Remuneration Committee is responsible for annually reviewing the need to revise the guidelines prior to the Board‚Äôs proposal to the AGM (if applicable) for adoption. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and present it to the AGM for resolution. The guidelines shall be valid until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration for senior executives  the application of guidelines for remuneration of senior executives and applicable remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the Company. The Board makes decisions on the salary and other terms of employment for the CEO on the basis of proposals from the Remuneration Committee. The CEO makes decisions on the salary and other terms of employment for other senior executives and consults with the Remuneration Committee on these matters. Decisions on possible variable remuneration in extraordinary circumstances are  however  made by the Board for the CEO as well as for other senior executives on the basis of proposals from the Remuneration Committee. The CEO and other senior executives are not present when the Board and the Remuneration Committee consider and make decisions on remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by these matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board may  following a proposal from the Remuneration Committee  decide to make a temporary derogation from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if there are particular reasons to do so in an individual case and such derogation is necessary in order to serve the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  or to ensure the Company‚Äôs financial viability. As stated above  the Remuneration Committee‚Äôs tasks include preparation of the Board‚Äôs decisions in remuneration-related matters. This includes decisions to derogate from the guidelines. Such derogations are to be reported and explained in the subsequent remuneration report.Salary and terms of employment for other employeesIn preparing the Board‚Äôs proposal for these remuneration guidelines  the salaries and terms of employment for the Company‚Äôs employees have been taken into account by including information about the employees‚Äô total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and the remuneration increase and rate of increase over time in the Board‚Äôs decision support material for evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines and limitations set out herein. The remuneration report on paid and outstanding remuneration covered by the guidelines will include a report on the trend regarding the gap between Company management‚Äôs remuneration and other employees‚Äô remuneration.Changes from previous guidelinesThe Board‚Äôs proposal for guidelines for remuneration of senior executives prior to the 2022 AGM is largely consistent with the guidelines adopted at the 2021 AGM. In the review prior to the 2022 AGM  changes have been made regarding the extended benefit for the CEO  as regards the official residence in Stockholm including cleaning allowance for the residence  clarification of the extended possibility for the Board to decide upon variable remuneration in extraordinary circumstances  and an increased bonus cap for variable remuneration to the CEO  from 60 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary to 80 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary. Furthermore  the possibility has been introduced for senior executives  if a bonus is received  to include the purchase price of SkiStar shares acquired during the vesting year of the current bonus payment in the amount that the executive has committed to invest in SkiStar shares.More informationOn the date of submission of these proposed remuneration guidelines for senior executives  SkiStar did not have any remuneration commitments not due for payment other than ongoing commitments to senior executives in accordance with the remuneration principles adopted at the 2021 AGM. For more information on remuneration at SkiStar  see the remuneration report and the annual report  which are available at www.skistar.com/sv/corporate no later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.21. Resolution regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issuesThe board of directors proposes that the AGM authorises the board of directors to resolve upon new issues of shares in accordance with the following.The board of directors is proposed to be authorized to  on one or several occasions during the period until the next AGM  to resolve on new issues of Class B shares. A new share issue may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right.

Decision pursuant to the authorisation may not result in a new issuance of shares exceeding ten (10) percent of all shares in the company at the time of the AGM's decision on the authorisation. An issue of new shares based on this authorisation must not result in the company‚Äôs share capital exceeding the company‚Äôs maximum allowed share capital as set out in the articles of association. Shares shall  in case of deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right to subscription  be issued on market terms. The board shall be entitled to determine other terms for the share issue.The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right if any  is to give the board increased options to  completely or partially  finance any future investments/acquisitions by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisitions alternatively to raise capital for such investments/acquisitions. The board  or anyone appointed by the board  shall be authorised to make such minor adjustments of the resolution of the AGM that may be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and has the right to otherwise take the measures required to enforce the decision.22. Resolution on authorisation providing the Board of Directors with the right to pass resolutions regarding acquisitions and sales of the company‚Äôs own sharesThe board of directors proposes that the AGM authorises the board of directors to resolve on the acquisition and sales of the company‚Äôs own shares according to essentially the following.The board of directors‚Äô proposal entails that the board be authorised  until the next AGM of shareholders  to pass resolutions on one or more occasions regarding the acquisition of Class B shares in the company; however  the company‚Äôs holding may not  at any time  exceed ten percent of the total number of shares in the company. The acquisition of shares shall take place in a regulated market or by an acquisition offer made to all shareholders that hold Class B shares. Acquisition of shares in a regulated market may only take place at a price that is  at any given point in time  within the registered share price interval ‚Äì that is  the interval between the highest bid price and the lowest selling price. An offer of acquisition made to all shareholders may take place at a price equivalent to the lowest market value at the time of the offer  with a maximum deviation of plus 20 percent.Furthermore  the proposal by the board of directors entails that the board of directors be entitled to pass resolutions  on one or more occasions until the next AGM  regarding the sale of the company‚Äôs own shares in a regulated market or in conjunction with the acquisition of companies or operations. The authorisation includes the right to pass resolutions on deviation from the preferential rights of shareholders and resolutions that establish forms of payment other than cash funds  on the basis of in-kind payment  offsetting or on the basis of other conditions. The authorisation may be utilised for the maximum number of shares stipulated in the authorisation to acquire the company‚Äôs shares. Transfers in a regulated market may only take place at a price that is  at any given point in time  within the registered share price interval. Transfers in connection with acquisitions shall take place at a price which  in all essential manners  corresponds to the market value for the company‚Äôs share at the time of entering into the acquisition agreement.These authorisations aim to provide the board of directors with increased scope in working with the company‚Äôs capital structure and  if deemed appropriate  to facilitate acquisitions. The reason for the deviation from pre-emption rights  with regard to transfers made in conjunction with the acquisition of companies and businesses  is to create alternative forms of payment for such acquisitions. The board  or anyone appointed by the board  shall be authorised to make such minor adjustments of the resolution that may prove necessary in connection with the implementation of the board‚Äôs resolution on repurchase and transfer of own shares.Shareholder‚Äôs proposal23.

When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition  we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures  since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures and additional non-GAAP information included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders  adjusted diluted

Today  Per Colleen works as CEO of TomEnterprise AB  TomEqt AB and Kinkon AB.Item 8: Determination of remuneration to new member of the board of directorsAs a consequence of the proposal regarding election of a new member of the board of directors  the nomination committee proposes that  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  remuneration of in total SEK 200 000 shall be paid on an annual basis to the new board member from 1 December 2022.Item 9: Resolution on (A) adaptation of the allotment principles for warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:1 and (B) adaptation of the allotment principles for warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:2As previously communicated by way of press release  Copperstone has given the new CEO Henrik Ager an opportunity to acquire 10 000 000 warrants on market terms  as part of the remuneration package agreed between the Company and Henrik Ager. In order to adapt the existing incentive programs‚Äô frameworks and allotment principles to the agreed transfer to Henrik Ager  an amendment is proposed to the earlier resolution from the general meeting regarding resale of warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:1  according to resolution item (A) below  as well as a corresponding amendment to the allotment principles regarding warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:2  according to resolution item (B) below. The proposal does not entail an issue of new warrants and consequently no change of dilutive effect  in relation to what was stated in the resolution of the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022. The resolution items (A) and (B) are mutually conditioned by each other and are resolved upon one resolution.(A) Resolution on adaptation of the allotment principles for warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:1On the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022  the Company resolved to issue 12 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:1. All warrants have initially been subscribed by the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive AB (the ‚ÄúSubsidiary‚Äù)  before intended allotment to selected management and key personnel in the Company. Pursuant to the annual general meeting‚Äôs resolution  the Subsidiary shall transfer no more than 2 500 000 warrants to the CEO.In order to adapt the program‚Äôs allotment principles to the agreed transfer of 10 000 000 warrants to the new CEO Henrik Ager  it is proposed that the extraordinary general meeting approves an amendment of the above-mentioned distribution  in such manner that the number of warrants that may be transferred by the Subsidiary to the CEO is adjusted to 5 631 130 warrants. For the same purpose  it is proposed that the CEO who has received allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:1 is enabled to also receive allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:2 (and vice versa  please refer to the below).The above-mentioned resale to Henrik Ager entails that there are additional 1 228 870 warrants remaining for potential allotment in this incentive program. The remaining warrants will be cancelled.(B) ‚Äì Resolution on adaptation of the allotment principles for warrants under Incentive program 2022/2025:2On the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022  the Company resolved to issue 15 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:2. All warrants have initially been subscribed by the Subsidiary  before intended allotment to board members of the Company. Pursuant to the annual general meeting‚Äôs resolution  the Subsidiary shall transfer inter alia no more than 2 000 000 warrants to the board members.In order to adapt the program‚Äôs allotment principles to the agreed transfer of 10 000 000 warrants to the new CEO Henrik Ager  it is proposed that the extraordinary general meeting approves an amendment of the above-mentioned distribution as follows. The warrants held by the Subsidiary within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:2 shall be possible to transfer also to the CEO  whereby the number of warrants that may be transferred to the CEO shall be 4 368 870 warrants. These warrants have thus not been previously allotted to board members. For the same purpose  it is proposed that the CEO  who has received allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:2 is enabled to also receive allotment in Incentive program 2022/2025:1 (and vice versa  please refer to the above).The above-mentioned resale entails that there are no additional warrants remaining for potential allotment in this incentive program.Item 10: Resolution on adoption of Incentive program 2022/2026 by way of (A) issue of warrants to the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive AB and (B) approval of transfer of warrants to management and key personnelFollowing allotment of warrants to the CEO in accordance with item 9 above  together with other allotments after the annual general meeting‚Äôs resolution on 18 May 2022  1 228 870 warrants remain in Incentive program 2022/2025:1  which lapse on 18 December 2025. The board of directors intends to propose a new incentive program for management and key personnel ahead of the annual general meeting 2023 but deems it important to already before the annual general meeting 2023 be able to facilitate important recruitment of new staff and  for this purpose  have more warrants with appropriate maturity available than the aforementioned number. For this reason  the board wishes to create space for further allotments corresponding to in total 3 700 000 warrants  which increase and replace ongoing incentive programs. As the Company intends to cancel the above-mentioned remaining 1 228 870 warrants  this will thus correspond to a net increase of approximately 2 470 000 warrants  which entails a dilution of not more than 0.2 percent.Thus  the board of directors of Copperstone proposes that the general meeting resolves to adopt a new incentive program for management and key personnel in the Company. This new incentive program will thus increase and partly replace the remaining warrants in Incentive program 2022/2025:1  which will be cancelled. The new incentive program is proposed to be adopted by way of an issue of warrants to the Subsidiary in accordance with resolution item (A) below  as well as transfer to selected management and key personnel in accordance with resolution item (B). Resolution items (A) and (B) are mutually conditioned by each other and are resolved upon one resolution.The board of directors assesses it as urgent and in the interest of all shareholders that management and key personnel have a long-term interest of a good value development of the Company‚Äôs share. A personal and long-term ownership commitment may be expected to contribute to an increased interest of the Company‚Äôs operations and results  as well as to increase the motivation for the participants‚Äô and affinity with the Company and its shareholders.(A) ‚Äì Issue of warrants to the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive ABThe board of directors proposes that a directed issue of warrants is carried out  by way of issuance of no more than 3 700 000 warrants of series 2022/2026. The subscription right to the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only accrue to the Subsidiary. The intention is that the warrants shall be transferred to management and key personnel in the Company afterwards  in accordance with what is stated in resolution item (B). The reason why the issue is proposed to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right is thus to create incentives for management and key personnel to at all times work for the Company‚Äôs positive development  since these hold management roles or key roles in the Company and accordingly constitute an important part of the Company‚Äôs continued operations. The warrants are issued without consideration. Each warrant shall entitle to subscription right of one (1) share in the Company  to a subscription price per share corresponding to the current share price in connection with the extraordinary general meeting  as will be seen further in the board of directors‚Äô complete proposal  multiplied with 1.5. Subscription of shares by exercising the warrants shall  in accordance with the terms and conditions for the warrants  be enabled until and including 29 May 2026. In the event that all warrants are exercised for subscription of shares  the Company‚Äôs registered share capital will be increased with SEK 370 000. The terms and conditions  including customary provisions of recalculation with regard to certain events related to the Company etc.  which will be set forth in the board of directors‚Äô complete proposal  shall be applied regarding the warrants.(B) - Approval of transfer of warrants to management and key personnel in the CompanyFurthermore  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary shall transfer no more than in total 3 700 000 warrants to management or key personnel (or wholly owned companies by these persons) in the Company  with the distribution stated below.Position / Categories Number of warrants Management and other key personnel  including consultants on a permanent basis Maximum 1 000 000 warrants per person Newly employed management and key personnel Maximum 500 000 warrants per personThe warrants shall be transferred on market-based terms to a price determined on the basis of the calculated market value for the warrants at the time for transfer  by an application of Black & Scholes valuation model (option premium). The calculation of the option premium to management shall be made or controlled by an independent valuation expert or shall be made on the basis of the expert‚Äôs valuation. Furthermore  a so-called offer of first refusal-agreement shall be entered into  according to which the warrant holder shall be obliged to offer the Company to acquire the warrants  or a certain part of these  under certain conditions.DilutionBased on the current number of shares in the Company  and with the assumption that all warrants will be exercised for subscription of shares and that 1 228 870 warrants from Incentive program 2022/2025:1 will be cancelled  the dilution as a consequence of the proposed incentive program will not exceed 0.2 percent of the shares and votes in the Company (not included the Company‚Äôs current incentive programs).Costs for the incentive program and impact on important key figuresThe incentive program 2022/2026 has been prepared in consultation with external advisors and the total costs for this advice is not expected to amount to noteworthy amounts. In addition to the costs for advisors  the board of directors assesses that the incentive program will cause some administrative costs in connection to subscription of shares by exercising of the warrants and registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Furthermore  the Company may link salary-based bonuses to allotments in order to facilitate participation in the program  bonus costs of which in that case will fall within the Company‚Äôs ordinary personnel costs.The stated dilutive effect above refers to  in relation to the Company‚Äôs key figures  the dilution of the number of shares  and affects relevant key figures definitely if the Company‚Äôs value has risen to the degree that exercise is carried out during the maturity period. In such a case  the dilution should be counteracted by the fact that the Company  in the event of full exercise  would (based on the current share price) be added an amount of SEK 6 900 000.Earlier incentive programs in the CompanyThe Company currently has some ongoing share-related incentive programs which include management  and some ongoing share-related incentive programs which include board members. All of the Company‚Äôs warrant programs are presented on the Company‚Äôs website and will be described in the board of directors‚Äô complete proposal. In the event that the incentive program would be fully implemented within the now intended framework in accordance with the board of directors‚Äô proposal above  the total numerical dilutive effect together with the existing warrant programs as per today will not exceed 5 percent. After the resale of warrants under ongoing Incentive program 2022/2025:1 to the new CEO Henrik Ager  1 228 870 warrants will remain in this incentive program. These 1 228 870 warrants will then be cancelled  which entails that the dilution following the proposed incentive program is mitigated.Majority requirementsResolution to adopt incentive programs according to the above stated  is covered by the rules for the board of directors and management in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)  which  for a valid resolution  requires that the proposal under this item is supported by shareholders representing no less than nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the general meeting.Item 11: Resolution on adjustment of terms and conditions for warrants under earlier incentive programsCopperstone has  on the annual general meeting on 20 May 2020  resolved to issue 16 250 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2020/2023  of which the warrant terms and conditions subsequently was partly amended and converted to Incentive program 2020/2023bis  on the annual general meeting on 19 May 2021 resolved to issue 10 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2021/2024:1 and to issue 15 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2021/2024:2  and on the annual general meeting on 18 May 2022 resolved to issue 12 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:1 and 15 000 000 warrants within the framework of Incentive program 2022/2025:2. All warrants have initially been subscribed by the Subsidiary before intended allotment and resale to selected management and key personnel or board members.All warrants under the above-mentioned incentive programs are governed by identical warrant terms and conditions  apart from some certain program specific details. For the purpose of facilitating so-called partial exercise of warrants under the Company‚Äôs ongoing incentive programs  i.e. that an option holder may exercise warrants for subscription of shares at more than one occasion and to a lower number than maximum  the Company‚Äôs board of directors proposes  with reference to item 10 in the warrant terms and conditions respectively  that the warrant terms and conditions regarding the warrants in the above-mentioned incentive programs for practical reasons are amended  in the manner that it facilitates for the option holder to subscribe for shares that the warrants are entitling to at multiple different subscription occasions. This change of terms and conditions is assessed to be appropriate and to all option holders‚Äô benefit.For a valid resolution according to this item  it is required that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing no less than nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the general meeting.Right to informationThe board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder requests it and the board of directors believes that it may take place without significant harm to the Company  provide information at the extraordinary general meeting regarding any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda  and any circumstances which may affect the assessment of the Company‚Äôs or a subsidiary‚Äôs financial position as well as the Company‚Äôs relationship to another group company.DocumentsComplete resolution proposals pursuant to the above  including relevant statements  will be presented on the Company‚Äôs website  www.copperstone.se  and be kept available at Copperstone Resources AB (publ)  Fasadv√§gen 43  SE-981 41 Kiruna  no later than three weeks before the extraordinary general meeting and be sent to shareholders who so wishes and state their postal address.Shares and votesThe Company may issue shares of one class. In total  there are 1 330 093 009 shares and votes in the Company. Each share in the Company carries one vote at the extraordinary general meeting. The Company does not hold any own shares._____________________Kiruna in November 2022Copperstone Resources AB (publ)The board of directorsFor more information  please contactChairman of the board J√∂rgen Olsson on +46 (0) 703 - 420 570E-mail: jorgen.olsson@copperstone.seinfo@copperstone.se or www.copperstone.seAbout CopperstoneCopperstone Resources AB is a company now scaling up to become a modern and responsibly producing mining company through the reopening of the Viscaria mine in Kiruna  Sweden.

Boosted by yet another record quarter of ESL Shipping and solid performance of Telko  our comparable operating profit for the quarter increased to EUR 13.0 million. Despite the expected sales drop in the Eastern market  our net sales were up 8% at EUR 160.1 million. Our comparable operating profit rate for Q3 remained strong at 8.1%  again above the target level of 8%. Overall  a great continuum to a financially successful year.We have continued making strides in our strategy execution. Leipurin‚Äôs milestone acquisition of the Swedish bakery distributor Kobia was approved by the competition authorities in the third quarter  and integration work is already underway. Kobia is included in Aspo Group‚Äôs financial reporting as of September  2022. Structural changes are negatively impacting Leipurin‚Äôs financial figures for 2022 but I am confident that the company is heading in the right direction with the renewed strategy.In September  Telko announced that it will strengthen its plastics distribution business by acquiring Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of engineering plastics and plastic additives with an established customer base in the local markets. Clear evidence of Telko‚Äôs ability to execute its accelerated growth strategy.During the quarter  ESL Shipping confirmed that it will establish a long-term shipping pool for energy efficient electric hybrid vessels together with a group of institutional and private investors. The upcoming Green Coaster pool will accelerate growth  profitability and return on capital of ESL Shipping's business  and fits seamlessly to Aspo‚Äôs renewed strategy.On October 17  we announced that Telko has signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. This is an important step  and I‚Äôm pleased that we have found a new owner for Telko's operations in Russia. This frees up time and resources to pursue further growth in western markets in accordance with our strategy. In line with what we have indicated before  the comparable operating profit of Telko Russia and Belarus was close to zero during the third quarter. Therefore  Telko‚Äôs Q3 results already give some visibility to the future financial performance of the company after the targeted exits of both Russia and Belarus have taken place. Telko's Russian business is classified as held for sale from the month of signing the agreement.Due to the excellent performance of ESL Shipping in particular  we upgraded our guidance for the full-year 2022 on October 17. We are now estimating that Aspo Group‚Äôs comparable operating profit for 2022 will be EUR 52‚Äì57 million  well above the EUR 42.4 million achieved last year. At the same time  our visibility to the overall costs related to the war in Ukraine and exiting our Russian operations  as well as other items affecting comparability has increased. As announced  the new estimate of the total items affecting comparability is approximately EUR -25 million. This estimate includes the items affecting comparability of EUR -8.0 million reported by the end of the third quarter of 2022.Our financial performance throughout the year has been solid and we remain confident on our short-term outlook. Macroeconomic uncertainty still remains and the foundations for moving into the next year differ substantially from a year ago. However  with the significant ongoing structural changes including exits from selected eastern markets and acquisitions in the western countries  we are in an excellent position to succeed in the fourth quarter 2022 and beyond. We continue our strategy execution during the coming years targeting both organic and non-organic growth especially in the western market.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:Net sales growth 5‚Äì10% per yearOperating profit of 8%Return on equity of over 20%Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo‚Äôs businesses  ESL Shipping‚Äôs operating profit target is 14%  Telko‚Äôs 8% and Leipurin‚Äôs 5%.Good financial performance continued in Q3 2022.

The operating result of other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo‚Äôs previous CEO.The items affecting comparability of 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin‚Äôs goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko‚Äôs terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko‚Äôs goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is an instrumental factor in guiding management of Aspo and in particular its investments. Aspo‚Äôs businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2 (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) was 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. With regards to the green transition in shipping  ESL Shipping is in close  long-term project cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation to its key customers in the future.During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by net sales growth in combination with operational efficiency  and it was 0.34 (12/2021: 0.42). Another key target is to improve safety  and during the past 12 months  TRI (Total Recordable Injury Frequency) was 7.8 (12/2021: 8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.Operating environment and the impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo‚Äôs operationsAspo‚Äôs operating environment has changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia‚Äôs armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused a lot of uncertainty in the market  price inflation and in particular higher energy prices  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates. Disturbances in logistic flows and poor availability of certain products are also evident in the market.Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically weakens operating conditions in Eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values.All of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia have been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas. As announced on October 17  Aspo Group‚Äôs subsidiary Telko has signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. As previously announced  Telko will also exit Belarus. This process is still ongoing. Leipurin has decided to withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. The process is proceeding as planned and more details on the timetable and methods of implementation will be announced in due course. Telko‚Äôs and Leipurin‚Äôs combined net sales in these countries accounted for approximately 16% of Aspo Group's net sales in 2021.The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23% of Leipurin‚Äôs total net sales in 2021 and 4% of the net sales of Aspo Group. The net sales of Telko Russia and Belarus amounted to EUR 69.9 million in year 2021 which accounted for 26% of Telko‚Äôs total net sales in 2021 and 12% of the net sales of Aspo Group.The international sanctions and Russia‚Äôs legislative measures prevent transportation of goods and transfer of payments  reducing net sales and profitability of our Russian operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of Russian Group companies is EUR 25.1 million  corresponding to 15.3% of Aspo Group‚Äôs total equity. Aspo‚Äôs assets in Russia are mainly consisting of cash  inventories and trade receivables. The number of employees working for Aspo companies in Russia is decreasing  amounting to 114 employees at the end of September (12/2021: 193).Increasing interest rates and inflation  combined with declining general economic forecasts  have impacted consumers‚Äô buying patterns  including by shifting consumption from higher priced to lower priced products.In media  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  but its impact is still present in the operating environment. For example  global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on Aspo‚Äôs businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members of ESL Shipping‚Äôs vessels.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 7-9/2022 7-9/2021 Change 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 Change in share in share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 57.0 44.6 5.3 165.8 129.8 3.2 Scandinavia 38.1 24.8 7.0 99.0 77.2 2.0 Baltic countries 16.4 13.4 1.1 49.6 38.8 1.0 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 24.6 39.6 -11.8 96.6 111.3 -6.8 Other countries 21.7 22.2 -1.6 68.6 56.2 0.7 Total 157.8 144.6 479.6 413.3The Group‚Äôs main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in eastern markets continued to decrease during the third quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine and the decision to reduce operations in Russia and Belarus  and ultimately exit the market. On the positive side  particularly Telko‚Äôs sales in Ukraine have picked up during the past months  although they are still not on the same level as during the previous year. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will channel its growth investments into western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group‚Äôs cash flow from operating activities in January‚ÄìSeptember was EUR 45.7 (33.3) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -5.8 (-12.6) million. The increase in working capital derives mainly from ESL Shipping and is partly offset by the improved working capital of Telko. The advance payments for the Green Coasters to be sold further are one root cause for the increase in ESL Shipping‚Äôs inventory balance. Free cash flow during January-September was EUR 17.9 (23.4) million. Investments of EUR -15.2 (-11.1) million mainly consisted of docking of ESL Shipping‚Äôs vessels and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the free cash flow includes the cash flow relating to the acquisition of Kobia and Mentum of EUR -15.6 million  and the cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus of EUR 3.0 million in total.9/2022 9/2021 12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 204.0 186.1 185.1 Cash and cash equivalents 43.7 23.7 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 160.3 162.4 167.4Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 160.3 million (12/2021: EUR 167.4)  and gearing fell to 97.6% (9/2021: 130.9%; 12/2021: 129.4%). The Group‚Äôs equity ratio at the end of the review period was 35.8% (9/2021: 31.8%; 12/2021: 32.0%). The balance sheet was strengthened as a result of improved profitability and a new hybrid bond issued in June.Net financial expenses in January‚ÄìSeptember totaled EUR -7.0 (-2.9) million. Exchange rate fluctuations  particularly strengthening of the Russian rouble  increased in financial expenses by EUR -4.0 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.8% (1.6%).The Group‚Äôs liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 43.7 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo‚Äôs EUR 80 million commercial paper program was also fully unused (9/2021: EUR 5 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).During the quarter  Aspo continued extending the maturity structure of interest-bearing liabilities. In September  AtoBatC Shipping signed EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The maturity of this loan is 15 years. Together with the EUR 20 million  10-year loan agreement signed with Nordic Investment Bank in June  these loans complete the financing of ESL Shipping‚Äôs investment in a series of six new  highly energy-efficient electric hybrid 5 350 dwt vessels  a project first announced in September 2021. In addition  Aspo refinanced a bilateral revolving credit facility of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new agreement which will mature in 2025. The RCF agreement also includes two one-year extension options.In June  Aspo issued a new hybrid bond of EUR 30 million. The coupon rate of the bond is 8.75% per annum. The bond has no maturity  but the company is entitled to redeem it in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo‚Äôs previous hybrid bond of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its businesses are exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which include but are not limited to the risks stated below.There is an increasing level of geopolitical uncertainty due to Russia's war in Ukraine. This affects the general economic environment  e.g. via inflation  interest rates  energy prices and prices of raw materials. Disturbances related to infrastructure may also occur as part of current uncertainties relating to Russia  for example due to cyber incidents or disruptions in information systems.The ongoing process of exiting Russia and other selected Eastern markets is changing the structure of the Group significantly and will affect earnings of Aspo businesses in the long run. There are risks that the market exits will cause additional costs or losses and repatriation of funds or exits will not succeed fully or partly. It is also possible that the exits will not receive the required authority approvals or will be jeopardized or fail for any other reason.Economic activity and current geopolitical uncertainties have caused prices of many raw materials  components  and logistics services to increase rapidly. Aspo may temporarily benefit from the price increases  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disturbances in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes  are also accumulating risks.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may affect Aspo‚Äôs businesses directly or indirectly. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct business damage  jeopardized payments and even suspend business operations.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its earnings via acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary weakening of the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The impact of the coronavirus on Aspo‚Äôs business has been limited on Group level  although the impact on Leipurin has been significant. Current and any new variants of the coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses through interruptions in global logistics flows  among other things.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they include significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO‚ÄôS BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading carrier of dry bulk cargo in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping‚Äôs operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company‚Äôs fleet consisted of 47 vessels with a total capacity of 451 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75.3% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2.3%) and the remaining 22 vessels (22.4%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping‚Äôs competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean carriers at sea as a special service.7-9/2022 7-9/2021 Change % 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 65.0 47.3 37 182.1 136.7 33 Operating profit  MEUR 9.7 7.1 37 27.9 17.0 64 Operating profit  % 14.9 15.0 15.3 12.4 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 9.7 7.1 37 26.8 17.0 58 Comparable operating profit  % 14.9 15.0 14.7 12.4The third quarter of 2022 displayed the strongest third quarter operating result in ESL Shipping‚Äôs history. Net sales increased by 37% from last year to EUR 65.0 (47.3) million. During the quarter  the operating profit increased by 37 % to a record-high level of EUR 9.7 (7.1) million. During the third quarter there were no items affecting comparability in operating profit.The strong result was driven by the shipping company‚Äôs partnership strategy and the operational success delivered by the entire personnel. The operating profit rate of 14.9% (15.0%) achieved during the third quarter was excellent  especially considering the more modest market conditions and the historical change of abandoning cargo flows from Russia as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and resulted sanctions. The target level of 14.0% operating profit was again exceeded.During the third quarter  price of diesel oil and especially price of LNG used as a ship fuel were significantly higher than in the comparative period last year. The current level of very high fuel surcharges continued to increase net sales and reduced the operating profit percentage rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability.During the review period  the volume of cargo transported by the shipping company decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The main drivers behind the volume development were re-routing of raw material supply out of Russia  which continued to result in increased transportation distances  and heavy congestion in certain major contract traffic ports. ESL Shipping has no remaining transport obligations related to cargo operations from Russian ports or with customers and cargo closely related to Russia.The profitability of ESL Shipping‚Äôs all vessel categories remained strong during the third quarter. In contract traffic  demand for ton miles remained strong throughout the review period despite slightly lower volumes  and spot market freight rates were at a satisfying level in all customer segments and vessel categories. Towards the end of the period spot market rates softened and demand showed some symptoms of slowing down  with the clear exception of the energy industry  where the demand continued strong.During the third quarter  ESL Shipping achieved a major strategic and structural milestone as it established a long-term Green Coaster pool for energy efficient electric hybrid vessels together with a group of institutional and private investors. A pooling structure is a model commonly used in the international shipping business for the ownership and operation of vessels. The forthcoming Green Coaster pool will accelerate the growth  profitability and return on capital of ESL Shipping's business. The pool will also form the first phase of the shipping company‚Äôs new low-carbon growth strategy that utilizes investor funding and pooling structure.Resulting from the established pool structure  ESL Shipping‚Äôs subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping declared options and ordered five additional vessels from the Indian shipyard Chowgule & Company Private Limited  from which the shipping company has previously ordered seven identical electric hybrid vessels. Of the series of twelve new-generation electric hybrid vessels  every other vessel will be sold to a company formed by a group of investors. As previously announced  the total amount of ESL Shipping's own investment will remain at the size of six vessels and approximately EUR 70 million.The first three of the new vessels are already under construction  and the planned delivery of the first vessel is scheduled for the autumn 2023. The planned delivery of the last vessel is scheduled for the second quarter of 2026. AtoBatC Shipping will act as the manager of the pool and all vessels in the pool will be placed as part of the shipping company's existing and growing contract traffic. The investor company is offered complete services related to the construction and maintenance of the vessels on a turnkey basis.ESL Shipping‚Äôs long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. One of the measures implemented together with a key client is to optimize a vessel‚Äôs speed with Virtual Arrival procedure  which has reduced emissions on the applied voyages on average by 24% in the past twelve months. Discussions are ongoing to extend the procedure for other trade lines and clients.The scheduled drydockings of the current fleet continued with 63 (116) docking days during the third quarter.The net sales of ESL Shipping in January‚ÄìSeptember increased significantly by 33% from the comparative period  amounting to EUR 182.1 (136.7) million. The comparable operating profit increased to EUR 26.8 (17.0) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 14.7% (12.4%).ESL Shipping outlook for 2022The overall macroeconomic uncertainty is increasing within ESL Shipping‚Äôs main geographical market area. High rate of inflation  mainly driven by high energy prices caused by supply constraints owing to the war in Ukraine  is increasing the pressure on demand and pricing among the shipping company‚Äôs main customers. As usual  most of the shipping company‚Äôs transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements  which will continue to support ESL Shipping‚Äôs performance going forward. The shipping company‚Äôs investments in energy efficient vessels will also further strengthen its market position  as the dominant role of energy cost as a driver in supply chain efficiency continues.Spot market demand and spot market price level in the company‚Äôs main market area in Northern Europe have softened from the very high levels of first half-year 2022 but remain still at a satisfactory level in all vessel categories. Production volumes of ESL Shipping‚Äôs main clients are forecasted overall to continue on current levels with necessary access to key raw materials. Demand of energy shipments is expected to remain high. Clients in metal industry have however informed about production curtailments owing to maintenance breaks  high energy prices and decrease in their customer demand  which affect contract volumes already during the last quarter of 2022.After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  some of the shipping company‚Äôs significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers in new geographical areas for part of their required production input. This is expected to lengthen transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile especially for ESL Shipping‚Äôs larger vessels. Temporarily the share of energy coal is expected to increase in terms of ton miles  mainly due to longer transportation distance.The expectations of providers of chartered-in tonnage are not meeting the realities of the market  and this may create uncertainty to availability of suitable tonnage.Measures will continue to protect the personnel‚Äôs health security during the re-emergence of the coronavirus.The impact of energy price increases on ESL Shipping‚Äôs costs are effectively offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements. The shipping company is moderately increasing the fuel stock level onboard its ships in anticipation for eventual supply shortages during late 2022.During the fourth quarter  one larger vessel unit will be drydocked for a total of approximately 10 days due to unplanned maintenance. In total  there will be approximately 120 (229) dockage days in 2022. All vessels owned by ESL Shipping are now equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together.

Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.7-9/2022 7-9/2021 Change % 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 60.5 69.6 -13 208.2 195.2 7 Operating profit  MEUR 4.2 5.9 -29 15.0 16.0 -6 Operating profit  % 6.9 8.5 7.2 8.2 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.5 -4.5 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 3.7 5.9 -37 19.5 16.0 22 Comparable operating profit  % 6.1 8.5 9.4 8.2In the third quarter  Telko‚Äôs net sales declined by 13% to EUR 60.5 (69.6) million and its comparable operating profit decreased to EUR 3.7 (5.9) million. Telko‚Äôs comparable operating profit rate was 6.1% (8.5%). The comparable operating profit for the third quarter excludes items affecting comparability of EUR 0.5 million due to the decrease in credit loss provisions related to accounts receivables in Ukraine. Telko‚Äôs operating profit for the third quarter declined to EUR 4.2 (5.9) million.Telko‚Äôs net sales dropped significantly during the third quarter due to decreased sales in Russia  as EU imports were terminated and sanctioned products abandoned. Telko¬¥s sales outside of Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine continued to grow. During the last few years  Telko has consistently decreased the share of commodities and increased the share of specialty products and is therefore nowadays more resilient to price fluctuation than in the past.Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 20% during the third quarter  amounting to EUR 30.5 (38.1) million. The main driver for the decline was Telko¬¥s shrinking business in Russia. In Telko¬¥s European markets demand of plastic polymers remained in general on a normal level. Product availability has improved  although it is still not fully normalized. Price levels  particularly in volume plastics  declined significantly  whereas price levels have still developed positively for technical products. Overall  prices are still clearly above long-term average.Net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 22% to EUR 17.3 (22.2) million due to decreased sales in Russia. Overall price levels declined during the quarter but stabilized towards the end of the quarter. Increasing energy costs and other production costs prevented further price decline. In general  demand in western markets has softened slightly. In addition  demand of some customer segments has declined following export restrictions to Russia  impacting especially Finland and Latvia. Chemicals sales in Ukraine continued to recover reaching a 60-70% level in September  compared to the previous year‚Äôs levels.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 37% to EUR 12.7 (9.3) million. High price levels combined with the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021 were the most significant growth drivers. High demand especially for Industrial lubricants resulted in sales volume growth  whereas the automotive segment showed weaker performance. There were significant cost increases for raw materials  transportation  and product manufacturing.Telko‚Äôs net sales increased by 7% during January‚ÄìSeptember to EUR 208.2 (195.2) million. Telko‚Äôs comparable operating profit for the review period was EUR 19.5 (16.0) million  and its comparable operating profit rate was 9.4% (8.2%). The comparable operating profit of Telko Russia and Belarus was close to zero during the third quarter  and hence the absolute profit level of the third quarter is an indication of performance after the targeted exit of Telko Russia and Belarus  excluding the losses caused by the exits. Telko‚Äôs operating profit stood at EUR 15.0 (16.0) million for January‚ÄìSeptember 2022 and the operating profit rate was 7.2% (8.2%).Telko outlook for 2022Telko¬¥s net sales and operating profit are expected to decrease during the fourth quarter of the year compared with the fourth quarter last year  mainly due to the further decreasing sales in Russia. In western markets  sales are expected to remain on a relatively stable level  but the risk for rapid changes in demand and price level remains. In the current business environment  the market is unpredictable and rapid changes are possible even if they are not yet in sight.In October  Telko signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The completion of the transaction requires an approval of the Russian authorities. Telko¬¥s operations in Russia and Belarus will not have significant impact on Telko¬¥s comparable operating profit during the fourth quarter.Aspo announced on September 28 that Telko will acquire the business of Norwegian Johan Steenks AS. The transaction was completed on October 3. Johan Steenks is a distributor of engineering plastics and plastic additives with an established customer base in the Norwegian market and numerous well-known principals. The company's annual net sales are approximately 5 million euros. The acquisition will not have significant impact on Telko¬¥s sales or result during the last quarter of the year.Telko expects that prices will stabilize in volume and engineering plastics  due to the already high energy cost in Europe. Overall market demand is expected to remain stable in the last quarter.In chemicals  the energy costs will keep production costs and price levels relatively high  and further price decline is not expected. In Europe demand and price levels are expected to remain stable  and recovery in Ukraine is expected to continue. Solid growth is also expected to continue in Central Asia. Demand of several customer segments is slowing down in Finland and Baltics due to discontinued exports to Russia.In lubricants  the prices are expected to remain relatively stable towards the end of year. Base oil prices have stabilized and even declined in some markets  but prices of readymade lubricants may slightly increase due to higher energy cost in manufacturing and general inflation. In industrial lubricants demand may suffer from reduced production in the metal manufacturing sector due to high energy price level. The demand for automotive lubricants may soften in coming months as it is driven by consumer purchasing power. Long delivery times remain a challenge.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth  but also accelerated growth through acquisitions to achieve its strategic targets.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin‚Äôs other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Aspo announced on April 22  2022 that Leipurin will withdraw from its businesses in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan.

In regional business units  net sales in Finland grew by 15% and stood at EUR 12.3 (10.7) million. Net sales in the Baltic business unit increased by 18% and were EUR 9.4 (8.0) million. In business unit East  net sales were down by 18% due to the scaled-down assortment including only local sourcing and stood at EUR 6.2 (7.6) million. New business unit Sweden  established as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on 1 September  contributed to Leipurin‚Äôs third quarter net sales by EUR 4.4 million. Sales to bakeries was up by 18% in the third quarter at EUR 22.5 (19.0) million. Sales to food industry increased by 23% and were EUR 3.7 (3.0) million.Leipurin‚Äôs third quarter sales were significantly impacted by strong growth in global market prices of raw materials. Sales measured in kilograms showed a decline in Finland and the Baltic countries  whereas East decreased to around half of previous year‚Äôs level. The cost of living continued to increase significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand towards more affordable products. Volumes in Finland and Sweden were also impacted by increased international traveling during the vacation months. Despite the negative volume trend  positive margin development continued.Leipurin‚Äôs comparable operating profit for the third quarter was EUR 0.6 (0.6) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 1.9% (2.2%). Leipurin‚Äôs comparable operating profit excluding Vulganus was EUR 0.6 million (0.8) and comparable operating profit rate 1.9% (3.0%). Items reducing Leipurin‚Äôs operating profit and affecting comparability totaled EUR -1.1 million  including costs related to the acquisition of Kobia AB and costs related to the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin‚Äôs operating profit for the third quarter was EUR -0.5 million (0.6). The operating profit was negatively affected by a reversal of fair value adjustment of EUR -0.4 million recognized on inventory in the Kobia acquisition.Leipurin completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Swedish bakery industry distributor Kobia Ab from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia Ab constitutes Leipurin‚Äôs new market area Sweden  and it is included in Aspo Group‚Äôs financial statements from September 1  2022. In 2021  Kobia‚Äôs net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit margin was approximately 3%. Through the acquisition  Leipurin further strengthens its position as a leading player in the Baltic Sea region. The new entity provides suppliers with a compelling gateway to the region‚Äôs market. Customers in the bakery and food industry will benefit from a strong partner in the global raw material market.In January-September  Leipurin‚Äôs net sales increased by 10% and were in total EUR 89.3 (81.4) million.

On October 25  Miska Kuusela was appointed the new Managing Director of Leipurin and a member of the Group Executive Committee of Aspo Group. Kuusela will start in his position on January 2  2023. Aspo Group‚Äôs CEO Rolf Jansson will act as the interim Managing Director until Miska Kuusela starts in his role.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin‚Äôs net sales and financial results. The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23 percent of Leipurin‚Äôs total net sales in 2021.The expansion to Sweden by acquisition of Kobia AB will add annual net sales of around EUR 50 million to the Leipurin and generate significant synergies in assortment development  supply chain and sourcing  and particularly when being able to serve partners in a broader geographical area.Inflation and in particular increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more premium products and can cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment‚Äôs customers. The weakening of purchasing power can have a negative effect on the demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers direct their purchases to more affordable products.Prices of major raw material categories are expected to continue on a rising trend  although the very rapid inflation experienced during the review period should stabilize somewhat.Despite these challenges  we see that the market of Leipurin in longer-term offers very stable development and also organic growth opportunities in selected market segments.The impact of the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic continue to affect the global supply chains and the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times.Management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well so far. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group‚Äôs administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. In the third quarter  the operating profit of Other operations was EUR -0.9 (-2.8) million including items affecting comparability of EUR -0.1 million relating to restructuring. Thus  the comparable operating profit amounted to EUR -0.8 (-2.8) million. In January‚ÄìSeptember the operating profit was EUR -4.8 (-6.0) million  including items affecting comparability of EUR -0.6 million relating to additional share-based compensation granted to the former CEO of Aspo. Thus  the comparable operating profit amounted to EUR -4.2 (-6.0) million. In the comparative period  costs increased as a result of higher personnel costs  including the costs related to the change of the CEO that were not reported as items affecting comparability  and individual short-term projects.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

The acquisition expands Leipurin‚Äôs geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia‚Äôs net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit margin was approximately 3%. The acquisition of Kobia AB included also the properties owned by Kobia. Aspo actively explores options to sell and lease back the properties. The potential transaction is significantly affected by market conditions.The preliminary purchase price is EUR 15.6 million and it is paid in full in cash. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value at the acquisition date. A fair value allocation of EUR 9.0 million was made on the properties  a fair value allocation of EUR 0.6 million was made on the intangible assets based on customer relationships  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventory was EUR 0.5 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments amounted to EUR 2.1 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities were deemed to correspond to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 0.4 million resulted from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately one million euro were recognized in the Leipurin segment‚Äôs other operating expenses.Preliminary acquisition calculation of Kobia AB 9/2022 MEUR Consideration Paid in cash 15.6 Total consideration 15.6 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed  fair value Intangible assets 1.0 Tangible assets 12.9 Leased assets 0.3 Inventories 4.8 Accounts receivable and other receivables 5.0 Total assets 24.0 Interest bearing liabilities 1.2 Accounts payable and other liabilities 5.3 Deferred tax liability 2.2 Total liabilities 8.7 Net assets acquired 15.3 Goodwill 0.4Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for saleThe Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo in December 2021. Vulganus was sold on 30 June 2022 to a leading Austrian bakery machine manufacturer K√ñNIG Maschinen GmbH. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million are reported as part of the Leipurin segment‚Äôs figures and Aspo Group‚Äôs continuing operations.The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in group reporting in accordance with IFRS 5 standard  and its results and balance sheet items are reported separately from the continuing operations of Aspo Group. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. On the balance sheet  the assets of the Kauko operating segment are reported under ‚ÄúAssets held for sale‚Äù and liabilities under ‚ÄúLiabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale‚Äù. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period of September 2021 have not been restated.Profit from discontinued operations 7-9/2022 7-9/2021 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 2.3 3.4 8.4 9.9 13.1 Materials and services -1.8 -2.5 -6.3 -7.3 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.3 -0.4 -1.3 -1.3 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 -3.5 -1.3 -3.5 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 -0.1 Other operating expenses -0.4 -0.2 -1.1 -0.8 -1.2 Operating profit -0.2 -3.2 -1.6 -3.1 -3.0 Profit before taxes -0.2 -3.2 -1.6 -3.1 -3.0 Income taxes -0.1 Profit for the period -0.2 -3.2 -1.7 -3.1 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of Kauko operating segment  insofar as they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations during the third quarter is EUR 0.2 (0.2) million higher than the Kauko operating segment‚Äôs profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko‚Äôs goodwill in June 2022. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko‚Äôs goodwill in the third quarter of 2021. There is no goodwill left in the Kauko operating segment.Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 9/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 3.0 5.5 Other assets held for sale 2.9 Assets classified as held for sale  total 3.0 8.4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 2.1 4.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 1.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total 2.1 6.8Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations include the figures of the Kauko operating segment.

The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  excluding internal assets and liabilities which are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities have been measured at their carrying amount. For Kauko and Vulganus the recognition of depreciation ended at the time of classification as held for sale on December 1  2021.Net cash flows of discontinued operations 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net cash inflow from operating activities -0.4 0.3 0.4 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from investing activities 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from financing activities -1.6 -1.6 -1.6 Net change in cash generated by the discontinued operations -2.0 -1.3 -1.2Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Kauko operating segment‚Äôs share of Aspo Group‚Äôs cash flows.Restricted cashAspo Group has EUR 14.0 million cash and cash equivalent balances in Russia the use of which are strictly limited by the Russian government and controlled by the banks. During the third quarter of 2022 dividend and commercial payments have still been successful. Further  as to our knowledge the sales prices of the businesses to be sold are estimated to be transferrable in connection with the sale. However  there is a risk that the cash equivalent balances in Russia are not fully available for use by the Group going forward and therefore regarded as restricted cash under IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn September 28  Telko announced that it will acquire the business of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of engineering plastics and plastic additives  and the transaction was completed on October 3.On October 17  Telko signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The sales price is approximately EUR 9.5 million. The completion of the transaction requires an approval of the Russian authorities. Rights to Telko's name and trademarks are not included in the sale. As a result of the divestment  Aspo estimates that it will recognize a total expense of approximately EUR 9 million  including a write-down of the company‚Äôs net assets and also an impairment loss on Telko‚Äôs goodwill  as well as the transaction costs. In addition  based on the current exchange rate of the Russian ruble  an amount of approximately EUR 3 million would be recognized as an expense due to translation differences  which does not reduce the equity of the Group.On October 17  Aspo upgraded its financial guidance for full-year 2022 especially due to the better-than-estimated development of ESL Shipping and outlook for the rest of the year. Aspo‚Äôs new financial guidance for 2022 is: Aspo Group's comparable operating profit will be EUR 52‚Äì57 (EUR 42.4) million in 2022. Previous guidance for 2022  issued on June 14  2022  was: Aspo Group‚Äôs comparable operating profit will improve from previous year (EUR 42.4 million).On October 25  Miska Kuusela was appointed the new Managing Director of Leipurin and a member of the Group Executive Committee of Aspo Group. Kuusela will start in his position on January 2  2023.

Boosted by yet another record quarter of ESL Shipping and solid performance of Telko  our comparable operating profit for the quarter increased to EUR 13.0 million. Despite the expected sales drop in the Eastern market  our net sales were up 8% at EUR 160.1 million. Our comparable operating profit rate for Q3 remained strong at 8.1%  again above the target level of 8%. Overall  a great continuum to a financially successful year.We have continued making strides in our strategy execution. Leipurin‚Äôs milestone acquisition of the Swedish bakery distributor Kobia was approved by the competition authorities in the third quarter  and integration work is already underway. Kobia is included in Aspo Group‚Äôs financial reporting as of September  2022. Structural changes are negatively impacting Leipurin‚Äôs financial figures for 2022 but I am confident that the company is heading in the right direction with the renewed strategy.In September  Telko announced that it will strengthen its plastics distribution business by acquiring Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of engineering plastics and plastic additives with an established customer base in the local markets. Clear evidence of Telko‚Äôs ability to execute its accelerated growth strategy.During the quarter  ESL Shipping confirmed that it will establish a long-term shipping pool for energy efficient electric hybrid vessels together with a group of institutional and private investors. The upcoming Green Coaster pool will accelerate growth  profitability and return on capital of ESL Shipping's business  and fits seamlessly to Aspo‚Äôs renewed strategy.On October 17  we announced that Telko has signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. This is an important step  and I‚Äôm pleased that we have found a new owner for Telko's operations in Russia. This frees up time and resources to pursue further growth in western markets in accordance with our strategy. In line with what we have indicated before  the comparable operating profit of Telko Russia and Belarus was close to zero during the third quarter. Therefore  Telko‚Äôs Q3 results already give some visibility to the future financial performance of the company after the targeted exits of both Russia and Belarus have taken place. Telko's Russian business is classified as held for sale from the month of signing the agreement.Due to the excellent performance of ESL Shipping in particular  we upgraded our guidance for the full-year 2022 on October 17. We are now estimating that Aspo Group‚Äôs comparable operating profit for 2022 will be EUR 52‚Äì57 million  well above the EUR 42.4 million achieved last year. At the same time  our visibility to the overall costs related to the war in Ukraine and exiting our Russian operations  as well as other items affecting comparability has increased. As announced  the new estimate of the total items affecting comparability is approximately EUR -25 million. This estimate includes the items affecting comparability of EUR -8.0 million reported by the end of the third quarter of 2022.Our financial performance throughout the year has been solid and we remain confident on our short-term outlook. Macroeconomic uncertainty still remains and the foundations for moving into the next year differ substantially from a year ago. However  with the significant ongoing structural changes including exits from selected eastern markets and acquisitions in the western countries  we are in an excellent position to succeed in the fourth quarter 2022 and beyond. We continue our strategy execution during the coming years targeting both organic and non-organic growth especially in the western market.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:Net sales growth 5‚Äì10% per yearOperating profit of 8%Return on equity of over 20%Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo‚Äôs businesses  ESL Shipping‚Äôs operating profit target is 14%  Telko‚Äôs 8% and Leipurin‚Äôs 5%.Good financial performance continued in Q3 2022.

In addition  EUR -0.1 million restructuring costs were recognized in Other operations.The items affecting comparability in the second quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -2.4 million included costs related to restructuring of Russia-related operations of EUR -0.2 million for ESL Shipping  EUR -0.4 million for Telko  EUR -0.1 million for Leipurin  the impact of the divestment of Vulganus of EUR -0.4 million for Leipurin  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million on Kauko‚Äôs goodwill  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.The items affecting comparability in the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consisted of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping‚Äôs cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko‚Äôs warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko‚Äôs accounts receivables in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin‚Äôs warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin‚Äôs accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million in Leipurin‚Äôs other restructuring expenses in Russia. The operating result of other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo‚Äôs previous CEO.The items affecting comparability of 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin‚Äôs goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko‚Äôs terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko‚Äôs goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is an instrumental factor in guiding management of Aspo and in particular its investments. Aspo‚Äôs businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce emission intensity  CO2 (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) was 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. With regards to the green transition in shipping  ESL Shipping is in close  long-term project cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation to its key customers in the future.During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by net sales growth in combination with operational efficiency  and it was 0.34 (12/2021: 0.42). Another key target is to improve safety  and during the past 12 months  TRI (Total Recordable Injury Frequency) was 7.8 (12/2021: 8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.Operating environment and the impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo‚Äôs operationsAspo‚Äôs operating environment has changed dramatically during 2022 due to Russia‚Äôs armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused a lot of uncertainty in the market  price inflation and in particular higher energy prices  as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates. Disturbances in logistic flows and poor availability of certain products are also evident in the market.Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically weakens operating conditions in Eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values.All of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia have been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas. As announced on October 17  Aspo Group‚Äôs subsidiary Telko has signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. As previously announced  Telko will also exit Belarus. This process is still ongoing. Leipurin has decided to withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. The process is proceeding as planned and more details on the timetable and methods of implementation will be announced in due course. Telko‚Äôs and Leipurin‚Äôs combined net sales in these countries accounted for approximately 16% of Aspo Group's net sales in 2021.The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23% of Leipurin‚Äôs total net sales in 2021 and 4% of the net sales of Aspo Group. The net sales of Telko Russia and Belarus amounted to EUR 69.9 million in year 2021 which accounted for 26% of Telko‚Äôs total net sales in 2021 and 12% of the net sales of Aspo Group.The international sanctions and Russia‚Äôs legislative measures prevent transportation of goods and transfer of payments  reducing net sales and profitability of our Russian operations. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of Russian Group companies is EUR 25.1 million  corresponding to 15.3% of Aspo Group‚Äôs total equity. Aspo‚Äôs assets in Russia are mainly consisting of cash  inventories and trade receivables. The number of employees working for Aspo companies in Russia is decreasing  amounting to 114 employees at the end of September (12/2021: 193).Increasing interest rates and inflation  combined with declining general economic forecasts  have impacted consumers‚Äô buying patterns  including by shifting consumption from higher priced to lower priced products.In media  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  but its impact is still present in the operating environment. For example  global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on Aspo‚Äôs businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members of ESL Shipping‚Äôs vessels.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 7-9/2022 7-9/2021 Change 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 Change in share in share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 57.0 44.6 5.3 165.8 129.8 3.2 Scandinavia 38.1 24.8 7.0 99.0 77.2 2.0 Baltic countries 16.4 13.4 1.1 49.6 38.8 1.0 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 24.6 39.6 -11.8 96.6 111.3 -6.8 Other countries 21.7 22.2 -1.6 68.6 56.2 0.7 Total 157.8 144.6 479.6 413.3The Group‚Äôs main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in eastern markets continued to decrease during the third quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine and the decision to reduce operations in Russia and Belarus  and ultimately exit the market. On the positive side  particularly Telko‚Äôs sales in Ukraine have picked up during the past months  although they are still not on the same level as during the previous year. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will channel its growth investments into western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group‚Äôs cash flow from operating activities in January‚ÄìSeptember was EUR 45.7 (33.3) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -5.8 (-12.6) million. The increase in working capital derives mainly from ESL Shipping and is partly offset by the improved working capital of Telko. The advance payments for the Green Coasters to be sold further are one root cause for the increase in ESL Shipping‚Äôs inventory balance. Free cash flow during January-September was EUR 17.9 (23.4) million. Investments of EUR -15.2 (-11.1) million mainly consisted of docking of ESL Shipping‚Äôs vessels and Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the free cash flow includes the cash flow relating to the acquisition of Kobia and Mentum of EUR -15.6 million  and the cash inflow from the sale of Espa and Vulganus of EUR 3.0 million in total.9/2022 9/2021 12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 204.0 186.1 185.1 Cash and cash equivalents 43.7 23.7 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 160.3 162.4 167.4Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 160.3 million (12/2021: EUR 167.4)  and gearing fell to 97.6% (9/2021: 130.9%; 12/2021: 129.4%). The Group‚Äôs equity ratio at the end of the review period was 35.8% (9/2021: 31.8%; 12/2021: 32.0%). The balance sheet was strengthened as a result of improved profitability and a new hybrid bond issued in June.Net financial expenses in January‚ÄìSeptember totaled EUR -7.0 (-2.9) million. Exchange rate fluctuations  particularly strengthening of the Russian rouble  increased in financial expenses by EUR -4.0 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.8% (1.6%).The Group‚Äôs liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 43.7 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo‚Äôs EUR 80 million commercial paper program was also fully unused (9/2021: EUR 5 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).During the quarter  Aspo continued extending the maturity structure of interest-bearing liabilities. In September  AtoBatC Shipping signed EUR 32.2 million loan agreement with Svenska Skeppshypotek. The maturity of this loan is 15 years. Together with the EUR 20 million  10-year loan agreement signed with Nordic Investment Bank in June  these loans complete the financing of ESL Shipping‚Äôs investment in a series of six new  highly energy-efficient electric hybrid 5 350 dwt vessels  a project first announced in September 2021. In addition  Aspo refinanced a bilateral revolving credit facility of EUR 20 million  about to mature in 2023  with a new agreement which will mature in 2025. The RCF agreement also includes two one-year extension options.In June  Aspo issued a new hybrid bond of EUR 30 million. The coupon rate of the bond is 8.75% per annum. The bond has no maturity  but the company is entitled to redeem it in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo‚Äôs previous hybrid bond of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its businesses are exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which include but are not limited to the risks stated below.There is an increasing level of geopolitical uncertainty due to Russia's war in Ukraine. This affects the general economic environment  e.g. via inflation  interest rates  energy prices and prices of raw materials. Disturbances related to infrastructure may also occur as part of current uncertainties relating to Russia  for example due to cyber incidents or disruptions in information systems.The ongoing process of exiting Russia and other selected Eastern markets is changing the structure of the Group significantly and will affect earnings of Aspo businesses in the long run. There are risks that the market exits will cause additional costs or losses and repatriation of funds or exits will not succeed fully or partly. It is also possible that the exits will not receive the required authority approvals or will be jeopardized or fail for any other reason.Economic activity and current geopolitical uncertainties have caused prices of many raw materials  components  and logistics services to increase rapidly. Aspo may temporarily benefit from the price increases  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disturbances in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes  are also accumulating risks.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may affect Aspo‚Äôs businesses directly or indirectly. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct business damage  jeopardized payments and even suspend business operations.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its earnings via acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary weakening of the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The impact of the coronavirus on Aspo‚Äôs business has been limited on Group level  although the impact on Leipurin has been significant. Current and any new variants of the coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses through interruptions in global logistics flows  among other things.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they include significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO‚ÄôS BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading carrier of dry bulk cargo in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping‚Äôs operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company‚Äôs fleet consisted of 47 vessels with a total capacity of 451 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75.3% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2.3%) and the remaining 22 vessels (22.4%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping‚Äôs competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean carriers at sea as a special service.7-9/2022 7-9/2021 Change % 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 65.0 47.3 37 182.1 136.7 33 Operating profit  MEUR 9.7 7.1 37 27.9 17.0 64 Operating profit  % 14.9 15.0 15.3 12.4 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 9.7 7.1 37 26.8 17.0 58 Comparable operating profit  % 14.9 15.0 14.7 12.4The third quarter of 2022 displayed the strongest third quarter operating result in ESL Shipping‚Äôs history. Net sales increased by 37% from last year to EUR 65.0 (47.3) million. During the quarter  the operating profit increased by 37 % to a record-high level of EUR 9.7 (7.1) million. During the third quarter there were no items affecting comparability in operating profit.The strong result was driven by the shipping company‚Äôs partnership strategy and the operational success delivered by the entire personnel. The operating profit rate of 14.9% (15.0%) achieved during the third quarter was excellent  especially considering the more modest market conditions and the historical change of abandoning cargo flows from Russia as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and resulted sanctions. The target level of 14.0% operating profit was again exceeded.During the third quarter  price of diesel oil and especially price of LNG used as a ship fuel were significantly higher than in the comparative period last year. The current level of very high fuel surcharges continued to increase net sales and reduced the operating profit percentage rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability.During the review period  the volume of cargo transported by the shipping company decreased slightly from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.9) million tons. The main drivers behind the volume development were re-routing of raw material supply out of Russia  which continued to result in increased transportation distances  and heavy congestion in certain major contract traffic ports. ESL Shipping has no remaining transport obligations related to cargo operations from Russian ports or with customers and cargo closely related to Russia.The profitability of ESL Shipping‚Äôs all vessel categories remained strong during the third quarter. In contract traffic  demand for ton miles remained strong throughout the review period despite slightly lower volumes  and spot market freight rates were at a satisfying level in all customer segments and vessel categories. Towards the end of the period spot market rates softened and demand showed some symptoms of slowing down  with the clear exception of the energy industry  where the demand continued strong.During the third quarter  ESL Shipping achieved a major strategic and structural milestone as it established a long-term Green Coaster pool for energy efficient electric hybrid vessels together with a group of institutional and private investors. A pooling structure is a model commonly used in the international shipping business for the ownership and operation of vessels. The forthcoming Green Coaster pool will accelerate the growth  profitability and return on capital of ESL Shipping's business. The pool will also form the first phase of the shipping company‚Äôs new low-carbon growth strategy that utilizes investor funding and pooling structure.Resulting from the established pool structure  ESL Shipping‚Äôs subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping declared options and ordered five additional vessels from the Indian shipyard Chowgule & Company Private Limited  from which the shipping company has previously ordered seven identical electric hybrid vessels. Of the series of twelve new-generation electric hybrid vessels  every other vessel will be sold to a company formed by a group of investors. As previously announced  the total amount of ESL Shipping's own investment will remain at the size of six vessels and approximately EUR 70 million.The first three of the new vessels are already under construction  and the planned delivery of the first vessel is scheduled for the autumn 2023. The planned delivery of the last vessel is scheduled for the second quarter of 2026. AtoBatC Shipping will act as the manager of the pool and all vessels in the pool will be placed as part of the shipping company's existing and growing contract traffic. The investor company is offered complete services related to the construction and maintenance of the vessels on a turnkey basis.ESL Shipping‚Äôs long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. One of the measures implemented together with a key client is to optimize a vessel‚Äôs speed with Virtual Arrival procedure  which has reduced emissions on the applied voyages on average by 24% in the past twelve months. Discussions are ongoing to extend the procedure for other trade lines and clients.The scheduled drydockings of the current fleet continued with 63 (116) docking days during the third quarter.The net sales of ESL Shipping in January‚ÄìSeptember increased significantly by 33% from the comparative period  amounting to EUR 182.1 (136.7) million. The comparable operating profit increased to EUR 26.8 (17.0) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 14.7% (12.4%).ESL Shipping outlook for 2022The overall macroeconomic uncertainty is increasing within ESL Shipping‚Äôs main geographical market area. High rate of inflation  mainly driven by high energy prices caused by supply constraints owing to the war in Ukraine  is increasing the pressure on demand and pricing among the shipping company‚Äôs main customers. As usual  most of the shipping company‚Äôs transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements  which will continue to support ESL Shipping‚Äôs performance going forward. The shipping company‚Äôs investments in energy efficient vessels will also further strengthen its market position  as the dominant role of energy cost as a driver in supply chain efficiency continues.Spot market demand and spot market price level in the company‚Äôs main market area in Northern Europe have softened from the very high levels of first half-year 2022 but remain still at a satisfactory level in all vessel categories. Production volumes of ESL Shipping‚Äôs main clients are forecasted overall to continue on current levels with necessary access to key raw materials. Demand of energy shipments is expected to remain high. Clients in metal industry have however informed about production curtailments owing to maintenance breaks  high energy prices and decrease in their customer demand  which affect contract volumes already during the last quarter of 2022.After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  some of the shipping company‚Äôs significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers in new geographical areas for part of their required production input. This is expected to lengthen transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile especially for ESL Shipping‚Äôs larger vessels. Temporarily the share of energy coal is expected to increase in terms of ton miles  mainly due to longer transportation distance.The expectations of providers of chartered-in tonnage are not meeting the realities of the market  and this may create uncertainty to availability of suitable tonnage.Measures will continue to protect the personnel‚Äôs health security during the re-emergence of the coronavirus.The impact of energy price increases on ESL Shipping‚Äôs costs are effectively offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements. The shipping company is moderately increasing the fuel stock level onboard its ships in anticipation for eventual supply shortages during late 2022.During the fourth quarter  one larger vessel unit will be drydocked for a total of approximately 10 days due to unplanned maintenance. In total  there will be approximately 120 (229) dockage days in 2022. All vessels owned by ESL Shipping are now equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together.

Telko‚Äôs comparable operating profit rate was 6.1% (8.5%). The comparable operating profit for the third quarter excludes items affecting comparability of EUR 0.5 million due to the decrease in credit loss provisions related to accounts receivables in Ukraine. Telko‚Äôs operating profit for the third quarter declined to EUR 4.2 (5.9) million.Telko‚Äôs net sales dropped significantly during the third quarter due to decreased sales in Russia  as EU imports were terminated and sanctioned products abandoned. Telko¬¥s sales outside of Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine continued to grow. During the last few years  Telko has consistently decreased the share of commodities and increased the share of specialty products and is therefore nowadays more resilient to price fluctuation than in the past.Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 20% during the third quarter  amounting to EUR 30.5 (38.1) million. The main driver for the decline was Telko¬¥s shrinking business in Russia. In Telko¬¥s European markets demand of plastic polymers remained in general on a normal level. Product availability has improved  although it is still not fully normalized. Price levels  particularly in volume plastics  declined significantly  whereas price levels have still developed positively for technical products. Overall  prices are still clearly above long-term average.Net sales of the chemicals business decreased by 22% to EUR 17.3 (22.2) million due to decreased sales in Russia. Overall price levels declined during the quarter but stabilized towards the end of the quarter. Increasing energy costs and other production costs prevented further price decline. In general  demand in western markets has softened slightly. In addition  demand of some customer segments has declined following export restrictions to Russia  impacting especially Finland and Latvia. Chemicals sales in Ukraine continued to recover reaching a 60-70% level in September  compared to the previous year‚Äôs levels.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 37% to EUR 12.7 (9.3) million. High price levels combined with the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021 were the most significant growth drivers. High demand especially for Industrial lubricants resulted in sales volume growth  whereas the automotive segment showed weaker performance. There were significant cost increases for raw materials  transportation  and product manufacturing.Telko‚Äôs net sales increased by 7% during January‚ÄìSeptember to EUR 208.2 (195.2) million. Telko‚Äôs comparable operating profit for the review period was EUR 19.5 (16.0) million  and its comparable operating profit rate was 9.4% (8.2%). The comparable operating profit of Telko Russia and Belarus was close to zero during the third quarter  and hence the absolute profit level of the third quarter is an indication of performance after the targeted exit of Telko Russia and Belarus  excluding the losses caused by the exits. Telko‚Äôs operating profit stood at EUR 15.0 (16.0) million for January‚ÄìSeptember 2022 and the operating profit rate was 7.2% (8.2%).Telko outlook for 2022Telko¬¥s net sales and operating profit are expected to decrease during the fourth quarter of the year compared with the fourth quarter last year  mainly due to the further decreasing sales in Russia. In western markets  sales are expected to remain on a relatively stable level  but the risk for rapid changes in demand and price level remains. In the current business environment  the market is unpredictable and rapid changes are possible even if they are not yet in sight.In October  Telko signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The completion of the transaction requires an approval of the Russian authorities. Telko¬¥s operations in Russia and Belarus will not have significant impact on Telko¬¥s comparable operating profit during the fourth quarter.Aspo announced on September 28 that Telko will acquire the business of Norwegian Johan Steenks AS. The transaction was completed on October 3. Johan Steenks is a distributor of engineering plastics and plastic additives with an established customer base in the Norwegian market and numerous well-known principals. The company's annual net sales are approximately 5 million euros. The acquisition will not have significant impact on Telko¬¥s sales or result during the last quarter of the year.Telko expects that prices will stabilize in volume and engineering plastics  due to the already high energy cost in Europe. Overall market demand is expected to remain stable in the last quarter.In chemicals  the energy costs will keep production costs and price levels relatively high  and further price decline is not expected. In Europe demand and price levels are expected to remain stable  and recovery in Ukraine is expected to continue. Solid growth is also expected to continue in Central Asia. Demand of several customer segments is slowing down in Finland and Baltics due to discontinued exports to Russia.In lubricants  the prices are expected to remain relatively stable towards the end of year. Base oil prices have stabilized and even declined in some markets  but prices of readymade lubricants may slightly increase due to higher energy cost in manufacturing and general inflation. In industrial lubricants demand may suffer from reduced production in the metal manufacturing sector due to high energy price level. The demand for automotive lubricants may soften in coming months as it is driven by consumer purchasing power. Long delivery times remain a challenge.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth  but also accelerated growth through acquisitions to achieve its strategic targets.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in nine countries that have been grouped into four regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  Sweden  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin‚Äôs other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Aspo announced on April 22  2022 that Leipurin will withdraw from its businesses in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan.

New business unit Sweden  established as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on 1 September  contributed to Leipurin‚Äôs third quarter net sales by EUR 4.4 million. Sales to bakeries was up by 18% in the third quarter at EUR 22.5 (19.0) million. Sales to food industry increased by 23% and were EUR 3.7 (3.0) million.Leipurin‚Äôs third quarter sales were significantly impacted by strong growth in global market prices of raw materials. Sales measured in kilograms showed a decline in Finland and the Baltic countries  whereas East decreased to around half of previous year‚Äôs level. The cost of living continued to increase significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand towards more affordable products. Volumes in Finland and Sweden were also impacted by increased international traveling during the vacation months. Despite the negative volume trend  positive margin development continued.Leipurin‚Äôs comparable operating profit for the third quarter was EUR 0.6 (0.6) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 1.9% (2.2%). Leipurin‚Äôs comparable operating profit excluding Vulganus was EUR 0.6 million (0.8) and comparable operating profit rate 1.9% (3.0%). Items reducing Leipurin‚Äôs operating profit and affecting comparability totaled EUR -1.1 million  including costs related to the acquisition of Kobia AB and costs related to the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin‚Äôs operating profit for the third quarter was EUR -0.5 million (0.6). The operating profit was negatively affected by a reversal of fair value adjustment of EUR -0.4 million recognized on inventory in the Kobia acquisition.Leipurin completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Swedish bakery industry distributor Kobia Ab from the Swedish Abdon Group. Kobia Ab constitutes Leipurin‚Äôs new market area Sweden  and it is included in Aspo Group‚Äôs financial statements from September 1  2022. In 2021  Kobia‚Äôs net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit margin was approximately 3%. Through the acquisition  Leipurin further strengthens its position as a leading player in the Baltic Sea region. The new entity provides suppliers with a compelling gateway to the region‚Äôs market. Customers in the bakery and food industry will benefit from a strong partner in the global raw material market.In January-September  Leipurin‚Äôs net sales increased by 10% and were in total EUR 89.3 (81.4) million. The comparative figures for 2021 include significant machinery sales in Russia  and the year-on-year growth in raw materials was very strong. Net sales in business unit Finland grew by 18% and stood at EUR 34.3 (29.1) million. Net sales in the Baltic business unit increased by 21% and were EUR 26.8 (22.1) million. In the business unit East  net sales decreased by 10% and were EUR 19.4 (21.6) million. Sales to bakeries increased by 13% in January-September and were EUR 59.3 (52.5) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 22% and stood at EUR 10.0 (8.2) million. The euro-denominated increase in sales was significantly impacted by strong growth in global market prices of raw materials. In Finland and Baltics combined  the volumes in kilograms were above pre-pandemic 2019 levels.Leipurin‚Äôs comparable operating profit for January-September 2022 was EUR 2.2 (1.2) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.5%). Net sales of Vulganus were EUR 4.3 (3.3) million and the operating profit was EUR -0.8 (-0.3) million. Leipurin‚Äôs comparable operating profit excluding Vulganus was EUR 3.0 (1.5) million and comparable operating profit rate 3.5% (2.0%).Vulganus was divested on June 30  2022. The divestment loss and related transaction costs of EUR -0.4 million are reported as part of the Leipurin segment‚Äôs figures in other operating expenses.The profit management program launched during the second quarter of 2021 will develop the organization‚Äôs capability of information-based management and particularly help to improve the commercial performance. The program includes both targeting selected growth clusters and improving efficiency of operations. The implementation of the program was particularly reflected on the positive development of results in Finland and the Baltic countries.Heli Arantola resigned in June to join another company. Arantola left the position of Leipurin‚Äôs Managing Director in the end of September. On October 25  Miska Kuusela was appointed the new Managing Director of Leipurin and a member of the Group Executive Committee of Aspo Group. Kuusela will start in his position on January 2  2023. Aspo Group‚Äôs CEO Rolf Jansson will act as the interim Managing Director until Miska Kuusela starts in his role.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin‚Äôs net sales and financial results. The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23 percent of Leipurin‚Äôs total net sales in 2021.The expansion to Sweden by acquisition of Kobia AB will add annual net sales of around EUR 50 million to the Leipurin and generate significant synergies in assortment development  supply chain and sourcing  and particularly when being able to serve partners in a broader geographical area.Inflation and in particular increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more premium products and can cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment‚Äôs customers. The weakening of purchasing power can have a negative effect on the demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers direct their purchases to more affordable products.Prices of major raw material categories are expected to continue on a rising trend  although the very rapid inflation experienced during the review period should stabilize somewhat.Despite these challenges  we see that the market of Leipurin in longer-term offers very stable development and also organic growth opportunities in selected market segments.The impact of the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic continue to affect the global supply chains and the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times.Management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well so far. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group‚Äôs administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. In the third quarter  the operating profit of Other operations was EUR -0.9 (-2.8) million including items affecting comparability of EUR -0.1 million relating to restructuring. Thus  the comparable operating profit amounted to EUR -0.8 (-2.8) million. In January‚ÄìSeptember the operating profit was EUR -4.8 (-6.0) million  including items affecting comparability of EUR -0.6 million relating to additional share-based compensation granted to the former CEO of Aspo. Thus  the comparable operating profit amounted to EUR -4.2 (-6.0) million. In the comparative period  costs increased as a result of higher personnel costs  including the costs related to the change of the CEO that were not reported as items affecting comparability  and individual short-term projects.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

The acquisition expands Leipurin‚Äôs geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia‚Äôs net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit margin was approximately 3%. The acquisition of Kobia AB included also the properties owned by Kobia. Aspo actively explores options to sell and lease back the properties. The potential transaction is significantly affected by market conditions.The preliminary purchase price is EUR 15.6 million and it is paid in full in cash. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value at the acquisition date. A fair value allocation of EUR 9.0 million was made on the properties  a fair value allocation of EUR 0.6 million was made on the intangible assets based on customer relationships  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventory was EUR 0.5 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments amounted to EUR 2.1 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities were deemed to correspond to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 0.4 million resulted from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately one million euro were recognized in the Leipurin segment‚Äôs other operating expenses.Preliminary acquisition calculation of Kobia AB 9/2022 MEUR Consideration Paid in cash 15.6 Total consideration 15.6 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed  fair value Intangible assets 1.0 Tangible assets 12.9 Leased assets 0.3 Inventories 4.8 Accounts receivable and other receivables 5.0 Total assets 24.0 Interest bearing liabilities 1.2 Accounts payable and other liabilities 5.3 Deferred tax liability 2.2 Total liabilities 8.7 Net assets acquired 15.3 Goodwill 0.4Discontinued operations and other non-current assets and disposal groups held for saleThe Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo in December 2021. Vulganus was sold on 30 June 2022 to a leading Austrian bakery machine manufacturer K√ñNIG Maschinen GmbH. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million are reported as part of the Leipurin segment‚Äôs figures and Aspo Group‚Äôs continuing operations.The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in group reporting in accordance with IFRS 5 standard  and its results and balance sheet items are reported separately from the continuing operations of Aspo Group. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. On the balance sheet  the assets of the Kauko operating segment are reported under ‚ÄúAssets held for sale‚Äù and liabilities under ‚ÄúLiabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale‚Äù. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period of September 2021 have not been restated.Profit from discontinued operations 7-9/2022 7-9/2021 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 2.3 3.4 8.4 9.9 13.1 Materials and services -1.8 -2.5 -6.3 -7.3 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.3 -0.4 -1.3 -1.3 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 -3.5 -1.3 -3.5 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 -0.1 Other operating expenses -0.4 -0.2 -1.1 -0.8 -1.2 Operating profit -0.2 -3.2 -1.6 -3.1 -3.0 Profit before taxes -0.2 -3.2 -1.6 -3.1 -3.0 Income taxes -0.1 Profit for the period -0.2 -3.2 -1.7 -3.1 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of Kauko operating segment  insofar as they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations during the third quarter is EUR 0.2 (0.2) million higher than the Kauko operating segment‚Äôs profit. An impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million was recognized on Kauko‚Äôs goodwill in June 2022. An impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million was recognized on Kauko‚Äôs goodwill in the third quarter of 2021. There is no goodwill left in the Kauko operating segment.Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 9/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 3.0 5.5 Other assets held for sale 2.9 Assets classified as held for sale  total 3.0 8.4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 2.1 4.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 1.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total 2.1 6.8Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations include the figures of the Kauko operating segment. The other assets held for sale with associated liabilities at the end of year 2021 pertain to Vulganus Oy. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  excluding internal assets and liabilities which are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities have been measured at their carrying amount. For Kauko and Vulganus the recognition of depreciation ended at the time of classification as held for sale on December 1  2021.Net cash flows of discontinued operations 1-9/2022 1-9/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net cash inflow from operating activities -0.4 0.3 0.4 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from investing activities 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net cash inflowithoutflow(-) from financing activities -1.6 -1.6 -1.6 Net change in cash generated by the discontinued operations -2.0 -1.3 -1.2Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Kauko operating segment‚Äôs share of Aspo Group‚Äôs cash flows.Restricted cashAspo Group has EUR 14.0 million cash and cash equivalent balances in Russia the use of which are strictly limited by the Russian government and controlled by the banks. During the third quarter of 2022 dividend and commercial payments have still been successful. Further  as to our knowledge the sales prices of the businesses to be sold are estimated to be transferrable in connection with the sale. However  there is a risk that the cash equivalent balances in Russia are not fully available for use by the Group going forward and therefore regarded as restricted cash under IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn September 28  Telko announced that it will acquire the business of Johan Steenks  a Norwegian distributor of engineering plastics and plastic additives  and the transaction was completed on October 3.On October 17  Telko signed a binding framework agreement according to which it will sell the share capital of its Russian subsidiary Telko OOO to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The sales price is approximately EUR 9.5 million. The completion of the transaction requires an approval of the Russian authorities. Rights to Telko's name and trademarks are not included in the sale. As a result of the divestment  Aspo estimates that it will recognize a total expense of approximately EUR 9 million  including a write-down of the company‚Äôs net assets and also an impairment loss on Telko‚Äôs goodwill  as well as the transaction costs. In addition  based on the current exchange rate of the Russian ruble  an amount of approximately EUR 3 million would be recognized as an expense due to translation differences  which does not reduce the equity of the Group.On October 17  Aspo upgraded its financial guidance for full-year 2022 especially due to the better-than-estimated development of ESL Shipping and outlook for the rest of the year. Aspo‚Äôs new financial guidance for 2022 is: Aspo Group's comparable operating profit will be EUR 52‚Äì57 (EUR 42.4) million in 2022. Previous guidance for 2022  issued on June 14  2022  was: Aspo Group‚Äôs comparable operating profit will improve from previous year (EUR 42.4 million).On October 25  Miska Kuusela was appointed the new Managing Director of Leipurin and a member of the Group Executive Committee of Aspo Group. Kuusela will start in his position on January 2  2023.

Mohamed M‚ÄôRabti  director and deputy head ...,Latest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison toolsThe launch of a suite of DWS cross-listed exchange traded funds in Hong Kong and Singapore could be game changing for Asian investors  market participants say  offering the prospect of reduced costs and more choice.The excitement in the industry does not revolve around the funds themselves ‚Äî which  apart from one MSCI USA swap Ucits ETF  offer Hong Kong and Singapore investors more exposure in Asian markets albeit via Ucits ETFs ‚Äî but instead over the way settlement and clearing will be handled.The cross-listed DWS ETFs will use Euroclear Bank‚Äôs centralised clearing for cross-border securities  the international central securities depository system  which has already transformed ETF trading in Europe.Mohamed M‚ÄôRabti  director and deputy head of capital markets at Euroclear  said it used to take four to six days to move ETF shares from Europe to Hong Kong and Singapore  massively increasing the usual spread market makers were able to quote on bid-offer prices for cross-listed ETFs. ‚ÄúNow with the ICSD we have removed many frictions.‚ÄùM‚ÄôRabti pointed to the success of ICSD in Europe  where he said more than 65 per cent of ETFs were using the international settlement system  and Mexico  where ICSD had facilitated the cross-listing of 330 European ETFs  adding that he expected more markets to adopt the system. Tel Aviv‚Äôs stock exchange is also a member of the ICSD.‚ÄúWith the ICSD  any local Asian exchange participants that have access to ICSD would have the ability to transfer shares to and from the Hong Kong and Singapore exchange versus the need to rely on [certain local] authorised participants to create units  which was the case previously ‚Äù said Keshava Shastry  global head of capital markets for DWS.In addition  he said  it was possible  within certain parameters  for the transfer of settled shares between Europe and Hong Kong and Singapore to happen on the same day.As well as improved liquidity  the centralised system is also expected to result in reduced spreads and therefore  ultimately  lower costs for investors.The ICSD system could also encourage greater institutional interest because it has  for example  fewer restrictions on order size  according to DWS.Serene Cai  head of securities trading at SGX  said part of the appeal of the link-up with Euroclear was that it made it easier for investors to access Ucits funds.Ucits ETFs not only offer a regulatory framework that has gained recognition outside Europe  but those with significant exposure to US equities have also gained favour with investors because they can offer tax advantages for overseas investors over their US-domiciled counterparts.‚ÄúWe expect more fruitful conversations with international ETF issuers  with the ICSD model. We have been in touch with a number of issuers that are interested in cross-listing their ETF in Hong Kong through the ICSD model ‚Äù said Brian Roberts  head of exchange traded products at HKEX.Click here to visit the ETF Hub,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.6,0.4,0.0,True,English,"['Asian ETF cross-listings', 'frictions', 'one MSCI USA swap Ucits ETF', 'international central securities depository system', 'four to six days', 'certain local] authorised participants', 'usual spread market makers', 'local Asian exchange participants', 'greater institutional interest', 'international settlement system', 'international ETF issuers', 'Mohamed M‚ÄôRabti', 'market participants', 'cross-border securities', 'securities trading', 'Ucits ETFs', 'centralised system', 'ETF Hub', 'ETF trading', 'Ucits funds', 'Asian markets', 'stock exchange', 'Asian investors', 'Latest news', 'depth data', 'comparison tools', 'Hong Kong', 'reduced costs', 'bid-offer prices', 'many frictions', '65 per cent', 'Tel Aviv', 'Keshava Shastry', 'same day', 'reduced spreads', 'lower costs', 'fewer restrictions', 'order size', 'Serene Cai', 'regulatory framework', 'US equities', 'tax advantages', 'US-domiciled counterparts', 'fruitful conversations', 'Brian Roberts', 'ICSD system', 'ETF shares', 'capital markets', 'listed ETFs', '330 European ETFs', 'Singapore exchange', 'centralised clearing', 'deputy head', 'global head', 'significant exposure', 'overseas investors', 'Euroclear Bank', 'ICSD model', 'DWS ETFs', 'Singapore investors', 'launch', 'suite', 'prospect', 'choice', 'excitement', 'industry', 'way', 'director', 'success', 'Mexico', 'cross-listing', 'member', 'access', 'ability', 'need', 'units', 'case', 'addition', 'parameters', 'transfer', 'liquidity', 'The', 'example', 'SGX', 'appeal', 'link-up', 'recognition', 'favour', 'touch', 'number', 'products', 'HKEX']",2022-11-03,2022-11-03,ft.com

Resolution regarding the guidelines for remuneration to senior executivesThe Board of SkiStar AB (publ) recommends that the Annual General Meeting adopt the following guidelines for remuneration of senior executives. The guidelines apply until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting and are valid for a maximum of four years.ScopeThe guidelines below include the Board of Directors (as applicable)  the CEO and other members of Group management  hereinafter referred to as senior executives. The guidelines are applicable to remuneration under new agreements and amendments to remuneration already agreed after adoption of the new guidelines by the AGM. The guidelines do not apply to remuneration decided on by the general meeting.The guidelines‚Äô promotion of the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilitySkiStar‚Äôs vision is to create memorable mountain experiences. As a listed company  SkiStar aims to create value for the Company‚Äôs shareholders and promote long-term sustainability in all operations. For further information about SkiStar‚Äôs strategy  long-term interests  including financial and operational targets  and sustainability work  see www.skistar.com/en/corporate and the annual report  which will be available at the same web address no later than three weeks prior to the AGM.Successful implementation of the Company‚Äôs business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including sustainability  are contingent on the Company having qualified employees. SkiStar must therefore be able to offer competitive remuneration. The Company‚Äôs remuneration structure in accordance with these guidelines mustcontribute to a consensus between senior executives and shareholders in terms of the long-term perspective of the operations  including promotion of the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability;ensure that senior executives receive remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  enabling the Company to recruit  motivate and retain competent employees;require senior executives‚Äô compliance with the Company‚Äôs code of conduct  policies and directives; andoffer a salary based on the Company‚Äôs financial targets and senior executives‚Äô individual responsibility  competence  performance  duties  experience and position.Variable remuneration covered by these guidelines should aim to promote the Company‚Äôs business strategy and long-term interests  including sustainability.Remuneration and forms of remunerationThe total compensation for senior executives must be reviewed regularly  and at least annually  to ensure that it is market-based. To create well-balanced total compensation that strengthens both short and long-term performance management and target achievement  remuneration may include the following components: fixed cash salary  variable remuneration/bonuses including undertaking to acquire shares  pension benefits and other benefits.Fixed cash salarySenior executives are to be offered a fixed cash salary that is individualised and market-based in relation to responsibility  competence  performance and regional salary levels. The fixed salary is to be determined annually  to apply during the period September to August.Variable remuneration/bonus including undertaking to acquire sharesSenior executives may receive variable cash remuneration/bonuses  based on the current bonus programme for SkiStar‚Äôs senior executives as decided by the Board for each financial year. Bonuses must be related to measurable criteria defined by the Board  which may be financial or non-financial  qualitative or quantitative  and must be based on factors that support SkiStar‚Äôs business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by having a clear link to value creation  committed long-term ownership and SkiStar‚Äôs development. The criteria may  for example  relate to the Company‚Äôs performance on earnings per share  return on equity  operating margin and organic growth  measured for each financial year. If the Board considers that the business strategy and the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  would be better promoted if the criteria were supplemented or changed  these guidelines allow such changes to be made.The bonus to the CEO may amount to a maximum of 80 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary  which consequently is the bonus cap for the CEO. Bonuses to other senior executives may amount to a maximum of 60 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary  which consequently is the bonus cap for these executives.The level of fulfilment of the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration is to be determined at the end of the measurement period. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the CEO‚Äôs variable cash remuneration assessment. Where the assessment of target achievement is concerned  the CEO is responsible for the assessment in relation to other senior executives‚Äô variable cash remuneration. Financial targets shall be based on the most recent financial report published by the Company.Should it be established that the criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration have not been met in whole or in part  the Board of Directors has the possibility to decide that variable remuneration is nevertheless to be paid to senior executives on an individual basis in extraordinary circumstances  up to an amount not exceeding half of the bonus cap  i.e. a maximum of 40 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary for the CEO  and a maximum of 30 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary for other senior executives. Such extraordinary arrangements are only to be applied either for the purpose of recruitment or retention  or as remuneration for extraordinary work in addition to the person‚Äôs regular duties. Decisions on such remuneration are to be taken by the Board of Directors  for both the CEO and other senior executives  on the proposal of the Remuneration Committee. Variable remuneration is paid in October of the year after it was earned.Under an agreement with the Company  senior executives who receive bonuses must undertake to acquire shares in the Company for long-term ownership (a period of at least three years)  investing at least 1/3 of their post-tax bonuses. The purchase price paid for any SkiStar shares acquired by a senior executive during a given vesting year may be included in the amount that the executive has committed to invest in SkiStar shares if a bonus is received for that vesting year. The purpose is to create involvement and engagement by offering senior executives the opportunity to become shareholders in a structured way. Through the criteria that determine the outcome as described above  incentives are created for senior executives to contribute to realisation of the Company‚Äôs business strategy and safeguarding of the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  and therefore long-term value creation.If a senior executive contravenes the above conditions by  for example  prematurely selling shares acquired under said conditions  the senior executive must  in accordance with the agreement with the Company  be required to repay the full amount (including income tax but not social security contributions) paid for the shares acquired.Pension benefitsSenior executives are entitled to pension arrangements under collective agreements and agreements with SkiStar AB. All pension obligations are defined-contribution plans. For the CEO  the Company pays pension contributions corresponding to 30 percent of the pensionable salary. For other senior executives  pension payments are made according to the standard ITP plan. Salary waivers may be used for increased pension provisions through one-time pension premium payments under salary and bonus sacrifice arrangements. The retirement age for senior executives who are Swedish citizens is 65. For others  it is as specified in their own country‚Äôs pension rules.Car benefitsSenior executives may be offered car benefits.Other benefitsSenior executives may be entitled to other benefits such as health insurance as well as the benefits available to other SkiStar employees. The total value of these benefits may not exceed five percent of a senior executive‚Äôs fixed cash salary.In addition  the CEO may be entitled to private travel between home and work (including air travel)  an official residence in Stockholm including cleaning allowance for the residence  tax return assistance and supplementary health insurance in addition to collectively agreed health insurance. The total value of these benefits may not exceed ten percent of the CEO‚Äôs fixed cash salary.OtherEmployment conditions for senior executives who are subject to rules other than Swedish rules on pension and other benefits may be duly adjusted to ensure compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines as far as possible.Period of notice and termination benefitsThe maximum period of notice is initially 12 months for termination of employment initiated by SkiStar and six months for termination by the senior executive. Termination benefits shall only be paid when termination of employment is initiated by the Company. Termination benefits shall only to be paid up to the date on which the individual in question obtains other employment. Termination benefits are calculated on the fixed cash salary and are not pensionable. Total fixed salary during the period of notice and any termination benefits must not exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed salary for 24 months.Decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board‚Äôs Remuneration Committee is responsible for annually reviewing the need to revise the guidelines prior to the Board‚Äôs proposal to the AGM (if applicable) for adoption. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and present it to the AGM for resolution. The guidelines shall be valid until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration for senior executives  the application of guidelines for remuneration of senior executives and applicable remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the Company. The Board makes decisions on the salary and other terms of employment for the CEO on the basis of proposals from the Remuneration Committee. The CEO makes decisions on the salary and other terms of employment for other senior executives and consults with the Remuneration Committee on these matters. Decisions on possible variable remuneration in extraordinary circumstances are  however  made by the Board for the CEO as well as for other senior executives on the basis of proposals from the Remuneration Committee. The CEO and other senior executives are not present when the Board and the Remuneration Committee consider and make decisions on remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by these matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board may  following a proposal from the Remuneration Committee  decide to make a temporary derogation from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if there are particular reasons to do so in an individual case and such derogation is necessary in order to serve the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  or to ensure the Company‚Äôs financial viability. As stated above  the Remuneration Committee‚Äôs tasks include preparation of the Board‚Äôs decisions in remuneration-related matters. This includes decisions to derogate from the guidelines. Such derogations are to be reported and explained in the subsequent remuneration report.Salary and terms of employment for other employeesIn preparing the Board‚Äôs proposal for these remuneration guidelines  the salaries and terms of employment for the Company‚Äôs employees have been taken into account by including information about the employees‚Äô total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and the remuneration increase and rate of increase over time in the Board‚Äôs decision support material for evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines and limitations set out herein. The remuneration report on paid and outstanding remuneration covered by the guidelines will include a report on the trend regarding the gap between Company management‚Äôs remuneration and other employees‚Äô remuneration.Changes from previous guidelinesThe Board‚Äôs proposal for guidelines for remuneration of senior executives prior to the 2022 AGM is largely consistent with the guidelines adopted at the 2021 AGM. In the review prior to the 2022 AGM  changes have been made regarding the extended benefit for the CEO  as regards the official residence in Stockholm including cleaning allowance for the residence  clarification of the extended possibility for the Board to decide upon variable remuneration in extraordinary circumstances  and an increased bonus cap for variable remuneration to the CEO  from 60 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary to 80 percent of 12 times the current monthly salary. Furthermore  the possibility has been introduced for senior executives  if a bonus is received  to include the purchase price of SkiStar shares acquired during the vesting year of the current bonus payment in the amount that the executive has committed to invest in SkiStar shares.More informationOn the date of submission of these proposed remuneration guidelines for senior executives  SkiStar did not have any remuneration commitments not due for payment other than ongoing commitments to senior executives in accordance with the remuneration principles adopted at the 2021 AGM. For more information on remuneration at SkiStar  see the remuneration report and the annual report  which are available at www.skistar.com/sv/corporate no later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.21. Resolution regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issuesThe board of directors proposes that the AGM authorises the board of directors to resolve upon new issues of shares in accordance with the following.The board of directors is proposed to be authorized to  on one or several occasions during the period until the next AGM  to resolve on new issues of Class B shares. A new share issue may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right. The authorisation shall include the right to resolve on a new share issue with cash payment  payment by contribution in kind or payment by set-off and otherwise subject to conditions as set out in Chapter 2  Section 5  Paragraph 2  1-3 and 5 of the Swedish Companies Act. Decision pursuant to the authorisation may not result in a new issuance of shares exceeding ten (10) percent of all shares in the company at the time of the AGM's decision on the authorisation. An issue of new shares based on this authorisation must not result in the company‚Äôs share capital exceeding the company‚Äôs maximum allowed share capital as set out in the articles of association. Shares shall  in case of deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right to subscription  be issued on market terms. The board shall be entitled to determine other terms for the share issue.The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right if any  is to give the board increased options to  completely or partially  finance any future investments/acquisitions by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisitions alternatively to raise capital for such investments/acquisitions. The board  or anyone appointed by the board  shall be authorised to make such minor adjustments of the resolution of the AGM that may be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and has the right to otherwise take the measures required to enforce the decision.22. Resolution on authorisation providing the Board of Directors with the right to pass resolutions regarding acquisitions and sales of the company‚Äôs own sharesThe board of directors proposes that the AGM authorises the board of directors to resolve on the acquisition and sales of the company‚Äôs own shares according to essentially the following.The board of directors‚Äô proposal entails that the board be authorised  until the next AGM of shareholders  to pass resolutions on one or more occasions regarding the acquisition of Class B shares in the company; however  the company‚Äôs holding may not  at any time  exceed ten percent of the total number of shares in the company. The acquisition of shares shall take place in a regulated market or by an acquisition offer made to all shareholders that hold Class B shares. Acquisition of shares in a regulated market may only take place at a price that is  at any given point in time  within the registered share price interval ‚Äì that is  the interval between the highest bid price and the lowest selling price. An offer of acquisition made to all shareholders may take place at a price equivalent to the lowest market value at the time of the offer  with a maximum deviation of plus 20 percent.Furthermore  the proposal by the board of directors entails that the board of directors be entitled to pass resolutions  on one or more occasions until the next AGM  regarding the sale of the company‚Äôs own shares in a regulated market or in conjunction with the acquisition of companies or operations. The authorisation includes the right to pass resolutions on deviation from the preferential rights of shareholders and resolutions that establish forms of payment other than cash funds  on the basis of in-kind payment  offsetting or on the basis of other conditions. The authorisation may be utilised for the maximum number of shares stipulated in the authorisation to acquire the company‚Äôs shares. Transfers in a regulated market may only take place at a price that is  at any given point in time  within the registered share price interval. Transfers in connection with acquisitions shall take place at a price which  in all essential manners  corresponds to the market value for the company‚Äôs share at the time of entering into the acquisition agreement.These authorisations aim to provide the board of directors with increased scope in working with the company‚Äôs capital structure and  if deemed appropriate  to facilitate acquisitions. The reason for the deviation from pre-emption rights  with regard to transfers made in conjunction with the acquisition of companies and businesses  is to create alternative forms of payment for such acquisitions. The board  or anyone appointed by the board  shall be authorised to make such minor adjustments of the resolution that may prove necessary in connection with the implementation of the board‚Äôs resolution on repurchase and transfer of own shares.Shareholder‚Äôs proposal23.

(‚ÄúClearStream‚Äù or the ""Company"") (TSX: CSM) today announced its results for the nine months ended September 30  2022. All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.‚ÄúEBITDAS‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDAS‚Äù are not standard measures under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.‚ÄúThe high level of activity that we experienced in the second quarter continued in the third quarter as we reported revenues of $171.9 million  largely unchanged from the record set in the second quarter. Revenues for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30  2022 increased by 58% from the same periods in 2021 as the market recovery from the pandemic lows continued ‚Äù said Barry Card  Chief Executive Officer.‚ÄúIn the third quarter  we successfully completed an additional 10 turnaround projects to build and maintain the integrity of our customers‚Äô infrastructure. When combined with the second quarter  we completed a total of 30 turnaround projects. We were able to recruit and grow our workforce to over 4 000 employees at the peak  to complete these projects. The commitment of our employees to safety allowed these projects to be delivered on time and with no incidents  representing best in class performance ‚Äù added Mr. Card.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $171.9 million  representing an increase of $63.3 million or 58.2% from Q3 2021 and a decrease of $1.3 million or 0.8% from Q2 2022.Gross profit for the three months ended September 30  2022 was $20.6 million  representing an increase of $8.5 million or 70.1% from Q3 2021 and an increase of $4.9 million or 31.3% from Q2 2022.Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30  2022 was 12.0%  as compared to 11.2% in Q3 2021 and 9.1% in Q2 2022.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $12.4 million  representing an increase of $6.4 million or 107.3% from Q3 2021 and an increase of $4.5 million or 56.6% from Q2 2022.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended September 30  2022 was 7.2%  representing an increase of 1.7% from Q3 2021 and an increase of 2.6% from Q2 2022.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended September 30  2022 were $10.0 million  representing an increase of $2.7 million or 36.5% from Q3 2021 and an increase of $0.2 million or 1.8% from Q2 2022. The increase is largely due to our business recovering and stabilizing in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022. In addition  2022 expenses are higher than 2021 due to ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness.Liquidity  including cash and available credit facilities  was $21.6 million at September 30  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New contract awards and renewals totaled approximately $350.0 million for the three months ended September 30  2022 and $12.0 million for the month of October 2022. Approximately 40% of the work is expected to be completed in the next 12 months.Maintenance and Construction ServicesRevenues for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $159.3 million  representing an increase of $60.0 million or 60.4% from Q3 2021 and a decrease of $0.9 million or 0.6% from Q2 2022. The increase relative to Q3 2021 was due to the completion of an additional 10 turnaround projects in the third quarter  which included two large projects. Gross profit margin for Q3 2022 was 11.2%  an increase of 2.7% from Q2 2022 and 2.0% from Q3 2021. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesRevenues for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $14.0 million  representing an increase of $3.5 million or 33.6% from Q3 2021 and a decrease of $0.3 million or 2.2% from Q2 2022. Gross profit margin for Q3 2022 was 19.1%  an increase of 4.5% from Q2 2022 and a decrease of 9.0% from Q3 2021. The decrease relative to Q3 2021 was primarily due to the mix of business  job margins being lower for certain projects and an increase in material costs. With the continued rise in global energy demand and commodity prices  we are seeing our customers in the oil sands operating at full production levels  which has started to increase the demand for our AssetArmorTM products.Environmental ServicesWe continue to enhance our professional services capabilities to service our growing customer base in this market segment. Our customers continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada as they increase their focus on ESG (environmental  social and governance) matters. We expect this trend to continue notwithstanding the expiry of the government-funded programs at the end of 2022.CorporateOn September 23  2022  Murray Desrosiers  Senior Vice President and General Counsel  was appointed Senior Vice President  Legal and Corporate Development.

ClearStream accounts for inter-segment sales based on transaction price.(2) ""Adjusted EBITDAS‚Äù is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were $171 883 and $454 927 compared to $108 647 and $287 447 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 58.2% and 58.3%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in 2022  representing an increase in activity across all areas of the business with the largest increase occurring in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment.Gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 was $20 617 and $46 059 compared to $12 124 and $30 610 for the same periods of 2021  representing an increase of 70.1% and 50.5%  respectively. Gross profit margin for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 was 12.0% and 10.1% compared to 11.2% and 10.6% for the same periods in 2021. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of work in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment combined with the recovery of the increased costs realized in the business  which have been built into contracts collaboratively with our customers.Selling  general and administrative (‚ÄúSG&A‚Äù) expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were $9 970 and $27 821  in comparison to $7 302 and $19 856 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 36.5% and 40.1%  respectively. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were 5.8% and 6.1% compared to 6.7% and 6.9% for the same periods in 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters of 2021  the increase in SG&A expenses is partially due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.For the three and nine months ended September 30  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $12 381 and $23 296 compared to $5 973 and $12 653 for the same periods in 2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 7.2% and 5.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 compared to 5.5% and 4.4% for the same periods in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three and nine months ended September 30  2022  compared to $143 and $11 313 for the three and nine months ended September 30  2021.Income from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30  2022 was $1 174 and loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30  2022 was $7 582 in comparison to losses of $2 227 and $9 300 for the same periods in 2021. The income variance was driven by a significant improvement in gross profit for the Maintenance and Construction Services segment and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021  partially offset by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOn October 5  2022  ClearStream amended its asset-based revolving credit facility (the ‚ÄúABL Facility‚Äù) with a Canadian charted bank to increase the maximum borrowings available thereunder to $50 million. The amount available under the ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable of ClearStream and certain of its subsidiaries. The maturity date of the ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The expanded ABL Facility will provide additional working capital needed to finance the higher level of activity experienced in 2022.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through September 30  2023.As at September 30  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at September 30  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $72.4 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKThe return of global energy demand and the reality of a multi-year period of upstream oil and natural gas underinvestment has resulted in a shortage of oil and natural gas and higher commodity prices  providing a promising outlook for the services industry. The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons have exacerbated the challenged supply situation and many importing countries are looking for alternative sources of supply  including North America  to fill the gap. At current commodity price levels  we anticipate continued high demand for our services as customers seek to maintain or incrementally grow production levels. However  broad economic concerns exist with respect to inflation  rising interest rates and geopolitical instability  the combination of which may lead to a global recession. These concerns may negatively impact the spending plans of our customers.Despite some recent weakness  the pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong. While our customers have been prioritizing debt repayment and returns to shareholders  they are starting to increase spending on both maintenance projects (to enhance operational reliability) and capital projects (to maintain or expand production capacity). We expect activity levels to remain strong for the remainder of 2022.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers to help them effectively manage their operations. Our organic growth strategy involves cross-selling our suite of more than 40 services that encompass the full asset lifecycle to generate efficiencies and cost reductions for our customers and further expanding our reach into industrial markets. We are also continually working to improve our service delivery to anticipate our customer‚Äôs requirements and proactively meet their needs.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years  ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas  Petrochemical  Mining  Power  Agriculture  Forestry  Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

ClearStream‚Äôs method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream‚Äôs Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery) and long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream‚Äôs reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream‚Äôs ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  loss of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream‚Äôs ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares.

The commitment of our employees to safety allowed these projects to be delivered on time and with no incidents  representing best in class performance ‚Äù added Mr. Card.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $171.9 million  representing an increase of $63.3 million or 58.2% from Q3 2021 and a decrease of $1.3 million or 0.8% from Q2 2022.Gross profit for the three months ended September 30  2022 was $20.6 million  representing an increase of $8.5 million or 70.1% from Q3 2021 and an increase of $4.9 million or 31.3% from Q2 2022.Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30  2022 was 12.0%  as compared to 11.2% in Q3 2021 and 9.1% in Q2 2022.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $12.4 million  representing an increase of $6.4 million or 107.3% from Q3 2021 and an increase of $4.5 million or 56.6% from Q2 2022.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended September 30  2022 was 7.2%  representing an increase of 1.7% from Q3 2021 and an increase of 2.6% from Q2 2022.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended September 30  2022 were $10.0 million  representing an increase of $2.7 million or 36.5% from Q3 2021 and an increase of $0.2 million or 1.8% from Q2 2022. The increase is largely due to our business recovering and stabilizing in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022. In addition  2022 expenses are higher than 2021 due to ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness.Liquidity  including cash and available credit facilities  was $21.6 million at September 30  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New contract awards and renewals totaled approximately $350.0 million for the three months ended September 30  2022 and $12.0 million for the month of October 2022. Approximately 40% of the work is expected to be completed in the next 12 months.Story continuesMaintenance and Construction ServicesRevenues for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $159.3 million  representing an increase of $60.0 million or 60.4% from Q3 2021 and a decrease of $0.9 million or 0.6% from Q2 2022. The increase relative to Q3 2021 was due to the completion of an additional 10 turnaround projects in the third quarter  which included two large projects. Gross profit margin for Q3 2022 was 11.2%  an increase of 2.7% from Q2 2022 and 2.0% from Q3 2021. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesRevenues for the three months ended September 30  2022 were $14.0 million  representing an increase of $3.5 million or 33.6% from Q3 2021 and a decrease of $0.3 million or 2.2% from Q2 2022. Gross profit margin for Q3 2022 was 19.1%  an increase of 4.5% from Q2 2022 and a decrease of 9.0% from Q3 2021. The decrease relative to Q3 2021 was primarily due to the mix of business  job margins being lower for certain projects and an increase in material costs. With the continued rise in global energy demand and commodity prices  we are seeing our customers in the oil sands operating at full production levels  which has started to increase the demand for our AssetArmorTM products.Environmental ServicesWe continue to enhance our professional services capabilities to service our growing customer base in this market segment. Our customers continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada as they increase their focus on ESG (environmental  social and governance) matters. We expect this trend to continue notwithstanding the expiry of the government-funded programs at the end of 2022.CorporateOn September 23  2022  Murray Desrosiers  Senior Vice President and General Counsel  was appointed Senior Vice President  Legal and Corporate Development.

Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were $171 883 and $454 927 compared to $108 647 and $287 447 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 58.2% and 58.3%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in 2022  representing an increase in activity across all areas of the business with the largest increase occurring in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment.Gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 was $20 617 and $46 059 compared to $12 124 and $30 610 for the same periods of 2021  representing an increase of 70.1% and 50.5%  respectively. Gross profit margin for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 was 12.0% and 10.1% compared to 11.2% and 10.6% for the same periods in 2021. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of work in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment combined with the recovery of the increased costs realized in the business  which have been built into contracts collaboratively with our customers.Selling  general and administrative (‚ÄúSG&A‚Äù) expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were $9 970 and $27 821  in comparison to $7 302 and $19 856 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 36.5% and 40.1%  respectively. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were 5.8% and 6.1% compared to 6.7% and 6.9% for the same periods in 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters of 2021  the increase in SG&A expenses is partially due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.For the three and nine months ended September 30  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $12 381 and $23 296 compared to $5 973 and $12 653 for the same periods in 2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 7.2% and 5.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 compared to 5.5% and 4.4% for the same periods in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three and nine months ended September 30  2022  compared to $143 and $11 313 for the three and nine months ended September 30  2021.Income from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30  2022 was $1 174 and loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30  2022 was $7 582 in comparison to losses of $2 227 and $9 300 for the same periods in 2021. The income variance was driven by a significant improvement in gross profit for the Maintenance and Construction Services segment and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021  partially offset by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOn October 5  2022  ClearStream amended its asset-based revolving credit facility (the ‚ÄúABL Facility‚Äù) with a Canadian charted bank to increase the maximum borrowings available thereunder to $50 million. The amount available under the ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable of ClearStream and certain of its subsidiaries. The maturity date of the ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The expanded ABL Facility will provide additional working capital needed to finance the higher level of activity experienced in 2022.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through September 30  2023.As at September 30  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at September 30  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $72.4 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKThe return of global energy demand and the reality of a multi-year period of upstream oil and natural gas underinvestment has resulted in a shortage of oil and natural gas and higher commodity prices  providing a promising outlook for the services industry. The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons have exacerbated the challenged supply situation and many importing countries are looking for alternative sources of supply  including North America  to fill the gap. At current commodity price levels  we anticipate continued high demand for our services as customers seek to maintain or incrementally grow production levels. However  broad economic concerns exist with respect to inflation  rising interest rates and geopolitical instability  the combination of which may lead to a global recession. These concerns may negatively impact the spending plans of our customers.Despite some recent weakness  the pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong. While our customers have been prioritizing debt repayment and returns to shareholders  they are starting to increase spending on both maintenance projects (to enhance operational reliability) and capital projects (to maintain or expand production capacity). We expect activity levels to remain strong for the remainder of 2022.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers to help them effectively manage their operations. Our organic growth strategy involves cross-selling our suite of more than 40 services that encompass the full asset lifecycle to generate efficiencies and cost reductions for our customers and further expanding our reach into industrial markets. We are also continually working to improve our service delivery to anticipate our customer‚Äôs requirements and proactively meet their needs.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years  ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas  Petrochemical  Mining  Power  Agriculture  Forestry  Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

ClearStream‚Äôs method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream‚Äôs Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery) and long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream‚Äôs reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream‚Äôs ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  loss of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream‚Äôs ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares.

The increase is largely due to our business recovering and stabilizing in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022. In addition  2022 expenses are higher than 2021 due to ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness.Liquidity  including cash and available credit facilities  was $21.6 million at September 30  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New contract awards and renewals totaled approximately $350.0 million for the three months ended September 30  2022 and $12.0 million for the month of October 2022.

ClearStream accounts for inter-segment sales based on transaction price.(2) ""Adjusted EBITDAS"" is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were $171 883 and $454 927 compared to $108 647 and $287 447 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 58.2% and 58.3%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in 2022  representing an increase in activity across all areas of the business with the largest increase occurring in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment.Gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 was $20 617 and $46 059 compared to $12 124 and $30 610 for the same periods of 2021  representing an increase of 70.1% and 50.5%  respectively. Gross profit margin for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 was 12.0% and 10.1% compared to 11.2% and 10.6% for the same periods in 2021. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of work in the Maintenance and Construction Services segment combined with the recovery of the increased costs realized in the business  which have been built into contracts collaboratively with our customers.Selling  general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were $9 970 and $27 821  in comparison to $7 302 and $19 856 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 36.5% and 40.1%  respectively. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 were 5.8% and 6.1% compared to 6.7% and 6.9% for the same periods in 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters of 2021  the increase in SG&A expenses is partially due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.For the three and nine months ended September 30  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $12 381 and $23 296 compared to $5 973 and $12 653 for the same periods in 2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 7.2% and 5.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 compared to 5.5% and 4.4% for the same periods in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three and nine months ended September 30  2022  compared to $143 and $11 313 for the three and nine months ended September 30  2021.Income from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30  2022 was $1 174 and loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30  2022 was $7 582 in comparison to losses of $2 227 and $9 300 for the same periods in 2021. The income variance was driven by a significant improvement in gross profit for the Maintenance and Construction Services segment and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021  partially offset by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOn October 5  2022  ClearStream amended its asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""ABL Facility"") with a Canadian charted bank to increase the maximum borrowings available thereunder to $50 million. The amount available under the ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable of ClearStream and certain of its subsidiaries. The maturity date of the ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The expanded ABL Facility will provide additional working capital needed to finance the higher level of activity experienced in 2022.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through September 30  2023.As at September 30  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at September 30  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $72.4 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKThe return of global energy demand and the reality of a multi-year period of upstream oil and natural gas underinvestment has resulted in a shortage of oil and natural gas and higher commodity prices  providing a promising outlook for the services industry. The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons have exacerbated the challenged supply situation and many importing countries are looking for alternative sources of supply  including North America  to fill the gap. At current commodity price levels  we anticipate continued high demand for our services as customers seek to maintain or incrementally grow production levels. However  broad economic concerns exist with respect to inflation  rising interest rates and geopolitical instability  the combination of which may lead to a global recession. These concerns may negatively impact the spending plans of our customers.Despite some recent weakness  the pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong. While our customers have been prioritizing debt repayment and returns to shareholders  they are starting to increase spending on both maintenance projects (to enhance operational reliability) and capital projects (to maintain or expand production capacity). We expect activity levels to remain strong for the remainder of 2022.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers to help them effectively manage their operations. Our organic growth strategy involves cross-selling our suite of more than 40 services that encompass the full asset lifecycle to generate efficiencies and cost reductions for our customers and further expanding our reach into industrial markets. We are also continually working to improve our service delivery to anticipate our customer's requirements and proactively meet their needs.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years  ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas  Petrochemical  Mining  Power  Agriculture  Forestry  Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

This press release contains forward-looking information relating to: our business plans  strategies and objectives; contract renewals and project awards  including the estimated value thereof and the timing of completing the associated work; that the demand for our AssetArmorTM products will increase as customers increase production levels; that customers will continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada; that the investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy will drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness; the sufficiency of our liquidity and cash flow from operations to meet our short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with our financial covenants through September 30  2023; our dividend policy; the supply/demand fundamentals for oil and natural gas and its impact on the demand for our services; the pricing outlook for commodities in the end markets we serve; that broad economic concerns may negatively impact the spending plans of our customers; that our customers will increase spending on both maintenance and capital projects; and activity levels for the remainder of 2022.Forward-looking information involves significant risks and uncertainties.

These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about ClearStream's business are more fully discussed in ClearStream's disclosure materials  including its annual information form and management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results  filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates. Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it  there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information  and management's assumptions may prove to be incorrect.This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release  and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‚Äò‚ÄòEBITDAS'' and ""Adjusted EBITDAS"" (collectively  the ‚Äò‚ÄòNon-standard measures'') are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream's method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream's Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery) and long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream's reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream's ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  loss of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream's ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30  2022.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream's consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream's website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.2,0.3,True,English,"['Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results', 'ClearStream', 'Wear Technology Overlay Services', 'ClearStream Energy Services Inc', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'available credit facilities', 'full production levels', 'growing customer base', 'professional services capabilities', 'New contract awards', 'global energy demand', 'Gross profit margin', 'two large projects', 'additional 10 turnaround projects', 'nine month periods', 'Construction Services', 'Environmental Services', 'nine months', 'same periods', '30 turnaround projects', 'EBITDAS margin', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', 'standard measures', 'press release', 'high level', 'second quarter', 'third quarter', 'pandemic lows', 'Barry Card', 'class performance', 'Mr. Card.', 'cost reductions', 'previous years', 'increased volume', 'ongoing investments', 'enterprise systems', 'digital strategy', 'longer-term efficiencies', 'cost competitiveness', 'next 12 months', 'various scopes', 'efficient execution', 'lower costs', 'job margins', 'material costs', 'continued rise', 'commodity prices', 'oil sands', 'AssetArmorTM products', 'three months', 'new customers', 'Canadian dollars', 'Adjusted EBITDAS', 'administrative expenses', 'market segment', ""customers' infrastructure"", 'work site', 'quarterly revenues', '2022 expenses', 'CALGARY', 'Alberta', 'Company', 'CSM', 'results', 'amounts', 'thousands', 'IFRS', 'Advisory', 'end', 'description', 'items', 'limitations', 'use', 'activity', 'record', 'recovery', 'integrity', 'total', 'workforce', '4,000 employees', 'peak', 'commitment', 'safety', 'time', 'incidents', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'Q3', 'decrease', 'Q2', 'Selling', 'general', 'business', 'elements', 'order', 'Liquidity', 'cash', 'September', 'December', 'renewals', 'October', 'Maintenance', 'completion', 'existing', 'mix', '11.', '4.5', '9.']",2022-11-03,2022-11-03,benzinga.com

The index will be used for a large pension fund mandate. This index is based on STOXX's broadest equity universe  the STOXX World AC (All Countries)  including both Developed and Emerging Markets and incorporates both proprietary ESG data provided by LGIM and data from ISS ESG.""Investing in minimum volatility strategies has traditionally come at the cost of potentially poorer ESG outcomes compared with standard market cap benchmarks. However  this new solution can allow the investor to enhance their environmental objectives  improve ESG profiles and achieve a net zero decarbonization pathway  while also targeting a lower risk profile than a broad market benchmark. The research process was a truly collaborative effort carried out by LGIM  the client and Qontigo who shared the same vision. We are pleased to have created an innovative solution which incorporates LGIM's ESG framework "" said Fadi Zaher  Head of Index Solutions at Legal & General Investment Management.""Investors in general  and pension trustees in particular  increasingly need to meet a higher number of objectives in their investment allocations. This is particularly true of sustainability criteria and  given the market backdrop  a defensive positioning. The iSTOXX World Min Vol ESG index is an example of how we can embed multiple requirements  and incorporate the most appropriate third-party data  into a rules-based  passive strategy. The index methodology also incorporates risk mitigation with the help of our Axioma optimizer "" said Axel Lomholt  Chief Product Officer  Indices & Benchmarks at Qontigo.Qontigo's iSTOXX World Min Vol ESG Index tracks the performance of an optimized minimum variance portfolio that tilts towards companies that exhibit low volatility  favorable fundamentals  and superior ESG scores. The index is constructed in two steps: first by creating a minimum variance portfolio based on the STOXX World index  and second by improving the Climate and ESG profiles of this portfolio.

The research process was a truly collaborative effort carried out by LGIM  the client and Qontigo who shared the same vision. We are pleased to have created an innovative solution which incorporates LGIM's ESG framework "" said Fadi Zaher  Head of Index Solutions at Legal & General Investment Management.""Investors in general  and pension trustees in particular  increasingly need to meet a higher number of objectives in their investment allocations.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap Investor Relations & Financial CommunicationsPierre Laurent  Louis-Victor Delouvrier and Arthur Rouill√©Tel: +33 (0)1 44 71 94 94bone@newcap.euCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

The proportion and time to onset of these negative events were studied at 28 days in the primary analysis  corresponding to the maximum treatment period  with follow-up of mortality and safety for at least 90 days.The 233 treated patients (ITT population) were 63 years old on average  64% of the patients were male  recruited in centers in Europe  the US and Brazil between Q3 2020 and Q1 2022  infected with the main SARS-Cov-2 variants.The trial ended early before reaching the 310 patients originally planned  due to stalled recruitment. The sub-population of patients without major protocol deviations (PP sub-population) included 180 patients with similar baseline demographics and disease characteristics as the ITT population. Since the top line results of the study were reported and because the study was underpowered  post-hoc statistical analyses have been performed to re-estimate the effect of Sarconeos (BIO101) on the risk of early death or respiratory failure at day 28 (primary endpoint of the study) and death at day 90 in the ITT and PP populations.On respiratory failure or early death  post-hoc Kaplan-Meier analyses show a significant reduction with Sarconeos (BIO101) in the risk of early death or respiratory failure at day 28 by 45% (p=0.037) in the ITT population and by 53% (p=0.051) in the PP population. These post-hocstrongly strengthen the primary analysis that had shown significant differences over 28 days in the Kaplan Meier curves for BIO101 versus placebo  (p=0.034  see figure below)  and a strong trend when testing for difference at day 28 by using the pre-defined statistical model (primary end-point Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test  p=0.071).fncls.ssp?fn=download2_file&code_str=076e43a1bcd79ea549b897d0e48abe7cOn mortality follow-up over 90 days  post hoc Kaplan-Meier analysis of the risk of death at day 90 was reduced with Sarconeos (BIO101) by 43% in the ITT population (p=0.076) and by 70% in the PP population (p=0.016). These analysis strongly strengthen the trend shown in the primary analysis with similar reduction of risk of death at day 28 which was not significant. The reduction in the risk of death at day 90 reflects the effect of Sarconeos (BIO101) on early death and respiratory failure during the maximum 28 days treatment period that translates efficiently and in the same proportion into a reduction in the risk of death later on.fncls.ssp?fn=download2_file&code_str=3cc9c32424b6803ec8c2bea9ffc93f15Sarconeos (BIO101) has a good safety profile  with a lower proportion of patients with adverse events compared to placebo (57% vs. 64%)  in particular a lower frequency of serious  mostly respiratory  adverse events (25% vs. 31%).The Company aims to present the results in detail as soon as possible during upcoming scientific conferences in the first half of 2023 and in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  said: ""These post-hoc analyses strongly supportthe therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The reduction in the risk of respiratory failure and death by more than 40% is impressive. These results exceed expectations about the effect size of BIO101 (expected 37.5% relative reduction vs. placebo) used in the sample size calculation of the study and commit us to further develop Sarconeos (BIO101) in this indication  giving hospitalized patients a therapeutic option while COVID-19 is becoming endemic. We will start sharing these results in the coming months with regulatory agencies and health authorities  particularly in Europe  the US and Brazil. The aim is to file for conditional marketing authorisation (Europe) and emergency use authorization (USA  Brazil) as soon as possible in 2023. I would like to sincerely thank all the patients  caregivers  employees  and finally the shareholders of Biophytis for their work  trust and dedication  throughout this study.""Convinced of the therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101)  Biophytis intends to offer this new therapeutic solution to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 as soon as possible. Biophytis will first amend and extend the Early Access Programme (EAP) to make Sarconeos (BIO101) available as soon as possible to hospitalized COVID-19 patients at risk of respiratory failure and death. An EAP has already been approved in the first half of 2022 in Brazil to treat intensive care patients  and applications will be made in other territories including the US and Europe. Biophytis will also start to prepare for filing in 2023 for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States and Brazil and conditional marketing authorisation in Europe  depending on COVID-19 evolution.About the COVA studyAs a reminder  the COVA clinical study (identifier clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04472728) is an international  multi-centre  double-blind  placebo-controlled  group-sequential and adaptive two-part study. It is a phase 2-3 study evaluating Sarconeos (BIO101) in patients aged 45 years and older  hospitalised with severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Part 1 of the COVA study is an exploratory Phase 2 proof-of-concept study designed to provide preliminary data on the safety  tolerability and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in 50 hospitalised patients with severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19. Part 2 of the COVA study is a randomised phase 3 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) on respiratory function in patients. Due to the evolution of the pandemia  the company decidedin April 2022 to stop enrolment at 237 enrolled patients  below the originally planned number of 310.About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes for patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

Growth in service revenues  up 7.9% in reported currency terms (+7.8% in local currency)  was a key driver of the Group‚Äôs strong revenue performance. Non telecom related revenues in Russia continued to decline and constituted 7.9% of total Group reported revenue in 3Q22 versus 10.4% in 3Q21.In 3Q22  Group EBITDA was flat YoY in reported currency terms (+0.7% in local currency)  with Group EBITDA margin of 42.8% (-1.5 p.p. YoY). To protect the profitability margins of the business  we remain focused on implementing planned cost-efficiency measures across the Group and on implementing inflationary pricing.Group EBITDA YoY performance was impacted by a number of extraordinary non-recurring items in 3Q22 and in 3Q21  as noted in the Country Performance section. Excluding these one-off items  Group EBITDA increased 1.9% YoY in local currency.In 3Q22  we reported growth of 0.8% YoY in our subscriber base. The Group continued to focus on the overall customer experience in our 4G networks.This supported the 15.1% YoY increase in our 4G users  which reached 107.1 million  with 14.1 million users added over the previous 12 months. 4G subscribers now account for 52.7% of our total subscriber base  up 6.5 p.p. from a year ago.On the back of our growing 4G penetration  we have been able to expand our digital operator offerings across our operations. This has driven the growth of our multiplay customer base (+24.5% YoY)  which reached 33.4 million during 3Q22. Multiplay customer ARPU is 4.3 times higher and churn is 2.4 times lower than single play voice-only customers.Our financial services business in Pakistan  JazzCash  ended the quarter with 16.7 million MAUs  an increase of 20.0% YoY. In Bangladesh  our streaming business  Toffee  achieved the 7.0 million MAUs milestone (+11.0% YoY) with 3.3 million average daily users (+55.1% YoY) in 3Q22.Group capex was USD 404 million  driven in particular by increased network investment in Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan  in line with our growth strategy. At 21.6%  capex intensity continues to decrease (-3.6 p.p. YoY).We closed the quarter with total cash of USD 3.3 billion  including USD 2.6 billion at the HQ level. Our operations are largely self-funding and do not require financing from the HQ to fund their operations  including capex.In Ukraine  the team continued to keep the country connected  with around 90% of our radio network operational at quarter end. However  recent damage to Ukrainian power infrastructure has had an impact on network availability. Kyivstar‚Äôs revenues were up 5.2% in local currency (-18.8% YoY in reported currency) as the weakness in the Ukrainian hryvnia negatively impacted reported growth rates. Kyivstar‚Äôs 4G customer base grew 4.7% YoY  and our customers consumed more data  with usage rising 29.7% YoY. EBITDA was down 10.7% YoY in local currency (-31.1% in reported currency) in 3Q22. EBITDA performance was impacted by the change in revenue mix impacting margins  operational cost pressures  indexation of frequency fees  and by charitable donations and the staff care program  as Kyivstar continues to support its employees and the community.Russia reported a 3Q22 revenue decrease of 6.1% YoY in local currency (+16.1% YoY in reported currency). Revenue was impacted by a 58.5% decline in equipment revenue due to lower device sales  while the YoY strength of the Russian ruble supported the growth in reported financial performance. 3Q22 mobile service revenue was up 2.1% YoY in local currency  as the continued growth in the 4G customer base drove mobile data revenue higher by 7.5% YoY in local currency. In Russia  EBITDA increased 7.3% in local currency (+32.7% YoY in reported currency). This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of EBITDA YoY growth in local currency.Pakistan revenues increased 12.0% YoY in local currency (-17.1% YoY in reported currency)  driven by strong growth in data revenue  despite the negative impact of the increase in withholding tax from 10% to 15% on 16 January 2022 and the further reduction in mobile termination rates in 2H22.

We are closely monitoring events in Russia and Ukraine  as well as the possibility of the imposition of further sanctions in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and any resulting further rise in tensions between Russia and the United States  the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services.The broad nature of the financial sanctions targeted at the Russian financial system  including several banks that have historically provided funding to the Company  the comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may have a material impact on the Company‚Äôs operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine. Over the next few months  we will be undertaking our annual assessment as required by IFRS to determine the potential need for further impairment charges  which is not as of yet determinable due to a number of factors  including the fluidity of the current situation and our ability to obtain relevant data required to build a business plan given the ongoing conflict and associated uncertainties. We may report significant impairment charges with respect to assets in Ukraine  Russia and/or other operating companies for the nine-months ended 30 September 2022. However  we are still gathering the necessary data and we are not able at this time to estimate the amount or range of this potential impairment charge to the income statement. Such an impairment charge  if any  would have no impact on the Company‚Äôs cash flow. It is possible further impairment charges may rise to such a level on an accounting basis as to require additional analysis of true asset values in order to determine the true value of assets to be compared to liabilities as outlined in the provisions of our debt agreements.DisclaimerVEON‚Äôs results presented in this trading update are  unless otherwise stated  based on IFRS and have not been externally reviewed and audited.

The SCC is established with the goal to build a lasting framework that connects stakeholders to leverage member knowledge and improve the speed and scale by which the industry can respond to climate change.‚ÄúFocus on sustainability is one of the pillars in our strategy. We are excited to be a founding member of the SCC  which we see as a fundamentally innovative solution to this significant industry challenge.‚Äù said Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM.As ASM works toward its target of Net Zero emissions by 2035  a key benefit of the SCC will be in methods and standards for addressing Scope 3 collaboratively across the semiconductor industry value chain.ASM played a key role in the creation of the SCC  represented by John Golightly  ASM Senior Director of Environmental Health and Safety & Sustainability  who led the formation of  and chaired the SEMI working group that developed the scope and framework of the SCC. ‚ÄúPast methods of engaging our value chain are insufficient given the needed scale and limited time available. Together through the SCC we strive to achieve impact and scale well beyond our individual efforts in response to the climate change.‚Äù said John Golightly.‚ÄúI applaud ASM for its commitment to become a founding member of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC) and for its continued support of global sustainability efforts ‚Äù said Ajit Manocha  SEMI President and CEO. ‚ÄúIndividually  SEMI member companies have made tremendous strides on sustainability  but we need to pool industry resources to solve the difficult decarbonization challenges and to meet tracking and reporting requirements across the value chain. The SCC members look forward to defining and prioritizing sustainability goals and to harness the collective energy of the global semiconductor supply chain to create solutions.‚ÄùThe SCC and SEMI will hold launch ceremonies and discussion panels at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh  Egypt.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

It is also based on the Eurostar Neo telecommunications satellite platform  developed under an ESA Partnership Project with Airbus designed to foster innovation and competitiveness in the European space industry. Once into orbit and positioned  the satellite EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13G will  with its twin EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F launched on October 15th  reinforce and enhance the broadcast of more than a thousand television channels into homes across Europe  Northern Africa and the Middle East. Moreover  the two satellites will offer advanced features in terms of uplink signal protection and resilience.In February 2021  Eutelsat was entrusted once again by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) to host the EGNOS GEO-4 payload  which is on board EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13G. Eutelsat already operates the EGNOS GEO-3 payload on its EUTELSAT 5 West B satellite.EGNOS is the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service that acts as an augmentation service to global positioning systems  to improve the reliability of positioning information. This is ensured by a crucial integrity message which is essential in aviation where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) alone doesnot satisfy strict operational requirements set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). It is especially important during critical aircraft flight stages such as the final approach. Other transport means including maritime and rail benefit from this EGNOS Safety of Life service. EGNOS also increases the positioning accuracy for other applications  such as precision farming  geomatics  land management and maritime.Eva Berneke  Eutelsat Chief Executive Officer said: ""EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13G is now on its way to join EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F at our flagship 13-degree East position. We also look forward to completing the GNSS network for our European Union long term customer and partner  the EUSPA. My congratulations to the Eutelsat  Airbus and SpaceX teams for another successful launch into geostationary orbit.‚ÄùAbout Eutelsat CommunicationsFounded in 1977  Eutelsat Communications is one of the world's leading satellite operators.

T‚Ä¶,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Razorfish  a global leader in marketing transformation  today released findings from a new research study aiming to better understand consumer attitudes around virtual goods and how these perceptions are reshaping digital culture. The study  Unlocking the Real Impact of Virtual Goods  aims to help brands identify opportunities to connect with consumers in the new digital frontier of Web3.The analysis  which surveyed consumers who currently own or had owned a virtual good within the past year  focuses on consumers' unique attitudes  perceptions  behaviors  and spending habits. It found that more than 70 percent of these early adopters view virtual goods as equally valuable to  or more valuable than  physical ones.‚ÄúThe rise of Web3 is exciting because of the amazing potential it has to revolutionize how people engage with the digital world ‚Äù said Cristina Lawrence  EVP  Consumer & Content Experience. ""We set out to understand consumer perceptions around virtual goods as mechanisms to express themselves and engage in communities. For brands  virtual goods offer new connection points ‚Äì or even wholly new revenue streams ‚Äì with these consumers.‚ÄùMany are already investing non-essential ‚Äúplay funds‚Äù into virtual goods. Of all early adopters surveyed  38% reported spending at least a quarter of their discretionary income on virtual goods  and 35% spend at least $1 000 on their virtual portfolio. A majority anticipate that they will increase their spend on virtual goods in the coming year.The study also investigated how virtual goods provide perceived luxury:Desired acquisition : How branded virtual goods increase everyday consumers‚Äô online influence and enhance their digital identity.: How branded virtual goods increase everyday consumers‚Äô online influence and enhance their digital identity. Emotional importance : How consumers perceive virtual goods produced by both mass-market and premium brands.: How consumers perceive virtual goods produced by both mass-market and premium brands.

The hydrogen initiative is an important milestone for Absolut Vodka in becoming completely CO 2 neutral by 2030. A prerequisite for being able to meet this goal is in reducing the carbon footprint of its glass packaging.Absolut has been a partner with Ardagh's Limmared glassworks in Sweden for 40 yearsAbsolut has signed an agreement with Ardagh Glass Packaging in Limmared  a subsidiary of Ardagh Group  to use this partly hydrogen-fired furnace commencing in the second half of 2023. The pioneering collaboration will accelerate the transformation of the global glassmaking process for a more sustainable future.Absolut has been a partner with Ardagh's Limmared glassworks in Sweden for 40 years  which currently uses a combination of natural gas and electricity to power its furnaces. From the second half of 2023  Ardagh will launch a pilot in its Limmared plant replacing 20 per cent of its natural gas with green hydrogen to manufacture all of Absolut's bottles across its portfolio. This means a full-scale change of the continuous production of Absolut bottles for all markets globally. The hydrogen will be produced onsite at Ardagh by using renewably sourced electricity.An industry wide quest for reducing climate impact is taking place. Combined with other innovations and sustainability initiatives  new technologies such as hydrogen furnaces will reduce carbon emissions from glass production significantly.The use of hydrogen would reduce Absolut Vodka's carbon footprint from glass by 20%. It follows other joint initiatives to reduce carbon emissions  such as the light-weighting of glass  increased use of electricity in the current furnace and a significant increase in recycled flint glass ‚Äì today reaching 53% with the ambition to go even further.Absolut owns one of the world's most energy-efficient distilleries. It has 98 per cent fewer emissions than an average distillery and has built up a surplus of emission rights as a result. The intent is to use these to invest in green transformation. Absolut will support Ardagh in this project and the parties will work together to fulfill Absolut's ambitions of a CO 2 neutral product by 2030 by using today's and tomorrow's best available technologies in glass manufacturing.Story continuesSt√©phanie Durroux  Chief Executive of The Absolut Company  says: ""Given we've been investing in our own production for decades  decreasing our emissions and increasing energy efficiency  we're now in a position where we also can focus on the parts of our value chain that are outside or our own scope. The glass manufacturing industry is in a transformative journey  and the world can't wait for the perfect solution. A bold and innovative approach is needed to accelerate radical change that will help solve the significant sustainability challenges that all glassmakers and buyers of glass face.""Bo Nilsson  Managing Director of Ardagh Glass Limmared AB  added: ""Our industry needs to be less reliant on fossil fuels and transition at pace to using more green energy. By investing in this new technology  we are embarking on a journey to reduce the carbon footprint of our glass packaging. There are challenges with such innovation  but we are committed to being an early mover in future-proofing our glass manufacturing operations world-wide.""For more information  assets or interview requests  please contact:Michael Lambmichael.lamb@mcsaatchi.com+44 75124 30936Notes to editors:About The Absolut CompanyThe Absolut Company has the worldwide responsibility for the production  packaging innovation and strategic marketing of Absolut Vodka  Malibu and Kahl√∫a.Absolut Vodka is one of the world's top ten international spirits brands.

The Group confirms the previously announced disposal program of ‚Ç¨1 billion by end-2023. This program  combined with targeted net cash flow generation of above 1.5% of sales in 2023  will contribute to significant deleveraging as soon as the end of 2023  moving toward a targeted net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio below 1.5 times at end-2025.Story continuesPatrick KOLLER  CEO of Faurecia  declared:‚ÄúFaurecia‚Äôs transformative acquisition of HELLA makes FORVIA a new global leader poised for profitable growth and strong value creation  even in current challenging market conditions  thanks to perfect alignment with automotive growth drivers.Today  we are taking a new step in our journey with the launch of Power25  which defines our three strategic priorities for the coming years: sales growth driven by innovation and sustainability; lower breakeven and enhanced profitability; and strong cash conversion and portfolio management to accelerate Group deleveraging after the HELLA acquisition.We are also adapting our financial targets to the macroeconomic environment and industry outlook. Our assumption of worldwide automotive production for 2025 is now revised to 88 million units  down 6 million vs. our previous assumption at the Capital Markets Day held in February 2021  a revision that is mainly due to tough macroeconomic conditions between 2021 and 2023. In this regard  our Power2025 also includes actions to face the short-term headwinds of 2023  before worldwide automotive production starts resuming growth supported by pent-up demand.With this assumption of 88 million units produced in 2025 and including the previously announced ‚Ç¨1bn disposal program by end-2023  we are targeting sales of c. 30 billion euros and operating margin above 7% in 2025 with a strengthened balance sheet  reflected in a leverage ratio below 1.5 times EBITDA at end-2025.FORVIA is already in motion on these objectives  and well on its way to becoming a sustainable mobility tech leader  offering pioneering technology for mobility experiences that matter to people.‚ÄùThe Board of Directors of Faurecia  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN  met on November 2 and reviewed the present Press Release.FORVIA 2025 FINANCIAL AMBITIONGroup Figures 2021* 2025** Sales ‚Ç¨22.0bn c. ‚Ç¨30.0bn Operating Margin 5.6% of sales >7% of sales Net cash flow 1% of sales 4% of sales(* pro forma figures) (** based on worldwide automotive production of 88 million units in 2025  incl. vehicles between 3.5t and 6t in Asia  and after the effect of the ‚Ç¨1bn disposal program by end-2023)From a financial standpoint  actions will prioritize:Deleveraging: Through a mix of improved cash generation and the divestment of non-strategic assets  Faurecia will reduce its net debt to c. ‚Ç¨6bn at end-2025 from ‚Ç¨8.4bn at June 30  2022. This represents a net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of below 1.5x from 3.1x at June 30  2022.FORVIA aims to generate cumulative net cash flow of more than ‚Ç¨2.5 billion between the second half of 2022 and 2025  reaching 4% of sales by end-2025 from 1.5% in 2023. To achieve this  it has launched a companywide ‚ÄúManage by cash‚Äù plan  combining:enhanced efficiency on R&D spending  heightened working capital discipline  targeting an operational reduction of at least 150bps as a percentage of sales between 2022 and 2025  including synergies  focused capex  targeting a reduction of 100bps as a percentage of sales between 2022 and 2025  active management of financings to ensure optimized interest rates in the medium term  optimized funding of hydrogen business development.FORVIA also confirms that its ‚Ç¨1bn disposal program by end-2023 is well on track  with c. 30% announced to date and at least one further transaction to be disclosed by year-end.The Board of Directors of Faurecia  during its latest meeting held on November 2  decided to propose to the next Shareholders‚Äô meeting that no dividend be paid in 2023.Cost reduction: FORVIA will actively cut costs in order to lower its breakeven point from a global production of 65 million units in 2022 to 61 million in 2025. It will mostly achieve this through a 300bps reduction in fixed costs as a percentage of sales between 2022 and 2025  comprising operational efficiency for about two thirds and net R&D and SG&A costs for one third. These cost-reduction measures include Faurecia-HELLA cost synergies and optimization  with FORVIA on track to achieve the announced objective of more than ‚Ç¨250 million  of which 40% in 2023. Thanks to hedging policies and self-help measures  FORVIA will also limit the growth of its energy bill to 1.8x in 2023 vs. 2021 and will largely mitigate the impact of 2023 inflation through existing contractual pass-through policies and continued negotiations with OEMs.Robust and selective growth: Faurecia and HELLA‚Äôs strong order books since 2019 support FORVIA‚Äôs sales ambition  securing at least 80% of expected business in 2025 and allowing for higher selectivity to lift profitability and cash generation. FORVIA expects its 2021-2025 sales Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to be above 9% before the effect of disposals  and 8% after  significantly outperforming market CAGR.HELLA: COMBINATION WITH FAURECIA ON TRACKFaurecia‚Äôs acquisition of HELLA has established FORVIA  the combined group  as the global #7 automotive supplier  strengthened by HELLA‚Äôs recognized technology leadership in such areas as Lighting and Electronics. HELLA will continue the strategy that has positioned it to benefit from key market trends in Electrification and Energy Management  Safe and Automated Driving and Digital and Sustainable Cockpit Experiences  while further internationalizing its business.The combination of operations with Faurecia is proceeding smoothly  with significant positive impact on activities such as joint purchasing and go-to-market  real estate management and sharing of best practices. Fiscal years have been aligned and Business Group-level reporting introduced at HELLA. Collaboration is accelerating  in particular between Faurecia Electronics and HELLA Electronics. Previously announced cost synergies are on track to reach more than ‚Ç¨250m in 2025  with revenue synergies amounting to ‚Ç¨300m-‚Ç¨400m. HELLA is expected to benefit from around 50% of validated sales and cost synergies.HELLA expects to increase revenues from ‚Ç¨6.3bn in 2021 to more than ‚Ç¨9.4bn in 2025  with the adjusted EBIT operating margin rising from 6% to above 8% and net cash flow from -1% of sales to around 4% of sales over the period  under HELLA accounting principles.As regards HELLA  please also refer to the press release issued separately by HELLA today (FORVIA‚Äôs Capital Markets Day includes HELLA‚Äôs analyst meeting  pursuant to sect. 55 of the Exchange Rules for the Frankfurter Wertpapierb√∂rse FWB).OBJECTIVES BY BUSINESS GROUPFORVIA‚Äôs Power25 ambitions are supported by the following actions and objectives by Business Group:Business Groups Sales Operating Margin 2021 2025 2021-2025 2021 2025 Electronics* ‚Ç¨3.5bn >‚Ç¨6.3bn CAGR >+16% 4.9% 8% Interiors ‚Ç¨4.6bn >‚Ç¨6.3bn CAGR >+8% 4.1% 7% Seating ‚Ç¨6.1bn >‚Ç¨8.0bn CAGR >+7% 4.7% 7% Lighting ‚Ç¨3.0bn >‚Ç¨4.3bn CAGR +10% 1.8% >5% Clean Mobility ‚Ç¨4.1bn ‚Ç¨4.8bn CAGR +4% (only consolidated operations  i.e. excl. hydrogen revenues through Symbio) 9.5% >10% Lifecycle Solutions ‚Ç¨0.9bn ‚Ç¨1.2bn CAGR +7% >12% >12%(*Electronics is the combination of HELLA Electronics and Faurecia Electronics)Electronics: Combining strengths for profitable growthFORVIA Electronics benefits from the strong complementarity between HELLA and Faurecia Electronics.

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations;Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses;Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs;Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of ‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term ‚ÄúEBITDA‚Äù that was previously used (this means that ‚ÄúEBITDA‚Äù aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‚ÄòAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù aggregates as from 2022).Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).Attachment",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.67,0.25,0.08,True,English,"['FORVIA Capital Market Day', 'first joint Capital Markets Day', 'targeted net cash flow generation', 'current challenging market conditions', 'FORVIA 2025 FINANCIAL AMBITION Group Figures', 'three key strategic priorities', 'cumulative net cash flow', 'sustainable mobility tech leader', 'FORVIA UNVEILS POWER25 PLAN', 'three strategic priorities', '2025 net cash flow', 'working capital discipline', 'worldwide automotive production', 'rising energy prices', 'strong value creation', 'tough macroeconomic conditions', 'Michel de ROSEN', 'present Press Release', 'R&D spending', 'strong cash conversion', 'new medium-term plan', 'new global leader', '‚Ç¨1bn disposal program', 'automotive growth drivers', 'Adjusted EBITDA ratio', 'CASH GENERATION', 'forma figures', 'strategic assets', 'mobility experiences', 'financial targets', 'financial standpoint', 'new step', 'net debt', 'macroeconomic environment', 'leverage ratio', 'combined Group', 'The Group', '2025 financial objectives', 'PROFITABLE GROWTH', 'profound transformation', 'step-change acquisition', 'mission statement', '88 million units', '2025 operating margin', 'short-term headwinds', 'high inflation', 'supply-chain disruptions', 'Patrick KOLLER', 'transformative acquisition', 'perfect alignment', 'coming years', 'industry outlook', 'pent-up demand', 'balance sheet', 'second half', 'operational reduction', 'Group deleveraging', 'significant deleveraging', 'lower breakeven', 'portfolio management', 'pioneering technology', 'Power25 actions', 'HELLA acquisition', 'previous assumption', 'sales growth', '2025 sales', 'FAURECIA', 'Nanterre', 'France', 'November', '11:00am', 'independence', 'Stellantis', 'people', 'ambitions', 'innovation', 'sustainability', 'profitability', 'following', 'vehicles', '3.5t', '6t', 'Asia', 'effect', 'Dec.', 'persistent', 'Story', 'CEO', 'journey', 'launch', 'enhanced', 'February', 'revision', 'regard', 'Power2025', 'motion', 'way', 'Board', 'Directors', 'chairmanship', 'mix', 'divestment', 'June', 'companywide', 'efficiency', '150bps', 'percentage', '2022']",2022-11-03,2022-11-03,finance.yahoo.com

Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A in the U.S. while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries. In September 2022  Servier communicated that it was discontinuing its involvement in the development of in-licensed CD19 products and purporting to provide Allogene with the ability to elect to obtain a license to the CD19 Products outside of the United States. We are evaluating all available options and contractual remedies to address the foregoing matters and other performance issues  which we believe may involve material breaches of the Servier Agreement by Servier.Allogene‚Äôs anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programs are licensed exclusively from Cellectis by Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to these programs.Servier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsOn October 6  2022  Allogene announced it has initiated potentially pivotal allogeneic CAR T Phase 2 clinical trial of ALLO-501A (ALPHA2 trial) in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Allogene expects that the ALPHA2 trial will enroll approximately 100 patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have not received prior anti-CD19 therapy. Allogene announced that updated clinical data from the CD19 program will be provided at Allogene‚Äôs R&D Showcase on November 29  2022.Allogene: anti-BCMA programOn November 2  2022  Allogene announced that the Phase 1 portion of the UNIVERSAL trial on ALLO-715 continues enrolling patients with r/r multiple myeloma (MM). Allogene also announced it will provide a clinical update from UNIVERSAL focused on a single dose ALLO-715 and discuss next steps for the program at the R&D Showcase.Allogene: solid tumor programOn November 2  2022  Allogene stated that ALLO-316  which targets CD70  its first AlloCAR T candidate for solid tumors  is being studied in patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial.Gene Editing PartnershipsIovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (‚ÄúIovance‚Äù)On October 10  2022  Iovance announced that the first patient was dosed and completed the safety observation period in the IOV-GM1-201 clinical trial of Iovance‚Äôs first genetically modified TIL therapy in development  IOV-4001  for the treatment of previously treated advanced melanoma or metastatic NSCLC.To inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein  IOV-4001 utilizes the gene-editing TALEN¬Æ technology licensed from Cellectis. This single genetic modification in IOV-4001 has the potential to enhance the antitumor activity of the TIL mechanism to directly target and kill tumor cells.Dosing the first patient with IOV-4001 is an important first step in providing proof-of-concept for delivering genetically modified TIL therapy to solid tumor patients with significant unmet needs and few treatment options.Cytovia TherapeuticsCytovia announced it will present new preclinical data on TALEN¬Æ gene-edited  induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived Natural Killer (NK) cells at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer‚Äôs (SITC) Annual Meeting. The abstract  entitled ‚ÄúTALEN¬Æ-Based Gene-Edited iPSC-Derived NK (iNK) Cells Demonstrate Enhanced Antitumor Activity‚Äù  was accepted for poster presentation.These data highlight the progress of Cellectis‚Äô research and development collaboration with Cytovia to develop TALEN¬Æ-edited iPSC NK and CAR-NK cells. Cellectis has developed custom TALEN¬Æ which Cytovia is using to edit iPSCs in a safe and effective manner.The poster presentation will occur on November 11  from 9:00AM until 9:00PM ET  Poster Hall.Corporate UpdatesAppointmentOn September 28  2022  Cellectis announced the appointment of Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  as Chief Medical Officer.Dr Frattini joined Cellectis in August 2020 as Senior Vice President of Clinical Sciences and has been responsible for Cellectis‚Äô clinical leadership including the clinical development strategy of the Company‚Äôs current immune-oncology UCART product candidates. He has also been serving as a core member of the senior clinical team and has been managing a team of physicians and clinical scientists. As Chief Medical Officer  Dr. Frattini oversees clinical research and development for Cellectis‚Äô UCART clinical trial programs. He remains based in Cellectis‚Äô New York office and has joined the Company‚Äôs executive committee.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 51.2% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of September 30  2022)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúIFRS‚Äù).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments ‚Äì Therapeutics and Plants ‚Äì in the appendices of this Q3 2022 financial results press release.Cash: As of September 30  2022  Cellectis  including Calyxt  had $103 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of which $95 million are attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This compares to $191 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2021  of which $177 million was attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This net decrease of $88 million primarily reflects (i) $81 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and lease financing activities of Cellectis  (ii) $17 million of net cash flows used in operating  capital expenditures and lease financing activities of Calyxt  and (iii) a $10 million unfavorable foreign exchange (FOREX) impact which was partially offset by (i) $10 million of net proceeds from capital raised at Calyxt in February 2022  (ii) $6 million of cash received related to research tax credit prefinancing and (iii) $3 million of cash received related to licenses and milestone payments. Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis excluding Calyxt anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of September 30  2022 will fund Cellectis‚Äô operations into early 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $9 million for the nine months ended September 30  2022 compared to $53 million for the nine months ended September 30  2021. 99% of consolidated revenues and other income was attributable to Cellectis in the first nine months of 2022. This decrease between the nine months ended September 30  2022 and 2021 was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease of revenue pursuant to the recognition of a $15 million convertible note obtained as consideration for a ‚Äúright-to-use‚Äù license granted to Cytovia and a $5 million Allogene milestone during the nine-month period ended September 30  2021  while revenue related to collaboration agreements for the nine months of 2022 consists of the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis‚Äô agreement with Cytovia for $2 million and the recognition of $1 million related to a change of control of a licensee pursuant to the terms of its license agreement with Cellectis and the amendment to the license agreement (extension of the option term) (ii) a decrease in other revenues of $24 million relating to a change in Calyxt‚Äôs business model for its PlantSpring technology and BioFactory  in which no significant revenue was yet recognized.Cost of Revenues: Consolidated cost of revenues were $1 million for the nine months ended September 30  2022 compared to $29 million for the nine months ended September 30  2021. This decrease is driven by the change in Calyxt‚Äôs business model for its PlantSpring and BioFactory.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $85 million for the nine months ended September 30  2022 compared to $97 million for the nine months ended September 30  2021. 89% of consolidated R&D expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first nine months of 2022. The $11 million decrease between the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $10 million (from $57 million in 2021 to $47 million in 2022) due to lower consumables  subcontracting costs and depreciation and amortization for the therapeutic segment  (ii) a $1 million decrease in social charges on stock option  and (iii) a $3 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense partially offset by an increase of $3 million in wages and salaries mainly driven by the increased R&D headcount in the therapeutic segment.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $25 million for the nine months ended September 30  2022 compared to $28 million for the nine months ended September 30  2021. 62% of consolidated SG&A expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first nine months of 2022. The $3 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $3 million decrease in wages and salaries  (ii) a $1 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $14 million in 2021 to $12 million in 2022) partially offset by (i) a $3 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense mainly explained by the favorable impact in 2021 of the recapture of non-cash stock-based compensation from the forfeiture of certain of Calyxt‚Äôs former CEO‚Äôs unvested stock options  restricted stock units  and performance stock units following his departure.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $79 million (or $1.74 per share) for the nine months ended September 30  2022  of which $73 million was attributed to Cellectis  compared to $89 million (or $2.00 per share) for the nine months ended September 30  2021  of which $75 million was attributed to Cellectis. This $10 million decrease in net loss between first nine months 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by (i) an increase in net financial gain of $14 million  (ii) a decrease of $28 million of cost of revenue  (iii) a $11 million decrease of research and development and  (iv) a $3 million decrease of SG&A expenses partially offset by a decrease in revenues and other income of $45 million.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $72 million (or $1.58 per share) for the nine months ended September 30  2022  of which $67 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of $80 million (or $1.79 per share) or the nine months ended September 30  2021  of which $66 million was attributed to Cellectis.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense‚Äîa non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis‚Äô financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company‚Äôs operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME ‚Äì Third Quarter(unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month period ended September 30  2021 2022 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (37 413 ) (28 467 ) Adjustment: 5 062 1 880 Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (32 351 ) (26 587 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.71 ) (0.58 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 45 471 977 45 540 315 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.71 ) (0.58 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 45 471 977 45 540 315When we have adjusted net loss  in accordance with IFRS  we use the Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic to compute the Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share).

Growth was +7.0% on a like-for-like basis compared to third-quarter 2021  a satisfactory performance given the absence of any material contribution from Covid support contracts during the quarter. Adjusted for this non-recurring impact  third-quarter like-for-like growth was +13.8%  building on the increased momentum observed in the second quarter across both of the Group's activities.Revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨6 002 million for the first nine months of 2022  a year-on-year increase of +6.0% at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation (like-for-like) and of +15.7% as reported. Reported revenue was also lifted by the +‚Ç¨286 million positive currency effect  stemming mainly from the rise in the US dollar against the euro. Changes in the scope of consolidation had a +‚Ç¨203 million positive impact  reflecting the consolidation of Health Advocate from July 1  2021 and of Senture from January 1  2022.Like-for-like growth in the first nine months of 2022 was particularly strong given the negative impact of lower revenue from Covid support contracts (down -‚Ç¨394 million compared with the first nine months of 2021). Adjusted for this expected non-recurring impact  like-for-like growth stood at +13.2% for the period.This strong momentum is based in particular on the Group's robust and diversified client portfolio.

The acceleration in business growth observed in the second quarter of the year continued apace in the third quarter.Revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨5 160 million in the first nine months of 2022  a year-on-year increase of +4.2% like-for-like. Reported growth came to +12.1%  with the difference versus like-for-like growth primarily attributable to the rise against the euro in the US dollar and most other currencies including the Brazilian real  the Indian rupee  the Mexican peso and the Colombian peso. In addition  reported growth includes the contribution of Senture  which has been consolidated in the Group's financial statements from January 1  2022.Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  the Core Services & D.I.B.S. activity delivered +12.4% growth on a like-for-like basis in the first nine months. This strong momentum is based in particular on the Group‚Äôs robust and diversified client portfolio.English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)In the third quarter  revenue for the region was ‚Ç¨612 million  slightly down (-1.5%) on a like-for-like basis  affected by the sharp decline in the revenue contribution of Covid support contracts in the United Kingdom. Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  like-for-like growth was +8.4%.Revenue was ‚Ç¨1 787 million for the first nine months of 2022  stable compared to the prior year with a like-for-like increase of +0.2%. The reported increase of +18.3% was primarily attributable to favorable currency effects ‚Äì corresponding to the rise against the euro in the US dollar and  to a lesser extent  in the Indian rupee  the Philippine peso and the pound sterling‚Äì and the positive impact of consolidating Senture from January 1  2022.Revenue remained stable throughout the nine-month period due mainly to the sharp decline in the revenue contribution of Covid support contracts in the United Kingdom  which was expected. Excluding Covid support contracts  like-for-like growth for the EWAP region was +10.7%.In the North American market  revenue in the social media  online entertainment  travel and financial services sectors continued to grow at a brisk pace.Offshore activities in the Philippines have been growing at a very rapid pace since the beginning of the year. They are attractive for effectively addressing the temporary recruitment difficulties encountered in the US domestic labor market.In the United Kingdom  activities excluding the impact of Covid support contracts accelerated significantly in the third quarter in the banking and insurance sectors and with government agencies.Ibero-LATAMIn the third quarter  revenue came to ‚Ç¨588 million  up +16.8% on a like-for-like basis.Nine-month revenue for the Ibero-LATAM region came to ‚Ç¨1 687 million  a year-on-year increase of +16.9% like-for-like. The reported increase of +23.1% mainly reflected the rise in the US dollar  Brazilian real  Mexican peso and Colombian peso against the euro.This once again very satisfactory performance is largely attributable to the Group's assertive operations in the social media  online entertainment  healthcare  financial services and travel sectors.Growth remained strong in most countries in the region. Business growth was particularly robust in Argentina  Peru  the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Multilingual hubs in Spain and Portugal are enjoying further rapid expansion.Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)In the third quarter  revenue in the CEMEA region came to ‚Ç¨401 million  down -5.3% on a like-for-like basis  due to the sharp decline in the contribution from Covid support contracts. Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  like-for-like growth was +11.5%.Revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨1 275 million in the first nine months of 2022  a year-on-year decline of -8.2% like-for-like and of -9.1% as reported  with the difference corresponding to negative currency effects due mainly to the fall of the Turkish lira against the euro. The like-for-like decline in revenue is linked to the sharp decrease in the contribution from Covid support contracts in the Netherlands  France and Germany. Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  business growth reached +7.7% on a like-for-like basis  accelerating steadily throughout the first nine months of the year.The Group reaped the rewards of many new contract start-ups and buoyant business with multinational clients  particularly in the travel  automotive  financial services and online entertainment sectors.IndiaIn the third quarter  revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨148 million  up +24.7% like-for-like  a sharp acceleration compared with the first half of the year.In the first nine months of 2022  operations in India generated ‚Ç¨411 million in revenue  up +20.3% like-for-like from the prior-year period and by a stronger +28.3% as reported  due to the positive currency effect caused by the rise in the Indian rupee against the euro.Offshore activities  which are the main source of regional revenue and include high value-added solutions for all English-speaking markets  were very robust. Offshore solutions are particularly attractive since they effectively address temporary recruitment difficulties encountered in the domestic labor market.Specialized ServicesIn the third quarter  revenue was ‚Ç¨307 million  up +18.8% on a like-for-like basis.Revenue from Specialized Services stood at ‚Ç¨842 million in the first nine months of 2022  a year-on-year increase of +19.1% like-for-like and of +44.7% as reported. The difference between like-for-like and reported growth stemmed from a favorable currency effect linked to the increase in value of the US dollar against the euro and a positive scope effect in the first half due to the consolidation of Health Advocate in the Group's financial statements since July 1  2021.The recovery in TLScontact volumes continued in the third quarter. However  business has still not reached its full potential due to the lockdowns in China.The growth of LanguageLine Solutions  the main contributor to Specialized Services revenue  accelerated in the third quarter. The healthcare sector  which accounts for more than half of this business' revenue  notably continued to deliver rapid growth.OutlookBarring unforeseen events  Teleperformance‚Äôs businesses should continue to grow actively in the fourth quarter  supported by the ramp-up of contracts signed in 2022. Based on the growth from upbeat operations in the first nine months  Teleperformance has raised its full-year 2022 guidance to:- like-for-like revenue growth  excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  of more than +12%  compared with an initial growth objective of more than +10%  which should also enable the Group to exceed the initial target of like-for-like growth of +5%;- an EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of more than 21%- an EBITA margin before non-recurring items of around 15.5% respectively  up +40 basis points versus 2021  and up +10 basis points versus the initial 2022 target of a +30 basis point increase.---------------------------------DisclaimerAll forward-looking statements are based on Teleperformance management‚Äôs present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

These buildings under construction are 93.7% pre-let28 projects delivered during the year representing 576 000 m¬≤  or ‚Ç¨ 31 million in additional annual rent (of which 11 projects totalling 240 000 m¬≤ delivered during the 2H 2022) and a further 460 000 m¬≤ estimated for delivery in the remainder of 2022P hotovoltaic capacity grew exponentially y-o-y to 120.9MWp operational or under construction and with a further 67.9MWp being planned. Once built  the significant photovoltaic roll-out ‚Äì which is already generating ‚Ç¨3.7 million revenues YTD ‚Äì will match our 2021 tenant electricity consumption. This contributed to the three star GRESB developer rating and elevated the portfolio compliance on the Paris-aligned 1.5 - degree decar bonisation pathway until the year 2045 which moves us significantly closer to a 1.5-degree ready portfolio under CRREMContinuing strong relationship with Allianz Real Estate evidenced by:(i) Second closing of VGP Park M√ºnchen joint venture with Allianz Real Estate on track for December 2022 with proceeds of circa ‚Ç¨70 million to be expected;(ii) Including the upcoming closing for VGP Park M√ºnchen the total JV closing in 2022 will amount to an annual record of more than ‚Ç¨800 million;(iii) Additional closing expected in Q1 2023 with the First Joint Venture for a total GAV of more than ‚Ç¨ 100 million. The transaction is currently under due diligence;(iv) Profit distribution from the joint ventures gaining momentum with profit distribution year to date totalling ‚Ç¨28.2 million with a further ca. ‚Ç¨30 million profit distribution to be received during November 20221 925 000 m¬≤ of new development land acquired during the year (of which 378 000 m¬≤ during 2H 2022) and 696 000 m¬≤ of development land deployed during the year to support the new developments started up during the year. Total secured development land bank stand at 10 683 000 m¬≤ at the end of October 2022 representing a development potential of circa 5 million m¬≤VGP‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer  Jan Van Geet: ‚ÄúVGP is having a very solid year in terms of growth and cash generation and an absolute record year in terms of completions of long-let projects to our clients: now these rents turn effective this generates a significant boost in our recurring revenue.‚ÄùJan Van Geet added: ‚ÄúThese record deliveries have made evident once again that VGP's DNA is of course closely linked to the constant development of new projects. As we look forward  we see a significant need for high quality new developments  driven by many factors  as the world of tomorrow is one of sustainability and efficiency driven by smart technologies and artificial intelligence. I believe that we have only seen a fraction of the efficiency potential yet  more innovations to optimise energy and operational efficiency are inevitably going to transform our industry in the years ahead of us. I do believe that our team is well set-up to deliver those highly complex  tailor-made  and sustainable solutions to the highest quality matching future customer needs  and above all that it is set-up to do that in all the countries we are active in in a consistent way. This is critical as our long-term development activities will always be driven by our ability to meet such client demand and our profitability looking forward.‚ÄùJan Van Geet concluded: ‚ÄúIt is equally important to point out to the fact that  as an economy does not develop in a linear way we have  besides the developer gains  always built different sources of recurring income ‚Äì besides rental income and income from our renewable energy sources also facility and property management fees and asset management fees. These recurrent income streams  boosted by the record delivery of buildings over the past years are now becoming a substantial part of our income and give us ample room to pay out dividends in the future and strengthen substantially VGP‚Äôs balance sheet on a standalone basis. Indeed  we have always deliberately chosen to keep recurring income from our assets partly on our balance sheet ourselves  partly through JVs we manage. Furthermore as a result  combined with the existing cash on balance sheet  undrawn RCFs and planned Munich joint venture closing we have enough means available to cover our commitments well beyond 2023.‚ÄùOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS ‚Äì 10M 2022Lease activities and resilienceSigned and renewed rental income of ‚Ç¨53.1 million driven by 721 000 m 2 of new lease agreements signed (corresponding to ‚Ç¨40.3 million of new annualised rental income 3 )  combined with 241 000 m 2 of lease agreements renewed (corresponding to ‚Ç¨12.7 million of annualised rental income 4 ) and ‚Ç¨3.7 million of indexation.Of the signed rent agreements in 2022 over half the committed rent comes from Logistics (53%) (of which 40% is general logistics  13% is non-food retail logistics and 1% is food-retail logistics)  followed by E-commerce (21%) and Light industrial (15%) (of which 4% is automotive related industry) and 10% is defined in another category.Germany was the main driver of the growth in committed leases with ‚Ç¨17.4 million (40%) of new leases 5 signed during the year (of which ‚Ç¨ 5.8 million on behalf of the Joint Ventures 6 ). The other countries also performed very well: new leases being signed in Romania +‚Ç¨ 4.3 million (10%) (‚Ç¨0.3 million on behalf of JV portfolio)  Spain +‚Ç¨4.0 million (9%) (‚Ç¨2.6 million on behalf of JV portfolio)  Netherlands +‚Ç¨3.9 million (9%) (‚Ç¨3.4 million on behalf of the JV portfolio)  Slovakia +‚Ç¨3.6 million (9 %) (‚Ç¨0.9 million on behalf of JV portfolio)  Czech Republic +‚Ç¨ 3.4 million (8%) (‚Ç¨2.5 million on behalf of JV portfolio)  Hungary +‚Ç¨2.8 million (6%) (‚Ç¨0.1 million on behalf of JV portfolio)  Austria +‚Ç¨2.4 million (5%) (‚Ç¨0.1 million on behalf of JV portfolio)  Latvia +‚Ç¨0.7 million (2%) (own portfolio)  Italy +‚Ç¨1.0 million (2%) (‚Ç¨0.4 million on behalf of JV portfolio) and Portugal +‚Ç¨0.6 million (1%) (own portfolio).Terminations represented a total of ‚Ç¨9.1 million or 170 000 m 2 (of which 118 000 m 2 within the Joint Ventures‚Äô portfolio). VGP has been able to release premisses so far at overall higher rental prices. As an example  in Germany  VGP‚Äôs largest market  VGP was able to increase as such its average rental price per square meter by 15%.The total signed lease agreements increased to ‚Ç¨291.0 million annualised committed rental income (equivalent to circa 5.0 million m 2 of lettable area) from ‚Ç¨256.1 million as of 31 December 2021. A 13.6% increase year-to-date.The signed committed lease agreements of the own portfolio represent a total of 2 038 000 m¬≤ of lettable area (‚Ç¨116.5 million of annualised committed leases) with the weighted average term of the annualised committed leases standing at 9.8 years 7 as at the end of October 2022.The signed committed lease agreements of the Joint Ventures‚Äô portfolio represent a total of 2 971 000 m¬≤ of lettable area (‚Ç¨174.5 million of annualised committed leases) with the weighted average term of the annualised committed leases standing at 7.3 years 8 as at the end of October 2022.The weighted average term of the annualised leases of the combined own and Joint Ventures‚Äô portfolio stood at 8.3 years 9 at the end of October 2022 compared to 8.6 years at the end of December 2021.The Annualised Committed Leases are composed of ‚Ç¨207.7 million lease agreements which have already become effective as of 31 October 2022 and ‚Ç¨83.3 million signed lease agreements which will become effective in the future. The breakdown as to when the Annualised Committed Leases will become effective is as follows:In Million EUR Current <1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years >3 years Total Own 64.1 44.2 5.7 0.6 1.9 116.5 Joint Ventures at 100% 143.6 30.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 174.5 Total 207.7 75.1 5.7 0.6 1.9 291.0Virtually all lease agreements include indexation clauses  of which the majority are uncapped  making the property portfolio well protected against inflation. Most of the existing leases are indexed in the first months of the year with the year-to-date indexation totalling ‚Ç¨3.7 million of rent equivalent. It is expected that this amount will rapidly ramp up when the current high inflation levels will be charged through to tenants during the first half of 2023.Based on the lease agreements becoming effective in 2023  for every 5% of inflation 4% will be passed on as indexation through increase of rent. Assuming a 10% inflation rate  rent would be increased by 7% during the same year (8% rent increase in respect of the own portfolio and 7% in respect of the Joint Ventures‚Äô portfolio).Development activitiesDuring the second half of 2022  VGP completed another 11 buildings representing 240 000 m¬≤ of lettable area  i.e.: in the Czech Republic: one building of 29 500 m¬≤ in VGP Park Hradek nad Nisou  one building of 15 800 m¬≤ in VGP Park Kladno  and one building of 5 500 m¬≤ in VGP Park Chomutov; in Germany: one building of 67 200 m¬≤ in VGP Park Laatzen and one building of 20 400 m¬≤ in VGP Park Rostock; in Spain: one building of 29 600 m¬≤ in VGP Park Sevilla Dos Hermanas and two buildings totalling 34 800 m¬≤ in VGP Park Zaragoza; in the other countries  one building of 10 700 m¬≤ in VGP Park Budapest Aerozone (Hungary)  one building of 18 300 m¬≤ in VGP Park Bratislava (Slovakia)  and finally one building of 8 200 m¬≤ in VGP Park Graz 2 (Austria).This brings the total of delivered projects for the first ten months of 2022 to 28 projects  adding 576 000 m 2 of lettable area representing ‚Ç¨31.6 million of annualized leases and which are 99.3% let.16 new projects have started up in the course of 2022 which represent 316 000 m 2 of future lettable area representing ‚Ç¨23.3 million of annualised leases once fully built and let.A total of 39 projects under construction at the end of October 2022 which will add 1 253 000 m 2 of future lettable area representing ‚Ç¨82.8 million of annualised leases once fully built and let (93.7% pre-let).Geographical split of parks under construction  based on square meters: 57% are located in Germany (17% attributable to VGP Park M√ºnchen and 40% to other projects in Germany)  11% in Romania  8% in Hungary  6% in the Netherlands  6% in Latvia  5% in the Czech Republic  2% in Spain  2% in Slovakia  2% in Portugal and 1% in Austria.VGP continues to focus on maintaining its development margins by reviewing any new and existing developments against their respective¬≤ targeted yield on costs10. Reflective of current market dynamics  the targeted average yield on costs are well above 7% for Western Europe  above 7.5% for Southern Europe and above 8% for Central and East Europe11.Land bankDuring the second half of 2022  VGP expanded its land bank further and as at 31 October 2022  the Group (including the Joint Ventures at 100%) has a remaining development land bank in full ownership of 8 164 000 m¬≤ (of which 1 307 000 m¬≤ held by the Joint Ventures) which allows the Group to develop ca. 3 680 000 m¬≤ of future lettable area (of which 622 000 m¬≤ on behalf of the Joint Ventures). In addition  the Group has another 2 519 000 m¬≤ of secured land plots which are expected to be purchased during the next 6 to 18 months  subject to obtaining the necessary permits.This brings the remaining total owned and committed land bank for development as at 31 October 2022 to 10 683 000 m¬≤  which represents a remaining development potential of ca. 4 812 000 m¬≤ of which 706 000 m¬≤ (15%) in Germany  733 000 m¬≤ (15%) in Romania  639 000 m¬≤ (13%) in the Netherlands  464 000 m¬≤ (10%) in the Slovak Republic  487 000 m¬≤ (10%) in Serbia  422 000 m¬≤ (9%) in Spain  323 000 m¬≤ (6%) in Hungary  316 000 m¬≤ (7%) in Italy  263 000 m¬≤ (5%) in the Czech Republic  138 000 m¬≤ (3%) in Austria  149 000 m¬≤ (3%) in France  120 000 m¬≤ (2%) in Portugal  38 000 m¬≤ (1%) in Croatia and the remaining balance of 14 000 m¬≤ in Latvia.From an asset value perspective  the land bank is predominantly Western European-based but on the bases of square meters the land bank is well spread across the countries in which we operate.Due to the overall market circumstances  we do anticipate more  predominantly brownfield  opportunities to become available in the coming 12 months ‚Äì we remain vigilant and are prepared for such opportunities to be seized at the right time.ESG initiatives and sustainable energy89 roof-solar installations with a total capacity of 120.9 MWp ‚Äì of which own operational photovoltaic capacity doubled y-o-y to 40.4MWp  15.1MWp third-party operated and 65.4MWp of own installations are currently under construction. This is being realised through a ‚Ç¨ 40.7 million investment to date (and a further ‚Ç¨28.8 million committed). In addition  the identified pipeline equates to an additional power generation capacity of 67.9 MWp.The potential current annual energy production  including PV projects under construction and in the pipeline is estimated at 168 318 MWh per year  which is equal to the total electricity consumption of all our tenants in VGP buildings in 2021.The GRESB score for the Group has made significant progress in 2022; the development portfolio received one additional star to three green stars.VGP performed its second CRREM study (Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor) in 2022. The analysis was done on the entire portfolio (based on GRESB submission; as of December 2021; including JVs at 100%). The results are encouraging as the portfolio remains compliant on a 1.5¬∞C decarbonization pathway until 2037 which is a 10-year improvement versus last year‚Äôs results. Taking also into account the expected annual energy production of current photovoltaic systems in the pipeline the portfolio compliance will be extended until 2045 and over 40% still compliant in 2050.The first certificate for EU Taxonomy compliance was received for a standing asset and going forward VGP aims for all new developments to achieve an EPC A energy label  EU taxonomy compliance  a BREEAM Excellent or DGNB Gold certificate and will no longer use gas heating where this is feasible.The Group‚Äôs earlier announced carbon reduction roadmap targets across scope 1-3 are set taking the science-based target constraints into account (see Corporate Responsibility Report 2021 for further details)  the Group has now engaged on a formal SBTi validation path  feedback is anticipated in 2023.Allianz Real Estate and developments with regards to Joint VenturesSecond closing of VGP Park M√ºnchen joint venture with Allianz Real Estate on track for December 2022 with proceeds of ca. ‚Ç¨70 million to be excepted. Additional equity recycling expected during the first half of 2023 through the partial refinancing by already secured bank debt.Including the upcoming closing for VGP Park M√ºnchen  VGP and Allianz Real Estate will have completed 4 Joint Venture closings in 2022 resulting in a transfer of a record more than ‚Ç¨800 million in gross asset value.Next closing expected in Q1 2023 with the First Joint Venture for a total gross asset value of more than ‚Ç¨100 million. The transaction is currently under due diligence.Profit distribution from joint ventures is gaining momentum with profit distribution year to date totalling ‚Ç¨28.2 million with a further ca. ‚Ç¨30 million profit distribution to be received during November 2022.OutlookNotwithstanding assets being transferred to the joint ventures  the recurring cash generating part of VGP‚Äôs business is continuing to grow to a considerable size with total contracted annual rental and fee income on a proportional look-through basis due to rise substantially during the next 12 months. Thus will significantly increase the recurring cash generation of the Group.At the moment of publication of the FY2022 financial results  scheduled for release on 23 February 2023  VGP will further communicate on the dividend proposal. The expected dividend distribution will be reviewed in the light of the current dividend policy and taking the longer-term target of dividend coverage (by recurring net rental and fee income and dividend distributions received from the joint ventures minus recurring expenses) into consideration.Due to the overall market circumstances VGP anticipates more  predominantly brownfield  opportunities to become available during the next 12 months. VGP remains vigilant and is prepared for such opportunities to be seized at the right time and price.CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing) Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432Forward-looking statements: This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

12622,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4552465-wall-street-breakfast-no-pivot-yet,Wall Street Breakfast: No Pivot Yet,Listen on the go! A daily podcast of Wall Street Breakfast will be available by 8:00 a.m. on Seeking Alpha  iTunes  Stitcher and Spotify.,"No pivot yetInvestors need some time off after a topsy-turvy year  but things may not be better at the local amusement park. Fed Chair Jay Powell took the market on another rollercoaster on Wednesday  with a series of loop-the-loops aboard a ride known as the Dove-Hawk Twister. When all was said and done  the Dow dropped 500 points  while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slumped 2.5% and 3.6%  respectively  after initially soaring on the Fed's announcement (that came along with a 75 bps rate hike).Steep turns: ""With the lags between policy and economic activity  there's a lot of uncertainty  so that we note that in determining the pace of future increases will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy  as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation... that's why I've said at the last two press conferences that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming  and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that.""""We may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting. The incoming data since our last meeting suggests the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. The risks are asymmetric. If the Fed does too much  it can cut. If it doesn't tighten enough  then you‚Äôre in real trouble... It is very premature to be thinking about pausing... We think we have a ways to go.""Bottom line: Powell and Co. will be watching the data and evolving market conditions before making any significant pivot. The Non-Farm Payrolls report for October is out tomorrow  followed by the Consumer Price Index on Nov. 10  and Personal Consumption Expenditures on Dec. 1. The latter is the Fed's preferred measurement for inflation as it captures changes in consumer behavior and has a broader scope than the CPI. Global macro events will also be considered like Russia's war against Ukraine and the effects of China's zero-COVID policy. (78 comments)Radical reductionIn a bid to drive down costs  Elon Musk plans to eliminate 50% of Twitter (TWTR) workforce today  which would result in nearly 3 700 layoffs  according to Bloomberg. The platform's work-from-anywhere policy would also be rescinded  with most of the remaining employees required to report to the office. In one scenario being considered  laid-off workers will be offered 60 days' worth of severance pay as Musk looks to gut a business for which he says he overpaid (the transaction valued Twitter at $44B).Snapshot: A series of layoffs started as soon as Musk took over the social media company  including CEO Parag Agrawal  finance chief Ned Segal and senior legal staffers Vijaya Gadde and Sean Edgett. In the days that followed  other departures have included Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland  Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette  and Jean-Philippe Maheu  vice president of global client solutions. After the layoffs were sorted  Twitter Chief Accounting Officer Robert Kaiden reportedly left the company  becoming one of the last pre-Musk C-suite executives to depart.In recent weeks  Musk has started hinting at his staffing priorities  saying he wants to focus on the core product. ""Software engineering  server operations & design will rule the roost ‚Äù he tweeted in early October. On the product side  the company will soon start charging $8-a-month for verification  which includes badges  and could go live as early as Monday. Reports suggest that users who already have a blue check will have a multi-month grace period before they will either need to pay for the badge or lose it.Not alone: In October  Meta Platforms (META) announced that it was eliminating 15% of its staff  or approximately 12 000 employees at Facebook  to slash its headcount as global headwinds and falling ad spends pose serious problems. In August  Snap (SNAP)  the maker of the ephemeral messaging app Snapchat  laid off 20% of its workforce. (26 comments)Grain dealRussia has agreed to return to a Turkish and U.N. brokered agreement that allowed the shipment of millions of tons of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. It had previously pulled out of the deal following an alleged Ukrainian drone attack in Crimea over the weekend. Moscow now says ""written assurances"" from Kyiv guarantee that it would not use the humanitarian maritime corridor for military purposes  so the shipments could continue unobstructed.Market movement: Wheat futures plunged in the U.S. and Europe on Wednesday  as well as other commodities. On the Chicago Board of Trade  wheat for December delivery (W_1:COM) settled down 6.3% to $8.46 per bushel  and December corn (C_1:COM) closed off 1.5% to $6.87 a bushel. The benchmark December contract on Euronext also settled 4.6% lower to ‚Ç¨341.25/metric ton.There's been some debate over how much leverage Russia's Vladimir Putin really holds over the deal  with the grain shipments continuing on Monday and Tuesday (and a one day interruption on Wednesday). Some say that the parties involved could push ahead despite Moscow's objections  though others feel that it would be hard to ink shipping and insurance contracts to underwrite the voyages. Whatever the case may be  Putin will likely try to gain additional leverage ahead of the deal's original expiration date of Nov. 19  and before the upcoming G20 Summit in Bali.Stats: Over the past two months  more than 400 ships departing Ukraine exported 9.9M metric tons of corn  wheat  sunflower products  barley  rapeseed and soy under the Black Sea Grain Initiative.

Apple (AAPL) closed out Wednesday's session with a market capitalization of $2.307T  making it more valuable than Alphabet (GOOG  GOOGL)  Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) combined (worth a total of $2.306T). The latter group even started 2022 worth $4.410T  compared to the valuation of the iPhone maker at $2.913T.Free cash flow: ""Take a look at last quarter. Apple FCF: $20 billion  Google FCF: $16 billion  Meta FCF: $0.3 billion  Amazon FCF: -$5 billion "" tweeted financial YouTuber Joseph Carlson  who first pointed out the comparison. ""Now of course one quarter doesn't paint the full picture. But Apple is posting massive FCF like clockwork. The others are not.""The four companies also reported earnings last week and only Apple's results were met with a positive market reaction. Macs selling at a record pace outweighed a slight miss on iPhone sales  while the Tim Cook-led firm beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Weak growth  some misses and downbeat forecasts weighed on the other tech giants  while many are worried about Meta's experimental pivot to a digital avatar-filled universe given its lack of regard to spending as the business burns billions.Commentary: ""Perhaps it's investor expectations  demanding perfection across complicated conglomerates "" wrote Mark Shmulik  senior internet analyst at Bernstein  following the quarterly figures last week. ""Or maybe Internet mega-caps are a lot less agile than we thought and [are] either unable or unwilling to adapt to a changing operating environment. What if it's just structural and Internet incumbents need to spend an ever-increasing amount of capital in their mature years to keep competitors at bay? All the above.""

Growth in service revenues  up 7.9% in reported currency terms (+7.8% in local currency)  was a key driver of the Group‚Äôs strong revenue performance. Non telecom related revenues in Russia continued to decline and constituted 7.9% of total Group reported revenue in 3Q22 versus 10.4% in 3Q21.In 3Q22  Group EBITDA was flat YoY in reported currency terms (+0.7% in local currency)  with Group EBITDA margin of 42.8% (-1.5 p.p. YoY). To protect the profitability margins of the business  we remain focused on implementing planned cost-efficiency measures across the Group and on implementing inflationary pricing.Group EBITDA YoY performance was impacted by a number of extraordinary non-recurring items in 3Q22 and in 3Q21  as noted in the Country Performance section. Excluding these one-off items  Group EBITDA increased 1.9% YoY in local currency.In 3Q22  we reported growth of 0.8% YoY in our subscriber base. The Group continued to focus on the overall customer experience in our 4G networks.This supported the 15.1% YoY increase in our 4G users  which reached 107.1 million  with 14.1 million users added over the previous 12 months. 4G subscribers now account for 52.7% of our total subscriber base  up 6.5 p.p. from a year ago.On the back of our growing 4G penetration  we have been able to expand our digital operator offerings across our operations. This has driven the growth of our multiplay customer base (+24.5% YoY)  which reached 33.4 million during 3Q22. Multiplay customer ARPU is 4.3 times higher and churn is 2.4 times lower than single play voice-only customers.Our financial services business in Pakistan  JazzCash  ended the quarter with 16.7 million MAUs  an increase of 20.0% YoY.

Our operations are largely self-funding and do not require financing from the HQ to fund their operations  including capex.In Ukraine  the team continued to keep the country connected  with around 90% of our radio network operational at quarter end. However  recent damage to Ukrainian power infrastructure has had an impact on network availability.

Kyivstar‚Äôs 4G customer base grew 4.7% YoY  and our customers consumed more data  with usage rising 29.7% YoY. EBITDA was down 10.7% YoY in local currency (-31.1% in reported currency) in 3Q22.

Revenue was impacted by a 58.5% decline in equipment revenue due to lower device sales  while the YoY strength of the Russian ruble supported the growth in reported financial performance. 3Q22 mobile service revenue was up 2.1% YoY in local currency  as the continued growth in the 4G customer base drove mobile data revenue higher by 7.5% YoY in local currency. In Russia  EBITDA increased 7.3% in local currency (+32.7% YoY in reported currency). This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of EBITDA YoY growth in local currency.Pakistan revenues increased 12.0% YoY in local currency (-17.1% YoY in reported currency)  driven by strong growth in data revenue  despite the negative impact of the increase in withholding tax from 10% to 15% on 16 January 2022 and the further reduction in mobile termination rates in 2H22. The Jazz team continued to deliver balanced growth in subscriber base (+5.0% YoY) and ARPU (+4.3% YoY) in 3Q22.

EBITDA in Pakistan declined 6.8% in local currency (-30.8%YoY in reported currency).In Kazakhstan  revenues increased 23.1% YoY in local currency (+10.3% in reported currency)  another quarter of strong growth supported by further expansion of our mobile customer base (+7.3% YoY)  higher data usage (+18.8% YoY) and inflationary pricing of tariffs.

We are closely monitoring events in Russia and Ukraine  as well as the possibility of the imposition of further sanctions in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and any resulting further rise in tensions between Russia and the United States  the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services.The broad nature of the financial sanctions targeted at the Russian financial system  including several banks that have historically provided funding to the Company  the comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may have a material impact on the Company‚Äôs operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine. Over the next few months  we will be undertaking our annual assessment as required by IFRS to determine the potential need for further impairment charges  which is not as of yet determinable due to a number of factors  including the fluidity of the current situation and our ability to obtain relevant data required to build a business plan given the ongoing conflict and associated uncertainties. We may report significant impairment charges with respect to assets in Ukraine  Russia and/or other operating companies for the nine-months ended 30 September 2022. However  we are still gathering the necessary data and we are not able at this time to estimate the amount or range of this potential impairment charge to the income statement. Such an impairment charge  if any  would have no impact on the Company‚Äôs cash flow. It is possible further impairment charges may rise to such a level on an accounting basis as to require additional analysis of true asset values in order to determine the true value of assets to be compared to liabilities as outlined in the provisions of our debt agreements.DisclaimerVEON‚Äôs results presented in this trading update are  unless otherwise stated  based on IFRS and have not been externally reviewed and audited.

As we look forward  we see a significant need for high quality new developments  driven by many factors  as the world of tomorrow is one of sustainability and efficiency driven by smart technologies and artificial intelligence. I believe that we have only seen a fraction of the efficiency potential yet  more innovations to optimise energy and operational efficiency are inevitably going to transform our industry in the years ahead of us. I do believe that our team is well set-up to deliver those highly complex  tailor-made  and sustainable solutions to the highest quality matching future customer needs  and above all that it is set-up to do that in all the countries we are active in in a consistent way. This is critical as our long-term development activities will always be driven by our ability to meet such client demand and our profitability looking forward.‚ÄùJan Van Geet concluded: ‚ÄúIt is equally important to point out to the fact that  as an economy does not develop in a linear way we have  besides the developer gains  always built different sources of recurring income ‚Äì besides rental income and income from our renewable energy sources also facility and property management fees and asset management fees. These recurrent income streams  boosted by the record delivery of buildings over the past years are now becoming a substantial part of our income and give us ample room to pay out dividends in the future and strengthen substantially VGP‚Äôs balance sheet on a standalone basis. Indeed  we have always deliberately chosen to keep recurring income from our assets partly on our balance sheet ourselves  partly through JVs we manage. Furthermore as a result  combined with the existing cash on balance sheet  undrawn RCFs and planned Munich joint venture closing we have enough means available to cover our commitments well beyond 2023.‚ÄùOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS ‚Äì 10M 2022Lease activities and resilienceSigned and renewed rental income of ‚Ç¨53.1 million driven by 721 000 m 2 of new lease agreements signed (corresponding to ‚Ç¨40.3 million of new annualised rental income 3 )  combined with 241 000 m 2 of lease agreements renewed (corresponding to ‚Ç¨12.7 million of annualised rental income 4 ) and ‚Ç¨3.7 million of indexation.of new lease agreements signed (corresponding to ‚Ç¨40.3 million of new annualised rental income )  combined with 241 000 m of lease agreements renewed (corresponding to ‚Ç¨12.7 million of annualised rental income ) and ‚Ç¨3.7 million of indexation.

The Annualised Committed Leases are composed of ‚Ç¨207.7 million lease agreements which have already become effective as of 31 October 2022 and ‚Ç¨83.3 million signed lease agreements which will become effective in the future. The breakdown as to when the Annualised Committed Leases will become effective is as follows:In Million EUR Current <1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years >3 years Total Own 64.1 44.2 5.7 0.6 1.9 116.5 Joint Ventures at 100% 143.6 30.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 174.5 Total 207.7 75.1 5.7 0.6 1.9 291.0Virtually all lease agreements include indexation clauses  of which the majority are uncapped  making the property portfolio well protected against inflation. Most of the existing leases are indexed in the first months of the year with the year-to-date indexation totalling ‚Ç¨3.7 million of rent equivalent. It is expected that this amount will rapidly ramp up when the current high inflation levels will be charged through to tenants during the first half of 2023.Based on the lease agreements becoming effective in 2023  for every 5% of inflation 4% will be passed on as indexation through increase of rent. Assuming a 10% inflation rate  rent would be increased by 7% during the same year (8% rent increase in respect of the own portfolio and 7% in respect of the Joint Ventures‚Äô portfolio).Development activitiesDuring the second half of 2022  VGP completed another 11 buildings representing 240 000 m¬≤ of lettable area  i.e.: in the Czech Republic: one building of 29 500 m¬≤ in VGP Park Hradek nad Nisou  one building of 15 800 m¬≤ in VGP Park Kladno  and one building of 5 500 m¬≤ in VGP Park Chomutov; in Germany: one building of 67 200 m¬≤ in VGP Park Laatzen and one building of 20 400 m¬≤ in VGP Park Rostock; in Spain: one building of 29 600 m¬≤ in VGP Park Sevilla Dos Hermanas and two buildings totalling 34 800 m¬≤ in VGP Park Zaragoza; in the other countries  one building of 10 700 m¬≤ in VGP Park Budapest Aerozone (Hungary)  one building of 18 300 m¬≤ in VGP Park Bratislava (Slovakia)  and finally one building of 8 200 m¬≤ in VGP Park Graz 2 (Austria).This brings the total of delivered projects for the first ten months of 2022 to 28 projects  adding 576 000 m 2 of lettable area representing ‚Ç¨31.6 million of annualized leases and which are 99.3% let.of lettable area representing ‚Ç¨31.6 million of annualized leases and which are 99.3% let. 16 new projects have started up in the course of 2022 which represent 316 000 m 2 of future lettable area representing ‚Ç¨23.3 million of annualised leases once fully built and let.of future lettable area representing ‚Ç¨23.3 million of annualised leases once fully built and let.

Reflective of current market dynamics  the targeted average yield on costs are well above 7% for Western Europe  above 7.5% for Southern Europe and above 8% for Central and East Europe11.Land bankDuring the second half of 2022  VGP expanded its land bank further and as at 31 October 2022  the Group (including the Joint Ventures at 100%) has a remaining development land bank in full ownership of 8 164 000 m¬≤ (of which 1 307 000 m¬≤ held by the Joint Ventures) which allows the Group to develop ca. 3 680 000 m¬≤ of future lettable area (of which 622 000 m¬≤ on behalf of the Joint Ventures). In addition  the Group has another 2 519 000 m¬≤ of secured land plots which are expected to be purchased during the next 6 to 18 months  subject to obtaining the necessary permits.This brings the remaining total owned and committed land bank for development as at 31 October 2022 to 10 683 000 m¬≤  which represents a remaining development potential of ca. 4 812 000 m¬≤ of which 706 000 m¬≤ (15%) in Germany  733 000 m¬≤ (15%) in Romania  639 000 m¬≤ (13%) in the Netherlands  464 000 m¬≤ (10%) in the Slovak Republic  487 000 m¬≤ (10%) in Serbia  422 000 m¬≤ (9%) in Spain  323 000 m¬≤ (6%) in Hungary  316 000 m¬≤ (7%) in Italy  263 000 m¬≤ (5%) in the Czech Republic  138 000 m¬≤ (3%) in Austria  149 000 m¬≤ (3%) in France  120 000 m¬≤ (2%) in Portugal  38 000 m¬≤ (1%) in Croatia and the remaining balance of 14 000 m¬≤ in Latvia.From an asset value perspective  the land bank is predominantly Western European-based but on the bases of square meters the land bank is well spread across the countries in which we operate.Due to the overall market circumstances  we do anticipate more  predominantly brownfield  opportunities to become available in the coming 12 months ‚Äì we remain vigilant and are prepared for such opportunities to be seized at the right time.ESG initiatives and sustainable energy89 roof-solar installations with a total capacity of 120.9 MWp ‚Äì of which own operational photovoltaic capacity doubled y-o-y to 40.4MWp  15.1MWp third-party operated and 65.4MWp of own installations are currently under construction. This is being realised through a ‚Ç¨ 40.7 million investment to date (and a further ‚Ç¨28.8 million committed). In addition  the identified pipeline equates to an additional power generation capacity of 67.9 MWp.The potential current annual energy production  including PV projects under construction and in the pipeline is estimated at 168 318 MWh per year  which is equal to the total electricity consumption of all our tenants in VGP buildings in 2021.The GRESB score for the Group has made significant progress in 2022; the development portfolio received one additional star to three green stars.VGP performed its second CRREM study (Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor) in 2022. The analysis was done on the entire portfolio (based on GRESB submission; as of December 2021; including JVs at 100%). The results are encouraging as the portfolio remains compliant on a 1.5¬∞C decarbonization pathway until 2037 which is a 10-year improvement versus last year‚Äôs results. Taking also into account the expected annual energy production of current photovoltaic systems in the pipeline the portfolio compliance will be extended until 2045 and over 40% still compliant in 2050.The first certificate for EU Taxonomy compliance was received for a standing asset and going forward VGP aims for all new developments to achieve an EPC A energy label  EU taxonomy compliance  a BREEAM Excellent or DGNB Gold certificate and will no longer use gas heating where this is feasible.The Group‚Äôs earlier announced carbon reduction roadmap targets across scope 1-3 are set taking the science-based target constraints into account (see Corporate Responsibility Report 2021 for further details)  the Group has now engaged on a formal SBTi validation path  feedback is anticipated in 2023.Allianz Real Estate and developments with regards to Joint VenturesSecond closing of VGP Park M√ºnchen joint venture with Allianz Real Estate on track for December 2022 with proceeds of ca. ‚Ç¨70 million to be excepted. Additional equity recycling expected during the first half of 2023 through the partial refinancing by already secured bank debt.Including the upcoming closing for VGP Park M√ºnchen  VGP and Allianz Real Estate will have completed 4 Joint Venture closings in 2022 resulting in a transfer of a record more than ‚Ç¨800 million in gross asset value.Next closing expected in Q1 2023 with the First Joint Venture for a total gross asset value of more than ‚Ç¨100 million. The transaction is currently under due diligence.Profit distribution from joint ventures is gaining momentum with profit distribution year to date totalling ‚Ç¨28.2 million with a further ca. ‚Ç¨30 million profit distribution to be received during November 2022.OutlookNotwithstanding assets being transferred to the joint ventures  the recurring cash generating part of VGP‚Äôs business is continuing to grow to a considerable size with total contracted annual rental and fee income on a proportional look-through basis due to rise substantially during the next 12 months. Thus will significantly increase the recurring cash generation of the Group.At the moment of publication of the FY2022 financial results  scheduled for release on 23 February 2023  VGP will further communicate on the dividend proposal. The expected dividend distribution will be reviewed in the light of the current dividend policy and taking the longer-term target of dividend coverage (by recurring net rental and fee income and dividend distributions received from the joint ventures minus recurring expenses) into consideration.Due to the overall market circumstances VGP anticipates more  predominantly brownfield  opportunities to become available during the next 12 months. VGP remains vigilant and is prepared for such opportunities to be seized at the right time and price.CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen Huybrechts(Head of Marketing) Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432Forward-looking statements: This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Our expertise in maximizing audiences and monetization of labels and artists in the digital ecosystem unlocks new opportunities every day.‚Äùin ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Change YoY Organic change1 Group Revenues 143.9 197.0 36.9% 37.6% Premium Solutions 135.3 184.4 36.2% 37.7% Automated Solutions 8.6 12.6 46.8% 36.1% in ‚Ç¨ million 9M 2021 9M 2022 Change YoY Organicchange Group Revenues 404.1 549.2 35.9% 36.3% Premium Solutions 378.4 513.6 35.7% 36.7% Automated Solutions 25.7 35.6 38.9% 30.8%Key highlightsBelieve‚Äôs strong growth in Q3‚Äô22 once again demonstrated the strength of Believe‚Äôs model in the artist and label markets. The Group continued to gain market share across all segments (from music creators to independent labels and top local artists) in all markets around the world.Believe‚Äôs products and solutions allowed to grow artists and labels at a much faster rate on all key digital music services through continued investments. Believe‚Äôs priority is to build capacity in its key markets and provide local teams with best-in-class products and solutions  developed by the Group‚Äôs Central Platform teams and leveraged across all local entities. The quality of service enabled by the model resulted in a strong performance from the existing portfolio of artists and labels during the quarter.Believe continues its expansion in Asia  which will be the #1 market in the world in the next 10 years  with several initiatives in Southeast Asia. The Group strengthened its leadership team in the region  with several appointments of Managing Directors at regional and country level (Indonesia  Thailand and Philippines). Believe has leadership positions in most of the 8 markets of the region  driving the growth of local acts. The Group operates across all its segments (Premium and Automated) and has invested consistently for the past 10 years  deploying first its Label and Artists Solutions to cater for the emerging and established artists segment in 8 markets  then its Artist Services in 3 markets  addressing the top artists‚Äô needs. During the last quarter Believe launched Byond in Thailand  an Artist Services brand to develop and support hip-hop artists and music locally. Sourcing from the existing TuneCore and Label & Artist Solutions roster  Byond has already successfully signed iconic acts including Saran who reached 1 billion of streams in 2022  as well as Zentyarb  K.Aglet  SD Thaitay  Z9  BlackHeart  DIEOUT  Mona V  Cyanide  T-BIGGEST  Pondering and Rap is Now. In addition  aligned with its commitment to offer best-in-class service to music creators  TuneCore (Automated Solutions) accelerated its localization efforts in Southeast Asia to ensure the most positive user experience. TuneCore has been growing significantly in the region since the implementation of its Social Platforms‚Äô revenue share offer  allowing music creators to easily distribute their music on the predominant social medias  which represents a strong funnel for new subscriptions. TuneCore has partnered with a global financial technology platform in Q3‚Äô22 to offer localized payment methods to the growing music creators base in the region  who preferred alternative payments to credit cards. Similar programs will be rolled out in other countries and regions that share like patterns in the coming months.The Group established new teams and partnerships during the quarter to address opportunities in music genres that are developing rapidly in digital or currently accelerating their digitalization. Believe launched b.electronic in October  a global initiative to specifically address the growing number of electronic and dance music labels and artists looking for the right partner to maximize their audience reach at a global scale and optimize the revenue sources. This new solution echoes the fast growth of the global electronic and dance music market  that grew +32% in FY‚Äô21 versus +18% for the market according to IMS (International Music Summit  the premier thought leadership platform for electronic music). It responds to specific needs of labels and artists from this genre  inherently targeting audiences beyond their local border. Believe will rely on highly experienced Central and Local teams of experts in key markets who have a global view on the genre to develop the portfolio of labels and artists. The signing of Big Top Amsterdam label  one of the major players in the global dance industry reflects such initiative. Big Top Amsterdam can count on all-stars like Bakermat and Gamper & Dadoni on its roster  each with over a billion streams  as well as creators Supermassive (who have built 1.8 million followers on TikTok and 1.5 million followers on YouTube)  and breakthrough Swedish producer Kronan among many other talents. The new-born partnership with Believe will play a crucial role in the international and digital growth of the label and its artists.Believe continued to nurture its relationships with major streaming providers and social platforms during the quarter by renewing partnerships with greater benefits for its artists and labels  as well as by early moving on their new initiatives. Believe was for example among the first players to participate in YouTube‚Äôs ‚ÄúCreator Music‚Äù initiative  a new digital storefront that allows creators to easily license popular music for use in their videos  generating revenue both for them and music rights holders.In alignment with its corporate project Shape Music for Good  Believe continued to promote gender parity in the music industry during the quarter. Believe hosted for the second year in a row the Gender Equality Hub at the Reeperbahn festival in Hamburg (Germany) in partnership with Keychange  the pioneering international initiative aiming at creating a more gender representative and inclusive music industry for present and future generations. The Hub offered masterclasses with key industry leaders who shared their expertise and encouraged women and other underrepresented groups in the music industry to be seen and to become part of the Keychange initiative. Faithful to its driving force of fairness  the Group launched in September its first collective employee shareholder scheme  which provides employees with the opportunity to be directly associated with the future of Believe. Participation rate reached 40% in the six countries where the plan was implemented and 57% in France. Believe‚Äôs commitment to its corporate social responsibility resulted in better ESG performances compared to its industry peers  as reflected by its metric ‚ÄúGender Equality Index‚Äù for France (99/100) and its AA MSCI ESG rating  the highest level reached within the Media index.RevenuesQ3‚Äô22 revenues grew by +36.9% to reach ‚Ç¨197.0 million (versus ‚Ç¨143.9 million in Q3‚Äô21)  mainly reflecting strong organic growth (+37.6%). In Q3‚Äô22  core digital activities represented 93.7% of Group‚Äôs revenues and increased by +39.6% year-over-year driven by continued growth in paid streaming  notably in emerging markets  and better monetization of ad-funded streaming services  even if the growth rate of ad-funded revenues has been weaker compared to the previous quarters as expected. The growth was amplified by additional market share gains at largest digital streaming providers both in mature and emerging countries thanks to the built-up of local capabilities and Believe‚Äôs expertise in developing digital audience and monetizing the artists and labels served by the Group. Non-digital sales grew by 6.1% in Q3‚Äô22 mostly thanks to merchandising  live and synchronization notably in France.Q3‚Äô22 performance reflected strong momentum in both segments. Premium Solutions revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨184.4 million in Q3‚Äô22  a year-over-year organic increase of +37.7% compared with Q3‚Äô21. The success of Premium Solutions stemmed from the Group‚Äôs investment over the past 24 to 36 months to strengthen local capabilities and roll out more services in key countries. This allowed the Group to serve a greater number of artists and labels with best-in-class services and to address a wider variety of music genres. Automated Solutions revenues reached ‚Ç¨12.6 million and grew by +46.8% in Q3‚Äô22 compared to last year  mostly reflecting solid organic growth of +36.1% and a positive forex impact related to the dollar appreciation versus the euro. Q3‚Äô22 performance reflected the appeal of TuneCore‚Äôs ‚ÄúUnlimited Pricing‚Äù program  which is driving subscription up  with revenue per subscriber on a positive trend as music creators are switching from the discovery offer to the highest pricing plan. Believe recorded solid performances in most markets except in the Russian and Ukrainian business units which grew +8.8% in Q3‚Äô22  resulting in an organic growth of +9.0% year-to-date. The Group excluding the two business units grew organically by +40.5% in Q3‚Äô22.Believe has been growing strongly since January with revenues up +35.9% year-to-date mostly reflecting a +36.3% organic growth for the period closing at the end of September (organic growth reached +39.2% outside Russia and Ukraine). Non-digital revenues further recovered notably thanks to merchandising and live activities in France. Overall  Believe continued to outperform the market and further reinforced its position in digital music in both segments and in all regions.Revenues by geography: growth in all geographiesin ‚Ç¨ million Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Change YoY APAC / Africa 32.5 52.3 61.1% France 24.2 34.1 41.2% Americas 21.2 28.6 35.1% Europe (excl. France & Germany) 40.9 53.1 29.8% Germany 25.2 28.8 14.4% Total 143.9 197.0 36.9%The level of activity in Asia Pacific and Africa remained strongly buoyant with revenues up 61.1% in Q3‚Äô22 compared to last year  representing 26.6% of group revenues. Market dynamics remained very strong in India and China and across Southeast Asia  as the Group leveraged the roll-out of all services in most territories and reinforced its local teams. The Group also benefitted from its strategic partnerships signed in Q4‚Äô21 in India (Think Music) and in the Philippines (VMAG)  which accelerated organic growth in both local markets.In France  revenues represented 17.3% of Group revenues and increased by +41.2% in Q3  driven by the strong performance of the existing catalogue of artist and labels and the strategic partnerships signed with Play Two and Jo&Co which allowed Believe to represent a wider variety of music genres in the market. Digital revenues were firmly up  but revenues also benefitted from a strong catch up of live and merchandising activities.In Americas  revenues grew by +35.1% and represented 14.5% of Group revenues  resulting from a strong activity level in Latin America notably in Brazil  and a firm acceleration in Automated Solutions following early success of TuneCore‚Äôs new Unlimited Pricing plans.In Europe (excluding France and Germany)  revenues grew by +29.8% and represented 27.0% of total revenues in Q3‚Äô22. The level of activity was particularly sustained in the UK and in Italy  and on a strong growth trajectory in South Europe and Eastern Europe. Revenues in the region were nevertheless affected by a slower pace of growth in Russia and in Turkey.In Germany  revenues grew by +14.4% compared to last year and represented 14.6% of revenues. Non-digital revenues still dragged down on the overall performance  while digital revenues were up very strongly during the quarter  reflecting the expertise of Believe in developing monetization for artists and labels in the digital ecosystem.FY 2022 outlook and organic growth guidance updateIn Q3‚Äô22  Believe remained on H1‚Äô22 solid organic growth trajectory. Paid streaming demonstrated its resilience and grew strongly in most of the Group's key markets. Growth in ad-supported streaming revenue decelerated compared to H1‚Äô22  stabilizing around June‚Äôs level as expected. The switch from ad-supported to paid streaming in emerging markets is progressing steadily. The Group expects the music industry to continue to show resilience and that paid streaming will continue its global deployment.Believe now expects FY22 organic growth to exceed +30% for the Group  above prior expectations provided on August 3  2022 (c. +29%) and above the range for the period 2021-2025 presented at the IPO (+22% to +25%). This target assumes that revenue growth in the Russian and Ukrainian units remains in line with the level achieved in Q3'22. It also includes a positive impact of around 2% linked to the extension of the services agreements concerning Play Two  Jo&Co (France)  Think Music (India) and VMAG (the Philippines)  which were concluded as part of the strategic partnerships signed with these companies in Q4'21.Based on higher organic growth than initially anticipated  Believe now expects an adjusted EBITDA margin of c. 4.5% above prior expectations of a stable margin year-over-year (FY'21: 4%)  as Central Platform costs will be better amortized. As the focus remains on accelerating investments  the annual margin improvement remains gradual. Believe intends to continue to invest significantly in Central Platform and local teams in the coming years to fuel future profitable growth  while actively managing the investment cycle with the objective of further improving efficiency.The Group also confirms that it will generate positive and solid free cash flow for the full year. This will result from a positive change in working capital and lower capital expenditure as a % of revenues. In addition  free cash flow will benefit from an annual installment of approximately ‚Ç¨20 million from one of its digital partners  which was renewed in Q3‚Äô22.Overall  the Group is on track with its strategic roadmap to build the best digital music company and confirms its medium-term trajectory communicated at the IPO  including a 2021-2025 CAGR of between +22% and +25% and a Group Adjusted EBITDA of 5%-7% by 2025  implying a segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%-16%  which is a ""high growth period"" margin  with revenue growth largely reinvested. Believe remains confident in its ability to achieve its long-term target of a 15% Group Adjusted EBITDA margin.Webcast:We will host a webcast https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/vkdevk96 and conference call starting at 6:30 p.m. CET today.

TruGraf Liver is the first diagnostic tool that leverages gene expression data‚Äîpowered by TGI's proprietary technology and machine learning‚Äîto give the earliest and most accurate view of immune quiescence.Due to the significant complications associated with the use of immunosuppression  clinicians may choose to reduce immunosuppression for liver transplant recipients to minimize these complications. Until now  immunosuppression optimization has largely been a ""trial and error"" process  with clinicians relying only on laboratory and clinical indicators of graft injury  resulting from the effects of immune activation. TruGraf Liver is the first and only blood-based test that offers biomarker guidance to aid physicians in optimizing immunosuppression in transplant recipients  to allow for a superior balance between graft rejection and adverse events.The first commercial TruGraf Liver tests were performed in August 2022  from samples drawn at Houston Methodist Hospital's J.C.

The hydrogen initiative is an important milestone for Absolut Vodka in becoming completely CO 2 neutral by 2030. A prerequisite for being able to meet this goal is in reducing the carbon footprint of its glass packaging.Absolut has been a partner with Ardagh's Limmared glassworks in Sweden for 40 yearsAbsolut has signed an agreement with Ardagh Glass Packaging in Limmared  a subsidiary of Ardagh Group  to use this partly hydrogen-fired furnace commencing in the second half of 2023. The pioneering collaboration will accelerate the transformation of the global glassmaking process for a more sustainable future.Absolut has been a partner with Ardagh's Limmared glassworks in Sweden for 40 years  which currently uses a combination of natural gas and electricity to power its furnaces. From the second half of 2023  Ardagh will launch a pilot in its Limmared plant replacing 20 per cent of its natural gas with green hydrogen to manufacture all of Absolut's bottles across its portfolio. This means a full-scale change of the continuous production of Absolut bottles for all markets globally. The hydrogen will be produced onsite at Ardagh by using renewably sourced electricity.An industry wide quest for reducing climate impact is taking place. Combined with other innovations and sustainability initiatives  new technologies such as hydrogen furnaces will reduce carbon emissions from glass production significantly.The use of hydrogen would reduce Absolut Vodka's carbon footprint from glass by 20%. It follows other joint initiatives to reduce carbon emissions  such as the light-weighting of glass  increased use of electricity in the current furnace and a significant increase in recycled flint glass ‚Äì today reaching 53% with the ambition to go even further.Absolut owns one of the world's most energy-efficient distilleries. It has 98 per cent fewer emissions than an average distillery and has built up a surplus of emission rights as a result. The intent is to use these to invest in green transformation. Absolut will support Ardagh in this project and the parties will work together to fulfill Absolut's ambitions of a CO 2 neutral product by 2030 by using today's and tomorrow's best available technologies in glass manufacturing.St√©phanie Durroux  Chief Executive of The Absolut Company  says: ""Given we've been investing in our own production for decades  decreasing our emissions and increasing energy efficiency  we're now in a position where we also can focus on the parts of our value chain that are outside or our own scope. The glass manufacturing industry is in a transformative journey  and the world can't wait for the perfect solution. A bold and innovative approach is needed to accelerate radical change that will help solve the significant sustainability challenges that all glassmakers and buyers of glass face.""Bo Nilsson  Managing Director of Ardagh Glass Limmared AB  added: ""Our industry needs to be less reliant on fossil fuels and transition at pace to using more green energy. By investing in this new technology  we are embarking on a journey to reduce the carbon footprint of our glass packaging. There are challenges with such innovation  but we are committed to being an early mover in future-proofing our glass manufacturing operations world-wide.""For more information  assets or interview requests  please contact:Michael Lamb[email protected]+44 75124 30936Notes to editors:About The Absolut CompanyThe Absolut Company has the worldwide responsibility for the production  packaging innovation and strategic marketing of Absolut Vodka  Malibu and Kahl√∫a.Absolut Vodka is one of the world's top ten international spirits brands.
