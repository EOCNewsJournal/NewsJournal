The split of the EV business from Renault‚Äôs traditional combustion-engine operations comes as the maker of Zoe and Clio cars seeks to navigate a difficult transition to electric vehicles as a possible recession looms in Europe.Renault will brief investors about its revamp plans  which are still being finalized  during a capital markets day on Nov. 8. A spokesperson declined to comment.Ampere‚Äôs carveout has been at the heart of talks between Renault and Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co. as the two companies seek to reshape a two-decade-old alliance. Nissan may invest $500 million to $750 million for a stake of about 15% in Ampere but the agreement hinges on a wider deal that would see Renault lower its own 43% stake in Nissan to about 15% over time to rebalance the alliance  people familiar with the situation have said.Higher Value?The talks are ongoing and valuation of Ampere has been among sticking points in the Nissan discussions  which have also hit snags over intellectual property concerns. Renault is currently worth 9 billion euros and it may be tricky for the carmaker to obtain a valuation for Ampere that‚Äôs higher than its own market capitalization.Story continuesThe IPO would be subject to market conditions  the person familiar with the situation said. Recent turbulence in share prices has put a damper on new offerings.De Meo also will be giving details next week on Renault‚Äôs legacy combustion-engine business  dubbed Horse  which also is being carved out. Renault may announce a deal with China‚Äôs Zheijiang Geely Holding Group for 50%-50% ownership of Horse until other investors make further investments  two people familiar with the talks said.Ampere will be based in France and employ about 10 000 people. The Horse entity with Geely would be based outside of France and also have a staff of about 10 000.The French government  which owns 15% of Renault  has been briefed in detail about the plans  one person said.The separation of the two businesses is likely to lead to ‚Äúa better capital allocation and eventually to improved shareholder returns ‚Äù Stifel analyst Pierre-Yves Quemener wrote in a note this month.--With assistance from Reed Stevenson.(Updates with background on Ampere)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.27,0.2,0.52,True,English,"['$10 Billion Valuation', 'Electric-Vehicle Business', 'Renault', 'Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo', 'potential initial public offering', 'Stifel analyst Pierre-Yves Quemener', 'Zheijiang Geely Holding Group', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'traditional combustion-engine operations', 'possible recession looms', 'intellectual property concerns', 'capital markets day', 'legacy combustion-engine business', 'Nissan Motor Co', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'The Horse entity', 'capital allocation', 'electric-vehicle business', 'standalone entity', 'software entity', 'Clio cars', 'difficult transition', 'electric vehicles', 'Japanese partner', 'two companies', 'Higher Value', 'market capitalization', 'market conditions', 'Recent turbulence', 'share prices', 'new offerings', 'French government', 'two businesses', 'shareholder returns', 'Reed Stevenson', 'EV business', 'Nissan discussions', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'French carmaker', 'two-decade-old alliance', 'wider deal', '9 billion euros', 'revamp plans', 'other investors', 'two people', 'one person', 'Renault SA', '10,000 people', 'matter', 'company', 'information', 'carveout', 'Ampere', 'overhaul', 'split', 'Zoe', 'Europe', 'Nov.', 'spokesperson', 'heart', 'talks', 'stake', 'agreement', 'time', 'situation', 'points', 'snags', 'Story', 'IPO', 'damper', 'details', 'China', '50%-50% ownership', 'investments', 'France', 'staff', 'separation', 'note', 'assistance', 'Updates', 'background']",2022-11-04,2022-11-05,finance.yahoo.com

The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 27 October 2022  will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $8.50 up to and including $10.25 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 7 December 2022  unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000  then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000. The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or about 9 December 2022  and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.Story continuesThe tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon. The full details of the tender offer  including complete instructions on how to tender shares  are included in the offer to purchase which is available on Tetragon's website at the following URL:http://www.tetragoninv.com/investors/share-repurchases/2022Shareholders should read carefully the offer to purchase because it contains important information.

The company also presented its financial results for the third quarter of 2022.Paul Stoffels3  CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Galapagos  commented: ‚ÄúToday we presented our strategic vision for our future as a financially sustainable biopharma company. Building on our strong fundamentals  we are convinced that we are taking the right steps to deliver on our core mission: adding years of life and improving the quality of life of patients globally.Focusing on our strategic therapeutic areas  we strive to push forward our deep  differentiated portfolio in immunology  build out our oncology franchise  and execute on business development opportunities with the aim to accelerate innovation and speed up time-to-patients  while creating long-term value for our stakeholders.‚ÄùStory continuesStrategic updateBuilding on our strong fundamentals  we aim to build a financially sustainable biopharma company  accelerating cutting-edge therapies to market to address unmet medical needs in our core key therapeutic areas of oncology and immunology.Our renewed focus on two strategic therapeutic areas goes hand in hand with redirecting our resources. To further streamline our portfolio  we have decided to discontinue activities in fibrosis and kidney disease to allow for increased investments in our oncology franchise.To shape our portfolio of innovative drugs with accelerated time-to-market  we intend to combine internal innovation with smart business development and apply deep clinical expertise to push programs through an optimal development process.Based on these guiding principles  we presented our Vision 2028 portfolio outlook. Over the course of the next five years  we aim to build a portfolio comprising:over 10 assets in lead optimization and five in preclinical development across different modalities (small molecules  cell therapy  biologics) five pivotal-stage candidates forming a solid late-stage pipeline in immunology and cell therapy  anda growing commercial presence with additional marketed indications for Jyseleca¬Æ and one CAR-T therapy approved in multiple indications.Financial visionAligned with our Vision 2028  we presented our financial outlook and capital allocation strategy at our R&D Day 2022. Discontinuation of our fibrosis and kidney efforts allows for reinvesting in oncology.With Jyseleca¬Æ potentially breaking even in 2024  and projected peak sales of ‚Ç¨500 million in Europe and first oncology revenues potentially contributing to our topline later this decade  we are committed to building a sustainable financial future  with a significantly reduced cash burn by 2028.OncologyWe also presented our Vision 2028 roadmap for oncology at our R&D Day 2022. Our core mission in the field is to broaden patient access and improve clinical outcomes by bringing best-in-class medicines to patients.With the combined acquisitions of CellPoint and AboundBio announced earlier this year  we positioned ourselves in the cell therapy space  combining the potentially disruptive manufacturing and delivery model of CellPoint (Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ  a closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapy) with the ability to develop next-generation CAR-Ts  small molecules and biologics.Short term  our aim is to validate the decentralized CAR-T delivery model with proven CAR-T therapies  and we announced the addition of a BCMA Phase 1/2 trial on the Cocoon¬Æ platform. This complements the currently ongoing CD19 Phase1/2 programs in recurring/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (rrNHL; ATALANTA study) and recurring/refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (rrCLL; EUPLAGIA study).In the coming years  we intend to build a pipeline of best-in-class cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and leverage our capabilities to rapidly address unmet needs in oncology.Today  we showcased the robust process performance of the Cocoon¬Æ system as well as first encouraging biomarker patient data of the CAR-T expansion profile with a 7 day-point-of-care vein-to-vein treatment. Topline Phase 1 results of both the rrNHL and rrCLL study are expected in the first half of 2023  followed by initial data of the BCMA study later in the year.Next year  we also aim to broaden the studies to include U.S. patients  and we plan to submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for both the CD19 and BCMA CAR-T programs with the FDA.ImmunologyWe have built up over 20 years of expertise in immunology  resulting in a deep and growing pipeline with multiple modes-of-action candidate medicines across all phases of development  from preclinical to Phase 4.We are excited about our selective TYK2 inhibitor  ‚Äò3667  for which we presented new data elucidating its potentially differentiating selectivity and potency profile. Ex vivo and in vivo data show that ‚Äò3667 fully blocks the INFa pathway with once-daily dosing  while in our assays JAK2 and JAK1/3 dependent pathways are not affected. Further  no effects on hematological parameters  lipids and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were observed  suggesting that ‚Äò3667 does not show JAKi ‚Äòfingerprints‚Äô at therapeutic doses. Also based on the positive results in psoriasis patients  we presented our development plan for ‚Äò3667  confirming the start of a Phase 2 study in dermatomyositis (GALARISSO) around year-end and the intention to start a Phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2023.We also presented an update on our SIKi portfolio  a potential novel mode-of-action in immunology. With targeted investments  we continue to make important progress in developing next-generation best-in-class candidates that reach optimal target coverage  teasing apart selectivity profiles that indicate the potential of SIK3i for rheumatological indications and SIK2/3i for inflammatory bowel disease. Our most advanced candidate  SIK3 inhibitor ‚Äò4399  has shown strong preclinical evidence for potential in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (EULAR 20224)  with a promising pharmacological and safety profile. We are planning to start a proof-of-mechanism study in RA patients with ‚Äò4399 mid 2023.For filgotinib  our selective JAK1 inhibitor  we are completing a Phase 3 program in Crohn‚Äôs disease (CD)  with results expected in the first half of 2023. Given the sales momentum and supportive long-term safety and efficacy data generated for filgotinib  we are currently exploring additional indications for filgotinib  and plan to start a Phase 3 study in axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) in 2023.Commercial progressSince becoming European marketing authorization holder (MAH) of Jyseleca¬Æ  we successfully set up our own commercial capabilities and are currently operational throughout Europe in the current approved indications RA and ulcerative colitis (UC).The financial results for the third quarter of 2022 show continued strong sales momentum for Jyseleca¬Æ  and we further raise our net sales guidance 2022 from ‚Ç¨75-‚Ç¨85 million at H1 2022 to ‚Ç¨80-‚Ç¨90 million.In the future  we aim to leverage our European commercial infrastructure beyond Jyseleca¬Æ  in line with our Vision 2028  to have at least one CAR-T cell therapy on the market within five years.Jyseleca¬Æ is a trademark of Galapagos NV and Gilead Sciences  Inc. or its related companies. Except for filgotinib‚Äôs approval as Jyseleca¬Æ for the treatment of moderately to severely RA and UC by the relevant regulatory authorities in the European Union  Great Britain  and Japan  our drug candidates are investigational; their efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines. We are committed to improving patients‚Äô lives worldwide by targeting diseases with high unmet needs. Our R&D capabilities cover multiple drug modalities  including small molecules and cell therapies. Our portfolio comprises discovery through to Phase 4 programs in immunology  oncology  and other indications. Our first medicine for rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis is available in the European Union  Norway  Great Britain  and Japan.

In our outreach to private banking clients as their trusted advisers  we find that they wish to stay invested.‚ÄúWe notched up solid commercial developments in the third quarter of 2022. Total net inflows in assets under management worked out at ‚Ç¨0.6 billion in the quarter. Drawing on our combined expertise in private banking  investment management and investment banking  we are further enhancing our product offering  a case in point being the launch of our Private Real Estate Pool in the quarter.

The mandate will get underway in the fourth quarter of 2022.‚ÄùTotal client assets and assets under management (AuM) were pushed down by a negative market performance in the quarter and ended up at ‚Ç¨115.3 billion (end of June: ‚Ç¨118.5 billion) and ‚Ç¨96.2 billion (end of June: ‚Ç¨99.6 billion) respectively. Client savings rose to ‚Ç¨12.3 billion (end of June 2022: ‚Ç¨11.9 billion). The total loan portfolio remained stable at ‚Ç¨9.1 billion  with mortgage loans accounting for ‚Ç¨6.7 billion. The mortgage portfolio showed a decline in the number of remortgaged and new loans  in line with the market. Van Lanschot Kempen‚Äôs mortgage portfolio comprises Dutch residential mortgage loans with a low risk profile  as evidenced by its low loan-to-value.For Investment Banking Clients  the third quarter was a good one  and commission income continued to shift from capital market transactions to M&A and debt advice  in line with the first six months of the year.Collaboration between Van Lanschot Belgium and Mercier Vanderlinden is proceeding smoothly.

SA which controls 60% of the shares of Sofip√¥le SA.The notification can be consulted on the website of BioSenic  under the heading ‚ÄúShareholder Information‚Äù.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap Investor Relations & Financial CommunicationsPierre Laurent  Louis-Victor Delouvrier and Arthur Rouill√©Tel: +33 (0)1 44 71 94 94bone@newcap.euCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar‚Äôs activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EUR m Q3 22 Q3 21 9M 22 9M 21 Exceptional operating expenses (-) (125) (102) 747 431 IFRIC linearisation (285) (199) 285 199 Transformation costs(1) 160 97 462 232 Of which related to French Retail Banking 100 46 301 106 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 24 23 63 66 Of which related to Corporate Centre 36 28 98 60 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 0 (185) 3 303 (185) Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) 0 3 300 Lyxor disposal(1) 0 3 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) (125) (287) 4 050 246 Reported Net income - Group Share 1 498 1 601 858 3 854 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) (88) (211) 3 631 184 Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 410 1 391 4 489 4 038(1) Allocated to Corporate Centre6 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 43 and 663 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.

Although the application was officially released on October 17  the program itself is currently ""on hold "" with no debt allowed to be forgiven until federal appeals courts  and potentially the Supreme Court  resolve ongoing challenges to the program. While the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) ensures that this debt forgiveness is not subject to federal income taxes  some states are still looking to impose state income taxes.In her new Strategic Perspective entitled ""Fate of Student Loan Forgiveness Program Unclear  but State Income Tax Consequences for Borrowers Taking Shape""  Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S. Senior Legal Analyst Anne H. Gibson offers keen insights on the program by analyzing eligibility  legal opposition  how it differs from other cancellation of debt initiatives  and how state income tax will affect it. In addition  Gibson provides a comprehensive map and chart detailing the quickly developing debt cancellation program. The map highlights states that will tax forgiven student debt  states that will not  and states that may do so. The chart breaks down each state's conformity with the IRC definition of income as well as relevant code sections.Who: Anne H. Gibson  J.D.  LL.M.The student loan forgiveness program is sure to be a boon to many borrowers  but the one-time debt relief could result in an additional tax burden for those living in states that have chosen to tax it. Some opponents of the program have even based their legal challenges on this potential state taxation. - Anne H. Gibson  J.D.  LL.M.

The tender offer  which was initially announced‚Ä¶,"LONDON  Nov. 4  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Tetragon today announces the commencement of a tender offer to purchase a portion of its outstanding non-voting shares for a maximum aggregate payment of $25 000 000 in cash. The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 27 October 2022  will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $8.50 up to and including $10.25 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 7 December 2022  unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000  then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000. The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or about 9 December 2022  and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.The tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon.

12740,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4553605-wall-street-breakfast-what-moved-markets,Wall Street Breakfast: What Moved Markets,Listen on the go! A daily podcast of Wall Street Breakfast will be available by 8:00 a.m. on Seeking Alpha  iTunes  Stitcher and Spotify.,"Despite an inconclusive jobs report that contributed to choppy trading early in the session  stocks finished Friday with modest gains. The advance allowed the major U.S. equity averages to break a four-session losing streak  which was fueled by the Federal Reserve's refusal earlier this week to make a definitive pivot from its ultra-hawkish stance. For the full week the major averages finished lower  with the Dow shedding 1.4%  the S&P off 3.4% and the Nasdaq clipping 5.7%. The tone was set when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than expected and China reopening hopes faded. The 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) ended the week at 4.18% and the 2-year yield (US2Y) stood at 4.67%. Looking ahead  the CPI report and U.S. election loom next week as big events. Read about some of the other major events in Seeking Alpha's Catalyst Watch.Windfall tax?BP (NYSE:BP) became the last of the Big Oil majors to report earnings this week  and the quarterly results quickly got controversial. Underlying replacement cost profit  used as a proxy for net profit  came in at $8.2B in the third quarter  up from $3.3B recorded in the same period a year ago. The report came at a time when commodity prices have surged  with oil and gas prices fueling inflation  in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In the crosshairs: ""Oil companies' record profits today are not because of doing something new or innovative. Their profits are a windfall of war  a windfall for the brutal conflict that's ravaging Ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe "" President Biden said in a statement. ""My team will work with Congress to look at these options that are available to us and others. It's time for these companies to stop war profiteering  meet their responsibilities in this country and give the American people a break and still do very well.""Talk of a windfall tax on energy producers first circulated among progressives  like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren  but it is now gaining traction in mainstream Democratic circles. Others feel that a tax would disincentivize and reduce current production  leading to even higher prices. They say it would also hurt future hydrocarbon investment  which has been weighed down by a regulatory environment that focuses on greener technologies and fails to address supply and demand imbalances.Turning to history: The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 was enacted under the Carter administration  and generated some $80B in gross revenues over the next eight years before being repealed by President Reagan. U.S. crude production declined as much as 8% over the period  according to the Congressional Research Service  while Washington grew increasingly concerned that the tax had increased the nation's dependence on imported oil. The CRS also cautions that despite the ""windfall"" name  it was really in excise tax  that was determined by calculating the ""difference between the market price of oil... and a statutory 1979 base price that was adjusted quarterly for inflation and state severance taxes."" Better examples may be seen from the ""war profiteering"" levy enacted during WWI and a similar excess profits tax adopted during WWII.How much are we talking about? Profits among the Big Oil majors totaled nearly $60B last quarter  including U.S.-based Exxon Mobil (XOM) (+191% Y/Y to $19.7B) and Chevron (CVX) (+84% to $11.2B)  as well as Europe's BP (+145% to $8.2B)  Shell (SHEL) (+129% to $9.5B)  Eni (E) (+161% to $3.7B) and TotalEnergies (TTE) (+43% to $6.6B). American energy giant ConocoPhillips (COP)  which was often included in the list prior to spinning off its downstream operations into Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) a decade ago  reported net income on Thursday that nearly doubled to $4.5B Y/Y. (256 comments)Heart pumpsLooking to boost growth at its medical devices unit  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) agreed to acquire cardiac pump maker Abiomed (ABMD) for an upfront payment of $380 per share  or a total of $16.6B (including debt and cash). An additional $35 per share will be paid if certain sales and regulatory clearance milestones are reached. Abiomed's stock skyrocketed on the news  surging nearly 50% over the session to close at $378.82 on Tuesday.Bigger picture: The deal comes ahead of J&J's planned spinoff of its consumer health business  which sells Tylenol and Band-Aids  into a standalone company in 2023. It will leave J&J more focused on its two remaining divisions  pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Abiomed's fast-growing Impella device  billed as the world's smallest heart pump  could provide a boost to the latter unit  with the device used to treat conditions ranging from a heart attack and failure to clogged arteries.""This acquisition is consistent with that strategy  expanding J&J med tech into high-growth markets  and accelerating revenue growth while advancing the standard of care "" CEO Joaquin Duato declared.Go deeper: J&J is not tightly integrating Abiomed into the rest of its business  and it will operate as a separate entity within its MedTech division. The deal is expected to accelerate its near- and long-term sales growth  and will be slightly dilutive to neutral to its adjusted earnings per share in the first year due to financing impact  but the pharma giant projects the transaction will add nearly $0.05 in 2024 before becoming increasingly accretive thereafter. (28 comments)No pivot yetInvestors need some time off after a topsy-turvy year  but things may not be better at the local amusement park. Fed Chair Jay Powell took the market on another rollercoaster on Wednesday  with a series of loop-the-loops aboard a ride known as the Dove-Hawk Twister. When all was said and done  the Dow dropped 500 points  while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slumped 2.5% and 3.6%  respectively  after initially soaring on the Fed's announcement (that came along with a 75 bps rate hike).Steep turns: ""With the lags between policy and economic activity  there's a lot of uncertainty  so that we note that in determining the pace of future increases will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy  as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation... that's why I've said at the last two press conferences that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming  and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that.""""We may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting. The incoming data since our last meeting suggests the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. The risks are asymmetric. If the Fed does too much  it can cut. If it doesn't tighten enough  then you‚Äôre in real trouble... It is very premature to be thinking about pausing... We think we have a ways to go.""Bottom line: Powell and Co. will be watching the data and evolving market conditions before making any significant pivot. The Non-Farm Payrolls report for October was released Friday  and will be followed by the Consumer Price Index on Nov. 10  and Personal Consumption Expenditures on Dec. 1. The latter is the Fed's preferred measurement for inflation as it captures changes in consumer behavior and has a broader scope than the CPI. Global macro events will also be considered like Russia's war against Ukraine and the effects of China's zero-COVID policy. (101 comments)King CookWhat a difference one year can make. Apple (AAPL) closed out Wednesday's session with a market capitalization of $2.307T  making it more valuable than Alphabet (GOOG  GOOGL)  Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) combined (worth a total of $2.306T). The latter group even started 2022 worth $4.410T  compared to the valuation of the iPhone maker at $2.913T.Free cash flow: ""Take a look at last quarter. Apple FCF: $20 billion  Google FCF: $16 billion  Meta FCF: $0.3 billion  Amazon FCF: -$5 billion "" tweeted financial YouTuber Joseph Carlson  who first pointed out the comparison. ""Now of course one quarter doesn't paint the full picture. But Apple is posting massive FCF like clockwork. The others are not.""The four companies also reported earnings last week and only Apple's results were met with a positive market reaction. Macs selling at a record pace outweighed a slight miss on iPhone sales  while the Tim Cook-led firm beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Weak growth  some misses and downbeat forecasts weighed on the other tech giants  while many are worried about Meta's experimental pivot to a digital avatar-filled universe given its lack of regard to spending as the business burns billions.Commentary: ""Perhaps it's investor expectations  demanding perfection across complicated conglomerates "" wrote Mark Shmulik  senior internet analyst at Bernstein  following the quarterly figures last week. ""Or maybe Internet mega-caps are a lot less agile than we thought and [are] either unable or unwilling to adapt to a changing operating environment. What if it's just structural and Internet incumbents need to spend an ever-increasing amount of capital in their mature years to keep competitors at bay? All the above."" (204 comments)Grain dealRussia agreed to return to a Turkish and U.N. brokered agreement that allowed the shipment of millions of tons of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. It had previously pulled out of the deal following an alleged Ukrainian drone attack in Crimea last Saturday. Moscow said ""written assurances"" from Kyiv guaranteed that it would not use the humanitarian maritime corridor for military purposes  so the shipments could continue unobstructed.Market movement: Wheat futures plunged in the U.S. and Europe on Wednesday  as well as other commodities. On the Chicago Board of Trade  wheat for December delivery (W_1:COM) settled down 6.3% to $8.46 per bushel  and December corn (C_1:COM) closed off 1.5% to $6.87 a bushel. The benchmark December contract on Euronext also settled 4.6% lower to ‚Ç¨341.25/metric ton.There's been some debate over how much leverage Russia's Vladimir Putin really holds over the deal  with the grain shipments continuing on Monday and Tuesday (and a one day interruption on Wednesday). Some say that the parties involved could push ahead despite Moscow's objections  though others feel that it would be hard to ink shipping and insurance contracts to underwrite the voyages.

The company also presented its financial results for the third quarter of 2022.Paul Stoffels3  CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Galapagos  commented: ‚ÄúToday we presented our strategic vision for our future as a financially sustainable biopharma company. Building on our strong fundamentals  we are convinced that we are taking the right steps to deliver on our core mission: adding years of life and improving the quality of life of patients globally.Focusing on our strategic therapeutic areas  we strive to push forward our deep  differentiated portfolio in immunology  build out our oncology franchise  and execute on business development opportunities with the aim to accelerate innovation and speed up time-to-patients  while creating long-term value for our stakeholders.‚ÄùStrategic updateBuilding on our strong fundamentals  we aim to build a financially sustainable biopharma company  accelerating cutting-edge therapies to market to address unmet medical needs in our core key therapeutic areas of oncology and immunology.Our renewed focus on two strategic therapeutic areas goes hand in hand with redirecting our resources. To further streamline our portfolio  we have decided to discontinue activities in fibrosis and kidney disease to allow for increased investments in our oncology franchise.To shape our portfolio of innovative drugs with accelerated time-to-market  we intend to combine internal innovation with smart business development and apply deep clinical expertise to push programs through an optimal development process.Based on these guiding principles  we presented our Vision 2028 portfolio outlook. Over the course of the next five years  we aim to build a portfolio comprising:over 10 assets in lead optimization and five in preclinical development across different modalities (small molecules  cell therapy  biologics) five pivotal-stage candidates forming a solid late-stage pipeline in immunology and cell therapy  anda growing commercial presence with additional marketed indications for Jyseleca¬Æ and one CAR-T therapy approved in multiple indications.Financial visionAligned with our Vision 2028  we presented our financial outlook and capital allocation strategy at our R&D Day 2022. Discontinuation of our fibrosis and kidney efforts allows for reinvesting in oncology.With Jyseleca¬Æ potentially breaking even in 2024  and projected peak sales of ‚Ç¨500 million in Europe and first oncology revenues potentially contributing to our topline later this decade  we are committed to building a sustainable financial future  with a significantly reduced cash burn by 2028.OncologyWe also presented our Vision 2028 roadmap for oncology at our R&D Day 2022. Our core mission in the field is to broaden patient access and improve clinical outcomes by bringing best-in-class medicines to patients.With the combined acquisitions of CellPoint and AboundBio announced earlier this year  we positioned ourselves in the cell therapy space  combining the potentially disruptive manufacturing and delivery model of CellPoint (Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ  a closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapy) with the ability to develop next-generation CAR-Ts  small molecules and biologics.Short term  our aim is to validate the decentralized CAR-T delivery model with proven CAR-T therapies  and we announced the addition of a BCMA Phase 1/2 trial on the Cocoon¬Æ platform. This complements the currently ongoing CD19 Phase1/2 programs in recurring/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (rrNHL; ATALANTA study) and recurring/refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (rrCLL; EUPLAGIA study).In the coming years  we intend to build a pipeline of best-in-class cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and leverage our capabilities to rapidly address unmet needs in oncology.Today  we showcased the robust process performance of the Cocoon¬Æ system as well as first encouraging biomarker patient data of the CAR-T expansion profile with a 7 day-point-of-care vein-to-vein treatment. Topline Phase 1 results of both the rrNHL and rrCLL study are expected in the first half of 2023  followed by initial data of the BCMA study later in the year.Next year  we also aim to broaden the studies to include U.S. patients  and we plan to submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for both the CD19 and BCMA CAR-T programs with the FDA.ImmunologyWe have built up over 20 years of expertise in immunology  resulting in a deep and growing pipeline with multiple modes-of-action candidate medicines across all phases of development  from preclinical to Phase 4.We are excited about our selective TYK2 inhibitor  ‚Äò3667  for which we presented new data elucidating its potentially differentiating selectivity and potency profile. Ex vivo and in vivo data show that ‚Äò3667 fully blocks the INFa pathway with once-daily dosing  while in our assays JAK2 and JAK1/3 dependent pathways are not affected. Further  no effects on hematological parameters  lipids and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were observed  suggesting that ‚Äò3667 does not show JAKi ‚Äòfingerprints‚Äô at therapeutic doses. Also based on the positive results in psoriasis patients  we presented our development plan for ‚Äò3667  confirming the start of a Phase 2 study in dermatomyositis (GALARISSO) around year-end and the intention to start a Phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2023.We also presented an update on our SIKi portfolio  a potential novel mode-of-action in immunology. With targeted investments  we continue to make important progress in developing next-generation best-in-class candidates that reach optimal target coverage  teasing apart selectivity profiles that indicate the potential of SIK3i for rheumatological indications and SIK2/3i for inflammatory bowel disease. Our most advanced candidate  SIK3 inhibitor ‚Äò4399  has shown strong preclinical evidence for potential in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (EULAR 20224)  with a promising pharmacological and safety profile. We are planning to start a proof-of-mechanism study in RA patients with ‚Äò4399 mid 2023.For filgotinib  our selective JAK1 inhibitor  we are completing a Phase 3 program in Crohn‚Äôs disease (CD)  with results expected in the first half of 2023. Given the sales momentum and supportive long-term safety and efficacy data generated for filgotinib  we are currently exploring additional indications for filgotinib  and plan to start a Phase 3 study in axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) in 2023.Commercial progressSince becoming European marketing authorization holder (MAH) of Jyseleca¬Æ  we successfully set up our own commercial capabilities and are currently operational throughout Europe in the current approved indications RA and ulcerative colitis (UC).The financial results for the third quarter of 2022 show continued strong sales momentum for Jyseleca¬Æ  and we further raise our net sales guidance 2022 from ‚Ç¨75-‚Ç¨85 million at H1 2022 to ‚Ç¨80-‚Ç¨90 million.In the future  we aim to leverage our European commercial infrastructure beyond Jyseleca¬Æ  in line with our Vision 2028  to have at least one CAR-T cell therapy on the market within five years.Jyseleca¬Æ is a trademark of Galapagos NV and Gilead Sciences  Inc. or its related companies. Except for filgotinib‚Äôs approval as Jyseleca¬Æ for the treatment of moderately to severely RA and UC by the relevant regulatory authorities in the European Union  Great Britain  and Japan  our drug candidates are investigational; their efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

The European Commission has approved Beyfortus¬Æ (nirsevimab) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. RSV is a common and highly contagious seasonal virus  infecting nearly all children by the age of two.1 2 Beyfortus is the first and only single-dose RSV protective option for the broad infant population  including those born healthy  at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions. Beyfortus is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi‚ÄúToday is a landmark day for RSV prevention  as decades of research and development come together in the world‚Äôs first approval of a broadly protective option against RSV disease. Once launched  Beyfortus will offer parents the ability to help protect their babies during their first RSV season.‚ÄùIskra ReicVaccines and Immune Therapies Unit  AstraZeneca‚ÄúBeyfortus is the first single-dose passive immunization against respiratory syncytial virus to gain approval in Europe and is also the first and only preventative option approved for a broad infant population. Today‚Äôs marketing authorization of Beyfortus marks a significant achievement for the scientific community and addresses a persistent  global unmet need in RSV prevention.‚ÄùSilke MaderChairwoman of the Executive Board and Co-Founder of the European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants (EFCNI)‚ÄúRespiratory syncytial virus represents a health threat among infants  and each year we see the impact it can have on families  healthcare providers and the healthcare system. At EFCNI  we are excited about the opportunity to expand prevention efforts to all infants  as we believe this can help ease the current emotional  physical and financial burdens of RSV.‚ÄùThe European Commission is the first regulatory body to grant approval to Beyfortus. The approval was based on results from the Beyfortus clinical development program  including the Phase 3 MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and Phase 2b trials and follows the recommendation by The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency in September 2022.3-11 In the MELODY and Phase 2b trials  Beyfortus met its primary endpoint of reducing the incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) caused by RSV during the RSV season vs. placebo with a single dose.3-8 The safety profile of Beyfortus was similar to placebo. Beyfortus also demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to palivizumab in the Phase 2/3 MEDLEY trial.9-10 12RSV is the most common cause of LRTI  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants.13 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.14-17 Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than three million hospitalizations  and it was estimated that there were 26 300 in-hospital deaths of children younger than five years.18 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally ‚Äîincluding hospital  outpatient and follow-up care ‚Äî were estimated at ‚Ç¨4.82 billion in 2017.19About BeyfortusBeyfortus¬Æ  a long-acting antibody designed for all infants for protection against RSV disease from birth through their first RSV season with a single dose  is developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Beyfortus has been developed to offer newborns and infants direct RSV protection via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require the activation of the immune system to help offer timely  rapid and direct protection against the disease.20Beyfortus has been granted marketing authorization in the European Union for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants from birth during their first RSV season.In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenue. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of ‚Ç¨120m  has paid a development milestone of ‚Ç¨30m and will pay up to a further ‚Ç¨465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits.Beyfortus has been granted designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designatio n from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and has been named ‚Äúa medicine for prioritized development‚Äù under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The safety and efficacy of Beyfortus was evaluated under an accelerated assessment procedure by the EMA.About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of Beyfortus¬Æ(nirsevimab) against medically attended LRTI through 150 days post-dose. Healthy preterm infants of 29‚Äì35 weeks‚Äô gestation were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  caused by RSV by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2) compared to placebo. Between November 2016 and December 2017  1 453 infants were randomized (Beyfortus  n=969; placebo  n=484) at the RSV season start. Studies were conducted in both hemispheres  at 164 sites in 23 countries.5 6 Data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in July 2020. The dosing regimen was recommended based on further exploration of the phase 2b data.5 The subsequent Phase 3 study  MELODY  applied the recommended dosing regimen.3 4The Phase 3 MELODY trial was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended LRTI due to RSV confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing through 150 days after dosing  versus placebo  in healthy late preterm and term infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season.3 4 The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV by 74.5% (95% CI 49.6  87.1; P<0.001) compared to placebo. Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ‚â•5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or placebo. Between July 2019 and March 2020  1 490 infants were randomized to either Beyfortus or placebo at the RSV season start.3 4 Data was published on the primary analysis in NEJM in March 2022.Findings from Beyfortus‚Äô clinical trial program include a pre-specified pooled analysis of the Phase 3 MELODY trial and the recommended dose from the Phase 2b trial  in which an efficacy (relative risk reduction versus placebo) of 79.5% (95% CI 65.9  87.7; P<0.0001) was seen against medically attended LRTI  such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia  caused by RSV in infants born at term or preterm entering their first RSV season.7 The pooled analysis studied healthy preterm and term infants who received the recommended dose of Beyfortus based on weight compared to placebo through Day 151 and showed an efficacy of 77.3% (95% CI 50.3  89.7; P<0.001) against RSV LRTI hospitalizations  as published in NEJM in March 2022.3 7MEDLEY was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for Beyfortus in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) eligible to receive palivizumab.9 10 Between July 2019 and May 2021  approximately 918 infants entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive a single 50mg (in infants weighing <5kg) or 100mg (in infants weighing ‚â•5kg) intramuscular injection of Beyfortus or palivizumab.

The tender offer  which was initially announced‚Ä¶,"LONDON  Nov. 4  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Tetragon today announces the commencement of a tender offer to purchase a portion of its outstanding non-voting shares for a maximum aggregate payment of $25 000 000 in cash. The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 27 October 2022  will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $8.50 up to and including $10.25 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 7 December 2022  unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000  then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000. The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or about 9 December 2022  and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.The tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon. The full details of the tender offer  including complete instructions on how to tender shares  are included in the offer to purchase which is available on Tetragon's website at the following URL:http://www.tetragoninv.com/investors/share-repurchases/2022Shareholders should read carefully the offer to purchase because it contains important information.

This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars‚Äô net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms ‚ÄúRevenues‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Banking Income‚Äù are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar‚Äôs net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the ‚ÄúOperating Expenses‚Äù as presented in note 8.1 to the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term ‚Äúcosts‚Äù is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (¬´ SRF ¬ª) are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 ‚Äì Exceptional items ‚Äì Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar‚Äôs activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EUR m Q3 22 Q3 21 9M 22 9M 21 Exceptional operating expenses (-) (125) (102) 747 431 IFRIC linearisation (285) (199) 285 199 Transformation costs(1) 160 97 462 232 Of which related to French Retail Banking 100 46 301 106 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 24 23 63 66 Of which related to Corporate Centre 36 28 98 60 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) 0 (185) 3 303 (185) Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) 0 3 300 Lyxor disposal(1) 0 3 Total exceptional items (pre-tax) (125) (287) 4 050 246 Reported Net income - Group Share 1 498 1 601 858 3 854 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) (88) (211) 3 631 184 Underlying Net income - Group Share 1 410 1 391 4 489 4 038(1) Allocated to Corporate Centre6 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 43 and 663 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q3 22 Q3 21 9M 22 9M 21 French Retail Banking Net Cost Of Risk 196 8 264 145 Gross loan Outstandings 246 467 234 980 244 941 234 525 Cost of Risk in bp 32 1 14 8 International Retail Banking and Financial Services Net Cost Of Risk 150 145 572 408 Gross loan Outstandings 127 594 134 725 136 405 132 088 Cost of Risk in bp 47 43 56 41 Global Banking and Investor Solutions Net Cost Of Risk 80 44 343 62 Gross loan Outstandings 190 678 149 761 179 454 144 456 Cost of Risk in bp 17 12 26 7 Corporate Centre Net Cost Of Risk 30 (1) 55 (1) Gross loan Outstandings 15 924 14 244 15 093 13 589 Cost of Risk in bp 75 (1) 49 (1) Societe Generale Group Net Cost Of Risk 456 196 1 234 614 Gross loan Outstandings 580 663 533 711 575 893 524 659 Cost of Risk in bp 31 15 29 16The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale‚Äôs return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group‚Äôs businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale‚Äôs 2022 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for ‚Äúinterest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations‚Äù and ‚Äúunrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders‚Äô equity  excluding conversion reserves‚Äù.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net (loss) income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release  including adjusted operating income  organic net revenue and adjusted operating expenses  provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence  impairment charges  and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.Organic Net Revenue ReconciliationTable 3Three Months EndedNine Months Ended(in millions)September 30 September 30 Reconciliation of Revenue Less Cost of Revenue to Organic Net Revenue2022202120222021Revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue)$ 442.4$ 369.5$ 1 284.6$ 1 085.6Less acquisitions:Acquisition revenue less cost of revenues (inorganic net revenue)$ (5.3)$ ‚Äî$ (23.6)$ ‚ÄîOrganic net revenue$ 437.1$ 369.5$ 1 261.0$ 1 085.6Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP InformationThree Months EndedNine Months EndedTable 4September 30 September 30 (in millions  except per share amounts)2022202120222021Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP (As shown on Table 1)Net income allocated to common stockholders$ 149.6$ 120.0$ 74.7$ 362.0Non-GAAP adjustmentsAcquisition-related expenses (1)1.66.717.911.9Investment establishment costs (2)‚Äî‚Äî3.0‚ÄîGain on investment (3)‚Äî‚Äî(7.5)‚ÄîLoan forgiveness (4)‚Äî‚Äî(1.3)‚ÄîAmortization of acquired intangible assets (5)30.431.891.195.2Goodwill impairment (6)0.8‚Äî460.9‚ÄîImpairment of investment (7)‚Äî5.010.65.0Total Non-GAAP adjustments32.843.5574.7112.1Income tax expense related to the items above2.9(8.5)(149.0)(24.4)Tax reserves (8)‚Äî‚Äî48.5‚ÄîDeferred tax re-measurements‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî17.7Net income allocated to participating securities - effect on reconciling items(0.1)(0.1)(1.7)(0.3)Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders$ 185.2$ 154.9$ 547.2$ 467.1Reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Non-GAAPDiluted earnings per common share$ 1.41$ 1.12$ 0.70$ 3.38Per share impact of non-GAAP adjustments noted above0.330.334.430.98Adjusted diluted earnings per common share$ 1.74$ 1.45$ 5.13$ 4.36Reconciliation of Operating Margin to Non-GAAPRevenue less cost of revenue$ 442.4$ 369.5$ 1 284.6$ 1 085.6Non-GAAP adjustments noted above‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîAdjusted revenue less cost of revenue$ 442.4$ 369.5$ 1 284.6$ 1 085.6Operating expenses (9)$ 205.6$ 178.8$ 1 045.5$ 500.3Non-GAAP adjustments noted above32.838.5569.9107.1Adjusted operating expenses$ 172.8$ 140.3$ 475.6$ 393.2Operating income$ 236.8$ 190.7$ 239.1$ 585.3Non-GAAP adjustments noted above32.838.5569.9107.1Adjusted operating income$ 269.6$ 229.2$ 809.0$ 692.4Adjusted operating margin (10)60.9 %62.0 %63.0 %63.8 %Reconciliation of Income Tax Rate to Non-GAAPIncome before income taxes229.0173.8197.1545.9Non-GAAP adjustments noted above32.843.5574.7112.1Adjusted income before income taxes$ 261.8$ 217.3$ 771.8$ 658.0Income tax provision78.853.4121.8182.8Non-GAAP adjustments noted above(2.9)8.5100.56.7Adjusted income tax expense$ 75.9$ 61.9$ 222.3$ 189.5Adjusted income tax rate29.0 %28.5 %28.8 %28.8 %(1) This amount includes professional fees (which includes fees associated with the valuation of the Cboe Digital goodwill impairment) and outside services.

The deferred compensation plans' expenses are not excluded from ""adjusted operating expenses"" and do not have an impact on ""Income before income taxes."" (10) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses  gain on investment  loan forgiveness  investment establishment costs  goodwill impairment  and impairment of investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income  as an indicator of the company's operating performance  or for cash flow  as a measure of the company's liquidity.

12747,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4552800-heads-you-win-tails-you-tie-with-clean-earth-spac,Heads You Win  Tails You Tie With Clean Earth SPAC (NASDAQ:CLIN),Announcement on Oct 12  2022 of business combination agreement between Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp and Alternus Energy  represents a major positive catalyst for CLIN. Read more here.,"Cavan Images/iStock via Getty ImagesBusiness combination with Alternus Energy  a fast growing international renewable power developer and producer currently generating 168 MWs in production across 40 owned and operated solar parks  represents a major positive catalyst for Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp. (NASDAQ:CLIN)  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company that successfully IPO'ed at the end of February 2022.Headquartered in Ireland  Alternus is an emerging leader in the development  construction and operation of utility scale commercial and industrial solar power parks. Currently the company is operational in eight countries across Europe  and Alternus recently established a US presence headquartered in North Carolina. After years of building its platform  Alternus is positioned to accelerate the growth of produced megawatts from existing operations and also from its pipeline.The conservative valuation of the transaction of the business combination agreement between Alternus and Clean Earth represents an attractive entry point for potential shareholders  with the valuation being based solely on owned and contracted solar pipeline. The conservative valuation does not include any potential upside from future solar project development and acquisitions or expansion into other renewable energy technologies. With forecasted 2023 EBITDA of $47.2 million  and a pro forma enterprise value of $992 million for the merged Clean Earth/Alternus Energy  this implies a valuation of 21x EV to EBITDA. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.A focused  long-term strategy makes Alternus a stand-out clean energy producerAlternus develops  installs and operates utility scale solar parks across Europe and the U.S. as long-term owners. As a long-term owner they focus on ensuring that the solar parks which are owned by Alternus are designed for the most efficient operations and built to last. The company views the solar parks as truly long-life assets  given the fact the energy production typically spans 35-plus years. This focused and long-term strategy has made Alternus a preferred partner to in-country developers and also to banks and local governments who prefer long-term focused market participants. The company sells the clean power to its commercial energy clients.The company's track record of operating success is clear. In 2017 Alternus had two solar parks in Romania and a total of 6 MWs operating with about 1 million Euros a year in revenues. Today  Alternus has grown to 40 operating parks across eight countries  a total of 168 MWs in production  and 30 million in recurring annual revenues. Based on the current energy production levels across the operating parks  $400 million+ more in future lifetime revenues from these parks is expected  out of which $172 million already has been contracted for the next 10 years.Alternus has plans to continue driving exceptional growth. They have 600-plus projects under development which they own today  that are set to deliver further predictable revenues in the next few years as the projects come on-line. From contracted and owned projects of 1.4 gigawatts  booked EBITDA is forecasted to reach $200 million-plus by the end of 2025. Importantly  60% of these projects are owned and contracted today and have installation start dates during 2023 and 2024. This supports the management team's ability to continue its pace of fast growth.CLINIn line with the company's long-term focus  for each project assessed by the management team  a critical factor for undertaking the project is the LCOE  the levelized cost of energy  which represents the total cost of developing  installing and operating the solar parks over their expected lifetime. This focus allows the management team to stay focused on the highest-return projects  to the benefit of aligned shareholders.Alternus also employs a capital-efficient financing strategy that delivers operating cash earlier in the process to reinvest into new assets to support long-term growth. With the company's PV solar projects generating long-term steady cash flow streams  a healthy amount of leverage is used in the operating model  however never more than 75% of the market value of the project. Importantly  the company uses flexible debt options structured as non-amortizing for the first three years of the project life  with traditional project debt used for the remaining 22 years (for an average 25-year term).As an operator at each stage in the PV solar cycle process  Alternus is able to capture value at each stage  which helps to reduce capex and ultimately the opex needs  while increasing the certainty of pipeline and predictability of new revenues. The company is uniquely positioned across the cycle end-to-end  also recently announcing its acquisition of Altnua that focuses on the project development phase. The acquisition of Altnua represents a new source of organic growth as a leader in renewable development partnerships for future energy solutions.The company has grown to more than 60 employees  with an experienced and driven management team led by Vincent Browne. Alternus is modeling itself as a best in class ESG operator focused on its social and governance impact  bringing in mostly independent board directors. With an installed capacity of 168 MWs in production  Alternus is currently saving more than 96 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year while producing enough annual power for 31 500 homes.An acceleration of capital being deployed into the renewable energy sector in the EU and USThe renewable energy sector is growing  with forecasted targets for the sector being over four times the current size by just 2030. EU and US policymakers are accelerating this growth with financial and regulatory support packages (i.e. the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act bringing $350 million+ in investment to renewables). The ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict has only brought additional momentum to ""energy independence "" putting renewables further in the spotlight.With operations in Europe and a growing footprint in the U.S.  shares of Alternus / Clean Earth can provide investors with exposure to the energy transition across both sides on the Atlantic.Alternus now being listed on Nasdaq via CLINAlternus getting listed on Nasdaq via Clean Earth will be transformative for the company  allowing it to access a broader investor base that's looking for credible ESG and clean energy investment options. With a Nasdaq listing  Alternus is planning to add dedicated investor relations to improve the company's visibility.Alternus has been listed on the Euronext Growth Oslo since 2021 under ticker ALT.OL. At the time of writing  on Nov. 1  ALT.OL is trading at 20.00 NOK/share  closer to the bottom end of its 52-week range of 16.10-31.00  and off its recent peak of 25.00 NOK/share on Oct. 14 following the deal announcement. This suggests market skepticism regarding whether the business combination with the Clean Earth SPAC will go through. However  Alternus' management team has publicly put their support behind the business combination with Clean Earth and have expressed their plan to have the minimum capital requirement waived to increase the probability of the merger going through successfully.In the event of higher than expected redemptions from CLIN following the business combination announcement  CLIN will have sufficient financing options to provide Alternus with enough capital into the merger. Shares of CLIN have remained range-bound and have yet to meaningfully respond to the news of the announcement on Oct. 12. Since its Feb. 24  2022  IPO  shares of Clean Earth  as represented by ticker CLINU  are +0.80%  that compares favorably to the S&P 500's decline of -12% over the same time frame.GOOGCLIN currently offers investors tremendous upside potential for undervalued growth in AlternusOn valuation metrics  you can see from the below charts how shares of Alternus are valued on 2024 EV-to-EBITDA and EV-to-revenue with current market comparables across the North American and European markets.CLINThese valuation metrics appear to discount the company growing significantly through 2024 compared to the overall peer group. In our view this supports the potential for significant upside potential  based on the company's existing owned and contracted projects.CLINWith the long-term track record of the Alternus management team  a clear outlined growth plan and a high likelihood of success for the business combination between Alternus and Clean Earth  shares of CLIN offer investors great upside potential with limited downside at current levels.ConclusionWith around $10.17 of cash in trust  this SPAC has about a 7% yield to maturity between now and the redemption date. So you can buy CLIN today  get a decent return and slightly better than tie or win if the market changes its current collective mind and drives the price well above liquidation value.TL; DRBuy CLIN.",neutral,0.49,0.51,0.0,mixed,0.57,0.29,0.14,True,English,"['Clean Earth SPAC', 'Heads', 'Tails', 'CLIN', 'growing international renewable power developer', 'long-term steady cash flow streams', 'other renewable energy technologies', 'pro forma enterprise value', 'current energy production levels', 'industrial solar power parks', 'Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp.', 'long-term focused market participants', 'out clean energy producer', 'utility scale solar parks', 'Special Purpose Acquisition Company', 'future solar project development', 'utility scale commercial', 'renewable development partnerships', 'future energy solutions', 'major positive catalyst', 'attractive entry point', 'installation start dates', 'flexible debt options', 'average 25-year term', 'Clean Earth/Alternus Energy', 'commercial energy clients', 'capital-efficient financing strategy', 'recurring annual revenues', 'traditional project debt', 'two solar parks', 'focused, long-term strategy', 'business combination agreement', 'project development phase', 'future lifetime revenues', 'first three years', 'solar cycle process', 'clean power', 'operating cash', 'market value', 'long-term owners', 'long-term growth', 'first quarter', '40 operating parks', 'solar projects', 'predictable revenues', 'new revenues', 'project life', 'solar pipeline', 'Cavan Images', 'Getty Images', 'eight countries', 'US presence', 'North Carolina', 'existing operations', 'conservative valuation', 'potential upside', '21x EV', 'U.S.', 'efficient operations', 'long-life assets', 'country developers', 'local governments', 'track record', 'operating success', '1 million Euros', 'management team', 'critical factor', 'levelized cost', 'new assets', 'healthy amount', 'operating model', 'opex needs', 'new source', 'driven mana', 'exceptional growth', 'organic growth', 'remaining 22 years', 'NASDAQ:CLIN', 'emerging leader', 'potential shareholders', '600-plus projects', 'highest-return projects', 'total cost', 'fast growth', 'next 10 years', '168 MWs', '40 owned', 'end', 'February', 'Ireland', 'construction', 'Europe', 'platform', 'megawatts', 'transaction', 'expansion', '2023 EBITDA', 'deal', 'banks', 'Romania', '6 MWs', 'plans', '1.4 gigawatts', 'ability', 'pace', 'LCOE', 'expected', 'benefit', 'PV', 'leverage', 'operator', 'stage', 'capex', 'certainty', 'Altnua', '60 employees', 'experienced', '35']",2022-11-04,2022-11-05,seekingalpha.com

(2) Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's organic growth guidance  adjusted operating expenses guidance and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance are not available. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures  primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and expenses that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of revenues  GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate  which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net (loss) income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release  including adjusted operating income  organic net revenue and adjusted operating expenses  provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence  impairment charges  and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP.

(10) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses  gain on investment  loan forgiveness  investment establishment costs  goodwill impairment  and impairment of investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income  as an indicator of the company's operating performance  or for cash flow  as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition  because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Table 5Three Months EndedNine Months Ended(in millions  except percentages)September 30 September 30 Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and AdjustedEBITDA (Per Table 1)2022202120222021Net income allocated to common stockholders$ 149.6$ 120.0$ 74.7$ 362.0Interest expense  net15.311.740.736.3Income tax provision78.853.4121.8182.8Depreciation and amortization41.042.8122.1125.4EBITDA$ 284.7$ 227.9$ 359.3$ 706.5EBITDA Margin64.4 %61.7 %28.0 %65.1 %Non-GAAP adjustments not included in above line itemsAcquisition-related expenses1.66.717.911.9Gain on investment‚Äî‚Äî(7.5)‚ÄîLoan forgiveness‚Äî‚Äî(1.3)‚ÄîInvestment establishment costs‚Äî‚Äî3.0‚ÄîGoodwill impairment0.8‚Äî460.9‚ÄîImpairment of investment‚Äî5.010.65.0Adjusted EBITDA$ 287.1$ 239.6$ 842.9$ 723.4Adjusted EBITDA Margin64.9 %64.8 %65.6 %66.6 %Table 6(in millions)September 30 December 31 Reconciliation of Cash and Cash Equivalents to Adjusted Cash20222021Cash and cash equivalents$ 353.3$ 341.9Financial investments27.437.1Less deferred compensation plan assets(25.4)(28.0)Less cash collected for Section 31 Fees‚Äî(25.9)Adjusted Cash$ 355.3$ 325.1Table 7(in millions)Reconciliation of Net Transaction and Clearing Fees by Business Segment ‚ÄìThree Months Ended September 30  2022 and 2021ConsolidatedOptionsN.A.

The split of the EV business from Renault‚Äôs traditional combustion-engine operations comes as the maker of Zoe and Clio cars seeks to navigate a difficult transition to electric vehicles as a possible recession looms in Europe.Renault will brief investors about its revamp plans  which are still being finalized  during a capital markets day on Nov. 8. A spokesperson declined to comment.Ampere‚Äôs carveout has been at the heart of talks between Renault and Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co. as the two companies seek to reshape a two-decade-old alliance. Nissan may invest $500 million to $750 million for a stake of about 15% in Ampere but the agreement hinges on a wider deal that would see Renault lower its own 43% stake in Nissan to about 15% over time to rebalance the alliance  people familiar with the situation have said.Higher value?The talks are ongoing and valuation of Ampere has been among sticking points in the Nissan discussions  which have also hit snags over intellectual property concerns. Renault is currently worth 9 billion euros and it may be tricky for the carmaker to obtain a valuation for Ampere that‚Äôs higher than its own market capitalization.The IPO would be subject to market conditions  the person familiar with the situation said. Recent turbulence in share prices has put a damper on new offerings.De Meo also will be giving details next week on Renault‚Äôs legacy combustion-engine business  dubbed Horse  which also is being carved out. Renault may announce a deal with China‚Äôs Zheijiang Geely Holding Group for 50%-50% ownership of Horse until other investors make further investments  two people familiar with the talks said.Ampere will be based in France and employ about 10 000 people. The Horse entity with Geely would be based outside of France and also have a staff of about 10 000.The French government  which owns 15% of Renault  has been briefed in detail about the plans  one person said.The separation of the two businesses is likely to lead to ‚Äúa better capital allocation and eventually to improved shareholder returns ‚Äù Stifel analyst Pierre-Yves Quemener wrote in a note this month.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.08,0.05,0.87,True,English,"['$10 billion valuation', 'EV business', 'Renault', 'Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo', 'potential initial public offering', 'Stifel analyst Pierre-Yves Quemener', 'Zheijiang Geely Holding Group', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'traditional combustion-engine operations', 'possible recession looms', 'intellectual property concerns', 'capital markets day', 'legacy combustion-engine business', 'Nissan Motor Co', 'The Horse entity', 'capital allocation', 'electric-vehicle business', 'standalone entity', 'software entity', 'Clio cars', 'difficult transition', 'electric vehicles', 'Japanese partner', 'two companies', 'Higher value', 'market capitalization', 'market conditions', 'Recent turbulence', 'share prices', 'new offerings', 'French government', 'two businesses', 'shareholder returns', 'EV business', 'Nissan discussions', 'French carmaker', 'two-decade-old alliance', 'wider deal', 'revamp plans', 'other investors', 'two people', 'one person', 'Renault SA', '10,000 people', 'billion', 'valuation', 'matter', 'company', 'information', 'carveout', 'Ampere', 'overhaul', 'split', 'Zoe', 'Europe', 'Nov.', 'spokesperson', 'heart', 'talks', 'stake', 'agreement', 'time', 'situation', 'points', 'snags', 'IPO', 'damper', 'details', 'China', '50%-50% ownership', 'investments', 'France', 'staff', 'separation', 'note']",2022-11-05,2022-11-05,hindustantimes.com
