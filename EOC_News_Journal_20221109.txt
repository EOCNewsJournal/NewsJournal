The royalty stream from TWYMEEG’s growth is poised to deliver significant value to Poxel ” noted Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. “From our clinical programs  our DESTINY-1 Phase 2 Trial for PXL065 in NASH recently reported positive results  especially with respect to fibrosis which represents the highest unmet need in non-cirrhotic NASH. This is an important milestone for Poxel  but also more broadly for NASH  for which there is still no approved treatment. Based on these results  we are prioritizing PXL065 in NASH and are actively looking for a partner to advance its development. By leveraging the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway  the extensive safety database of the parent molecule  and our recent Phase 2 results  we are well-positioned amongst other drugs in development for future development. In addition  PXL770 is a Phase 2 ready asset that is focused exclusively on rare diseases  starting with adrenoleukodystrophy and autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.”Clinical UpdatesPositive topline results were announced for the Phase 2 trial for the treatment of NASH (DESTINY-1) for PXL065 stating that the primary efficacy endpoint was met. PXL065-treated patients achieved statistically significant improvements in the relative decrease in liver fat content measured by magnetic resonance imaging estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI - PDFF) at 36-weeks for all doses. Histology findings from paired liver biopsies showed strong improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH  consistent with dose-dependent reduction of all biomarkers related to fibrinogenesis and fibrosis risk scores. Additional dose-dependent benefits on glucose control and indices of insulin sensitivity were also observed. PXL065 was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in body weight and no increased lower extremity edema vs. placebo. The safety profile is consistent with reduced PPARg-mediated side effects vs. published results of pioglitazone.PDFF) at 36-weeks for all doses.

The safety profile is consistent with reduced PPARg-mediated side effects vs. published results of pioglitazone. In adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  PXL770 is prepared to advance into a Phase 2a biomarker proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trial in male patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the most common ALD subtype. The 12-week study will evaluate pharmacokinetics  safety and potential for efficacy based on relevant disease biomarkers  such as the effect on very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)  the characteristic plasma marker of the disease. Considering the DESTINY-1 results for PXL065 in NASH  which validated the deuterium-modified thiazolidinedione (TZD) platform  a second identical study continues to be planned in order to assess the potential of the deuterium-modified TZD platform with PXL065 in ALD. ALD studies are expected to initiate as soon as possible  subject to additional financing.PXL770 was granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)TWYMEEG net sales in Japan for the quarter (July-September) grew significantly to JPY 0.4 billion (EUR 2.5 million)1  over the prior quarter (April-June) of JPY 0.1 billion (EUR 0.6 million)1 as recently reported by Sumitomo Pharma. As of September 1st  initial launch year restrictions for TWYMEEG which limited new products to two weeks prescriptions have been lifted. Sumitomo Pharma’s forecast for net sales of TWYMEEG in Japan is JPY 1.5 billion (EUR 10.6 million)1 for fiscal year 2022 (April 2022 to March 2023). Based on the current forecast  Poxel expects to receive 8% royalties on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan through the Sumitomo Pharma fiscal year 2022.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today discussed highlights from the third quarter of 2022 and provided a business update.“We are highly encouraged to have received two additional FDA Breakthrough Device Designations  validating the pioneering nature of our work and providing a streamlined approval process for these important therapies ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We are looking forward to additional upcoming milestones  including the expected release of interim data from ongoing blood pressure feasibility studies.”Recent highlights:R&D and operationsToday  ONWARD announced that the Company has been granted Breakthrough Device Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for two additional indications: (1) to its external system ARC-EX for improving or restoring lower extremity sensory and motor function in people with chronic neurological deficits resulting from SCI; and (2) to its implantable system ARC-IM for treating neurogenic bladder dysfunction in people with SCI. The Company now has a total of five Breakthrough Device Designations for ARC Therapy.Breakthrough Device Designation is an FDA program designed to help patients and their physicians receive timely access to technologies that have the potential to provide more effective treatment or diagnosis for debilitating conditions of great unmet need  such as SCI. As part of this designation  the FDA will provide ONWARD with priority review and the opportunity to interact with FDA experts throughout the premarket review phase as the technology moves toward commercialization.In September 2022  ONWARD reported positive top-line results from its Up-LIFT pivotal study evaluating transcutaneous stimulation with its external ARC Therapy. The study enrolled 65 people at 14 leading SCI centers in the U.S.  Europe  and Canada  achieving its primary effectiveness endpoint of improvement in upper extremity strength and function in people with SCI.In October 2022  ONWARD reported topline results from the LIFT Home study  evaluating the safety and feasibility of ARC-EX Therapy when used at home. The study enrolled 17 participants at 5 leading research centers across the U.S. Participants performed training on activities of daily living involving arm and hand movement three times per week over a one-month period. Approximately 97% of these sessions were completed without usability issues  supporting the feasibility of home-based treatment.Corporate and FinancialThe Company reported cash and cash equivalents of EUR 70 million as of September 30  2022 and reiterated its guidance of expected cash runway through the end of 2024.In September 2022  ONWARD appointed Vivian Riefberg  a highly accomplished expert in healthcare  government  and strategy  to the Board of Directors. In 2020  Ms. Riefberg retired as a senior partner with McKinsey & Company  where she led the Public Sector Practice for the Americas and co-led the U.S. Health Care practice. She previously served on the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center Board of Governors and on the NIH Advisory Board for Clinical Research.Outlook:ONWARD’s management expects to continue the steady and consistent execution of its strategy through the end of 2022 and beyond.Following positive top-line data from the Up-LIFT pivotal study  ONWARD expects to submit for regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU during the first half of 2023 to allow the Company to commercialize ARC-EX for the improvement of upper extremity strength and function in patients with SCI. If all goes as planned  these authorizations are expected in the second half of 2023.Additionally  ONWARD plans to discuss the findings from the LIFT Home study with regulatory authorities to define the appropriate approval pathway for home use  with a goal to facilitate access to ARC-EX Therapy at home without the burden of continued visits to a clinic.Before year-end 2022  the Company expects to release interim data from the STIMO-HEMO and HemON studies. Both studies are exploring the use of ARC-IM Therapy to normalize low blood pressure in people with SCI  which is the first planned indication for ARC-IM. By year-end  ONWARD  therefore  expects to have released top-line data from its pivotal study for ARC-EX and interim data from current clinical feasibility studies for ARC-IM  providing important clinical validation of both of its major technology platforms.The Company plans to continue building its team and capabilities in preparation for the expected launch of its ARC-EX Therapy in the second half of 2023  both operationally and commercially. Over the next several months  ONWARD plans to focus on recruiting for sales  marketing  and field service roles to cover the U.S. and select European markets.With a strong balance sheet  the current cash position is expected to be sufficient to finance operations through the end of 2024 and support investments in product development  clinical trials  operational capabilities  and commercial launch. ONWARD continues to consider opportunities to further strengthen its cash position as equity capital markets improve in the U.S. and around the globe.Conference Call & WebcastONWARD will host a conference call with a live webcast today  November 8  2022  at 2:30 pm CET / 8:30 am ET.

Portugal's Resolution Fund has the remaining 25% stake.Non-performing loans (NPLs) fell to 1.6 billion euros ($1.60 billion)  or 5% of total credit  in September from 2.2 billion a year earlier. In 2017  its NPLs were 10.1 billion or 28% of total loans.""The major part of the job is done. But we need to be looking at the European average  which is in the 2.5%-3% range... in the short to medium-term "" Bourke said.Novo Banco's nine-month net profit almost tripled to 428 million euros  citing improved commission income  capital market gains and a steep drop in impairments and provisions.Story continues""This was the seventh straight quarter of profitability. We can generate 80 to 100 bps of capital through underlying profitability a year – that means we control our own destiny "" Bourke said.Although nine-month net interest income (NII)  or earnings on loans minus funding costs  fell 5.6% due to higher funding costs of senior debt issuance and other factors  NII rose by 2.5% between July and September from the previous three months  benefiting from rate hikes by the European Central Bank.The average rate of its net interest margin stood at 1.29%  but the impact of the upward repricing of the portfolios should come in the fourth quarter and Novo Banco should end the year ""well above 1.5%""  the upper bound of its forecast range  he said.($1 = 0.9998 euros)(Reporting by Sergio Goncalves; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi ; Andrei Khalip and Susan Fenton)",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.21,0.2,0.59,True,English,"['Novo Banco', 'Portugal', 'IPO', 'plans', 'U.S. private equity fund', 'nine-month net interest income', 'MASSIVE BAD LOANS CLEAN-UP', 'nine-month net profit', 'net interest margin', 'initial public offering', 'five largest players', 'recovery track record', 'chief financial officer', 'tough restructuring commitments', 'senior debt issuance', 'previous three months', 'north European countries', 'seventh straight quarter', 'Banco Espirito Santo', 'higher funding costs', 'capital market gains', 'profit-making Novo Banco', 'European Central Bank', 'Resolution Fund', 'commission income', 'European average', 'Portuguese market', 'fourth quarter', 'Non-performing loans', 'total loans', 'Sergio Goncalves', 'new CEO', 'Lone Star', 'banking assets', 'high level', 'Portuguese companies', 'real estate', 'total credit', 'major part', 'steep drop', '80 to 100 bps', 'other factors', 'rate hikes', 'average rate', 'upward repricing', 'upper bound', 'Elisa Martinuzzi', 'Andrei Khalip', 'Susan Fenton', 'capitalised bank', '1.6 billion euros', '428 million euros', 'IPO opportunity', 'Euronext Lisbon', 'remaining 25% stake', 'underlying profitability', 'forecast range', 'Mark Bourke', '0.9998 euros', '75% stake', '2.5%-3% range', 'Reuters', 'Portugal', 'markets', 'listings', 'Tuesday', 'Analysts', 'ruins', 'lender', 'position', 'August', 'concentration', 'advantage', 'risking', 'subsidiaries', 'Brussels', 'NPLs', 'September', 'job', 'short', 'medium-term', 'impairments', 'provisions', 'Story', 'destiny', 'NII', 'earnings', 'July', 'impact', 'portfolios', 'year']",2022-11-08,2022-11-09,finance.yahoo.com

(Euronext: OCI) and ADNOC)  Scatec ASA (OSE: SCATC)  Orascom Construction (NASDAQ Dubai: OC: EGX: ORAS) and The Sovereign Fund of Egypt  marks an important milestone in the development of a green hydrogen ecosystem in Egypt and the broader African region.The launch of the hydrogen facility comes as world leaders gather for the United Nations COP 27 Climate Change Conference in Sharm El Sheikh  Egypt  where they seek to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction. Unless we make sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades  global warming will exceed the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.In order to secure affordable  accessible and sustainable energy security for future generations an accelerated shift to renewable energy and lower carbon intensity fuels is required. Green hydrogen  which is produced from water using renewable energy sources  has the potential to play a significant role in decarbonizing hard to abate sectors  such as heavy industries and global shipping.Story continuesAin Sokhna has a strategic position close to the Suez Canal Economic Zone with the possibility of using renewable electricity to develop an industrial hub near global shipping lanes.Fertiglobe has a strong global network through its shareholders OCI N.V. and ADNOC and is an early mover in hydrogen and low carbon ammonia. The hydrogen tie-ins for up to 100 MW of electrolysis have already been installed at Fertiglobe’s two existing ammonia plants in Ain Sokhna.The project is being built by Orascom Construction using Egyptian engineers and state of the art technology.Terje Pilskog  CEO of co-owner and leading renewable power producer Scatec said:“Today marks a key milestone for Scatec  but more importantly  it represents a breakthrough for green hydrogen production in a strategically situated region. It is an honour to work together with Egyptian authorities and our industrial partners on this project and commence the commissioning of the green hydrogen project in Egypt during the UN world leader's climate summit. We see a massive green hydrogen demand driven by strong policy support globally  and Africa is perfectly positioned to take advantage of its low-cost renewables and strategic position.”His Excellency Dr. Sultan Al Jaber  Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology  UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change and chairman of co-owner Fertiglobe  said:“The commissioning of ‘Egypt Green’ marks another important step in the journey to unlock the potential of hydrogen and its carrier fuels. As the world meets in Sharm el Sheikh for COP 27  this project represents a practical response to the need to meet rising energy demand with minimum emissions. The first integrated green hydrogen plant in Africa  delivered in record time  shows what can be achieved when we collaborate around a shared ambition. Fertiglobe will continue to leverage its knowledge and experience in hydrogen and ammonia  to make low and zero carbon fuels more available  as the world seeks a realistic pathway to a decarbonized energy system.”Nassef Sawiris  Executive Chair of OCI N.V. and Executive Vice Chair of co-owner Fertiglobe said:“We are pleased with the launch of the first tangible project of its kind and the first integrated green hydrogen plant in Africa. It is a true milestone that puts Egypt and Africa firmly on the map as one of the best places in the world to develop a green hydrogen hub  thanks to available land  abundant renewable energy sources  the significant pool of skilled labor  and our location on global cross-roads. We are pleased to have been able to show leadership developing a green ammonia production platform in such a short time frame  something that has not been achieved elsewhere. We could not have done this without the support of in particular the Egyptian government or without the collaboration with our industrial partners. We look forward to seeing the positive impact this project can have for the world.”Ahmed El-Hoshy  CEO of OCI N.V. and co-owner Fertiglobe said:“This project is a significant further step towards our global decarbonization strategy and an exciting milestone for Fertiglobe  as it marks the first of many stages in the execution on our hydrogen roadmap. Adding the electrolyzer to our state-of-the-art ammonia facilities and infrastructure in Egypt  we are fully leveraging our existing ammonia production and global distribution infrastructure  including OCI’s Port of Rotterdam ammonia import terminal. We aim to meet the increasing demand for large-scale low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia  as the need for more sustainable energy sources becomes more urgent. Together with our partners in the project we are acting on this need and bringing the hydrogen future to life.”Osama Bishai  CEO of co-owner Orascom Construction said:""The project brings together world class partners that collectively set an ambitious goal to form a new hydrogen hub out of Egypt  thus creating a new sustainable industry. So many variables went into making this phase come to life. This project would not have been possible without the support of the Egyptian government and a number of ministries  who by working closely with the consortium  were able to provide immense support that was integral to the swift delivery of the first phase of ‘Egypt Green’. I am also proud of our teams on the ground who worked tirelessly to commission the first phase of this project  consequently  making this launch possible. This state-of-the-art project  which implements the latest hydrogen technology  is built by Egyptian engineers on Egyptian soil. We are delighted to embark on a journey that plays an important role in the sustainable industrial development of Egypt.""Ayman Soliman  CEO of The Sovereign Fund of Egypt said:“This project is a showcase of transitioning from pledges to implementation  delivering on Egypt’s promise to the world to create a regional hub for green energy and transforming the Suez Canal into a green corridor. We are setting a precedent with our foreign and local partners from the private sector by establishing the first integrated green hydrogen plant in Africa and Emerging Markets that caters to the growing demand for clean energy. It is a moment of pride that we will build on for future generations. Our pipeline of projects in the green energy field capitalizes on Egypt’s ideal location with its unique renewables profile and proximity to markets with renewables deficits to realize our shared goal of emissions reduction.""NotesAbout OCI N.V.OCI N.V.

This shows Idylla™’s potential to improve strategic treatment decisions within a multidisciplinary team for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “Tailoring cancer treatments to individual patients is key  and require molecular diagnostic testing to help identify the specific biomarkers involved. Recent studies3 among approximately 1 600 patients show that in many European countries  less than 50% of the patients undergo biomarker testing. This is due to  among other reasons  lack of diagnostic laboratory infrastructure which also hinders a broader uptake of more complex testing technologies such as NGS. Integrating decentralized  rapid and easy-to-use Idylla™ testing in routine use can help broaden access to biomarker testing and as such  improve patient treatment and outcomes. We are therefore very pleased with another study showing the significant impact of Idylla™ on time-to-treatment that is no less than 16.8 days faster than NGS for EGFR positive patients with advanced NSCLC.”The study was performed on 238 samples which were tested both using an NGS panel (Oncopanel) and the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test4. The study showed a concordance of 98.7% between the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test and the NGS panel. The lab turnaround time was faster for the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test by an average of 12.4 days. In the EGFR positive cohort  the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test led to a 48% reduction and on average 16.8 days faster turnaround time.Furthermore  the study concludes that the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test could contribute to overall time and cost savings for patients if testing is implemented in a stepwise manner  where the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test and the PD-L1 IHC (Immunohistochemistry) test are performed first  and comprehensive yet more expensive NGS panel testing is only initiated in case of a negative Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test. Such first-line use of Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test is not only more cost-effective  but it also allows to obtain EGFR test results in the same time frame as the PD-L1 IHC test results  which is important as EGFR positivity may be a contra-indication forPD-1/PD-L1 therapy in NSCLC5.The impact of the rapid Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test on turnaround times is in line with previous studies6 published  concluding that Idylla™ testing early on may contribute to improving strategic treatment decisions in a multidisciplinary team for patients with NSCLC by the early screening of EGFR mutations.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile 32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

The SL Notes are to be issued under Faurecia's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework established in October 2021.We executed an interest pre-hedging arrangement in September 2021 via a swap option for the SL Notes issuance.

The Sustainability Performance Target in the SL Notes is in line with our objective validated by SBTi to be CO2 neutral on our Scopes 1 and 2 by 2025 from a 2019 base yearThe Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework has been reviewed by ISS ESG  the Second Party Opinion provider  which assessed the contribution of Faurecia’s SL Notes to the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations (UN SDGs) as having a “Significant Contribution” to “Affordable and Clean Energy” and “Climate action” goals.An application has been made to list the SL Notes on the official list of Euronext Dublin (Global Exchange Market) and we expect that the SL Notes will be added to the Euronext ESG Bonds platform.

The decrease in revenue was attributable to the temporary supply disruption that caused a delay in order fulfillment.Cost of Goods SoldCost of goods sold was €63 000 for the three months ending September 30  2022  representing a gross profit of €119 000  or gross margin of 65.3%.

The Company expects to continue adding headcount across the organization ahead of U.S. commercial launch.Operating LossTotal operating loss for the third quarter of 2022 was €8.8 million versus €8.1 million in the third quarter of 2021.

12879,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-renault-china-geely-powertrain-joint.html,Renault unveils sweeping overhaul for electric future,French automaker Renault presented its green revamp to investors Tuesday  splitting its operations in two: a new electric vehicle unit and a subsidiary for thermal and hybrid assets that will pair up with China's Geely.,"The flagship division of Renault's reorganisation is Ampere.French automaker Renault unveiled a sweeping overhaul on Tuesday in a bid to attract investors as it expands its electric vehicle business amid an accelerating market.Under the green revamp  Renault is to split its operations in two  with a new electric vehicle unit and a subsidiary for petrol  diesel and hybrid cars that will pair up with China's Geely.The carmaker's flagship division following the reorganization will be Ampere  which aims to produce a million electric vehicles by 2031  the group said ahead of an investor day in Paris.The new division will employ around 10 000 staff in France.Renault is the latest automaker seeking to finance a shift towards electric.The market for the greener vehicles is expected to grow rapidly in response to consumers' worries about climate change  putting pressure on manufacturers to develop less polluting products.The European Union last month agreed to phase out new CO 2 -emitting vehicles by 2035  a move set to turbo-charge the production of electric prototypes on the continent.Renault follows the likes of US automaker Ford and Germany's Volkswagen.The latter launched its premium sports brand Porsche on the stock market in September to finance its investment in electric  connected and autonomous cars.Ampere will produce the new Renault 5 and Renault 4 among other models in northern France and will target more than 30-percent growth annually over the next eight years and to break even by 2025.Renault said it would list Ampere on the Euronext Paris stock exchange in the latter half of 2023 and invite investment but will retain ""a strong majority"".The group—in which the French state and carmaker Nissan each own 15 percent—has still to outline the part that its Japanese partner will play in the new electric division.—Financing electric drive—For hybrid and internal-combustion vehicles  Renault plans to combine its technological  manufacturing and research and development activities with Chinese automaker Geely.The 50-50 partnership with the Chinese group—owner of Volvo—will develop and produce engines  gear boxes and other components for hybrid and petrol and diesel vehicles.Chief executive Luca De Meo says the strategy is to make Renault more agile and innovative in the face of the ""accelerated technological evolution of our time""Volvo Cars said separately it will cede its stake in its internal combustion engine partnership with Geely  which will be folded into the partnership with Renault that will be called ""Horse"".It will employ 19 000 people across Europe  China and South America  and have 17 factories and five research and development centers.Turnover for the division is expected to grow by four percent by 2027  the group said.""We are designing an agile and innovative organization to manage the volatility and accelerated technological evolution of our time "" said Renault chief executive Luca de Meo.The group aims to see an operating margin—a key profitability yardstick—of above eight percent in 2025.Shares in Renault were down 2.6 percent in afternoon trading on the Paris stock exchange.The group's financial targets are ""more ambitious than expected"" but ""raise questions""  analyst Tom Narayan of RBC said.The company suffered a historic loss in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its recovery was destabilized by its withdrawal from Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.In late July  Renault said that its decision to quit the Russian market had pushed it deep into the red in the first half of 2022.Two months earlier  it had sold its 100-percent stake in Renault Russia and its 68-percent stake in AVTOVAZ.But with its new revamp  Renault said it planned

By providing secure  self-service smart parcel lockers to businesses across the country  together with a dedicated support centre and response and repair team  Quadient will help the Irish economy capitalise on the property boom by simplifying parcel delivery and improving residents’ experience.With the Banking & Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) expecting 50 000 new homes to be built across 2022 and 2023  Quadient will help property developers and property management organisations transform parcel pickup: providing a secure location for residents’ parcel deliveries with 24/7 access; in turn freeing up time for building management to deal with other tasks; and reducing the physical and environmental footprint of parcel delivery.“Property is a highly competitive marketplace in Ireland  and high-density housing will be crucial to meeting the country’s housing needs ” said Ian Caminsky  SVP and MD Parcel Locker Solutions  UKI & DACHIT at Quadient. “This demands a new approach for processing parcels and packages. An Post alone delivered 56 million packets and parcels in its last reporting year – an average of 29 per household. Combine that figure with deliveries from other carriers  and management teams at high-occupancy communities will be faced with a flood of parcels every week. Employees will either need to receive  log  store and distribute these parcels  taking time away from other tasks  or run the risk of unwatched parcels potentially being stolen. Automated lockers can reduce the pressure on management teams  while creating a more pleasant  liveable service and environment for residents.”Quadient already has a presence in Ireland through its mailing and customer experience services. By bringing Parcel Pending smart lockers into the country  it will provide more opportunities to the property industry to realise the benefits of automated lockers  including:Increased security – Ensuring packages can only be picked up by the intended recipient  reducing opportunities for parcel theft and giving residents confidence they live in a safe environment.Ensuring packages can only be picked up by the intended recipient  reducing opportunities for parcel theft and giving residents confidence they live in a safe environment. Improved efficiency – It can take up to four minutes for a delivery driver and building staff to complete handover of a package – plus the time to hand it to the recipient. Quadient’s parcel lockers reduce this time to seconds  freeing up the delivery driver and building staff time.– It can take up to four minutes for a delivery driver and building staff to complete handover of a package – plus the time to hand it to the recipient. Quadient’s parcel lockers reduce this time to seconds  freeing up the delivery driver and building staff time.

Digital integration – Quadient’s parcel lockers are designed to integrate with cloud services and applications  for instance resident engagement portals such as Spike Global – allowing property managers to offer a modern  streamlined experience and immediate access to their services to residents.– Quadient’s parcel lockers are designed to integrate with cloud services and applications  for instance resident engagement portals such as Spike Global – allowing property managers to offer a modern  streamlined experience and immediate access to their services to residents. Environmental impact – By guaranteeing delivery the first time  preventing re-visits  and ensuring that couriers and residents only have to visit a single location  parcel lockers help both reduce emissions and create a safer environment for residents.With nearly 17 000 installations worldwide serving millions of users  Quadient has considerable experience and existing footprint to benefit not only the Irish residential market and university accommodation  but also retail and home delivery  where parcel lockers can improve efficiency  guarantee delivery  and offer a better service to customers.“We are dedicated to the Irish market and are excited about making the most of our expertise in the country ” continued Ian Caminsky. “We have undeniable evidence of the benefits developers  property managers and residents have already seen from our lockers: to the extent that for many developments the lockers themselves have become a selling point for new residents. Indeed  in some locations we have seen the number of lockers triple following positive feedback. The future of high-density housing is one that makes best use of the space available; reduces the impact on the environment; and gives residents the fastest and easiest possible access to the services they need  without compromising their comfort or security. Our parcel lockers are an essential part of this vision  and we look forward to making this journey in Ireland.”For more information about Parcel Pending by Quadient  visit https://www.parcelpending.com/en-gb/ireland/.Parcel Pending by Quadient will be exhibiting at Ireland's Residential Investment and Development Conference in Dublin on November 10th – to find out more  visit:https://www.bisnow.com/events/dublin/multifamily/irelands-build-to-rent-conference-7481.About Quadient®Quadient is the driving force behind the world’s most meaningful customer experiences.

Renault Group is one team of teams  benefiting from simplified governance and digital management platforms boosting collaboration and breaking silos typical of traditional organizations. Allocating up to 10% of the capital to our employees  will contribute to foster a new common culture oriented to value creation. We believe also in cooperation when it comes to invest  create and scale new businesses and technologies. This is the core of our horizontal approach  and the network of leading partners that are participating in our different projects  is the proof of the quality of our initiatives. All this is one of the most progressive re-engineering projects of the recent years in our industry  a Revolution in its kind."" said Luca de Meo  Chief Executive Officer of Renault Group.“What the Group has achieved in terms of financial turnaround in just 2 years is outstanding and we will not stop here.

All in all  the Revolution is also financial and aims at creating value for all our stakeholders as illustrated by our dividend policy and our target to reinforce employee shareholding.” said Thierry Piéton  Chief Financial Officer of Renault Group.Boulogne-Billancourt  November 8  2022Following approval by the Board of Directors held on November 7  2022 under the chairmanship of Jean-Dominique Senard  Luca de Meo  CEO of Renault Group and Thierry Piéton  CFO of Renault Group  present today  during its Capital Market Day  the third chapter of its Renaulution strategy.Until now  carmakers were evolving in an environment of mature ICE technology and stable customer expectations. The ongoing transformations  reshaping the automotive industry  are driving the emergence of additional value chains: electric vehicles (EV)  software  new mobility services  and circular economy.Today  after Resurrection and Renovation  the first two phases of the Renaulution strategic plan presented in January 2021  Renault Group opens the third chapter: it launches its Revolution with the ambition to become a Next Gen automotive company.This new set-up will allow Renault Group to capture value across all the new profit pools (estimated by external institutions at ~€220 billion in 2030 vs €110 billion today). To seize opportunities in these markets and to adapt to today’s environment  Renault Group creates full-fledged and focused organizations. It will transform its business mix by harnessing structurally more profitable value chains. Renault Group leverages a horizontal and ecosystemic approach to co-create  co-finance and scale strategic initiatives with leading partners.Now  RevolutionThe guiding principles of this value driven and ecosystemic approach are:Strategic focusEffectivenessSmart capital allocationBest partners selectionAsset-light by designRenault Group is operating its own Revolution by creating 5 focused businesses with specialized teams  each built on a homogeneous set of technologies  with their own governance and P&L.These businesses are:Ampere : the first EV & Software pure player born from an OEM disruptionAlpine : a high-end zero-emission global brand with a racing pedigree. A unique asset-light model combined with proprietary technologiesMobilize : built around a leading financial services company to enter the market of new mobility  energy and data-based servicesThe Future Is NEUTRAL : the first 360° circular economy company in the automotive industry from closed loop in materials to battery recyclingPower: the traditional core business of Renault Group will continue to develop innovative low emissions ICE & hybrid vehicles under the Renault  Dacia and Renault LCV brands  each with their dedicated organization and governancePower: innovative low emissions ICE & hybrid vehiclesICE & hybrid vehicles will still represent up to 50% of passenger cars sales worldwide even by 2040. Developing efficient technologies in that field remains key for the future of any global OEM. Therefore  Renault Group is ensuring the further development of its core business  with the launch of a totally new range of Renault ICE & Hybrid (passenger cars)  Dacia and LCV – and with the creation of a worldwide supplier  leader in ICE & hybrid powertrain technologies.Renault Group will combine its ICE & hybrid powertrain technologies (Horse project) together with Geely to create a worldwide leading supplierRenault Group and Geely will combine their ICE in a 50-50 entity. This dedicated business will design  develop  produce  and sell all ICE & hybrid powertrain components and systems with state-of-the-art technologies. Day 1  the entity will have a turnover of over €15 billion and a volume of 5 million units per year  already serving 8 customers who will benefit of increased synergies and productivity.This entity will be full-fledged and global  with:17 plants supplying 130 countries5 R&D centers in Europe (Spain  Romania and Sweden)  China  and South America for a total of 3 000 engineersA total of 19 000 employees  across 3 continentsIt will offer a complete portfolio of technologies on all components: engine  gearbox  xHEV systems and batteries at best level. Thanks to this project  Renault Group will double both its scale and market coverage from 40% to 80% worldwide. This growth will be fueled by geographical expansion  with access to North America and China  and by products complementarity to come up with complete low emissions systems and solutions for OEMs. To do that  it will develop its technology portfolio in the field of alternative fuels seeking for cooperation with a potential partner from the energy industry.Renault brand ICE & Hybrid: globally upliftedEven with the sharp rise of the EV offer  the combustion engine vehicles will still continue to grow especially outside of Europe. Thus  Renault brand will remain present on ICE & hybrid markets  especially in Latin America  India  South Korea and North Africa. Renault ICE & Hybrid passenger cars sales will keep growing 2% per year on average over 2022-2030.To uplift the brand in all geographies  Renault will continue its C-segment offensive and will grow by 20% its net revenue  while expanding its contribution margin by 30% between 2022 and 2030.Dacia: growing from >10% operating margin to 15% by 2030Dacia’s model is unique  built upon the combination of three main components:An engineering focus on design-to-cost already providing a solid double-digit cost advantageA unique industrial and sourcing footprint with a benchmark cost competitivenessAn asset-light distribution model ensuring costs comparable to agency model85% retail channel mixAs a consequence  Dacia already generates an operating margin above 10%  and aims to reach 15% by 2030.To achieve this ambition  Dacia  currently a B-segment champion will boldly enter the C-segment. After Jogger this year  Dacia Bigster will embody this move and 2 other vehicles will follow  allowing Dacia to double its profit pool coverage. In parallel  Dacia will also keep lowering costs and will benefit from the doubling of the volume of the global CMF-B platform across brands which will reach 2 million units by 2030.Dacia will contribute to reinvent the ICE value chain through the cooperation with Horse project by developing breakthrough powertrains adaptation for alternative & synthetic fuels. Dacia will smoothly transition to EV in Europe by pioneering affordable EV solutions.LCV: propelled into the future by two game changersRenault Group’s LCV business relies on solid foundations with over 5 million vehicles in European car park  an ecosystem of over 600 dedicated Pro+ dealers  4 plants and the most up-to-date line-up by 2026.Renault LCV will develop two game changing projects to address a dynamic and changing market:Hyvia : the Group’s joint-venture with Plug for carbon-free hydrogen mobility offers a complete ecosystem  from fuel cells vehicles  to electrolyzers  to hydrogen refueling. It combines Plug’s H2 expertise with Renault Group’s industrial and engineering assets. Hyvia aims for 30% of the hydrogen-powered LCV market by 2030  in Europe and a cumulated order intake of €1 billion by 2026.FlexEVan: a game changing EV & software defined family of vans to be deployed on the market from 2026. FlexEVan will be compact for urban use thanks to a specially designed EV platform. FlexEVan will benefit from the SDV developed within Ampere. The vehicle will thus become a fully connected warehouse extension  integrated into the customer's digital ecosystem. It will be the first vehicle to benefit from the application of the software-defined vehicle technology at Renault Group  allowing notably for real-time  end-to-end operations monitoring and data-driven fleet management. FlexEVan will reduce the total lifecycle cost of usage for the clients by at least 30%  i.e. more than the price of the van. To support the development of FlexEVan  Renault Group intends to create Flexis  a partnership with a relevant partner having experience in the sector and a complementary activity. Thanks to this partnership  developments will be shared  meaning a significant decrease in costs and a maximization of customers coverage.Ampere: the 1st EV and software pure player born from an OEM disruptionWith Ampere  Renault Group is creating a standalone company that will be the 1st EV and software pure player born from an OEM disruption. Ampere will develop  manufacture  and sell full EV passenger cars  with cutting-edge software-defined vehicle (SDV) technology  under the Renault brand. Ampere will bring the best of both worlds: know-how and assets from Renault Group with the focus and agility of an EV pure player.Based in France  Ampere will be a full-fledged OEM with around 10 000 employees. As a tech company  Ampere will drive innovation with around 3 500 engineers  half of them specialized in software.Before 2030  Ampere’s line-up of 6 electric cars will be ideally positioned on the fastest-growing segments in Europe covering 80% of the EV mainstream profit pool: the B segment with the new Renault 5 Electric and Renault 4 Electric  and the C segment with Megane E-tech Electric  Scénic Electric and 2 other vehicles to be revealed. A large portion of the investments of the first 4 vehicles has already been spent.Ampere targets to produce around 1 million EVs for the Renault brand in 2031. Ampere is a growth story  with above 30% of compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the 10 years to come.Ampere relies on 3 tech backbones making it unique in the EV and software ecosystem:A high-tech and top - competitive manufacturing footprint : ElectriCity  already one of the major and most competitive EV production poles in Europe: in 2025  a vehicle will be produced in less than 10 hours. 400k units production capacity from day 1  scalable to 1 million leveraging other Renault Group facilities  ElectriCity also offers a unique local ecosystem with 80% of the suppliers within 300kmA European EV value chain : Ampere is partnering with the most relevant players to access to know-how  to secure sustainable supply and to gain visibility and control on costs and performance. Thanks to its European-based supply chain  Ampere will secure the supply for more than 80 GWh required for its cars by 2030. From 10% coverage of the EV value chain in 2020  it is now above 30% and will reach 80% by 2030A breakthrough Software - D efined V ehicle (SDV) technology : SDV is the future of the automotive industry  allowing the car to be constantly upgradable throughout its lifecycle  learning from its users  and keeping the vehicle linked from cradle to grave to the OEM. To launch its first open and horizontal SDV in 2026  Renault Group has built deep partnerships with 2 major tech players: Qualcomm Technologies to co-develop high-performance computing platforms based on Snapdragon Digital® Chassis™ solutions for the Centralized Electronic Architecture. This includes System on Chip and low layers software in addition to features  in-car services and applications. Qualcomm Technologies  or one of its affiliates  intends to invest in the Renault Group's dedicated electric and software company Ampere Google with whom the collaboration includes an Android-based platform for Software-Defined Vehicle and cloud software to enable a SDV digital twinBuilding the SDV in a horizontal way is unique in the entire industry. It reduces development time and cost. Partnering with Google to create this open platform based on Android allows Ampere to leverage one of the world’s largest global ecosystem of third-party apps developers. They will come up with a variety of services that will enrich the user experience while accelerating the development of features through the lifetime of the vehicle.These partnerships will enable Renault Group to reduce costs  improve efficiency  flexibility and speed of vehicle developments  and increase value for end-users thanks to continuous software innovation and updates.Alpine: a high-end zero-emission global brand with a racing pedigreeOver the past two years  Alpine has had a rebirth  capitalizing on its iconic A110 sports coupé and on its entry into Formula 1  where it aims to become a championship contender. Today  Alpine is a true high-end brand  a full-fledged OEM  asset-light  tech focused  a team of 2 000 people  of which 50% are engineers.

It will be full-electric from 2026. By then  Alpine will also reveal the next A110  and 2 new models: a B-hatchback and a C+ crossover. Alpine then plans to launch two D and E segments cutting-edge cars to support its international expansion. As a result  we expect half of Alpine’s growth to come from new markets beyond Europe including potentially North America and China.Mobilize: built around a leading financial services company to enter the market of new mobility  energy and data-based servicesMobilize is built around a core asset  Mobilize Financial Services (MFS)  one of the best financial services providers on the market with 4 million of customers.

Bringing together all the existing expertise of the Group and its partners in this activity  this new entity offers closed-loop recycling solutions at each stage of a vehicle's life: supply of parts and raw materials  production  usage and end of life. From around 50% of value chain coverage today  The Future Is NEUTRAL aims to reach above 90% by 2030. It is set to become the European leader at industrial scale in the closed-loop automotive circular economy. It will service Renault Group as well as the entire industry. In order to accelerate its development and strengthen its leadership  The Future Is NEUTRAL is opening up a minority of its capital to outside investors with the objective of to co-finance investments of around €500 million until 2030.ESG: a performance lever for Renault GroupThe Group’s Revolution will see an acceleration of its ESG trajectory representing a key driver for the operating and financial performance of the Group.The business re-engineering of Renault Group will enable it to become a front-runner in the quest for carbon neutrality and inclusive future.On the climate front  the Group aims for carbon neutrality in Europe in 2040 and worldwide by 2050  adopting a cradle to grave approach. The Group has set intermediate carbon footprint reduction targets to lead the way  with specific action plans for each of its businesses.Each business has its own ESG objectives  all of them benefitting to the Group ESG targets:Power Ampere Alpine Mobilize The FutureIs NEUTRAL Affordable mobilityUp to -70%CO 2 emissions per vehicle by 2030 100% EV line-upCarbon neutrality in production in 2025Local value chainUpskilling & reskilling 100% EV line-up by 2026Carbon neutrality in production by 2030 100% electric line-upRenewable energyBattery second life Car-to-car parts & materials closed loopsBattery recycling>90% coverage of the circular economy value chain by 2030In regards with the Renault Group’s tradition of social responsibility  it will accompany the transition  upskilling & reskilling of thousands of people towards the new value chains of the automotive revolution.

The performances of these 5 businesses will continue to build on the financial discipline implemented during the Resurrection phase. The Group’s levers – value over volume  competitiveness and capital efficiency – will be further accelerated respectively by its new products offensive  a strong focus on variable costs  sustainable supplier network development and digitization. And furthermore  a unique ecosystemic partnership approach will extend the coverage of key value chains with a low capital intensity bias.To face current industry unprecedented transformation challenge  Renault Group developed an approach based on two principles:A self-financed plan  secured by strong free cash-flow generation from its businessesPartnerships or external funding to accelerate growth  innovation or competitiveness and reduce capital requirementsAmpere: low cash-burn & external fundingRenault Group wishes to accelerate Ampere’s future development and propel Renault brand into its electric future without drawing heavily on the Group’s financial resources.

This dividend symbolizes a new era and then will gradually grow in a disciplined manner up to 35% payout ratio of Group consolidated net income – parent share  in the mid-term. To do so  the Group must achieve its first priority which is to turn back to an investment grade rating.Capital allocation policy: implementing a balanced capital allocationRenault Group aims at using at least 50% of the excess cash generated to reinvest in the Group. Looking forward  Renault Group intends to be more active on financial investments  in line with its ecosystemic approach  but limiting them to maximum 15% to 20% of its free cash-flow.For the remaining cash allocation  aside from dividend  the Group wishes to associate its employees to its performance to foster a common sense of belonging to the project and nurture a culture of value. Through dedicated employees’ shareholding programs  it ambitions to see the employee shareholding portion grow to 10% of the Group capital by 2030.Existing bonds will remain under Renault SA  the issuer of the industrial activities of the Group. Each business could use financing instruments depending on its own needs and strategy.AllianceRenault Group  Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors are currently engaged in discussions to jointly address the new challenges and opportunities driving the future of the automotive industry  which include:An agreement on a set of strategic common initiatives across markets  products  and technologiesNissan and Mitsubishi Motors consideration to invest in Ampere which will support Renault Group’s Renaulution strategy and will be one of the strategic steps towards Nissan Ambition 2030 and Mitsubishi Motors strategyStructural improvements to ensure sustainable Alliance operations and governance** *This plan will be presented to employee representative bodies in accordance with applicable regulations.The presentation is available on www.renaultgroup.com.* **About Renault GroupRenault Group is at the forefront of a mobility that is reinventing itself.

12883,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4554803-unilever-a-long-term-portfolio-stabilizer,Unilever: A Long-Term Portfolio Stabilizer (NYSE:UL),Unilever has managed itself well through this challenging operating environment  and is on track to emerge a much stronger company. See why UL stock is a Buy.,"JJFarquitectosUnilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is one of the largest consumer products companies in the world  with a market cap of ~$120B. The company’s shares trade both in Amsterdam as well as in London (where the company is headquartered). Unilever reports its earnings in euros  and U.S. investors can purchase NYSE listed shares under the ticker “UL.”Starting at the end of 2020  Unilever’s P/E ratio began to de-rate to below the 17.5x to 23x range the company had historically traded at since 2014. The decline in the stock’s P/E ratio seems to be the result of slowing growth  exacerbated by a global surge in commodities as rising input costs put pressure on the company’s margins. Additionally  the decline in the euro versus the dollar has dragged on the ADRs. The ADRs for UL are down 18.14% since 2020  while the Euronext traded shares are down just 0.32%. UL has underperformed the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index and the MSCI World Consumer Staples Index by 30% and 19.1%  respectively. The Euronext listed shares have underperformed as well during this time frame.BloombergHistorically  up until the pandemic Unilever was a market outperformer. During the 10-year period between 1999 and 2009  the ADRs outperformed the S&P 500 (SP500) by ~11.2% on an annualized basis. While the stock underperformed the S&P 500  for a low-beta consumer staple during the longest period of economic expansion in modern historically the ADRs arguably did quite well  rising ~9.7% per annum while the S&P 500 returned 13.5% per annum.Unfortunately  since the end of 2020  Unilever stock has struggled even as the business continues to perform at or above management’s expectations. Given the 2-year underperformance  we believe today’s prices represent a solid entry point for Unilever stock.Business HighlightsEPS Growth/VolatilityAs a consumer staples company  Unilever grows at a slower rate than the market  but also has significantly less earnings volatility. The company is a “portfolio stabilizer” that has shown an ability to beat the market over a long-time horizon. Adj. EPS has gone from €0.72 in 2001 to €2.65 in 2021  which represents a 6.7% CAGR over a 20-year period. During this time frame  the ADRs returned 9.2% annually  just slightly below the S&P 500’s 9.5% annualized return.Unilever tends to outperform during times of market distress because Unilever’s earnings are much less volatile than the typical S&P 500 company. The standard deviation of the Unilever’s EPS growth rates over the last 10 years is 9.1%  versus 19.3% for the S&P 500. Put another way  over the last 10 years  ~66% of the time Unilever’s EPS growth has been above or below its average EPS growth rate by 9.1%. A prime example is 2020  where the S&P 500’s EPS fell 20%  while Unilever’s EPS fell just 1.2%.Long-Term Growth ProspectsThe consumer products industry is mature  but it contains sub-segments of significant growth. For example  Estee Lauder (EL) derives ~50% of its revenues from skin care products that are typically high-end products designed to prevent aging. The market for skin care products has exploded over the last few years  and EL is now growing their skin care business in the high teens/low twenties percent range. EL’s exposure to this high growth category has earned it a sector leading P/E ratio of 34x.Unilever has invested in high growth areas within the consumer products category  which are expected to be significant contributors to growth over the long term. However  in general  large consumer products companies will typically grow their top line at GDP+ type rates.Sustainable Competitive AdvantagesAs a global multi-billion-dollar consumer products company  Unilever’s distribution  supply chain  and sales network  would take a significant amount of time and capital to replicate. This is often why smaller consumer products companies  once having reached a certain size  will typically sell themselves to the big companies. Brand value and loyalty is also built up over years and arguably decades.Low Capital RequirementsUnilever requires very little investment to fund its growth. Capital expenditures have averaged just 2.6% of revenues over the last 5 years.Portions of R&D expense run through the income statement for accounting purposes  but we consider these expenses an investment in the company. R&D expenses are also a small percentage of sales  averaging just 1.5% of revenues over the last 5 years.Conservative Financial PoliciesUnilever has a high-quality balance sheet with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.6x on a trailing-12-month basis. The company’s interest coverage ratio (EBIT/Net interest expense) is ~14x on a T12M basis.The company has an A+ issuer rating credit rating from S&P and an A1 rating from Moody’s.Management TeamUnilever’s CEO  Alan Jope  has been with the company since 1985. Prior to becoming CEO in 2019  he was the President of Unilever’s largest division  Beauty & Personal Care. Under his leadership  the Beauty & Personal care division averaged organic growth of 3.6% and expanded its operating margins 180bps.Investors have largely criticized him  as the stock has significantly underperformed the MSCI World Consumer Staples Index since he took over. This prompted activist investor Nelson Peltz to step in and take a stake in the company. Peltz joined the board in July. Since that time  Mr. Jope has announced he would be retiring at the end of 2023. News reports have surfaced that Peltz has been actively seeking his replacement. Given Peltz’s success at P&G (the stock doubled between the time he joined the board and when he left in August of this year) that largely involved a management shake-up  Peltz seems to be the right guy to get the business on track for strong performance in the future.CapitalizationAuthorManagement announced a share buyback program at the end of Q1 of €3bn. The company completed its first €750 tranche in July  and the company expects to complete another €750 tranche by December of this year.ThesisUnilever bears have largely been in control for the past 2 years  as the U.S. ADR are down 14% from year-end 2020 levels. The company’s forward P/E ratio is now more than 1 standard deviation below the company’s 10-year average.Unilever is successfully implementing price increases to offset a significant portion of the input cost inflation it has been facing. While increasing prices has dampened volume growth  investors have underappreciated Unilever’s pricing power as organic growth is strongly positive.Input commodity prices have already started to reduce the strain on the company’s profitability. It is likely that household product inflation is fairly sticky  which should translate into the company achieving higher margins as input cost inflation comes down and the company maintains its price increases.The depreciation of the euro has provided a tailwind to financial performance  but has punished U.S. investors. The Fed has given mixed signals about the path of monetary policy moving forward  but any moves to reduce the tightness of U.S. monetary policy should cause the USD to weaken against the euro and would help boost performance of the ADRs.We forecast EPS will be down ~1.8% in 2022  but to grow in the high single digits in 2023 and 2024. As fundamentals improve and the company shows an ability to offset inflationary pressures  we see the ADRs re-rating back to ~19.8x  which represents upside potential of 25% over the next 12-18 months.Our bear case scenario is that margin compression continues and whereby earnings remain flat. In this scenario we see the ADRs trading around 15x earnings  which would be down ~15% including dividends.Overall  we like the risk/reward for UL stock. Unilever may not be a market-beating name in a loose monetary regime  but long-term consumer staples with well-managed  strong brands can generate solid returns for years.BusinessFounded when Margarine Unie and Lever Brothers merged in 1929  Unilever is one of the largest consumer products companies in the world. The company’s early days focused on animal fat products  such as butter and margarine  and personal care products such as soap. Throughout the 20th century  the company expanded into several other consumer products areas largely through acquisition.Today  Unilever generates ~€55bln in annual sales  owns over 400 brands  employs 149k people  and has products available in over 190 countries. Overall  the company targets underlying organic sales growth of 3% to 5% over the long term.Unilever’s business strategy is guided by five strategic pillars. The company looks to achieve these goals through organic and inorganic initiatives. The goals are:Develop the company’s portfolio into high growth spacesWin with the company’s brands as a force for good  powered by purpose & innovationAccelerate in the USA  India  China  and leverage EM strengthLead in the channels of the futureBuild a purpose-led  future-fit organization and growth culture.Unilever updated its operating segments in September of 2022 to be a more category focused. The company reports in five segments: Beauty & Wellbeing  Personal Care  Home Care  Nutrition  and Ice Cream.Beauty & Wellbeing is the company’s 3rd largest  but fastest growing  segment. The business line includes brands such as Dove  Sunsilk  Vaseline  and Liquid I.V. This business segment is a mid-single digit grower  with operating margins in the low 20% range. Inside of this segment is a ~€1.0bn Prestige Beauty business growing double-digits organically. This business competes with the likes of Estee Lauder and L’Oreal (LRLCF  LRLCY)  which are the darlings of the consumer products space.Personal Care is another strong performer  with ~€11.7B in sales. This segment includes brands such as Dove  Rexona  Lux  and Axe. This segment grows organically in the 2-5% range  but has been growing faster in recent periods as management has been raising prices aggressively within this segment. While margins were in in the first half of 2022  historically margins in this segment have been strong in the high-teens low 20% range.Unilever’s Home Care is ~€11B in sales  and has a been growing organically in the mid-single to high-single digit range for several quarters in a row. However  this is a significantly more competitive industry. As a result  operating margins are in the low-double digits range. Popular brands in this segment include OMO  Sunlight  Comfort and Seventh Generation.Finally  Unilever has a Nutrition and an Ice Cream segment. Brands in the Nutrition segment include Knorr  Hellmann’s  and Red Lable  while the Ice Cream segment includes Ben & Jerry’s  Magnum  and Breyers. These segments have historically struggled to grow much more than 4 or 5% at the most. Organic sales have jumped in recent quarters as the company has increased prices in the mid-to-high-single-digit range. Margins in the company’s Nutrition segment are in the mid-teens while the Ice Cream segment’s margins are in the low-double digit range.Here is a segment breakdown:Company FilingsRevenue and earnings are geographically diversified  with 60% of revenues coming from higher growth emerging markets.Company FilingsKey growth markets for the company are the U.S.  India  and China. Today  these countries represent ~€9bn  ~€5bn  and ~€3bn of sales  respectively.M&AUnilever is active with its portfolio management  as the company has executed approximately €14.5bln in M&A and divested €8.1bn of brands since 2015. The company has been pretty quiet recently as management has been largely focused on improving business fundamentals.The most recent major acquisition was a €5.2bn purchase of a health food and drinks business primarily focused on Asian markets called Horlicks from GlaxoSmithKline. The business has grown at double-digit rates over the last 15 years. The transaction was immediately accretive to EPS even though Unilever paid 20x post synergy EBTIDA. The primary rationale for the deal was to increase Unilever’s presence in health-food categories and high growth emerging markets.Focused on portfolio development and growth  Unilever is willing to divest underperforming businesses. At the end of 2017 the company announced it sold its spreads business  which included brands such as Becel  Flora  Country Crock  and Blue Band  to KKR for €6.825bn. The spreads business was very profitable but faced secular decline issues as people eat less bread and margarine. The company sold the business for somewhere between 9x and 10x EBITDA returning the proceeds to investors via €6bn in buybacks during 2018.The company just recently divested its Tea business to CVC advisers for €4.5bln in July of 2022.Fighting InflationGlobal inflation has taken center stage in financial markets as economies deal with supply disruptions in the face of a faster than expected rebound in demand for goods.Several commodities used in Unilever’s products have seen significant prices increases versus their pre-pandemic levels. Rising prices have created a challenging operating environment for the company.Bloomberg  Author's spreadsheet-Author’s Graph. Data obtained from Bloomberg.During Unilever’s 3rd quarter of 2022  the company raised prices 12.5% to offset the cost inflation the company has experienced. That was the 2nd quarter in a row the company raised prices by double digit percentages. Volumes declined just 1.6% in the most recent quarter translated into consolidated underlying sales growth of 10.6%. That is the highest organic sales growth rate for the company going back as far as we have data for. The subdued volume declines in the face of significantly higher pricing shows that Unilever likely has some strong pricing power that it can use to maintain its margins.While it is different across different economies  overall  we believe that consumers are in fairly good shape and have a more inflationary mindset. U.S. consumer seem to have significant excess savings that is providing a buffer during the historic level of inflation the economy has experience. Consumers seem to be less sensitive to price increases than they were during the previous decade.In addition to price increases  management has leveraged its savings programs  buying efficiencies  and productivity programs harder than ever to fight off inflation. Buying efficiencies alone offset roughly half of the market level inflation.Overall  we are confident that Unilever can manage its way through this period of input cost inflation without seeing major margin degradation nor damaging the long-term health of the business.Recently  many of Unilever’s major input commodities have seen their prices changes moderate in recent months if not begin to decline. A weakening global economy and normalizing supply chains have been the main driver behind the changes. While it is hard to predict the direction of commodity prices  Unilever has managed to work its way through these challenges relatively successfully.Below is an analysis of the how the company’s volume growth changes for a change in prices. This analysis shows that price increases in the 5% to 6% range will result in lower volumes (which we’ve already witnessed in 2022)  but should still be accretive to organic growth. Elasticities have been even better than this analysis showed  as the company has raised prices by double-digits the last two quarters and volume declines have been less than what the model would have predicted.Company filings  author's spreadsheetManagementUnilever CEO  Alan Jope  has been in charge since January 2019. He announced his intent to retire at the end of 2023. While he took over Unilever during a challenging time for global staples companies  his relative performance has been sub-optimal. Nelson Peltz’s decision to join the board has likely played a role in Mr. Jope’s departure. Unilever in recent quarters has been very aggressive in protecting margins and market share  which have translated into decent stock price performance.It has been reported that Mr. Peltz has initiated the process to find Mr. Jope’s replacement. He was tasked with similar challenges when he took a stake in Proctor & Gamble (PG) a few years ago  and that was a great success story. Investing alongside Peltz seems like a sold bet.ModelWe’ve modeled for strong topline growth driven by high pricing in 2022  but we expect operating margins to fall 300bps y/y driven by higher input cost inflation. However  revenue growth should moderate to mid-single digits in 2023 and 2024  while operating margins begin to expand y/y. We see EPS falling 1.8% this year before growing high-single digits for the next couple of years as input costs come down and the company benefits from higher pricing.Company Filings  Author's Model Company Financials  Author's SpreadsheetsCompsWe believe comparing Unilever to companies across the subsectors in the consumer products industry is the most effective way to evaluate it versus peers. There is not one single company that overlaps all the categories Unilever competes in due to the company’s diverse portfolio of food  home care  and self-care products.Generally  the closest comps to the company are Henkel (HEN3 GY)  Danone (BN FP)  and Reckitt Benckiser (RKT LN). These three companies have diverse similar categories to Unilever and have similar growth and margin profiles.Bloomberg  Author's SpreadsheetWe performed regression analysis on peer companies’ growth profiles and their valuations. We derived an implied valuation based on this analysis and our analysis implied a forward P/E multiple of 20.4x and an EV/EBITDA multiple of 14.3x. These are in line with Unilever’s historical averages.Author Author Bloomberg  Company Filings  Author's Graph Bloomberg  Company Filings  Author's SpreadsheetValuationUsing a combination of Unilever’s historical multiples and the implied multiples from our comps analysis  on a forward P/E basis  we believe the ADR today is worth $60. This represents ~15% upside from current prices.We believe that this stock could provide cumulative total returns of 28% over the next 2 years. 20.3% of the return would come from price appreciation  while the remaining return would come from dividends.At these levels  we think that there is a significant margin of safety built into the stock  as the inflationary concerns are priced into the stock price at this point. We see the downside on the ADRs of $47.75 with one year of dividends protecting the downside to just 5%.An EV/EBITDA multiple yields similar results. We believe the implied multiple from our comps analysis was a bit too high  so we capped our upside case at 14.5x which is close to the highest the stock ever traded at. Our base case is slightly above the stock’s 10-year average EV/EBITDA multiple  and our downside is the stock returning to close to March 2020 valuations.Author's Model Author's ModelDue to the mature nature of Unilever’s business  a discounted cash flow (""DCF"") analysis is also a useful tool for deriving the value today. Using what we would consider to be highly conservative inputs  we derive an ADR value per share today of $53.42. This represents an upside of 15.3%.Author's ModelWe note that there is some element of a wait-and-see story here. The market clearly doesn’t believe that management can navigate through the challenging environment  and so earnings releases will play a key role in getting the stock back towards our target valuation.We confess that it is virtually impossible to predict commodity price movements  currency or consumer buying behavior with any degree of accuracy  so there is the risk of a sell-off on a quarterly earnings release. We would generally add more ADRs to our position in the low $40’s high $30s.RisksOur analysis of Unilever’s ability to preserve price increases and expand margins once input cost increases abate could be incorrect. This would likely result in slower futures earnings growth and this a lower stock multiple in the future.As a consumer staples stock  Unilever is generally viewed as an income oriented conservative investment. Consumer staples stocks generally have higher sensitivity to interest rates so a drastic move higher in long-term rates could potentially hurt the stock price.Management could poorly manage the company’s portfolio of brands. This would include failing to properly integrate an acquisition  paying too much for an acquisition  or disposing of an asset for too low of a price.Potential liability from consumer personal care products. We’ve seen this with J&J and their talc powder products. Generally speaking  these are safe products and lawsuits tend to be short-term issues.The company could fail to innovate and keep up with changing consumer tastes. This has been a major challenge for the entire industry as consumers have been in favor of products from smaller more nimble companies. Investing in the proper areas and releasing products that are attractive consumers are key to sustainable successful long-term business growth.ADR currency translation is another risk that has played out in recent months. Since Unilever is listed in Europe  a decline in the euro versus the dollar leads to a lower ADR value. However  if the euro strengthens this be really good for the ADRs.ConclusionUnilever is not the type of stock that is going to get you rich overnight  but we do believe that this is a great portfolio stabilizer. The stock can generate some relatively decent income (a 3.7% yield) with low volatility returns. In a risk off market  Unilever is likely to outperform like it has this year. Any reduction in interest rates or weakening USD would likely result in major upside for the ADRs. This would just be an extra boost on top of what we expect to be EPS growth for Unilever over the next couple of years.This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alpha’s Top Ex-US Stock Pick competition  which runs through November 7.

(Euronext: OCI) and ADNOC)  Scatec ASA (OSE: SCATC)  Orascom Construction (NASDAQ Dubai: OC: EGX: ORAS) and The Sovereign Fund of Egypt  marks an important milestone in the development of a green hydrogen ecosystem in Egypt and the broader African region.The launch of the hydrogen facility comes as world leaders gather for the United Nations COP 27 Climate Change Conference in Sharm El Sheikh  Egypt  where they seek to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction. Unless we make sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades  global warming will exceed the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.In order to secure affordable  accessible and sustainable energy security for future generations an accelerated shift to renewable energy and lower carbon intensity fuels is required. Green hydrogen  which is produced from water using renewable energy sources  has the potential to play a significant role in decarbonizing hard to abate sectors  such as heavy industries and global shipping.Ain Sokhna has a strategic position close to the Suez Canal Economic Zone with the possibility of using renewable electricity to develop an industrial hub near global shipping lanes.Fertiglobe has a strong global network through its shareholders OCI N.V. and ADNOC and is an early mover in hydrogen and low carbon ammonia. The hydrogen tie-ins for up to 100 MW of electrolysis have already been installed at Fertiglobe’s two existing ammonia plants in Ain Sokhna.The project is being built by Orascom Construction using Egyptian engineers and state of the art technology.Terje Pilskog  CEO of co-owner and leading renewable power producer Scatec said:“Today marks a key milestone for Scatec  but more importantly  it represents a breakthrough for green hydrogen production in a strategically situated region. It is an honour to work together with Egyptian authorities and our industrial partners on this project and commence the commissioning of the green hydrogen project in Egypt during the UN world leader's climate summit. We see a massive green hydrogen demand driven by strong policy support globally  and Africa is perfectly positioned to take advantage of its low-cost renewables and strategic position.”His Excellency Dr. Sultan Al Jaber  Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology  UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change and chairman of co-owner Fertiglobe  said:“The commissioning of ‘Egypt Green’ marks another important step in the journey to unlock the potential of hydrogen and its carrier fuels. As the world meets in Sharm el Sheikh for COP 27  this project represents a practical response to the need to meet rising energy demand with minimum emissions. The first integrated green hydrogen plant in Africa  delivered in record time  shows what can be achieved when we collaborate around a shared ambition. Fertiglobe will continue to leverage its knowledge and experience in hydrogen and ammonia  to make low and zero carbon fuels more available  as the world seeks a realistic pathway to a decarbonized energy system.”Nassef Sawiris  Executive Chair of OCI N.V. and Executive Vice Chair of co-owner Fertiglobe said:“We are pleased with the launch of the first tangible project of its kind and the first integrated green hydrogen plant in Africa. It is a true milestone that puts Egypt and Africa firmly on the map as one of the best places in the world to develop a green hydrogen hub  thanks to available land  abundant renewable energy sources  the significant pool of skilled labor  and our location on global cross-roads. We are pleased to have been able to show leadership developing a green ammonia production platform in such a short time frame  something that has not been achieved elsewhere. We could not have done this without the support of in particular the Egyptian government or without the collaboration with our industrial partners. We look forward to seeing the positive impact this project can have for the world.”Ahmed El-Hoshy  CEO of OCI N.V. and co-owner Fertiglobe said:“This project is a significant further step towards our global decarbonization strategy and an exciting milestone for Fertiglobe  as it marks the first of many stages in the execution on our hydrogen roadmap. Adding the electrolyzer to our state-of-the-art ammonia facilities and infrastructure in Egypt  we are fully leveraging our existing ammonia production and global distribution infrastructure  including OCI’s Port of Rotterdam ammonia import terminal. We aim to meet the increasing demand for large-scale low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia  as the need for more sustainable energy sources becomes more urgent. Together with our partners in the project we are acting on this need and bringing the hydrogen future to life.”Osama Bishai  CEO of co-owner Orascom Construction said:""The project brings together world class partners that collectively set an ambitious goal to form a new hydrogen hub out of Egypt  thus creating a new sustainable industry. So many variables went into making this phase come to life. This project would not have been possible without the support of the Egyptian government and a number of ministries  who by working closely with the consortium  were able to provide immense support that was integral to the swift delivery of the first phase of ‘Egypt Green’. I am also proud of our teams on the ground who worked tirelessly to commission the first phase of this project  consequently  making this launch possible. This state-of-the-art project  which implements the latest hydrogen technology  is built by Egyptian engineers on Egyptian soil. We are delighted to embark on a journey that plays an important role in the sustainable industrial development of Egypt.""Ayman Soliman  CEO of The Sovereign Fund of Egypt said:“This project is a showcase of transitioning from pledges to implementation  delivering on Egypt’s promise to the world to create a regional hub for green energy and transforming the Suez Canal into a green corridor. We are setting a precedent with our foreign and local partners from the private sector by establishing the first integrated green hydrogen plant in Africa and Emerging Markets that caters to the growing demand for clean energy. It is a moment of pride that we will build on for future generations. Our pipeline of projects in the green energy field capitalizes on Egypt’s ideal location with its unique renewables profile and proximity to markets with renewables deficits to realize our shared goal of emissions reduction.""NotesAbout OCI N.V.OCI N.V.

The update follows the announcement of the merger between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic  and the listing on Euronext Brussels and Paris.The BioSenic autoimmune platform has been constructed to target systemic autoimmune diseases using arsenic trioxide (ATO). This uses ATO’s first-in-class mechanism of action as an active anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent.“Medsenic has developed its systemic autoimmune disease platform over a 12-year period to utilize the immunomodulation properties of arsenic trioxide. The properties of ATO as a small molecule are now well established ” said Prof. François Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. “Following the merger  BioSenic is now developing controlled dosages and new formulations that are adapted to a significant number of important indications with unmet medical needs. We are looking to demonstrate that arsenic can potentially cure and save lives. Combining both our platforms  ALLOB from Bone Therapeutics and the new ATO platform by Medsenic  BioSenic will trigger key value creation milestones during the first half of 2023.”The unique efficacy of ATO to create long-lasting remission of a rare cancer condition  acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)  has been previously recognized by both FDA and EMA  with market approvals. BioSenic is now further actively clinically testing ATO as a main therapeutic asset for autoimmune diseases.There are two mechanisms of action of arsenic trioxide for counteracting autoimmunity and inflammatory chronic diseases. The first is a significant increase in oxidative stress of activated immune cells leading to their death. The second inhibits the synthesis and/or release of proinflammatory cytokines. By combining the mechanisms of action  inflammation and active autoimmunity is drastic decreased. These immunomodulatory properties have important and long-lasting effects on the immune pathology in a number of autoimmune diseases. This has been extensively previously demonstrated in adequate animal models by Medsenic and other organizations.BioSenic assets now comprise two platforms:The ALLOB MSC platform uses cells with immune privilege  anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to differentiate into bone tissues when injected into the specific bone sites to be regenerated or repaired. The phase IIb trial of ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in H1 2023.The autoimmune disease platform using ATO has completed a phase IIb trial with positive results on safety and efficacy in 20 patients for cGVHD (chronic Graft vs Host Disease). A headline result for this corticosteroid-controlled trial was that patient’s corticosteroids levels decreased as soon as six weeks following the start of the treatment with ATO  to reach minimal levels.""Medsenic/BioSenic has recently completed a phase II study of Arsenic Trioxide in combination with corticosteroids as initial therapy for moderate-severe cGvHD. The promising response rates at six months justifies pursuing a phase III study  with a goal of broadening treatment options and reducing the overall morbidity of chronic GVHD in our transplant recipients "" said Prof. Corey Cutler  medical director of the Stem Cell Transplantation Program at Boston's Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Cutler's field of expertise is Graft Versus Host Disease.The acquired clinical results and expected results from both platforms enable BioSenic to move forward into confirmatory Phase III studies prior to Market Access procedures with regulatory agencies in US and Europe.The phase III study of the autoimmune disease platform in cGvHD (Chronic Graft vs Host Disease) has been designed to reach the market as quickly as possible through the framework of an expedite 505b2 FDA regulatory pathway.In addition to cGVHD  BioSenic is also preparing a randomized placebo-controlled phase IIb study with ATO in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. This disease has a high prevalence - the worldwide prevalence of SLE can reach 108 per 100 000 inhabitants and its incidence 5.14 per 100 000 inhabitants per year (Tian et al  2022  Ann Reum. Dis.). As a result  this disease is potentially a strategic target for BioSenic. In addition  promising preclinical data gathered by Medsenic has provided clinical data to support a phase II clinical trial with ATO targeting systemic sclerosis.As a result  BioSenic expects key value creation milestones in H1 2023 with the interim phase IIb results of ALLOB and the start of the phase III study with ATO in cGvHD. BioSenic will start the process to engage with industrial partners to co-develop late-stage clinical projects and to look at other segments of interest in autoimmune diseases and cancer.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap Investor Relations & Financial CommunicationsPierre Laurent  Louis-Victor Delouvrier and Arthur RouilléTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 94 94bone@newcap.euCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This shows Idylla™’s potential to improve strategic treatment decisions within a multidisciplinary team for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “Tailoring cancer treatments to individual patients is key  and require molecular diagnostic testing to help identify the specific biomarkers involved. Recent studies3 among approximately 1 600 patients show that in many European countries  less than 50% of the patients undergo biomarker testing. This is due to  among other reasons  lack of diagnostic laboratory infrastructure which also hinders a broader uptake of more complex testing technologies such as NGS. Integrating decentralized  rapid and easy-to-use Idylla™ testing in routine use can help broaden access to biomarker testing and as such  improve patient treatment and outcomes. We are therefore very pleased with another study showing the significant impact of Idylla™ on time-to-treatment that is no less than 16.8 days faster than NGS for EGFR positive patients with advanced NSCLC.”The study was performed on 238 samples which were tested both using an NGS panel (Oncopanel) and the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test4. The study showed a concordance of 98.7% between the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test and the NGS panel. The lab turnaround time was faster for the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test by an average of 12.4 days. In the EGFR positive cohort  the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test led to a 48% reduction and on average 16.8 days faster turnaround time.Furthermore  the study concludes that the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test could contribute to overall time and cost savings for patients if testing is implemented in a stepwise manner  where the Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test and the PD-L1 IHC (Immunohistochemistry) test are performed first  and comprehensive yet more expensive NGS panel testing is only initiated in case of a negative Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test. Such first-line use of Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test is not only more cost-effective  but it also allows to obtain EGFR test results in the same time frame as the PD-L1 IHC test results  which is important as EGFR positivity may be a contra-indication forPD-1/PD-L1 therapy in NSCLC5.The impact of the rapid Idylla™ EGFR Mutation Test on turnaround times is in line with previous studies6 published  concluding that Idylla™ testing early on may contribute to improving strategic treatment decisions in a multidisciplinary team for patients with NSCLC by the early screening of EGFR mutations.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile 32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

For hybrid and internal-combustion vehicles  Renault plans to combine its technological  manufacturing and research and development activities with Chinese automaker Geely.The 50-50 partnership with the Chinese group -- owner of Volvo -- will develop and produce engines  gear boxes and other components for hybrid and petrol and diesel vehicles.It will employ 19 000 people across Europe  China and South America  and have 17 factories and five research and development centres.Turnover for the division is expected to grow by four percent by 2027  the group said.""We are designing an agile and innovative organisation to manage the volatility and accelerated technological evolution of our time "" said Renault chief executive Luca de Meo.The group aims to see an operating margin -- a key profitability yardstick -- of above eight percent in 2025.Shares in Renault fell on the Paris exchange shortly after trading began on Tuesday  before regaining ground by mid-morning.The group's financial targets are ""more ambitious than expected"" but ""raise questions""  analyst Tom Narayan of RBC said.The company suffered a historic loss in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and its recovery was destabilised by its withdrawal from Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.In late July  Renault said that its decision to quit the Russian market had pushed it deep into the red in the first half of 2022.Two months earlier  it had sold its 100-percent stake in Renault Russia and its 68-percent stake in AVTOVAZ.But with its new revamp  Renault said it planned to resume paying shareholders a dividend next year for the first time since 2019.The value of traditional car manufacturers pales in comparison to new players on the market specialising in electric vehicles such as Elon Musk's Tesla or Chinese firm BYD.US giant Ford has taken similar steps  announcing the creation of the ""Model E"" electric subsidiary earlier this year.Renault's sales of traditional internal-combustion vehicles are falling.In the first nine months of 2022  hybrid and electric vehicles represented 38 percent of the brand's registrations in Europe  a year-on-year increase of 12 percent.The separation of Renault's electric and conventional production has concerned trade unions after several waves of job cuts.",neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,negative,0.02,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['sweeping overhaul', 'electric future', 'Renault', 'Renault chief executive Luca de Meo', 'premium sports brand Porsche', 'Model E"" electric subsidiary', 'new electric vehicle unit', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'electric vehicle business', 'less polluting products', 'The European Union', 'key profitability yardstick', 'analyst Tom Narayan', 'US giant Ford', 'US automaker Ford', 'Financing electric drive', 'next eight years', 'first nine months', 'traditional car manufacturers', 'new CO2-emitting vehicles', 'million electric vehicles', 'traditional internal-combustion vehicles', 'new electric division', 'Chinese automaker Geely', 'French automaker Renault', 'Paris exchange', 'latest automaker', 'stock market', 'new division', 'new revamp', 'new players', 'electric prototypes', 'French state', 'greener vehicles', 'first half', 'Chinese firm', 'new Renault', 'sweeping overhaul', 'green revamp', 'flagship division', 'investor day', ""consumers' worries"", 'climate change', 'autonomous cars', 'other models', '30-percent growth', 'latter half', 'strong majority', 'Japanese partner', 'development activities', '50-50 partnership', 'gear boxes', 'other components', 'South America', 'development centres', 'innovative organisation', 'technological evolution', 'operating margin', 'financial targets', 'historic loss', 'Covid-19 pandemic', 'late July', '100-percent stake', '68-percent stake', 'Elon Musk', 'similar steps', 'year increase', 'trade unions', 'several waves', 'job cuts', 'eight percent', 'diesel vehicles', 'first time', 'accelerating market', 'Russian market', 'northern France', 'Chinese group', 'five research', 'conventional production', 'four percent', 'hybrid cars', '15 percent', '38 percent', '12 percent', 'Tuesday', 'bid', 'investors', 'operations', 'petrol', 'China', 'carmaker', 'reorganisation', 'Ampere', '10,000 staff', 'shift', 'response', 'pressure', 'move', 'continent', 'likes', 'Germany', 'Volkswagen', 'September', 'investment', 'connected', 'Nissan', 'manufacturing', 'owner', 'Volvo', 'engines', '19,000 people', '17 factories', 'Turnover', 'agile', 'volatility', 'Shares', 'trading', 'ground', 'mid-morning', 'questions', 'RBC', 'company', 'recovery', 'withdrawal', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'decision', 'red', 'AVTOVAZ', 'shareholders', 'value', 'comparison', 'Tesla', 'BYD', 'creation', 'sales', 'registrations', 'separation', '2022']",2022-11-08,2022-11-09,economictimes.indiatimes.com

Developing efficient technologies in that field remains key for the future of any global OEM. Therefore  Renault Group is ensuring the further development of its core business  with the launch of a totally new range of Renault ICE & Hybrid (passenger cars)  Dacia and LCV – and with the creation of a worldwide supplier  leader in ICE & hybrid powertrain technologies.Renault Group will combine its ICE & hybrid powertrain technologies (Horse project) together with Geely to create a worldwide leading supplierRenault Group and Geely will combine their ICE in a 50-50 entity. This dedicated business will design  develop  produce  and sell all ICE & hybrid powertrain components and systems with state-of-the-art technologies. Day 1  the entity will have a turnover of over €15 billion and a volume of 5 million units per year  already serving 8 customers who will benefit of increased synergies and productivity.This entity will be full-fledged and global  with:17 plants supplying 130 countries5 R&D centers in Europe (Spain  Romania and Sweden)  China  and South America for a total of 3 000 engineersA total of 19 000 employees  across 3 continentsIt will offer a complete portfolio of technologies on all components: engine  gearbox  xHEV systems and batteries at best level. Thanks to this project  Renault Group will double both its scale and market coverage from 40% to 80% worldwide. This growth will be fueled by geographical expansion  with access to North America and China  and by products complementarity to come up with complete low emissions systems and solutions for OEMs. To do that  it will develop its technology portfolio in the field of alternative fuels seeking for cooperation with a potential partner from the energy industry.Renault brand ICE & Hybrid: globally upliftedEven with the sharp rise of the EV offer  the combustion engine vehicles will still continue to grow especially outside of Europe. Thus  Renault brand will remain present on ICE & hybrid markets  especially in Latin America  India  South Korea and North Africa. Renault ICE & Hybrid passenger cars sales will keep growing 2% per year on average over 2022-2030.To uplift the brand in all geographies  Renault will continue its C-segment offensive and will grow by 20% its net revenue  while expanding its contribution margin by 30% between 2022 and 2030.Dacia: growing from >10% operating margin to 15% by 2030Dacia’s model is unique  built upon the combination of three main components:An engineering focus on design-to-cost already providing a solid double-digit cost advantageA unique industrial and sourcing footprint with a benchmark cost competitivenessAn asset-light distribution model ensuring costs comparable to agency model85% retail channel mixAs a consequence  Dacia already generates an operating margin above 10%  and aims to reach 15% by 2030.To achieve this ambition  Dacia  currently a B-segment champion will boldly enter the C-segment. After Jogger this year  Dacia Bigster will embody this move and 2 other vehicles will follow  allowing Dacia to double its profit pool coverage. In parallel  Dacia will also keep lowering costs and will benefit from the doubling of the volume of the global CMF-B platform across brands which will reach 2 million units by 2030.Dacia will contribute to reinvent the ICE value chain through the cooperation with Horse project by developing breakthrough powertrains adaptation for alternative & synthetic fuels. Dacia will smoothly transition to EV in Europe by pioneering affordable EV solutions.LCV: propelled into the future by two game changersRenault Group’s LCV business relies on solid foundations with over 5 million vehicles in European car park  an ecosystem of over 600 dedicated Pro+ dealers  4 plants and the most up-to-date line-up by 2026.Renault LCV will develop two game changing projects to address a dynamic and changing market:Hyvia : the Group’s joint-venture with Plug for carbon-free hydrogen mobility offers a complete ecosystem  from fuel cells vehicles  to electrolyzers  to hydrogen refueling. It combines Plug’s H2 expertise with Renault Group’s industrial and engineering assets. Hyvia aims for 30% of the hydrogen-powered LCV market by 2030  in Europe and a cumulated order intake of €1 billion by 2026.: the Group’s joint-venture with Plug for carbon-free hydrogen mobility offers a complete ecosystem  from fuel cells vehicles  to electrolyzers  to hydrogen refueling. It combines Plug’s H2 expertise with Renault Group’s industrial and engineering assets. Hyvia aims for 30% of the hydrogen-powered LCV market by 2030  in Europe and a cumulated order intake of €1 billion by 2026. FlexEVan: a game changing EV & software defined family of vans to be deployed on the market from 2026. FlexEVan will be compact for urban use thanks to a specially designed EV platform. FlexEVan will benefit from the SDV developed within Ampere. The vehicle will thus become a fully connected warehouse extension  integrated into the customer's digital ecosystem. It will be the first vehicle to benefit from the application of the software-defined vehicle technology at Renault Group  allowing notably for real-time  end-to-end operations monitoring and data-driven fleet management. FlexEVan will reduce the total lifecycle cost of usage for the clients by at least 30%  i.e. more than the price of the van. To support the development of FlexEVan  Renault Group intends to create Flexis  a partnership with a relevant partner having experience in the sector and a complementary activity. Thanks to this partnership  developments will be shared  meaning a significant decrease in costs and a maximization of customers coverage.Ampere: the 1st EV and software pure player born from an OEM disruptionWith Ampere  Renault Group is creating a standalone company that will be the 1st EV and software pure player born from an OEM disruption. Ampere will develop  manufacture  and sell full EV passenger cars  with cutting-edge software-defined vehicle (SDV) technology  under the Renault brand.

The performances of these 5 businesses will continue to build on the financial discipline implemented during the Resurrection phase. The Group’s levers – value over volume  competitiveness and capital efficiency – will be further accelerated respectively by its new products offensive  a strong focus on variable costs  sustainable supplier network development and digitization. And furthermore  a unique ecosystemic partnership approach will extend the coverage of key value chains with a low capital intensity bias.To face current industry unprecedented transformation challenge  Renault Group developed an approach based on two principles:A self-financed plan  secured by strong free cash-flow generation from its businessesPartnerships or external funding to accelerate growth  innovation or competitiveness and reduce capital requirementsAmpere: low cash-burn & external fundingRenault Group wishes to accelerate Ampere’s future development and propel Renault brand into its electric future without drawing heavily on the Group’s financial resources. In this context  the Group envisages external partners and investors to embark on the journey with assumptions as follows:Established EV player with limited cash burn. Free cash-flow above 0 in 2025Open to external investors to accelerate R&D and ecosystem developmentAlliance scale (Renault Group  Nissan  Mitsubishi Motors): equity participation under studyEnvisaged IPO on Euronext Paris earliest H2 2023 (subject to market conditions) with Renault Group keeping strong majority and the support of potential strategic cornerstone investors (including Qualcomm Technologies)Horse project: financially optimizing the ICE & hybrid powertrain futureFrom a financial standpoint  Horse project aims at providing productivity gains  fixed costs reduction and significant Group’s balance sheet improvement. Renault Group will keep 50% of the entity  a level which would lead to the deconsolidation of this activity from Renault Group’s scope and financial statements  starting from H2 2023.The carve-out impacts are estimated as follows:€2.5 billion fixed assets reduction€1.2 billion fixed costs variabilization  per year on average and €2.4 billion reduction in R&D and Capex from 2023 to 2030Powertrain cost competitiveness: €2.5 billion from 2023-2030.

This dividend symbolizes a new era and then will gradually grow in a disciplined manner up to 35% payout ratio of Group consolidated net income – parent share  in the mid-term. To do so  the Group must achieve its first priority which is to turn back to an investment grade rating.Capital allocation policy: implementing a balanced capital allocationRenault Group aims at using at least 50% of the excess cash generated to reinvest in the Group. Looking forward  Renault Group intends to be more active on financial investments  in line with its ecosystemic approach  but limiting them to maximum 15% to 20% of its free cash-flow.For the remaining cash allocation  aside from dividend  the Group wishes to associate its employees to its performance to foster a common sense of belonging to the project and nurture a culture of value. Through dedicated employees’ shareholding programs  it ambitions to see the employee shareholding portion grow to 10% of the Group capital by 2030.Existing bonds will remain under Renault SA  the issuer of the industrial activities of the Group. Each business could use financing instruments depending on its own needs and strategy.AllianceRenault Group  Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors are currently engaged in discussions to jointly address the new challenges and opportunities driving the future of the automotive industry  which include:An agreement on a set of strategic common initiatives across markets  products  and technologiesNissan and Mitsubishi Motors consideration to invest in Ampere which will support Renault Group’s Renaulution strategy and will be one of the strategic steps towards Nissan Ambition 2030 and Mitsubishi Motors strategyStructural improvements to ensure sustainable Alliance operations and governance** *This plan will be presented to employee representative bodies in accordance with applicable regulations.The presentation is available on www.renaultgroup.com.* **About Renault GroupRenault Group is at the forefront of a mobility that is reinventing itself.

For additional details on the study  visit BE OPTIMAL on clinicaltrials.gov.1About BE COMPLETEBE COMPLETE was a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFαi). All enrolled study participants had a history of inadequate response (lack of efficacy after at least three months of therapy at an approved dose) or intolerance to treatment with one or two TNFαi for either psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. For additional details on the study  visit BE COMPLETE on clinicaltrials.gov.2About BE MOBILE 1BE MOBILE 1 was a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active nr-axSpA. For additional details on the study  visit BE MOBILE 1 on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE MOBILE 2BE MOBILE 2 was a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active AS. For additional details on the study  visit BE MOBILE 2 on clinicaltrials.gov.4About CIMZIA® in the U.S. 5CIMZIA® is the only Fc-free  PEGylated anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor). CIMZIA has a high affinity for human TNF-alpha  selectively neutralizing the pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha.CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  and adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation.CIMZIA is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PSO) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.In addition  CIMZIA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. See important safety information including risk of serious bacterial  viral and fungal infections and tuberculosis below.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about CIMZIA in the U.S.CONTRAINDICATIONSCIMZIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to certolizumab pegol or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema  anaphylaxis  serum sickness  and urticaria.SERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.Discontinue CIMZIA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis (TB)  including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to CIMZIA use.Invasive fungal infections  including histoplasmosis  coccidioidomycosis  candidiasis  aspergillosis  blastomycosis  and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated  rather than localized  disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.Bacterial  viral  and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens  including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA prior to initiating therapy in the following patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of opportunistic infection; who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic; with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA  including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start CIMZIA during an active infection  including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years  patients with co-morbid conditions  and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops  monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies  some fatal  have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers  of which CIMZIA is a member. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.Consider the risks and benefits of CIMZIA treatment prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials  more cases of malignancies were observed among CIMZIA-treated patients compared to control patients.In CIMZIA clinical trials  there was an approximately 2-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis  particularly those with highly active disease  are at a higher risk of lymphoma than the general population.Malignancies  some fatal  have been reported among children  adolescents  and young adults being treated with TNF blockers.Approximately half of the cases were lymphoma  while the rest were other types of malignancies  including rare types associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually seen in this patient population.Approximately half of the cases were lymphoma  while the rest were other types of malignancies  including rare types associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually seen in this patient population. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL)  a rare type of T-cell lymphoma  have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers  including CIMZIA. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treating with CIMZIA in these patient types.Cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use.HEART FAILUREWorsening and new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Exercise caution and monitor carefully.HYPERSENSITIVITYAngioedema  anaphylaxis  dyspnea  hypotension  rash  serum sickness  and urticaria have been reported following CIMZIA administration. If a serious allergic reaction occurs  stop CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. The needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA prefilled syringe contains a plastic derivative of natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to latex.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers  including CIMZIA  may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA.Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them before and during CIMZIA treatment.Discontinue CIMZIA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming CIMZIA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers  including CIMZIA  have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases  including multiple sclerosis  seizure disorder  optic neuritis  peripheral neuropathy  and Guillain-Barré syndrome.HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia  including aplastic anemia  have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with CIMZIA.Consider stopping CIMZIA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.DRUG INTERACTIONSDo not use CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDS.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with CIMZIA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and  rarely  in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on CIMZIA should not receive live or live-attenuated vaccines.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in CIMZIA clinical trials (≥8%) were: upper respiratory infections (18%)  rash (9%)  and urinary tract infections (8%).For full prescribing information  please visithttps://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Cimzia_09_11_2019_en.pdfCIMZIA® is a registered trademark of the UCB Group of Companies.About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.6 In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.7 8 The label information may differ in other countries.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.

Portugal's Resolution Fund has the remaining 25% stake.Non-performing loans (NPLs) fell to 1.6 billion euros ($1.60 billion)  or 5% of total credit  in September from 2.2 billion a year earlier. In 2017  its NPLs were 10.1 billion or 28% of total loans.""The major part of the job is done. But we need to be looking at the European average  which is in the 2.5%-3% range... in the short to medium-term "" Bourke said.Novo Banco's nine-month net profit almost tripled to 428 million euros  citing improved commission income  capital market gains and a steep drop in impairments and provisions.""This was the seventh straight quarter of profitability. We can generate 80 to 100 bps of capital through underlying profitability a year – that means we control our own destiny "" Bourke said.Although nine-month net interest income (NII)  or earnings on loans minus funding costs  fell 5.6% due to higher funding costs of senior debt issuance and other factors  NII rose by 2.5% between July and September from the previous three months  benefiting from rate hikes by the European Central Bank.The average rate of its net interest margin stood at 1.29%  but the impact of the upward repricing of the portfolios should come in the fourth quarter and Novo Banco should end the year ""well above 1.5%""  the upper bound of its forecast range  he said.($1 = 0.9998 euros)Reporting by Sergio Goncalves; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi  Andrei Khalip and Susan FentonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.19,0.57,True,English,"['Novo Banco', 'Portugal', 'IPO', 'plans', 'U.S. private equity fund', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'nine-month net interest income', 'MASSIVE BAD LOANS CLEAN-UP', 'nine-month net profit', 'net interest margin', 'initial public offering', 'five largest players', 'recovery track record', 'chief financial officer', 'tough restructuring commitments', 'senior debt issuance', 'previous three months', 'north European countries', 'seventh straight quarter', 'Banco Espirito Santo', 'higher funding costs', 'capital market gains', 'profit-making Novo Banco', 'European Central Bank', 'Resolution Fund', 'commission income', 'European average', 'Portuguese market', 'fourth quarter', 'Non-performing loans', 'total loans', 'new CEO', 'Lone Star', 'banking assets', 'high level', 'Portuguese companies', 'real estate', 'total credit', 'major part', 'steep drop', '80 to 100 bps', 'other factors', 'rate hikes', 'average rate', 'upward repricing', 'upper bound', 'Sergio Goncalves', 'Elisa Martinuzzi', 'Andrei Khalip', 'Susan Fenton', 'capitalised bank', '1.6 billion euros', '428 million euros', 'IPO opportunity', 'Euronext Lisbon', 'remaining 25% stake', 'underlying profitability', 'forecast range', 'Mark Bourke', '0.9998 euros', '75% stake', '2.5%-3% range', 'Portugal', 'markets', 'listings', 'Tuesday', 'Analysts', 'ruins', 'lender', 'position', 'August', 'concentration', 'advantage', 'risking', 'subsidiaries', 'Brussels', 'NPLs', 'September', 'job', 'short', 'medium-term', 'impairments', 'provisions', 'destiny', 'NII', 'earnings', 'July', 'impact', 'portfolios', 'year', 'Reporting', 'Standards']",2022-11-08,2022-11-09,reuters.com

We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA  when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measure  provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis.However  non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only  has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition  other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance  all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for Adjusted EBITDA to net loss  the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.We defined Adjusted EBITDA as net loss  adjusted to exclude: (i) interest expense  net  (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes  (iii) depreciation and amortization  (iv) share-based compensation expense  (v) change in fair value of warrant liabilities  (vi) acquisition-related transaction costs  and (vii) other significant gains  losses  and expenses (such as impairments  transaction bonus) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains ""forward-looking statements "" which generally are accompanied by words such as ""believe "" ""may "" ""could "" ""will "" ""estimate "" ""continue "" ""anticipate "" ""intend "" ""target "" ""goal "" ""expect "" ""should "" ""would "" ""plan "" ""predict "" ""project "" ""forecast "" ""potential "" ""seem "" ""seek "" ""future "" ""outlook "" and similar expressions that predict  indicate or relate to future events or trends or Forge’s future financial or operating performance  or that are not statements of historical matters.

However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€60.9 million (-€59.4 million in Q3 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €747.5 million (€647.1 million in Q3 2021).For the first nine months of 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€167.8 million(-€147.4 million for the first nine months of 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 115.4 million (€1 641.5 million for the first nine months of 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect.

The safety profile of Onivyde in the NAPOLI 3 trial was consistent with those observed in the previous phase I/II mPDAC study.Ipsen intends to file a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Onivyde in combination with oxaliplatin plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mPDAC following the Fast Track Designation granted in 2020. The clinical trial results will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.“ The positive results from the NAPOLI 3 trial demonstrate that compared with the standard-of-care  the investigational Onivyde treatment regimen extended the lives of people living with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who were previously untreated ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “ The prognosis for people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is extremely poor and we plan to submit these new findings to the regulatory authority as  if approved  we believe this regimen could offer up an important new treatment option for people living with an aggressive and hard-to-treat cancer. We thank the patients who participated in the study  their families and their healthcare teams.”PDAC is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas with approximately 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.1 2 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).3 Even in later stages  weight loss  abdominal pain and jaundice are the most common symptoms making PDAC difficult to detect.4 Currently  fewer than 20 percent of people diagnosed with PDAC survive longer than one year and overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.1 2Phase III NAPOLI 3 StudyNAPOLI 3 is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Onivyde plus oxaliplatin and 5 FU/LV was administered twice in a month (days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycle) compared to an injection of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine administered three times a month (days 1  8  15 of a 28 day cycle). Approximately 770 patients were enrolled in the trial with the primary outcome measure of overall survival. Secondary outcome measures included progression-free survival  objective response rate  quality of life assessment  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events  serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. Adverse events and laboratory analyses were also analyzed.Onviyde® (irinotecan liposome injection)Onivyde is a long-circulating  liposomal topoisomerase inhibitor designed to interrupt DNA replication in cancer cells. Onivyde enters cancer cells using a naturally occurring process (enhanced permeability and retention or EPR effect) and as macrophages unpack the liposomes  Onivyde is activated facilitating the release of the cytotoxic payload into the tumor  including irinotecan and its conversion into SN-38  its active metabolite. Ipsen has exclusive commercialization rights for the current and potential future indications for Onivyde in the U.S. Servier  an independent international pharmaceutical company with a strong international presence in 150 countries  is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde outside of the U.S. and Taiwan. PharmaEngine is a commercial stage oncology company headquartered in Taipei and is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde in Taiwan.Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  Europe and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNINGS: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA and SEVERE DIARRHEAFatal neutropenic sepsis occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving Onivyde. Severe or life-threatening neutropenic fever or sepsis occurred in 3% and severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU and LV. Withhold Onivyde for absolute neutrophil count below 1500/mm3 or neutropenic fever. Monitor blood cell counts periodically during treatment.Severe diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU/LV. Do not administer Onivyde to patients with bowel obstruction. Withhold Onivyde for diarrhea of Grade 2–4 severity. Administer loperamide for late diarrhea of any severity. Administer atropine  if not contraindicated  for early diarrhea of any severity.CONTRAINDICATIONOnivyde is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Onivyde or irinotecan hydrochloride.Warnings and precautionsSevere neutropenia: see boxed WARNING.

For more information  visit ipsen.com.Ipsen’s Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.References1. https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html2. https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/pancreatic-cancer/statistics3.

However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€60.9 million (-€59.4 million in Q3 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €747.5 million (€647.1 million in Q3 2021).For the first nine months of 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€167.8 million(-€147.4 million for the first nine months of 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 115.4 million (€1 641.5 million for the first nine months of 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 Q3 9M 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 1 082.3 706.5 1 788.8 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 1 367.8 747.5 2 115.4 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 106.9 60.9 167.8 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 808.4 2 283.2 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -49.2 -37.8 -87.0 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 770.6 2 196.2 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.4 -0.4 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 770.2 2 195.8 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +45.7% +21.6% +31.7% +9.0% +22.8%€m Impact of currencyas of September 30th  2022 USD -19.4 CNY -17.5 HKD -8.6 BRL -7.8 Others -33.7 Total -87.0Average exchange rate 9M 2022 9M 2021 USD 0.9400 0.8360 CNY 0.1425 0.1292 HKD 0.1200 0.1076 BRL 0.1830 0.1568Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

On Tuesday  it was announced that the Renault Group and Chinese firm Geely had signed a non-binding framework agreement to establish a company focused on the development  production and supply of ""hybrid powertrains and highly efficient ICE [internal combustion engine] powertrains."" According to Renault  both itself and Geely will have a 50% stake in the business  which will consist of 17 powertrain facilities and five research and development centers. Speaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed on Tuesday  Renault Chief Financial Officer Thierry Pieton sought to explain some of the reasoning behind the planned partnership with Geely. ""In our view  and according to all the studies that we've got  there is no scenario where ICE and hybrid engines represent less than 40% of the market with a horizon of 2040 "" he said. ""So it's actually … a market that's going to continue to grow.""The tie-up with Geely comes as Renault fleshes out plans to establish an EV spin-off called Ampere. According to Renault  France-based Ampere ""will develop  manufacture  and sell full EV passenger cars."" It's eyeing an initial public offering on the Euronext Paris  which would take place in the second half of 2023 at the earliest  subject to market conditions. During his interview with CNBC  Pieton touched upon the need  as he saw it  for different types of vehicles. ""It's very important to have  at the same time  the development of our electric vehicle business on one side — with Ampere — and to build a sustainable source of ICE and hybrid powertrains."" This was why Renault was going into a partnership with Geely  he added  explaining the move represented ""an absolute slam dunk"" from a business and financial perspective. This was because  Pieton argued  it created ""a world-leading supplier of ICE and hybrid powertrains with around 19 000 employees in the world  covering 130 countries.""In comments sent to CNBC via email  David Leggett  an analyst at GlobalData  noted that automotive manufacturers could still enjoy profits from the sale of vehicles that used internal combustion engines. ""Margins are generally higher than on electric vehicles  which are relatively costly to manufacture "" he said. ""The gap will eventually narrow as EV volumes rise sharply and unit costs on major EV components fall significantly  but there is still much profitable business to be done on ICEs and hybrids and will be for some time to come "" he added. ""Manufacturers need to be flexible in their powertrain offerings according to market needs — which differ across the world."" Renault's continued focus on the internal combustion engine comes at a time when some big economies are looking to move away from vehicles that use fossil fuels. The U.K.  for example  wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require  from 2035  all new cars and vans to have zero tailpipe emissions. The European Union  which the U.K. left on Jan. 31  2020  is pursuing similar targets.

I am particularly pleased with the support of the hundreds of individual shareholders who were able to participate via the PrimaryBid platform. This fundraising will offer our portfolio of four active substances in the advanced development phase a chance of success  thanks to future international partnerships  which will be added to the one already signed with Nestlé Health Science for TOTUM•63  and direct marketing in France of our three other products  TOTUM•070  TOTUM•854 and TOTUM•448. A new strategy that opens up prospects for the Company’s rapid growth in turnover.“Allocation of fundsAs previously announced  proceeds from the offering will be used to fund:- at 60%  the Company's structuring to support future global or regional (except France) licensing and/or distribution partnerships for the other TOTUM products in the pipeline (TOTUM•070 – LDL hypercholesterolemia; TOTUM•448 – NAFL/NASH; TOTUM•854 – raised blood pressure) and to support the licensing and supply agreements already signed for TOTUM•63 (prediabetes). It should be recalled that TOTUM•63 (prediabetes) is licensed at Nestlé Health Science  and the results of the Phase II/III REVERSE-IT pivot study are now expected in the first half of 2023 (as announced by the Company on 15 September 2022). From a regulatory point of view  TOTUM•63 is already marketable in Europe  after notification to the DGCCRF in France (mutual recognition applicable for other European Union countries). The results of REVERSE-IT are ultimately intended to enable a health claim to be made. Valbiotis' goal is to finalize the signature of an international licensing and/or distribution agreement by the second half of 2023 for TOTUM•070;- at 40%  the implementation of resources dedicated to the direct marketing of TOTUM products in France (excluding TOTUM•63) in accordance with the strategy communicated on October 7 (press release of October 7  2022). The marketing strategy will be based on in-house medical sales representatives (APMs) whose main target audience will be key prescribers  i.e.  general practitioners  certain specialists and pharmacists. The latter will recommend the TOTUM products based on their patients' cardiometabolic profile. At the same time  consumers/patients will be targeted directly through an adapted digital marketing strategy. The distribution channels envisaged will be pharmacies  drugstores and online sales. The funds raised will contribute to:the recruitment of a dedicated sales team;the structuring of online sales and product marketing  and;expenses related to the launch of direct sales (notably inventory building).As indicated in the press release published on October 7  2022  TOTUM•070  whose Phase II clinical study was highly successful  will be the first product marketed by Valbiotis in France even before a health claim. It is scheduled to be launched in the first half of 2024  followed by TOTUM•448 and TOTUM•854 in 2024-2025.Before the completion of the Global Offering  the Company’s cash horizon was in the last quarter of 2023. Given the current cash level  the net product of this Global Offering and the milestones expected during 2023 as part of the overall partnership with Nestlé Health Science on TOTUM•63 and in the second half of 2023 with the signing of a partnership on TOTUM•070  the Company extends its cash horizon to the end of the first half of 2024. In parallel  the Company is working on non-dilutive financing solutions to postpone this cash horizon.Terms of the Global OfferingThe Global Offering  for an overall amount of 9.7 million euros  was completed by way of issuance of 2 681 059 new ordinary shares with cancellation of preferential subscription rights and without a priority period  within:(i) an offering of 2 480 385 new shares for an approximate amount of 9.0 million euros (share premium included)  in favor of categories of investors (article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code) within the framework of the delegation granted by the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of May 5  2022 (13th resolution)  i.e. (“Reserved Offer”):investment companies and investment funds under French or foreign law that invest or have invested over the past five (5) years in the sector of prevention and/or the fight against chronic diseases;member companies of an industrial group governed by French or foreign law having an activity similar to that of the Company in the fields of prevention and/or the fight against chronic diseases.(ii) a public offering of 200 674 new shares intended for retail investors via the PrimaryBid platform for an approximate amount of 0.7 million euros within the framework of the delegation of powers granted by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 5  2022 (11th resolution) (“PrimaryBid Offer”).TP ICAP Midcap and Portzamparc  a subsidiary of BNP Paribas  acted as Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners and Allegra Finance  Listing Sponsor  is advising Valbiotis on this transaction.In the framework of the PrimaryBid Offering  investors were only able to subscribe via the PrimaryBid partners mentioned on the PrimaryBid website (www.PrimaryBid.fr).

Pieton explains the reason behind the move to focus on the internal combustion engine. Renault's focus comes at a time when some big economies are looking to move away from vehicles that use fossil fuels.Renault sees the internal combustion engine continuing to play a crucial role in its business over the coming years. Renault Group and Chinese firm Geely have signed a non-binding framework agreement to establish a company focused on the development  production and supply of ""hybrid powertrains and highly efficient ICE [internal combustion engine] power trains""Renault and Geely will have a 50% stake in the business  which will consist of 17 powertrain facilities and five research and development centers. ""In our view  and according to all of the studies that we've got  there is no scenario where ICE and hybrid engines represent less than 40% of the market with a horizon of 2040 "" says Thierry Pieton.Renault and Geely are working on an EV spin-off called Ampere.

Despite the many difficulties and the climate change challenge the world currently faces  we are confident in the ability of global retail to accelerate its transformation  and we believe in the role it can play as a provider of solutions for some of these issues. We are equally confident in SES-imagotag's ability to continue to play a leading role in the development of transformative solutions for the retail sector. This year  SES-imagotag celebrates its 30th anniversary. For thirty years  our overriding purpose has been the digitization of physical retail based on solutions  the technology provided by the Internet of Things  the Cloud  data  and artificial intelligence  that transform stores into ultra-efficient  connected  more automated and more intelligent environments  enabling an omnichannel service model and a quality experience to consumers who are becoming increasingly demanding of a seamless omnichannel retail offering. Physical retail has been under significant economic pressure for several years: eroding operating margins – driven by higher real estate expense  increasing labor costs  and growing competition from digital channels – are leading to shrinking profits. The resurgence of strong inflationary headwinds increases this pressure at every level of the cost structure  decreasing profit potential across the physical retail sector. Against this complex backdrop  visionary retailers succeed in betting on the omnichannel model and the revitalization of their physical points of sale  enabling – in particular – local e-commerce that is very fast and efficient  and also low in carbon emissions. Our conviction is that  in the years to come  technology will drive the acceleration of the evolution toward “phygital” retail: local  fast  efficient  convenient  offering local jobs of higher quality  and respectful of the environment  of urban centers and of consumers. And this is the magnificent purpose of SES-imagotag  the uncontested global leader driving the digital transformation of retail  whose growth and development are accelerating as a result of a growing demand and an incomparable capacity for innovation. SES-imagotag is a technology company whose usefulness and “raison d'être” become clearer by the day for all of our associates. Our ambition of strong profitable growth is based on the pillars built over the course of the past years: a global presence  a technological platform  high value-added solutions  a robust business model  a resilient supply chain  and a like-minded and motivated entrepreneurial management. Today  SES-imagotag is recognized as the reference company in Retail IoT. The unmet need remains immense in Europe  and the huge potential market in North America is beckoning to us. 2023 is shaping up to be a watershed year in terms of innovation launches. We thus foresee significant work ahead  in the service of a common good: the modernization of retail. We also anticipate compelling value creation for our clients  our associates  and our shareholders  who are growing in numbers and in international representation.” MARKET AND STRATEGY VUSION ‘27 Backdrop and Context: Physical Retail under Pressure The context within which SES-imagotag currently operates  and in which the VUSION ‘27 plan has been developed  is a physical retail industry that faces significant and model-shifting pressure from several directions: The current macroeconomic backdrop   with galloping inflation in many key markets and looming recession across the globe  is driving rising labor and energy costs (among others) and  consequently  margin erosion and decreasing profits;  with galloping inflation in many key markets and looming recession across the globe  is driving rising labor and energy costs (among others) and  consequently  margin erosion and decreasing profits; Dynamics in the retail sector are changing with online shopping becoming more prevalent  consumer behavior shifting toward new preferences and ways of shopping (i.e. the acceleration of e-commerce and social commerce)  labor shortages  and decreasing in-store traffic. These market realities are leading retailers to examine and re-think their operating models to ensure their relevance to consumers  and to develop business models that can generate adequate operating margins and profits going forward. Digitizing the Retail Sector: Despite many headwinds  physical stores hold significant value-creating potential Against this backdrop  SES-imagotag's products and solutions are proving to be very effective tools in retailers' efforts to transform the current difficult operating environment into a more positive setting for their businesses  enabling them to drive operating efficiencies within their physical stores under new market realities  and creating value for themselves  their suppliers  and their customers. ESL adoption is accelerating on a long-term trajectory  as ESL technology increasingly becomes the backbone technology of in-store digitization. As the global ESL leader SES-imagotag has been driving transformative innovation in the ESL industry  advancing from technological shifts such as migrating ESLs to the cloud  to the current strategic focus on providing digital shelf systems  i.e. cloud-connected sets of integrated shelf devices (ESL  micro-cameras and sensors). Specifically  and as discussed in further detail in this strategic plan  SES-imagotag's Digital Shelf System enables stores to manage with greater precision  agility and insight: Price and promotions ;; Order fulfillment for local e-commerce;for local e-commerce; On-shelf availability  real-time shelf monitoring  inventory management data and planogram compliancereal-time shelf monitoring  inventory management data and planogram compliance In-store location of products  staff and shoppersof products  staff and shoppers Retail media  including digital interactions with consumers  customer insights and retail-CPG supplier interactionincluding digital interactions with consumers  customer insights and retail-CPG supplier interaction Personnel management. The efficiencies and insights created by these in-store digital solutions  among others  are estimated to enhance retailer and CPG company operating margins by several points -- estimated to be in the low to mid-single digits -- thus partially off-setting the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions on the operations and P&Ls of retailers. The Market Opportunity The size of the global addressable Electronic Shelf Label market is estimated by the company at around 10 billion units. To date  the estimated ESL installed base is around 700 million units  i.e. 7% penetration  of which SES-imagotag accounts for approximately 50%. Based on these numbers  the unmet potential demand for ESLs is over 9 billion units  pointing to an extremely large addressable market for SES-imagotag to expand its business in the coming years. By way of perspective  SES-imagotag currently has an installed base of around 350 million ESLs. ESLs are the backbone of physical retail digitization There is a larger  more disruptive and transformative opportunity that is being created via the growth of the ESL installed base. Electronic shelf labels enable a growing portfolio of very powerful software  services and non-ESL solutions (VAS) for digitizing physical stores. These solutions  in turn  enable physical stores to transform themselves into ultra-efficient  connected  increasingly automated  intelligent environments  enabling an omnichannel service model and a quality experience to consumers. VAS is expected to grow even faster than ESL installations over the next five years  underscoring a fast-growing and highly profitable growth vector for the company  and highlighting the company's strategic direction. Driving Sustainability in Physical Retail SES-imagotag's purpose is to invent IoT and digital technologies that create a positive impact on society by enabling sustainable and human-centered commerce. The company's shared value-creation model is structured on three pillars: Roadmap for Positive Retail  which aims to develop ultra-low carbon IoT devices; contribute to retail's Net-Zero target; and enable better and more sustainable stores  thus protecting jobs  consumers and communities; Be a Great Place to Work  fostering and promoting diversity and equality  long-term motivation  human capital development  overall well-being at work  and meaningful social dialogue; and Long-Term Stakeholder value  based on world-class governance standards  measurable long-term positive impact and stakeholder value  and transparency and quality of ESG reporting. Retail supply chains account for 25% of the world's GHG emissions according to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Within this context  SES-imagotag is in the process of building a Net-Zero contribution plan which aims to de-carbonize its own products and contribute to the de-carbonization of retail. To de-carbonize its products  the Company seeks to increasingly migrate the in-store technology it provides to be cloud-based and infraless  refurbish and recycle ESLs  and to eco-design lower carbon and battery-less ESLs through its Vusion-E program. To contribute to the de-carbonization of retail  SES-imagotag's solutions enable paperless stores  local e-commerce  reduction of food waste  and better information at the shelf influencing responsible consumption. In October 2022  SES-imagotag's sustainability efforts were recognized via a Platinum ranking from EcoVadis  the world's reference of business sustainability ratings  placing the Company in the top 1% of all companies evaluated on environmental factors  labor and human rights  sustainable procurement  and ethics. Also in 2022  SES-imagotag obtained the ISO 14001 certification  confirming that the Company's environmental management system complies with a series of requirements as outlined by that ISO standard. Moreover  SES-imagotag's solutions have an important role to play in promoting sustainability within the growth of e-commerce. Technology-enabled stores are efficient e-commerce assets  as they can carry out in-store fulfillment  ensure extra-fast pick-up and express delivery  and can handle returns and services. It is estimated that in the future  IoT-enabled stores could fulfill at least 50% of total e-commerce online sales. In providing an alternative to the direct-to-consumer logistics model under which e-commerce predominantly operates  technology-enabled stores could contribute to minimizing the need for many millions of square meters required by new e-commerce fulfillment centers  thus decreasing the consequent significant level of incremental CO 2 emissions that these new fulfillment facilities would generate. SES-imagotag's ESG strategy and priorities are overseen by an International Advisory Board  comprised of six global leaders with vast and high-level experience in the CPG  technology and public sectors  and by the ESG  Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors. TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS Core Expertise and Capabilities: Leveraging proprietary technological innovation; Making the Physical Store a Digital Asset To develop its innovative retail digitization solutions  SES-imagotag's R&D is carried out in seven excellence centers located in Europe (France  Austria  Germany  Ireland  and Croatia)  Asia (Taiwan) and the United States (Chicago).

Through cameras and sensors  Captana transforms pictures into structured data by processing image data obtained at the store shelf in the Captana Cloud using artificial intelligence  machine learning and computer vision. It is differentiated from competing solutions through its ESL and sensor synchronization technology that drives higher accuracy and easier implementation by leveraging the ESL infrastructure. Captana addresses at-shelf issues such as out-of-stocks  which are estimated to cost retailers up to 8% in annual revenues. It also aggregates  processes and analyzes data produced in stores  but that are not used to their fullest potential for the benefit of category management  store operations  e-commerce and online shopping  marketing and supply chain optimization. Captana enables in-store optimization at the shelf  with the following positive impacts to a store's operating margin  as well as benefits for CPG brands: In-store labor automation;Increase in on-shelf availability;Improved inventory accuracy;Back-office automation;Customer experience. Engage: The Next Big Digital Media is the Physical Store The objective of Engage is to ensure that retailers are leveraging the full potential of the foot traffic in their stores. The concept is to create a new digital touchpoint at the shelf by: Running dynamic digital campaigns   with digital content delivered at the shelf;  with digital content delivered at the shelf; Enabling shopper interactions by providing the ability to engage digitally with shoppers at the moment of purchase;by providing the ability to engage digitally with shoppers at the moment of purchase; Measuring the impact of promotional campaigns in real-time  and obtaining insights into consumer behavior; andand into consumer behavior; and Generating an additional revenue stream by leveraging in-store media ad spend and monetizing in-store foot traffic. The insights generated by the Engage platform enable CPG companies to communicate with their consumers digitally via ads at a prime location: the store shelf. This in turn creates a new revenue stream for retailers. The technology developed by SES-imagotag  and the solutions enabled by this technology  provide the tools that stores require to become tech-enabled digital assets. SES-imagotag's growth plan for the next five years is built on the accelerating adoption of these technologies by the world's largest retailers. VUSION ‘27: GLOBAL GROWTH AND NEW FRONTIERS Transformation Plan SES-imagotag's new strategic plan  VUSION ‘27  is underpinned by a transformation plan  comprised of the following objectives to be met by year-end 2027: Growth and Leadership: SES-imagotag aims to retain and expand its position as the Global No. 1 cloud IoT company for retail and industry. The top-line objective is to reach 1 billion connected IoT devices  and revenue of €2.2 bn (for an estimated CAGR of 30%)  with 40% of sales generated in the United States;SES-imagotag aims to retain and expand its position as the Global No. 1 cloud IoT company for retail and industry.

Global Footprint Expansion: Strategy & Roadmap At present  SES-imagotag's products and services are sold to over 60 countries across the globe through 19 regional hubs  with a concentration in Western Europe and North America. Until recently  the Company's business and growth had been concentrated in Europe which  in 2022  still represents around 75% of total revenues. However  over the past few years this growth profile has begun to shift  with the United States becoming a market that strongly contributes to growth. This trend is expected to continue over the next five years. Growth by Region Europe: Elevating our historic market SES-imagotag's Europe region  which operates through 12 offices and branches with 180 employees  currently accounts for 75% of the company's total revenue. Top-line is expected to more than double to €1.1bn by year-end 2027. This region comprises the company's most mature markets  with high levels of penetration in France  southern Europe  Benelux and Scandinavia. Markets such as Germany and the UK present significant opportunity for future growth as ESL and digital adoption are set to catch-up rapidly. In the region's more highly-penetrated markets  growth is expected to be partially driven by further deploying the large existing customer base and upgrading the installed store base increasingly to the Cloud platform and VAS solutions. The Vusion ‘27 plan envisions converting upward of 25 000 existing stores to Cloud-based solutions. The ongoing development of new verticals will drive further growth. This includes new retail segments such as hard discount  home furnishing  travel retail  health and beauty  sporting goods  fashion  DIY  convenience stores  and gas stations  as well as new customers in manufacturing  automotive  logistics  office signage and healthcare. North America: Scaling up in the world's largest retail market SES-imagotag's North American region operates through 4 offices (Chicago  Dallas  Montreal and Mexico City)  and 50 employees (expected to reach 100 by year-end 2023). All 4 000 stores across the region use the VUSION cloud platform and some of the Company's VAS solutions. Revenues already total over €100m in 2022. The total addressable market in North America is estimated to be more than 3 bn ESLs with much lower penetration than Europe. SES-imagotag's growth ambitions in the region are based on an assumption of rapid adoption catch-up  fueled by increasing price and promotional velocity  the shift to in-store fulfillment of online orders and the accelerating need for shelf automation. SES-imagotag North America's top-line is expected to increase ten-fold to a range of €0.9 to €1bn over the next five years. Rest of World In the Rest of World  SES-imagotag will continue to develop its presence in selected markets through its existing regional hubs and strategic partners network in Asia  South America and Middle East/Africa. The expected average growth in these markets is around 25% per annum throughout the period  leading to a top line of approximately €200m. These markets will become a significant growth reservoir in the longer term.

This growth will be driven by significant market penetration acceleration in the United States  the migration of existing ESL customers in Europe toward cloud-based solutions  the penetration of new markets in the Rest of World  and the development of new retail sectors and other verticals. VAS is expected to represent 30% of revenue at year-end 2027  up from 16% in 2022. Drivers of Profitability growth EBITDA in 2027 is expected to reach €480m  with EBITDA margin expanding from approximately 10% in 2022  to an anticipated 22% in 2027. The drivers of this significant profitability improvement are assumed to be a widening of gross margin  resulting from the growth of VAS (which generates a higher gross margin than ESLs) in the revenue mix  and a gradual improvement in operating leverage. Financial structure Over the next five years  SES-imagotag's potential financing requirements will be primarily met through debt. The maximum leverage the company expects to reach is a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0x. In the event that SES-imagotag takes on new debt  it could progressively shift from bullet to amortizable debt  and from European borrowing to more debt taken on in the United States. The Company is also targeting a first dividend in 2024 (based on 2023 results).

12955,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555522-air-liquide-aiquf-dividend-growth-monster-hiding-in-plain-sight,Air Liquide: A Dividend Growth Monster Hiding In Plain Sight (OTCMKTS:AIQUF),Air Liquide is a large French industrial gases producer and has been somewhat of a secret compounder over the years. Read what investors need to know.,"JL Images/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAir Liquide (OTCPK:AIQUF  OTCPK:AIQUY) is a French industrial gas giant active around the world. After its German peer Linde (LIN)  they are the second-largest supplier of industrial gases of the world  measured by revenue. Examples of their products are industrial gases which are supplied to companies active in the petrochemical industry  hydrogen  and healthcare gases such as oxygen and nitrous oxide which are used for treating patients. The nature of its operations makes the industrial gas segment a very capital-intensive business  and economies of scale can be very powerful in these types of industries. This gives Air Liquide an impressive moat.In this article  I will focus on the possession of Air Liquide for long-term investors  which can be quite untransparent and difficult to assess when only looking at graphs. One has to take into account their many free share attributions. Also  I will talk about what makes the company such a solid pick for buy-and-hold investors. Full disclosure: I have owned Air Liquide shares since 5 years  and I am planning on holding them.""Air Solide""I am situated in the Netherlands myself. One of the arguments of US or other non-EU investors against owning shares of European companies is that governments can sometimes have a large stake in companies. For Air Liquide  this is not the case  their largest investors are pension funds and money management firms. In fact  Air Liquide has the largest share of capital owned by individual shareholders of all firms in the CAC 40 (CAC:IND): about 33% of its market capitalization.The company also has an active policy of rewarding their long-term shareholders: They give a loyalty bonus of 10% on dividends and free share attributions (the latter of which is in fact a stock dividend). You do have to become a registered shareholder to be eligible for this bonus. As another illustration of their dedication to a long-term view: Air Liquide has only had 6 different CEOs since 1902. This focus on the long term combined with a solid performance in the past has led to some investors dubbing the company ""Air Solide"".Performance and DividendsLet us take a look at the past performance of the company's shares now to see if this stable-looking enterprise is also performing accordingly.Data by YChartsGraph 1: Air Liquide share price and profit/earnings ratio over the yearsIn the first graph  you can see the price development of Air Liquide shares over the last ~13 years. I took the AIQUF shares here  since they translate 1:1 to the European shares traded on Euronext (note: AIQUY corresponds to 1/5 of the regular shares).When looking at the price graph of Air Liquide shares  it can be noted that the company performed in a relatively stable way but that there was likely no extraordinary outperformance compared with major indices  if any. Also  recently  the company's shares have experienced a correction more or less in line with worldwide markets.Of course  dividends are not accounted for in the price graph. But there is another important factor which has not been included: the loyalty bonus which Air Liquide awards to shareholders which have held their shares for more than 2 full calendar years. Every time Air Liquide pays out its dividend  long-term shareholders receive 10% extra. Of course  investors need to pay dividend tax  so the benefit in the end will be a bit less.Air Liquide's aims to pay out 55% of its net profit in dividend  which makes their past payouts look like this:Air Liquide annual dividend Amount 2022 €2.90 2021 €2.75 2020 €2.70 2019 €2.65 2018 €2.65 2017 €2.60 2016 €2.60 2015 €2.55 2014 €2.55 2013 €2.50 2012 €2.13 2011 €1.91 2010 €1.91 2009 €1.73 Click to enlargeTable 1: Last annual dividends paid out by Air Liquide (source: Air Liquide)Free SharesFor loyal shareholders  not only the dividend will be increased by 10%  also the free share attributions are increased by the same percentage. In addition to its annual dividend  Air Liquide somewhat irregularly awards free shares to its shareholders. To partially counter the dilution effect of these free share giveaways  the company put into work multiple share buyback programs. These free shares should be viewed as nothing less than a stock dividend  which does not directly change the value of an individual shareholder's investment. This is because the total number of shares of Air Liquide gets diluted by the same percentage as the free share allocation. But shareholders who receive the 10% extra bonus do gain something  since not all shareholders receive this extra 10%  and thus are fractionally better off after such a free share attribution.Air Liquide gave away free shares in the following years (1:10 means that 1 free share was given for every 10 shares owned  fractional shares when shareholders owned a number which was not dividable by 10 were paid out in cash):Air Liquide free shares 2022 2019 2017 2014 2012 2010 Attribution 1:10 1:10 1:10 1:10 1:10 1:15 Click to enlargeTable 2: Free shares provided by Air Liquide (source: website Air Liquide)Air Liquide awarded 9 free share attributions in the last 20 years. As I mentioned before  these free share attributions do not directly increase performance of investors' holdings. But these free share allocations do have a very large influence on the amount of dividends paid over the longer term. Let us make a calculation using the dividend of 2009 as a baseline and include dividend payments and free share allocations.Annual dividend Free shares Corrected dividend with 10% bonus for dividend + free shares 2009 €1.73 €1.90 2010 €1.91 1:15 €2.10 2011 €1.91 €2.26 2012 €2.13 1:10 €2.51 2013 €2.50 €3.28 2014 €2.55 1:10 €3.34 2015 €2.55 €3.71 2016 €2.60 €3.78 2017 €2.60 1:10 €3.78 2018 €2.65 €4.28 2019 €2.65 1:10 €4.28 2020 €2.70 €4.84 2021 €2.75 €4.93 2022 €2.90 1:10 €5.20 Click to enlargeTable 3: Annual dividends corrected for bonus and free shares (source: calculations by author)Note that  in this table  I am assuming that all the free share attributions happened after the payment of the annual dividend in the given years  of which I am not sure whether this was always the case.We can conclude from this table that when you include the free share allocations and the 10% bonus in the dividend of Air Liquide  the dividend development looks a whole lot rosier than when leaving this out. At first glance  the 'normal' dividend numbers of Air Liquide look like a company which increases its dividend bit by bit  but nothing impressive. The corrected numbers reveal that Air Liquide has been an impressive dividend growth investment for long-term investors.On paper  Air Liquide increased its dividend by 68% from 2009 to 2022  which is an average annual increase of 4.1%. Not bad  but nothing impressive. When we include our calculated corrected dividends  we end up at a total dividend increase of 174% between 2009 and 2022  or an annual rate of 8.1%. These percentages are so different because of the large influence of the free share attributions.ValuationA quality stock like Air Liquide is rarely cheap  and if we look at the metrics  it does not appear to be cheap today either:Data by YChartsGraph 2: Air Liquide PE ratio  earnings per share and price to free cash flow ratios over the yearsOn a price to free cash flow basis  the shares do appear to be fairly valued  but when looking at the PE ratio  shares seem historically a bit overvalued at a ratio of 24.06. Around 2010 or 2019 was probably the best time to buy Air Liquide shares  but even then  their PE ratio was around 18  which is relatively high.ConclusionAir Liquide looks like a very solid holding for buy-and-hold investors. In this article  we took a look at the share price development of the stock in combination with its annual dividend and free share attribution policy. At first glance  Air Liquide looks like a bit of a lackluster performer dividend-wise. But when accounted for their free share attributions in combination with their growing dividend  the company looks like a very solid dividend growth machine for long-term investors. This is more or less hidden in plain sight.I have owned Air Liquide shares since 5 years and will continue to do so for as long as I'm able. Their current valuation is rich  so I would consider the stock a 'hold' at current prices. But quality stocks like these are rarely cheap  so long-term investors should not be deterred by the slightly higher-than-historic valuation.Thank you for reading!

The partnership between Tizeti and Eutelsat will provide a complementary solution that leverages satellite broadband infrastructure and Tizeti’s community Wi-FI management platform to deliver a fast and affordable public wi-fi hotspot service  especially in remote areas that are difficult to reach by terrestrial broadband infrastructure.Philippe Baudrier  Eutelsat’s General Manager – Connectivity for Africa said “Eutelsat’s ambition is to connect one million unserved people across sub-Saharan Africa to high-speed internet over the next 5 years and this partnership with Tizeti will help bridge Nigeria’s digital divide and unlock the wealth of social and economic opportunities that the internet brings”.Speaking on the partnership  Tizeti’s Chief Executive Officer of Tizeti  Kendall Ananyi  said that satellite broadband will complement Tizeti’s existing initiatives and lay a foundation for a robust and thriving digital ecosystem across Nigeria. “Our partnership with Eutelsat extends our mission of bringing affordable and reliable internet to more Nigerians and provides us with the opportunity to accelerate the expansion of broadband internet via satellite  to bridge the digital gap and improve digital transformation for more Nigerians”  Ananyi said.Konnect’s Community Wi-Fi (Konnect Wi-Fi) initiative has already seen considerable success across Africa with hundreds of sites providing internet access to tens of thousands of people every week.For many countries in Africa  there is still a huge digital divide. This boundary between connected and unconnected translates into clear consequences for employment  education  family and social life  and access to information. Partnerships such as this play a significant role in addressing the digital infrastructure deficits in emerging economies  leveraging innovative technology and capabilities  to improve development outcomes for millions of people.About KonnectKonnect is the Eutelsat Group entity in charge of retail marketing for a new generation of superfast satellite broadband services.
