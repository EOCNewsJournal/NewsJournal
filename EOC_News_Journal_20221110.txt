Our organic revenue growth outside China for Q3 2022 was +15.5%.Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) grew significantly at +25.5% in Q3 2022  +18.5% on an organic basis  to reach €241.9 million  i.e. 29.9% of Group revenue vs 27.3% in Q3 2021. The DOOH programmatic ecosystem continued to gain traction as our programmatic advertising revenue through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform) more than doubled vs the same period last year  with the dynamism of the 37 DSPs (demand-side platforms) connected to VIOOH (the most connected SSP of the OOH media industry)  including Displayce following our strategic alliance announced in July.By activity  Street Furniture grew by +8.3% organically in Q3 2022 and was above Q3 2019 levels globally  driven by Europe (including France and United Kingdom) and by a strong rebound in Asia-Pacific; Billboard revenue increased significantly as well at +9.0% organically in Q3 2022 driven by Asia-Pacific and especially Australia which was already above 2019 like North America; Transport grew strongly at +10.2% reflecting the continued recovery of air travel in most regions of the world  including Rest of the World which was already above 2019 revenue levels  but remained meaningfully impacted by ongoing mobility restrictions in China.All geographies grew positively organically in Q3 2022 except Asia-Pacific which was flat compared to Q3 2021. Asia-Pacific excluding China grew strongly by +52.3%. The rebound was especially strong in North America and in Rest of the World in line with the strong recovery of air traffic in these geographies.As far as Q4 is concerned  we continue to have a solid trading momentum and despite ongoing mobility restrictions in China  we expect an organic revenue growth at around +3.0% vs Q4 2021.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognized ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound.

On an organic basis (i.e. excluding the positive impact from foreign exchange variations  and the limited impact from changes in perimeter this quarter)  adjusted revenue increased by +9.0%. Adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture and advertising displays  increased by +10.2% on an organic basis in the third quarter of 2022.Q3 adjusted revenue 2022 (€m) 2021 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 412.5 369.2 +11.7% +8.3% Transport 277.7 231.8 +19.8% +10.2% Billboard 118.1 105.5 +12.0% +9.0% Total 808.4 706.5 +14.4% +9.0%(a) Excluding acquisitions/divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange9-month adjusted revenue 2022 (€m) 2021 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 1 201.9 930.8 +29.1% +26.0% Transport 736.8 570.2 +29.2% +20.3% Billboard 344.5 287.9 +19.7% +17.2% Total 2 283.2 1 788.8 +27.6% +22.8%(a) Excluding acquisitions/divestitures and the impact of foreign exchangePlease note that the geographic comments hereafter refer to organic revenue growth.STREET FURNITUREThird quarter adjusted revenue increased by +11.7% to €412.5 million (+8.3% on an organic basis)  France  UK and Rest of Europe were above 2019 revenue levels with a strong trading momentum over the whole period. Asia-Pacific  North America and Rest of the World recorded double-digit organic growth rates vs Q3 2021.Third quarter adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture were up +9.5% on an organic basis compared to the third quarter of 2021.TRANSPORTThird quarter adjusted revenue increased by +19.8% to €277.7 million  +10.2% on an organic basis reflecting the strong return of air travel  notably in the US and in the Middle-East  and the rebound of commuter traffic in public transport. While some countries were already above Q3 2019 revenue levels  Transport remained meaningfully impacted by ongoing mobility restrictions in China.BILLBOARDThird quarter adjusted revenue increased by +12.0% to €118.1 million  +9.0% on an organic basis. Asia-Pacific grew the most followed by Rest of the World.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method. However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€60.9 million (-€59.4 million in Q3 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €747.5 million (€647.1 million in Q3 2021).For the first nine months of 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€167.8 million(-€147.4 million for the first nine months of 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 115.4 million (€1 641.5 million for the first nine months of 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 Q3 9M 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 1 082.3 706.5 1 788.8 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 1 367.8 747.5 2 115.4 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 106.9 60.9 167.8 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 808.4 2 283.2 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -49.2 -37.8 -87.0 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 770.6 2 196.2 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.4 -0.4 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 770.2 2 195.8 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +45.7% +21.6% +31.7% +9.0% +22.8%€m Impact of currencyas of September 30th  2022 USD -19.4 CNY -17.5 HKD -8.6 BRL -7.8 Others -33.7 Total -87.0Average exchange rate 9M 2022 9M 2021 USD 0.9400 0.8360 CNY 0.1425 0.1292 HKD 0.1200 0.1076 BRL 0.1830 0.1568Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

The safety profile of Onivyde in the NAPOLI 3 trial was consistent with those observed in the previous phase I/II mPDAC study.Ipsen intends to file a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Onivyde in combination with oxaliplatin plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mPDAC following the Fast Track Designation granted in 2020. The clinical trial results will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.“ The positive results from the NAPOLI 3 trial demonstrate that compared with the standard-of-care  the investigational Onivyde treatment regimen extended the lives of people living with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who were previously untreated ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “ The prognosis for people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is extremely poor and we plan to submit these new findings to the regulatory authority as  if approved  we believe this regimen could offer up an important new treatment option for people living with an aggressive and hard-to-treat cancer. We thank the patients who participated in the study  their families and their healthcare teams.”PDAC is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas with approximately 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.1 2 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).3 Even in later stages  weight loss  abdominal pain and jaundice are the most common symptoms making PDAC difficult to detect.4 Currently  fewer than 20 percent of people diagnosed with PDAC survive longer than one year and overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.1 2Phase III NAPOLI 3 StudyNAPOLI 3 is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Onivyde plus oxaliplatin and 5 FU/LV was administered twice in a month (days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycle) compared to an injection of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine administered three times a month (days 1  8  15 of a 28 day cycle). Approximately 770 patients were enrolled in the trial with the primary outcome measure of overall survival. Secondary outcome measures included progression-free survival  objective response rate  quality of life assessment  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events  serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. Adverse events and laboratory analyses were also analyzed.Onviyde® (irinotecan liposome injection)Onivyde is a long-circulating  liposomal topoisomerase inhibitor designed to interrupt DNA replication in cancer cells. Onivyde enters cancer cells using a naturally occurring process (enhanced permeability and retention or EPR effect) and as macrophages unpack the liposomes  Onivyde is activated facilitating the release of the cytotoxic payload into the tumor  including irinotecan and its conversion into SN-38  its active metabolite. Ipsen has exclusive commercialization rights for the current and potential future indications for Onivyde in the U.S. Servier  an independent international pharmaceutical company with a strong international presence in 150 countries  is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde outside of the U.S. and Taiwan. PharmaEngine is a commercial stage oncology company headquartered in Taipei and is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde in Taiwan.Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  Europe and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNINGS: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA and SEVERE DIARRHEAFatal neutropenic sepsis occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving Onivyde. Severe or life-threatening neutropenic fever or sepsis occurred in 3% and severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU and LV. Withhold Onivyde for absolute neutrophil count below 1500/mm3 or neutropenic fever. Monitor blood cell counts periodically during treatment.Severe diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU/LV. Do not administer Onivyde to patients with bowel obstruction. Withhold Onivyde for diarrhea of Grade 2–4 severity. Administer loperamide for late diarrhea of any severity. Administer atropine  if not contraindicated  for early diarrhea of any severity.CONTRAINDICATIONOnivyde is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction to Onivyde or irinotecan hydrochloride.Warnings and precautionsSevere neutropenia: see boxed WARNING.

For more information  visit ipsen.com.Ipsen’s Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q3 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€60.9 million (-€59.4 million in Q3 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €747.5 million (€647.1 million in Q3 2021).For the first nine months of 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€167.8 million(-€147.4 million for the first nine months of 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €2 115.4 million (€1 641.5 million for the first nine months of 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 Q3 9M 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 1 082.3 706.5 1 788.8 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 1 367.8 747.5 2 115.4 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 106.9 60.9 167.8 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 808.4 2 283.2 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -49.2 -37.8 -87.0 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 770.6 2 196.2 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.4 -0.4 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 770.2 2 195.8 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +45.7% +21.6% +31.7% +9.0% +22.8%€m Impact of currencyas of September 30th  2022 USD -19.4 CNY -17.5 HKD -8.6 BRL -7.8 Others -33.7 Total -87.0Average exchange rate 9M 2022 9M 2021 USD 0.9400 0.8360 CNY 0.1425 0.1292 HKD 0.1200 0.1076 BRL 0.1830 0.1568Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

12943,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/09/renault-is-betting-the-market-for-gasoline-cars-will-continue-to-grow.html,Autos giant Renault is betting the market for gasoline cars will continue to grow,Thierry Pieton's comments came during an interview with CNBC in Paris.,"In this article STLASTLA-ITRNO-FR Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTwatch nowRenault sees the internal combustion engine continuing to play a crucial role in its business over the coming years  according to a top executive at the French automotive giant. On Tuesday  it was announced that the Renault Group and Chinese firm Geely had signed a non-binding framework agreement to establish a company focused on the development  production and supply of ""hybrid powertrains and highly efficient ICE [internal combustion engine] powertrains."" According to Renault  both itself and Geely will have a 50% stake in the business  which will consist of 17 powertrain facilities and five research and development centers. Speaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed on Tuesday  Renault Chief Financial Officer Thierry Pieton sought to explain some of the reasoning behind the planned partnership with Geely. ""In our view  and according to all the studies that we've got  there is no scenario where ICE and hybrid engines represent less than 40% of the market with a horizon of 2040 "" he said. ""So it's actually … a market that's going to continue to grow.""The tie-up with Geely comes as Renault fleshes out plans to establish an EV spin-off called Ampere. According to Renault  France-based Ampere ""will develop  manufacture  and sell full EV passenger cars."" It's eyeing an initial public offering on the Euronext Paris  which would take place in the second half of 2023 at the earliest  subject to market conditions. During his interview with CNBC  Pieton touched upon the need  as he saw it  for different types of vehicles. ""It's very important to have  at the same time  the development of our electric vehicle business on one side — with Ampere — and to build a sustainable source of ICE and hybrid powertrains."" This was why Renault was going into a partnership with Geely  he added  explaining the move represented ""an absolute slam dunk"" from a business and financial perspective. This was because  Pieton argued  it created ""a world-leading supplier of ICE and hybrid powertrains with around 19 000 employees in the world  covering 130 countries.""In comments sent to CNBC via email  David Leggett  an analyst at GlobalData  noted that automotive manufacturers could still enjoy profits from the sale of vehicles that used internal combustion engines. ""Margins are generally higher than on electric vehicles  which are relatively costly to manufacture "" he said. ""The gap will eventually narrow as EV volumes rise sharply and unit costs on major EV components fall significantly  but there is still much profitable business to be done on ICEs and hybrids and will be for some time to come "" he added. ""Manufacturers need to be flexible in their powertrain offerings according to market needs — which differ across the world."" Renault's continued focus on the internal combustion engine comes at a time when some big economies are looking to move away from vehicles that use fossil fuels. The U.K.  for example  wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require  from 2035  all new cars and vans to have zero tailpipe emissions.

The two companies announced during the sidelines of the AfricaCom 2022 trade fair that they will deploy Eutelsat’s KA-band satellite connectivity  Konnect  to reach remote communities throughout Nigeria and provide fast  and affordable internet services.Despite 44.5 percent broadband penetration  covered largely by Mobile Network Operators  reliable internet connectivity is still limited to a few states. The partnership between Tizeti and Eutelsat will provide a complementary solution that leverages satellite broadband infrastructure and Tizeti’s community Wi-FI management platform to deliver a fast and affordable public wi-fi hotspot service  especially in remote areas that are difficult to reach by terrestrial broadband infrastructure.Philippe Baudrier  Eutelsat's General Manager - Connectivity for Africa said ""Eutelsat's ambition is to connect one million unserved people across sub-Saharan Africa to high-speed internet over the next 5 years and this partnership with Tizeti will help bridge Nigeria's digital divide and unlock the wealth of social and economic opportunities that the internet brings"".Speaking on the partnership  Tizeti’s Chief Executive Officer of Tizeti  Kendall Ananyi  said that satellite broadband will complement Tizeti’s existing initiatives and lay a foundation for a robust and thriving digital ecosystem across Nigeria. “Our partnership with Eutelsat extends our mission of bringing affordable and reliable internet to more Nigerians and provides us with the opportunity to accelerate the expansion of broadband internet via satellite  to bridge the digital gap and improve digital transformation for more Nigerians”  Ananyi said.Konnect's Community Wi-Fi (Konnect Wi-Fi) initiative has already seen considerable success across Africa with hundreds of sites providing internet access to tens of thousands of people every week.For many countries in Africa  there is still a huge digital divide. This boundary between connected and unconnected translates into clear consequences for employment  education  family and social life  and access to information. Partnerships such as this play a significant role in addressing the digital infrastructure deficits in emerging economies  leveraging innovative technology and capabilities  to improve development outcomes for millions of people.About KonnectKonnect is the Eutelsat Group entity in charge of retail marketing for a new generation of superfast satellite broadband services.

I am particularly pleased with the support of the hundreds of individual shareholders who were able to participate via the PrimaryBid platform. This fundraising will offer our portfolio of four active substances in the advanced development phase a chance of success  thanks to future international partnerships  which will be added to the one already signed with Nestlé Health Science for TOTUM•63  and direct marketing in France of our three other products  TOTUM•070  TOTUM•854 and TOTUM•448. A new strategy that opens up prospects for the Company’s rapid growth in turnover.“Allocation of fundsAs previously announced  proceeds from the offering will be used to fund:- at 60%  the Company's structuring to support future global or regional (except France) licensing and/or distribution partnerships for the other TOTUM products in the pipeline (TOTUM•070 – LDL hypercholesterolemia; TOTUM•448 – NAFL/NASH; TOTUM•854 – raised blood pressure) and to support the licensing and supply agreements already signed for TOTUM•63 (prediabetes). It should be recalled that TOTUM•63 (prediabetes) is licensed at Nestlé Health Science  and the results of the Phase II/III REVERSE-IT pivot study are now expected in the first half of 2023 (as announced by the Company on 15 September 2022). From a regulatory point of view  TOTUM•63 is already marketable in Europe  after notification to the DGCCRF in France (mutual recognition applicable for other European Union countries). The results of REVERSE-IT are ultimately intended to enable a health claim to be made. Valbiotis' goal is to finalize the signature of an international licensing and/or distribution agreement by the second half of 2023 for TOTUM•070;- at 40%  the implementation of resources dedicated to the direct marketing of TOTUM products in France (excluding TOTUM•63) in accordance with the strategy communicated on October 7 (press release of October 7  2022). The marketing strategy will be based on in-house medical sales representatives (APMs) whose main target audience will be key prescribers  i.e.  general practitioners  certain specialists and pharmacists. The latter will recommend the TOTUM products based on their patients' cardiometabolic profile. At the same time  consumers/patients will be targeted directly through an adapted digital marketing strategy. The distribution channels envisaged will be pharmacies  drugstores and online sales. The funds raised will contribute to:the recruitment of a dedicated sales team;the structuring of online sales and product marketing  and;expenses related to the launch of direct sales (notably inventory building).As indicated in the press release published on October 7  2022  TOTUM•070  whose Phase II clinical study was highly successful  will be the first product marketed by Valbiotis in France even before a health claim. It is scheduled to be launched in the first half of 2024  followed by TOTUM•448 and TOTUM•854 in 2024-2025.Before the completion of the Global Offering  the Company’s cash horizon was in the last quarter of 2023. Given the current cash level  the net product of this Global Offering and the milestones expected during 2023 as part of the overall partnership with Nestlé Health Science on TOTUM•63 and in the second half of 2023 with the signing of a partnership on TOTUM•070  the Company extends its cash horizon to the end of the first half of 2024.

Pieton explains the reason behind the move to focus on the internal combustion engine. Renault's focus comes at a time when some big economies are looking to move away from vehicles that use fossil fuels.Renault sees the internal combustion engine continuing to play a crucial role in its business over the coming years. Renault Group and Chinese firm Geely have signed a non-binding framework agreement to establish a company focused on the development  production and supply of ""hybrid powertrains and highly efficient ICE [internal combustion engine] power trains""Renault and Geely will have a 50% stake in the business  which will consist of 17 powertrain facilities and five research and development centers. ""In our view  and according to all of the studies that we've got  there is no scenario where ICE and hybrid engines represent less than 40% of the market with a horizon of 2040 "" says Thierry Pieton.Renault and Geely are working on an EV spin-off called Ampere. The company is eyeing an initial public offering on the Euronext Paris in 2023. Geely CEO Pieton: ""It's very important to have  at the same time  the development of our electric vehicle business""Pieton said the move represented ""an absolute slam dunk"" from a business and financial perspective. This was because  Pieton argued  it created ""a world-leading supplier of ICE and hybrid powertrains with around 19 000 employees in the world  covering 130 countries""",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,negative,0.01,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['Autos giant Renault', 'gasoline cars', 'market', 'internal combustion engine] power trains', 'Renault CFO Thierry Pieton', 'binding framework agreement', 'initial public offering', 'absolute slam dunk', 'Autos giant Renault', 'electric vehicle business', 'Geely CEO Pieton', 'gasoline cars', 'big economies', 'fossil fuels', 'crucial role', 'coming years', 'hybrid powertrains', '17 powertrain facilities', 'five research', 'hybrid engines', 'EV spin-off', 'Euronext Paris', 'financial perspective', 'world-leading supplier', 'Renault Group', 'Chinese firm', 'same time', 'efficient ICE', 'development centers', 'market', 'gasoline-cars', 'grow', 'CNBC', 'partnership', 'reason', 'move', 'focus', 'vehicles', 'company', 'production', 'supply', '50% stake', 'view', 'studies', 'scenario', 'less', 'horizon', '19,000 employees', '130 countries']",2022-11-09,2022-11-10,biztoc.com

The new plan builds on the accomplishments and results of the plan currently in place  VUSION ‘23.

Despite the many difficulties and the climate change challenge the world currently faces  we are confident in the ability of global retail to accelerate its transformation  and we believe in the role it can play as a provider of solutions for some of these issues. We are equally confident in SES-imagotag's ability to continue to play a leading role in the development of transformative solutions for the retail sector. This year  SES-imagotag celebrates its 30th anniversary. For thirty years  our overriding purpose has been the digitization of physical retail based on solutions  the technology provided by the Internet of Things  the Cloud  data  and artificial intelligence  that transform stores into ultra-efficient  connected  more automated and more intelligent environments  enabling an omnichannel service model and a quality experience to consumers who are becoming increasingly demanding of a seamless omnichannel retail offering. Physical retail has been under significant economic pressure for several years: eroding operating margins – driven by higher real estate expense  increasing labor costs  and growing competition from digital channels – are leading to shrinking profits. The resurgence of strong inflationary headwinds increases this pressure at every level of the cost structure  decreasing profit potential across the physical retail sector. Against this complex backdrop  visionary retailers succeed in betting on the omnichannel model and the revitalization of their physical points of sale  enabling – in particular – local e-commerce that is very fast and efficient  and also low in carbon emissions. Our conviction is that  in the years to come  technology will drive the acceleration of the evolution toward “phygital” retail: local  fast  efficient  convenient  offering local jobs of higher quality  and respectful of the environment  of urban centers and of consumers. And this is the magnificent purpose of SES-imagotag  the uncontested global leader driving the digital transformation of retail  whose growth and development are accelerating as a result of a growing demand and an incomparable capacity for innovation. SES-imagotag is a technology company whose usefulness and “raison d'être” become clearer by the day for all of our associates. Our ambition of strong profitable growth is based on the pillars built over the course of the past years: a global presence  a technological platform  high value-added solutions  a robust business model  a resilient supply chain  and a like-minded and motivated entrepreneurial management. Today  SES-imagotag is recognized as the reference company in Retail IoT. The unmet need remains immense in Europe  and the huge potential market in North America is beckoning to us. 2023 is shaping up to be a watershed year in terms of innovation launches. We thus foresee significant work ahead  in the service of a common good: the modernization of retail. We also anticipate compelling value creation for our clients  our associates  and our shareholders  who are growing in numbers and in international representation.” MARKET AND STRATEGY VUSION ‘27 Backdrop and Context: Physical Retail under Pressure The context within which SES-imagotag currently operates  and in which the VUSION ‘27 plan has been developed  is a physical retail industry that faces significant and model-shifting pressure from several directions: The current macroeconomic backdrop   with galloping inflation in many key markets and looming recession across the globe  is driving rising labor and energy costs (among others) and  consequently  margin erosion and decreasing profits;  with galloping inflation in many key markets and looming recession across the globe  is driving rising labor and energy costs (among others) and  consequently  margin erosion and decreasing profits; Dynamics in the retail sector are changing with online shopping becoming more prevalent  consumer behavior shifting toward new preferences and ways of shopping (i.e. the acceleration of e-commerce and social commerce)  labor shortages  and decreasing in-store traffic. These market realities are leading retailers to examine and re-think their operating models to ensure their relevance to consumers  and to develop business models that can generate adequate operating margins and profits going forward. Digitizing the Retail Sector: Despite many headwinds  physical stores hold significant value-creating potential Against this backdrop  SES-imagotag's products and solutions are proving to be very effective tools in retailers' efforts to transform the current difficult operating environment into a more positive setting for their businesses  enabling them to drive operating efficiencies within their physical stores under new market realities  and creating value for themselves  their suppliers  and their customers. ESL adoption is accelerating on a long-term trajectory  as ESL technology increasingly becomes the backbone technology of in-store digitization. As the global ESL leader SES-imagotag has been driving transformative innovation in the ESL industry  advancing from technological shifts such as migrating ESLs to the cloud  to the current strategic focus on providing digital shelf systems  i.e. cloud-connected sets of integrated shelf devices (ESL  micro-cameras and sensors). Specifically  and as discussed in further detail in this strategic plan  SES-imagotag's Digital Shelf System enables stores to manage with greater precision  agility and insight: Price and promotions ;; Order fulfillment for local e-commerce;for local e-commerce; On-shelf availability  real-time shelf monitoring  inventory management data and planogram compliancereal-time shelf monitoring  inventory management data and planogram compliance In-store location of products  staff and shoppersof products  staff and shoppers Retail media  including digital interactions with consumers  customer insights and retail-CPG supplier interactionincluding digital interactions with consumers  customer insights and retail-CPG supplier interaction Personnel management. The efficiencies and insights created by these in-store digital solutions  among others  are estimated to enhance retailer and CPG company operating margins by several points -- estimated to be in the low to mid-single digits -- thus partially off-setting the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions on the operations and P&Ls of retailers. The Market Opportunity The size of the global addressable Electronic Shelf Label market is estimated by the company at around 10 billion units. To date  the estimated ESL installed base is around 700 million units  i.e. 7% penetration  of which SES-imagotag accounts for approximately 50%. Based on these numbers  the unmet potential demand for ESLs is over 9 billion units  pointing to an extremely large addressable market for SES-imagotag to expand its business in the coming years. By way of perspective  SES-imagotag currently has an installed base of around 350 million ESLs. ESLs are the backbone of physical retail digitization There is a larger  more disruptive and transformative opportunity that is being created via the growth of the ESL installed base. Electronic shelf labels enable a growing portfolio of very powerful software  services and non-ESL solutions (VAS) for digitizing physical stores. These solutions  in turn  enable physical stores to transform themselves into ultra-efficient  connected  increasingly automated  intelligent environments  enabling an omnichannel service model and a quality experience to consumers. VAS is expected to grow even faster than ESL installations over the next five years  underscoring a fast-growing and highly profitable growth vector for the company  and highlighting the company's strategic direction. Driving Sustainability in Physical Retail SES-imagotag's purpose is to invent IoT and digital technologies that create a positive impact on society by enabling sustainable and human-centered commerce. The company's shared value-creation model is structured on three pillars: Roadmap for Positive Retail  which aims to develop ultra-low carbon IoT devices; contribute to retail's Net-Zero target; and enable better and more sustainable stores  thus protecting jobs  consumers and communities; Be a Great Place to Work  fostering and promoting diversity and equality  long-term motivation  human capital development  overall well-being at work  and meaningful social dialogue; and Long-Term Stakeholder value  based on world-class governance standards  measurable long-term positive impact and stakeholder value  and transparency and quality of ESG reporting. Retail supply chains account for 25% of the world's GHG emissions according to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Within this context  SES-imagotag is in the process of building a Net-Zero contribution plan which aims to de-carbonize its own products and contribute to the de-carbonization of retail. To de-carbonize its products  the Company seeks to increasingly migrate the in-store technology it provides to be cloud-based and infraless  refurbish and recycle ESLs  and to eco-design lower carbon and battery-less ESLs through its Vusion-E program. To contribute to the de-carbonization of retail  SES-imagotag's solutions enable paperless stores  local e-commerce  reduction of food waste  and better information at the shelf influencing responsible consumption. In October 2022  SES-imagotag's sustainability efforts were recognized via a Platinum ranking from EcoVadis  the world's reference of business sustainability ratings  placing the Company in the top 1% of all companies evaluated on environmental factors  labor and human rights  sustainable procurement  and ethics. Also in 2022  SES-imagotag obtained the ISO 14001 certification  confirming that the Company's environmental management system complies with a series of requirements as outlined by that ISO standard. Moreover  SES-imagotag's solutions have an important role to play in promoting sustainability within the growth of e-commerce. Technology-enabled stores are efficient e-commerce assets  as they can carry out in-store fulfillment  ensure extra-fast pick-up and express delivery  and can handle returns and services. It is estimated that in the future  IoT-enabled stores could fulfill at least 50% of total e-commerce online sales. In providing an alternative to the direct-to-consumer logistics model under which e-commerce predominantly operates  technology-enabled stores could contribute to minimizing the need for many millions of square meters required by new e-commerce fulfillment centers  thus decreasing the consequent significant level of incremental CO 2 emissions that these new fulfillment facilities would generate. SES-imagotag's ESG strategy and priorities are overseen by an International Advisory Board  comprised of six global leaders with vast and high-level experience in the CPG  technology and public sectors  and by the ESG  Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors. TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS Core Expertise and Capabilities: Leveraging proprietary technological innovation; Making the Physical Store a Digital Asset To develop its innovative retail digitization solutions  SES-imagotag's R&D is carried out in seven excellence centers located in Europe (France  Austria  Germany  Ireland  and Croatia)  Asia (Taiwan) and the United States (Chicago).

SES-imagotag has a high-value portfolio of strong IP assets  with more than 110 active patent families  and over 500 active patents. These technologies  competencies and innovations enable SES-imagotag's overriding objective: Making the Physical Store a Digital Asset. SES-imagotag's Products and Solutions: Leveraging cutting-edge technology to transform stores Based on the technology described above  SES-imagotag's business has evolved from the sale of proprietary electronic shelf label hardware  to the provision of a growing Cloud-based platform (with the aim to become largest IoT network in retail)  services and non-ESL solutions (abbreviated as VAS). In stores  VUSION drives the digitization of the physical retail sector by providing the following benefits: Pricing automationOptimized picking and replenishmentReal-time shelf monitoring and analyticsDigital advertisingIn-store search and flashIn-store mobile experience These are transforming traditional physical retail outlets into digital assets. Captana: Shelf Transparency Delivered The Captana solution is an essential component in the Digital Shelf System. Based on ultra-low power wireless micro-cameras and sensors powered by cloud and AI  Captana allows for permanent shelf-monitoring. Through cameras and sensors  Captana transforms pictures into structured data by processing image data obtained at the store shelf in the Captana Cloud using artificial intelligence  machine learning and computer vision. It is differentiated from competing solutions through its ESL and sensor synchronization technology that drives higher accuracy and easier implementation by leveraging the ESL infrastructure. Captana addresses at-shelf issues such as out-of-stocks  which are estimated to cost retailers up to 8% in annual revenues. It also aggregates  processes and analyzes data produced in stores  but that are not used to their fullest potential for the benefit of category management  store operations  e-commerce and online shopping  marketing and supply chain optimization. Captana enables in-store optimization at the shelf  with the following positive impacts to a store's operating margin  as well as benefits for CPG brands: In-store labor automation;Increase in on-shelf availability;Improved inventory accuracy;Back-office automation;Customer experience. Engage: The Next Big Digital Media is the Physical Store The objective of Engage is to ensure that retailers are leveraging the full potential of the foot traffic in their stores. The concept is to create a new digital touchpoint at the shelf by: Running dynamic digital campaigns   with digital content delivered at the shelf;  with digital content delivered at the shelf; Enabling shopper interactions by providing the ability to engage digitally with shoppers at the moment of purchase;by providing the ability to engage digitally with shoppers at the moment of purchase; Measuring the impact of promotional campaigns in real-time  and obtaining insights into consumer behavior; andand into consumer behavior; and Generating an additional revenue stream by leveraging in-store media ad spend and monetizing in-store foot traffic. The insights generated by the Engage platform enable CPG companies to communicate with their consumers digitally via ads at a prime location: the store shelf. This in turn creates a new revenue stream for retailers. The technology developed by SES-imagotag  and the solutions enabled by this technology  provide the tools that stores require to become tech-enabled digital assets. SES-imagotag's growth plan for the next five years is built on the accelerating adoption of these technologies by the world's largest retailers. VUSION ‘27: GLOBAL GROWTH AND NEW FRONTIERS Transformation Plan SES-imagotag's new strategic plan  VUSION ‘27  is underpinned by a transformation plan  comprised of the following objectives to be met by year-end 2027: Growth and Leadership: SES-imagotag aims to retain and expand its position as the Global No. 1 cloud IoT company for retail and industry. The top-line objective is to reach 1 billion connected IoT devices  and revenue of €2.2 bn (for an estimated CAGR of 30%)  with 40% of sales generated in the United States;SES-imagotag aims to retain and expand its position as the Global No. 1 cloud IoT company for retail and industry.

Global Footprint Expansion: Strategy & Roadmap At present  SES-imagotag's products and services are sold to over 60 countries across the globe through 19 regional hubs  with a concentration in Western Europe and North America. Until recently  the Company's business and growth had been concentrated in Europe which  in 2022  still represents around 75% of total revenues. However  over the past few years this growth profile has begun to shift  with the United States becoming a market that strongly contributes to growth. This trend is expected to continue over the next five years. Growth by Region Europe: Elevating our historic market SES-imagotag's Europe region  which operates through 12 offices and branches with 180 employees  currently accounts for 75% of the company's total revenue. Top-line is expected to more than double to €1.1bn by year-end 2027. This region comprises the company's most mature markets  with high levels of penetration in France  southern Europe  Benelux and Scandinavia. Markets such as Germany and the UK present significant opportunity for future growth as ESL and digital adoption are set to catch-up rapidly. In the region's more highly-penetrated markets  growth is expected to be partially driven by further deploying the large existing customer base and upgrading the installed store base increasingly to the Cloud platform and VAS solutions. The Vusion ‘27 plan envisions converting upward of 25 000 existing stores to Cloud-based solutions. The ongoing development of new verticals will drive further growth. This includes new retail segments such as hard discount  home furnishing  travel retail  health and beauty  sporting goods  fashion  DIY  convenience stores  and gas stations  as well as new customers in manufacturing  automotive  logistics  office signage and healthcare. North America: Scaling up in the world's largest retail market SES-imagotag's North American region operates through 4 offices (Chicago  Dallas  Montreal and Mexico City)  and 50 employees (expected to reach 100 by year-end 2023). All 4 000 stores across the region use the VUSION cloud platform and some of the Company's VAS solutions. Revenues already total over €100m in 2022. The total addressable market in North America is estimated to be more than 3 bn ESLs with much lower penetration than Europe. SES-imagotag's growth ambitions in the region are based on an assumption of rapid adoption catch-up  fueled by increasing price and promotional velocity  the shift to in-store fulfillment of online orders and the accelerating need for shelf automation. SES-imagotag North America's top-line is expected to increase ten-fold to a range of €0.9 to €1bn over the next five years. Rest of World In the Rest of World  SES-imagotag will continue to develop its presence in selected markets through its existing regional hubs and strategic partners network in Asia  South America and Middle East/Africa. The expected average growth in these markets is around 25% per annum throughout the period  leading to a top line of approximately €200m. These markets will become a significant growth reservoir in the longer term.

This growth will be driven by significant market penetration acceleration in the United States  the migration of existing ESL customers in Europe toward cloud-based solutions  the penetration of new markets in the Rest of World  and the development of new retail sectors and other verticals. VAS is expected to represent 30% of revenue at year-end 2027  up from 16% in 2022. Drivers of Profitability growth EBITDA in 2027 is expected to reach €480m  with EBITDA margin expanding from approximately 10% in 2022  to an anticipated 22% in 2027. The drivers of this significant profitability improvement are assumed to be a widening of gross margin  resulting from the growth of VAS (which generates a higher gross margin than ESLs) in the revenue mix  and a gradual improvement in operating leverage. Financial structure Over the next five years  SES-imagotag's potential financing requirements will be primarily met through debt. The maximum leverage the company expects to reach is a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0x. In the event that SES-imagotag takes on new debt  it could progressively shift from bullet to amortizable debt  and from European borrowing to more debt taken on in the United States. The Company is also targeting a first dividend in 2024 (based on 2023 results).

12955,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555522-air-liquide-aiquf-dividend-growth-monster-hiding-in-plain-sight,Air Liquide: A Dividend Growth Monster Hiding In Plain Sight (OTCMKTS:AIQUF),Air Liquide is a large French industrial gases producer and has been somewhat of a secret compounder over the years. Read what investors need to know.,"JL Images/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAir Liquide (OTCPK:AIQUF  OTCPK:AIQUY) is a French industrial gas giant active around the world. After its German peer Linde (LIN)  they are the second-largest supplier of industrial gases of the world  measured by revenue. Examples of their products are industrial gases which are supplied to companies active in the petrochemical industry  hydrogen  and healthcare gases such as oxygen and nitrous oxide which are used for treating patients. The nature of its operations makes the industrial gas segment a very capital-intensive business  and economies of scale can be very powerful in these types of industries. This gives Air Liquide an impressive moat.In this article  I will focus on the possession of Air Liquide for long-term investors  which can be quite untransparent and difficult to assess when only looking at graphs. One has to take into account their many free share attributions. Also  I will talk about what makes the company such a solid pick for buy-and-hold investors. Full disclosure: I have owned Air Liquide shares since 5 years  and I am planning on holding them.""Air Solide""I am situated in the Netherlands myself. One of the arguments of US or other non-EU investors against owning shares of European companies is that governments can sometimes have a large stake in companies. For Air Liquide  this is not the case  their largest investors are pension funds and money management firms. In fact  Air Liquide has the largest share of capital owned by individual shareholders of all firms in the CAC 40 (CAC:IND): about 33% of its market capitalization.The company also has an active policy of rewarding their long-term shareholders: They give a loyalty bonus of 10% on dividends and free share attributions (the latter of which is in fact a stock dividend). You do have to become a registered shareholder to be eligible for this bonus. As another illustration of their dedication to a long-term view: Air Liquide has only had 6 different CEOs since 1902. This focus on the long term combined with a solid performance in the past has led to some investors dubbing the company ""Air Solide"".Performance and DividendsLet us take a look at the past performance of the company's shares now to see if this stable-looking enterprise is also performing accordingly.Data by YChartsGraph 1: Air Liquide share price and profit/earnings ratio over the yearsIn the first graph  you can see the price development of Air Liquide shares over the last ~13 years. I took the AIQUF shares here  since they translate 1:1 to the European shares traded on Euronext (note: AIQUY corresponds to 1/5 of the regular shares).When looking at the price graph of Air Liquide shares  it can be noted that the company performed in a relatively stable way but that there was likely no extraordinary outperformance compared with major indices  if any. Also  recently  the company's shares have experienced a correction more or less in line with worldwide markets.Of course  dividends are not accounted for in the price graph. But there is another important factor which has not been included: the loyalty bonus which Air Liquide awards to shareholders which have held their shares for more than 2 full calendar years. Every time Air Liquide pays out its dividend  long-term shareholders receive 10% extra. Of course  investors need to pay dividend tax  so the benefit in the end will be a bit less.Air Liquide's aims to pay out 55% of its net profit in dividend  which makes their past payouts look like this:Air Liquide annual dividend Amount 2022 €2.90 2021 €2.75 2020 €2.70 2019 €2.65 2018 €2.65 2017 €2.60 2016 €2.60 2015 €2.55 2014 €2.55 2013 €2.50 2012 €2.13 2011 €1.91 2010 €1.91 2009 €1.73 Click to enlargeTable 1: Last annual dividends paid out by Air Liquide (source: Air Liquide)Free SharesFor loyal shareholders  not only the dividend will be increased by 10%  also the free share attributions are increased by the same percentage. In addition to its annual dividend  Air Liquide somewhat irregularly awards free shares to its shareholders. To partially counter the dilution effect of these free share giveaways  the company put into work multiple share buyback programs. These free shares should be viewed as nothing less than a stock dividend  which does not directly change the value of an individual shareholder's investment. This is because the total number of shares of Air Liquide gets diluted by the same percentage as the free share allocation. But shareholders who receive the 10% extra bonus do gain something  since not all shareholders receive this extra 10%  and thus are fractionally better off after such a free share attribution.Air Liquide gave away free shares in the following years (1:10 means that 1 free share was given for every 10 shares owned  fractional shares when shareholders owned a number which was not dividable by 10 were paid out in cash):Air Liquide free shares 2022 2019 2017 2014 2012 2010 Attribution 1:10 1:10 1:10 1:10 1:10 1:15 Click to enlargeTable 2: Free shares provided by Air Liquide (source: website Air Liquide)Air Liquide awarded 9 free share attributions in the last 20 years. As I mentioned before  these free share attributions do not directly increase performance of investors' holdings. But these free share allocations do have a very large influence on the amount of dividends paid over the longer term. Let us make a calculation using the dividend of 2009 as a baseline and include dividend payments and free share allocations.Annual dividend Free shares Corrected dividend with 10% bonus for dividend + free shares 2009 €1.73 €1.90 2010 €1.91 1:15 €2.10 2011 €1.91 €2.26 2012 €2.13 1:10 €2.51 2013 €2.50 €3.28 2014 €2.55 1:10 €3.34 2015 €2.55 €3.71 2016 €2.60 €3.78 2017 €2.60 1:10 €3.78 2018 €2.65 €4.28 2019 €2.65 1:10 €4.28 2020 €2.70 €4.84 2021 €2.75 €4.93 2022 €2.90 1:10 €5.20 Click to enlargeTable 3: Annual dividends corrected for bonus and free shares (source: calculations by author)Note that  in this table  I am assuming that all the free share attributions happened after the payment of the annual dividend in the given years  of which I am not sure whether this was always the case.We can conclude from this table that when you include the free share allocations and the 10% bonus in the dividend of Air Liquide  the dividend development looks a whole lot rosier than when leaving this out. At first glance  the 'normal' dividend numbers of Air Liquide look like a company which increases its dividend bit by bit  but nothing impressive. The corrected numbers reveal that Air Liquide has been an impressive dividend growth investment for long-term investors.On paper  Air Liquide increased its dividend by 68% from 2009 to 2022  which is an average annual increase of 4.1%. Not bad  but nothing impressive. When we include our calculated corrected dividends  we end up at a total dividend increase of 174% between 2009 and 2022  or an annual rate of 8.1%. These percentages are so different because of the large influence of the free share attributions.ValuationA quality stock like Air Liquide is rarely cheap  and if we look at the metrics  it does not appear to be cheap today either:Data by YChartsGraph 2: Air Liquide PE ratio  earnings per share and price to free cash flow ratios over the yearsOn a price to free cash flow basis  the shares do appear to be fairly valued  but when looking at the PE ratio  shares seem historically a bit overvalued at a ratio of 24.06. Around 2010 or 2019 was probably the best time to buy Air Liquide shares  but even then  their PE ratio was around 18  which is relatively high.ConclusionAir Liquide looks like a very solid holding for buy-and-hold investors. In this article  we took a look at the share price development of the stock in combination with its annual dividend and free share attribution policy. At first glance  Air Liquide looks like a bit of a lackluster performer dividend-wise. But when accounted for their free share attributions in combination with their growing dividend  the company looks like a very solid dividend growth machine for long-term investors. This is more or less hidden in plain sight.I have owned Air Liquide shares since 5 years and will continue to do so for as long as I'm able. Their current valuation is rich  so I would consider the stock a 'hold' at current prices. But quality stocks like these are rarely cheap  so long-term investors should not be deterred by the slightly higher-than-historic valuation.Thank you for reading!

Shareholders not resident in Sweden who wish to accept the Offer (as defined below) must make inquiries concerning applicable legislation and possible tax consequences. Shareholders should refer to the offer restrictions included in the section titled “Important information” at the end of this announcement and in the offer document  which has been published on the Offer website (www.smokefree-offer.com). Shareholders in the United States should also refer to the section entitled “Special notice to shareholders in the United States” at the end of this announcement.On May 11  2022  Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V.1 (“PMHH”)  an affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”)  announced a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (“Swedish Match”) to tender all shares in Swedish Match2 to PMHH (the “Offer”). On November 7  2022  PMHH declared the Offer unconditional and announced that it would complete the Offer and acquire all shares in Swedish Match that have been tendered in the Offer. In addition  PMHH extended the acceptance period until November 25  2022 and informed the Swedish Match shareholders that the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period will be reduced to SEK 115.07 in cash per share due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share for shareholders of record as of November 14  2022.The shares tendered in the Offer at the end of the acceptance period (which expired on November 4  2022) amounted to in aggregate 1 255 989 816 shares in Swedish Match3  corresponding to approximately 82.59 percent4 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match. Settlement for shares tendered in the Offer up to and including November 4  2022  is expected to be initiated around November 11  2022.As set forth in the offer document regarding the Offer made public on June 28  2022 (the “Offer Document”)  PMHH and its affiliates may  to the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  acquire  or take measures to acquire  shares in Swedish Match in other ways than through the Offer. Information about such acquisitions of shares  or measures to acquire shares  must be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.A shareholding exceeding 85 percent5 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match impacts the inclusion of Swedish Match shares in various market indexes  and is therefore information relevant for certain index funds holding shares in Swedish Match. In view of this  PMHH wishes to inform the Swedish Match shareholders that PMHH has acquired 49 899 948 shares in Swedish Match outside of the Offer since the announcement of the outcome of the Offer on November 7  2022. Accordingly  the total number of shares in Swedish Match acquired by PMHH  including the shares tendered in the Offer at the end of the acceptance period on November 4  2022  amounts to 1 305 889 764 shares  corresponding to approximately 85.87 percent5 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match. No acquisitions have been made at a price exceeding the price in the Offer.“We are pleased to have already reached almost 86% ownership of Swedish Match within the first 3 business days of the extension period ” said Jacek Olczak  Chief Executive Officer of PMI. “We encourage the remaining shareholders to tender as soon as possible in the extended time to avoid having to wait for payment through a potential minority redemption process  which we intend to initiate after reaching an ownership of more than 90%.”“We look forward to welcoming Swedish Match’s employees and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI family to create a global smoke-free champion  notably bringing IQOS and ZYN together in both the U.S. and international markets. We will be working together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of a smoke-free future.”PMHH will continue to strive towards an ownership in Swedish Match of more than 90 percent5 of the total number of shares in Swedish Match and thereafter initiate compulsory redemption of the remaining shares in Swedish Match under the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551))  as well as promote a delisting of Swedish Match’s shares from Nasdaq Stockholm. For further information on the implications of PMHH’s ownership of less than 90 percent of the total number of registered shares in Swedish Match  PMHH refers shareholders of Swedish Match to the description thereof included in the section of the Offer Document entitled “Important notice to shareholders in the United States of America”.As previously announced  PMHH has extended the acceptance period until November 25  2022 at 17.00 (CET) to provide the remaining shareholders of Swedish Match who have not tendered their shares time to accept the Offer. Due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share with record date for the payment on November 14  2022  and expected date for payment through Euroclear Sweden on November 17  2022  the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period will  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer6  be reduced accordingly to SEK 115.07 in cash per share. For further information regarding Swedish Match’s resolution on dividends at the annual general meeting 2022  please refer to Swedish Match’s website  www.swedishmatch.com.

After a development phase extended by 18 months due to the Covid pandemic  this major revamp has involved all of Artprice's databases and services.After a call for tenders at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level and committed external consultants to audit and develop a complete overhaul of Artprice.com  with a solid UI/UX approach (UX and UI respectively stand for User Experience and User Interface). The results of this user-centric approach will be visible in mid-December.The new website will also boast a new economic model with the inclusion of paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers will be primarily the 6 400 auction houses worldwide affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now be able to highlight their future sales in paying advertiser mode  based on the search criteria used by Artprice's 5.4 million users. The resulting targeting will be extremely relevant.We note that for over 50 years  the economic model of auction houses has systematically involved advertising costs – announcing details of upcoming sales – that accounted for approximately 34% of their overall costs  regardless of the country or the size of their activity.Since auctions are now 98% advertised on the Internet  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their sales for a fee has found the best solution on our new website. It is only logical that auction houses now consider their advertisement of future sales (34% of the cost of the sale) makes more sense on the Internet rather than in the printed press.In the past  Artprice has always considered online advertising incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and notoriety. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to demand from auction houses for advertising while maintaining Artprice's core DNA.In the new roll-out  the 6 400 auction operators will be able to integrate and merge the announcements of their future sales into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  along with ""pushing"" the artists selected as favorites to Artprice's 5.4 million users (alerts by text messages  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  My Artists page  etc.).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 400 auction houses affiliated with Artprice since 1997 will ultimately exceed our subscription revenue (currently 90% of Artprice's total revenue). Artprice therefore believes that by responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  the new business model could double its future revenue.In responding to the numerous and repeated requests from its 6 400 affiliated auction houses around the world to be able to profitably advertise their future sales  Artprice has made every effort to remain faithful to its principle of prioritizing the readability of its databases.Significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in early January 2023   a complete overhaul of the Artists Pages in AI and Web 3.0  Art NFTs for better global visibility of the 800 000 artists listed by Artprice by ArtmarketArtmarket.com will be introducing a significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in January 2023 that will generate an increase in future income. As Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.The fee increases follow extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  being well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find anywhere else. Our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 must now be commercially exploited at its true value. Remember that our databases are continually updated with ultra-detailed and qualified data: well over a million new data logs every year.According to a consensus of art market professionals  Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making support tools  signatures & monograms  information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for €350/year  450 queries for €975/year and  in the event of overrun  €2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competitions' offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from €265 to €529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with further margin for additional price rises in the future.Somewhat counter-intuitively – given the geopolitical and economic context – the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has clearly outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. As the end of the year approaches  it is clear that the war in Ukraine and fears of a major recession have not had a negative impact on the art market.On 8 November last  AFP  the French Press Agency  highlighted this phenomenon in an article titled ""Collection of Microsoft co-founder could fetch over a billion dollars in New York""  adding ""By auctioning in New York the art collected by Paul Allen (Microsoft's co-founder who died in 2018)  Christie's is aiming for a historic sales record in a bold move that reflects a market whose indicators are higher than ever  despite the geopolitical and economic crises.""During December 2022  as part of our major revamp  we will be introducing significant changes to the presentation of our databases and Artist Pages on Artprice by Artmarket. This development  conceived with a UI/UX approach  will therefore be effective ahead of the tariff increase with the objective of boosting Artmarket.com's revenues from the very start of 2023.Conceived after 18 months of in-depth analysis by a highly specialized team of UI/UX consultants  the changes we are introducing take into account the sentiment of users when they navigate our digital media (databases and services). The objective of UX design is to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and/or prospective customers as much as possible in order to make it easier and more intuitive  both on mobile and desktop devices. As a result of these changes the expectations and needs of Artprice's customers and users will be better satisfied.Thanks to UX design  online navigation is more fluid and more effective. It eliminates the incomprehension that users often encounters in their daily online experiences and takes into account not just the logistics of online navigation  but also the 'emotional' aspect of online navigation.The Interface aspect (UI design) of our modifications has focused on enhancing the interaction of Artprice users with our databases and services. This approach has been used at all stages in the development of our new website  right through to its roll-out in mid-December 2022.Unlike UX (user experience)  UI is more focused on the visual aspect in order to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services. The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field in order to acquire new market shares.The Artists Pages are the principal and most common entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. It is for this reason that our website revamp has aimed to reposition artists at the heart of the art market  a position that is inevitable with the production of Art NFTs which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This global overhaul of Artprice aims to give its customers and users a better experience  in line with their needs  after several years of collecting and analyzing their queries  in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will at last allow the exploitation of the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and printed sales catalogs in the world. Dating back to 1700  and owned by Artprice  this collection is the very foundation of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and of its position as the World Leader in Art Market Information for the past 25 years.Thus  Artprice users and prospects will now be able to navigate from the Artist Pages to several centuries of knowledge that Artprice by Artmarket's historians and editors have been organizing over the last 25 years  allowing them to immerse themselves in the exceptional and mysterious history of the art market.These new pages will highlight the wealth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  with high added value. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) will allow access to very relevant and personalized recommendations  to enhance customers' knowledge of the art market and to generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more business revenue.Indeed  this feature takes Artprice by Artmarket clients and users into a Web 3.0 dimension and – by extension – into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.During the course of the development of our major roll-out scheduled in December 2022  Artprice listened to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  but art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  they have absolutely no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.These are the new clients of Artmarket.com  whose services they have frequently requested. Their main demand in recent years has been that we post art prices in ETH and BTC in all Artprice databases.This huge global community could not understand why Artprice's reference databases only quoted prices in the world's main fiat currencies  without the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC)  which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding Stablecoins).Appreciating the business opportunity represented by 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs  Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams therefore moved quickly to respond positively to their demand.Artmarket.com has therefore once again taken a major step forward that required considerable reflection and an imposing volume of work. As a result since September 2022  Artprice now quotes 8 828 384 art auction results in Bitcoin (going back to 1 February 2011 when 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707) and 5 814 866 art auction results in Ethereum (going back to 7 August 2015 when 1 Ethereum was worth $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  the tens of millions of calculations underlying this ambitious project were made using the value of the respective cryptocurrencies on the days the respective sales were concluded. The values were calculated by Artmarket.com's proprietary IT systems.https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/12/artmarket_com-adds-ethereum-and-bitcoin-to-its-multi-currency-artprice-databases-to-meet-the-needs-of-its-customers-and-prepareSince 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population in order to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable and above all contextualized data.Indeed  when navigating our new website  clients and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of the GAFAs.Over the years  Artprice  as the World Leader in Art Market Information  has been a partner in numerous essential and historic collaborations with artists. Their contributions have been clearly reflected in the development of our new interface with users.The other essential collaboration has of course been with the auction houses which will now have a growing interest in collaborating with Artprice. Henceforward we will promote their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  thereby generating new recurring income for Artprice with its proprietary Intranet  which has been the reference work tool for auction houses for many years.After two years of R&D – extended by the circumstances of the Covid pandemic – Artmarket.com customers  partners and members will be able to immerse themselves in a new experience at the heart of the art market. This is undoubtedly one of the founding steps for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with its positioning fundamentally improved by the referencing of images on search engines (SEOs) and the dual objectives of increasing traffic in order to conquer new market shares and to monopolize the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databases.We have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow a better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies with regard to new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture and the sentiments of our customers.Moreover  as regards the exchange of Art NFTs on its Marketplace and given the current energy context  Artmarket.com is pleased to have preferred Ethereum for a long time and fully supports the remarks by France's Minister of the Economy  Mr. Bruno Le Maire  as indicated in a previous press release:https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-already-positioned-on-nfts-with-artprice-reacts-to-an-interview-on-bfm-crypto-with-bruno-le-maire-and-notably-hisArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that in the first two quarters of 2022  the phenomenon of Art NFTs became a lasting segment of the art market on all continents with an acceleration of turnover and volumes in the second half of 2022 due notably to the purge of crypto-currencies and much more favorable new legislation in the USA as well as the introduction of regulatory framework in Europe that prevents crypto-abuse/fraud and enhances the confidence of consumers  investors and operators.These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.Artprice invites you to read the latest Banques Notes published by the European Center for Research in Banking and Finance  with the analysis of Blanche Sousi  Professor Emeritus of the University of Lyon 3  Jean Monnet Chair ad personam in European banking and monetary law:""The European Regulation MiCAR has just been adopted: are NFTs regulated?

Artprice therefore believes that by responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  the new business model could double its future revenue.In responding to the numerous and repeated requests from its 6 400 affiliated auction houses around the world to be able to profitably advertise their future sales  Artprice has made every effort to remain faithful to its principle of prioritizing the readability of its databases.Significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in early January 2023   a complete overhaul of the Artists Pages in AI and Web 3.0  Art NFTs for better global visibility of the 800 000 artists listed by Artprice by ArtmarketArtmarket.com will be introducing a significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in January 2023 that will generate an increase in future income. As Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.The fee increases follow extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  being well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find anywhere else. Our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 must now be commercially exploited at its true value. Remember that our databases are continually updated with ultra-detailed and qualified data: well over a million new data logs every year.According to a consensus of art market professionals  Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making support tools  signatures & monograms  information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for €350/year  450 queries for €975/year and  in the event of overrun  €2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competitions' offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from €265 to €529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with further margin for additional price rises in the future.Somewhat counter-intuitively – given the geopolitical and economic context – the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has clearly outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. As the end of the year approaches  it is clear that the war in Ukraine and fears of a major recession have not had a negative impact on the art market.On 8 November last  AFP  the French Press Agency  highlighted this phenomenon in an article titled ""Collection of Microsoft co-founder could fetch over a billion dollars in New York""  adding ""By auctioning in New York the art collected by Paul Allen (Microsoft's co-founder who died in 2018)  Christie's is aiming for a historic sales record in a bold move that reflects a market whose indicators are higher than ever  despite the geopolitical and economic crises.""During December 2022  as part of our major revamp  we will be introducing significant changes to the presentation of our databases and Artist Pages on Artprice by Artmarket. This development  conceived with a UI/UX approach  will therefore be effective ahead of the tariff increase with the objective of boosting Artmarket.com's revenues from the very start of 2023.Conceived after 18 months of in-depth analysis by a highly specialized team of UI/UX consultants  the changes we are introducing take into account the sentiment of users when they navigate our digital media (databases and services). The objective of UX design is to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and/or prospective customers as much as possible in order to make it easier and more intuitive  both on mobile and desktop devices. As a result of these changes the expectations and needs of Artprice's customers and users will be better satisfied.Thanks to UX design  online navigation is more fluid and more effective. It eliminates the incomprehension that users often encounters in their daily online experiences and takes into account not just the logistics of online navigation  but also the 'emotional' aspect of online navigation.The Interface aspect (UI design) of our modifications has focused on enhancing the interaction of Artprice users with our databases and services. This approach has been used at all stages in the development of our new website  right through to its roll-out in mid-December 2022.Unlike UX (user experience)  UI is more focused on the visual aspect in order to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services. The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field in order to acquire new market shares.The Artists Pages are the principal and most common entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. It is for this reason that our website revamp has aimed to reposition artists at the heart of the art market  a position that is inevitable with the production of Art NFTs which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This global overhaul of Artprice aims to give its customers and users a better experience  in line with their needs  after several years of collecting and analyzing their queries  in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will at last allow the exploitation of the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and printed sales catalogs in the world. Dating back to 1700  and owned by Artprice  this collection is the very foundation of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and of its position as the World Leader in Art Market Information for the past 25 years.Thus  Artprice users and prospects will now be able to navigate from the Artist Pages to several centuries of knowledge that Artprice by Artmarket's historians and editors have been organizing over the last 25 years  allowing them to immerse themselves in the exceptional and mysterious history of the art market.These new pages will highlight the wealth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  with high added value. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) will allow access to very relevant and personalized recommendations  to enhance customers' knowledge of the art market and to generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more business revenue.Indeed  this feature takes Artprice by Artmarket clients and users into a Web 3.0 dimension and – by extension – into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.During the course of the development of our major roll-out scheduled in December 2022  Artprice listened to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  but art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  they have absolutely no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.These are the new clients of Artmarket.com  whose services they have frequently requested. Their main demand in recent years has been that we post art prices in ETH and BTC in all Artprice databases.This huge global community could not understand why Artprice's reference databases only quoted prices in the world's main fiat currencies  without the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC)  which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding Stablecoins).Appreciating the business opportunity represented by 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs  Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams therefore moved quickly to respond positively to their demand.Artmarket.com has therefore once again taken a major step forward that required considerable reflection and an imposing volume of work. As a result since September 2022  Artprice now quotes 8 828 384 art auction results in Bitcoin (going back to 1 February 2011 when 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707) and 5 814 866 art auction results in Ethereum (going back to 7 August 2015 when 1 Ethereum was worth $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  the tens of millions of calculations underlying this ambitious project were made using the value of the respective cryptocurrencies on the days the respective sales were concluded. The values were calculated by Artmarket.com's proprietary IT systems.https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/12/artmarket_com-adds-ethereum-and-bitcoin-to-its-multi-currency-artprice-databases-to-meet-the-needs-of-its-customers-and-prepareSince 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population in order to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable and above all contextualized data.Indeed  when navigating our new website  clients and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of the GAFAs.Over the years  Artprice  as the World Leader in Art Market Information  has been a partner in numerous essential and historic collaborations with artists. Their contributions have been clearly reflected in the development of our new interface with users.The other essential collaboration has of course been with the auction houses which will now have a growing interest in collaborating with Artprice. Henceforward we will promote their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  thereby generating new recurring income for Artprice with its proprietary Intranet  which has been the reference work tool for auction houses for many years.After two years of R&D – extended by the circumstances of the Covid pandemic – Artmarket.com customers  partners and members will be able to immerse themselves in a new experience at the heart of the art market. This is undoubtedly one of the founding steps for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with its positioning fundamentally improved by the referencing of images on search engines (SEOs) and the dual objectives of increasing traffic in order to conquer new market shares and to monopolize the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databases.We have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow a better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies with regard to new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture and the sentiments of our customers.Moreover  as regards the exchange of Art NFTs on its Marketplace and given the current energy context  Artmarket.com is pleased to have preferred Ethereum for a long time and fully supports the remarks by France's Minister of the Economy  Mr. Bruno Le Maire  as indicated in a previous press release:https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-already-positioned-on-nfts-with-artprice-reacts-to-an-interview-on-bfm-crypto-with-bruno-le-maire-and-notably-hisArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that in the first two quarters of 2022  the phenomenon of Art NFTs became a lasting segment of the art market on all continents with an acceleration of turnover and volumes in the second half of 2022 due notably to the purge of crypto-currencies and much more favorable new legislation in the USA as well as the introduction of regulatory framework in Europe that prevents crypto-abuse/fraud and enhances the confidence of consumers  investors and operators.These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.Artprice invites you to read the latest Banques Notes published by the European Center for Research in Banking and Finance  with the analysis of Blanche Sousi  Professor Emeritus of the University of Lyon 3  Jean Monnet Chair ad personam in European banking and monetary law:""The European Regulation MiCAR has just been adopted: are NFTs regulated? No  but…"": https://banque-notes.eu/le-reglement-europeen-micar-vient-detre-adopte-les-nfts-sont-ils-reglementes-non-mais/thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com emphasizes: ""In its various annual reports on the Art Market and its regulated information  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said with regard to NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a perfect knowledge of the relevant Monetary & Financial Codes and Intellectual Property Codes of the countries in which the market is operating. Similarly  to appreciate the nature of this market (experiencing exponential growth)  one also needs a true understanding of Blockchain  crypto-currencies and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of 1990).""Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.coml Don't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]l Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demol Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

12985,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.globalinvestorgroup.com/articles/3699445/isf-q-and-a-clearstreams-alexandre-roques,ISF Q&A: Clearstream's Alexandre Roques,Can you share with our readers some of your career highlights so far? I’ve witnessed significant phases of the financial industry  notably the run-up of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008  which saw the increasing prevalence of the securities lending. Then  following the wobble in European sovereign debt 2011  the advent of dovish monetary policy led to central banks becoming much more involved in capital market activities. This created a need to re-inject liquidity the central banks had purchased back into the market. I’m immensely proud to have been involved in the design of such mechanisms  which has been an enriching professional experience. The highlight I want to share with you is a bit more personal. I remember vividly the first day I arrived in London in 2005  starting off on my career as a securities lending trader at BNP Paribas. I remember having this feeling that I was in the right place at the right time. I was only supposed to stay in London for six months  yet here I am 17 years later. What are you the proudest of since the start of your career? I would say my biggest achievement has been to put Clearstream Securities Lending on the industry map. When I joined Clearstream in 2009  I remember we were facing just a few lenders and borrowers  and I was the only trader there. But we had big ambitions: 14 years later  we are one of the biggest and best-rated securities lending desks globally. We have created a unique access to a liquidity pool composed of traditional lender-owned assets as well as Eurosystem central bank monetary policy portfolios. I am very proud that Clearstream Banking is now the first stop when it comes to HQLA for borrowers. I am equally proud of the positive feedback we have from our counterparties  particularly the efficiency and ease with which it is to trade with us. Not only do we have access to a unique pool of liquidity  but on the distribution side we are very active and strive to bring liquidity to the market. What are some of the lessons you have learned in the past few years? First of all  I have learned that low interest rates don’t last forever. I say this in a tongue-in-cheek way  but it is true. The watershed moment came in November 2011  after the eurozone debt crisis  when Draghi stepped in and said ‘whatever it takes’. This is when central banks in Europe started to consider unconventional monetary policy tools to support the market and created the low interest rate environment we’ve come to know for the past ten years. Then suddenly  there was a shift in dynamics in Q4 of 2021. I would not say it took participants by surprise  but we saw a very stable market  at least for HQLA  in terms of fees and flow  starting to become active again. So  I am interested to see what will happen next  especially once central banks will start to pivot on interest rates. The second lesson is that getting out of QE is not easy. A lot of market participants got used to having the support of outright buyers – the central banks. In the absence of a buyer of last resort  it has created significant amounts of volatility and has put pressure on liquidity  particularly as it shifts the burden of market making back to commercial banks. A situation can change dramatically  and we must be prepared for that. Our industry has been extremely resilient in the past few of years. There was no disruption in terms of distribution  borrowing or flows. It has been incredible to see because it means we can weather strong disruptive situations such as lockdowns. It is testament to the professionalism of the industry and the trust between participants  which I am proud to be part of. How has the securities lending market changed since you started your career? Because of lockdowns  I think that the way we communicate as an industry has evolved. When I started  we were talking to each other on the phone  verbally. The way that people communicate now is more message-based. In addition  the fact that people were not seeing each other because there were no conferences has been disruptive to our industry. I am very happy to see conferences and events coming back. We can socialise again. This has also made me realise how important in-person interactions are  and that our industry is driven by strong personal connections  trust  and communication between participants. Another point is that the securities lending market is getting more geared towards automation. When I started trading at the beginning of the 2000s  everything was voice-based  and we were booking trades manually. There was only one platform  which had just started operating at the time. There is clearly a push towards automation now as well as rationalisation. When I say ‘rationalisation ' I mean that I am seeing more departments merging: equities  fixed income or collateral optimisation coming together under the same umbrella. I am also seeing more flows going through platforms. This is a positive development  but you also need to take a step back and have a view of what is happening in the market. I think it's about trying to find a good balance when it comes to automation as there are bespoke - segments of our industry that will always require a manual human touch. Finally  I am seeing lenders becoming more involved in managing their securities lending programmes. They historically have been more passive because securities lending was seen as more of an add-on to mitigate their custody costs. But over the years  lenders have become active on that end. It has been very positive for the industry because we have seen much more inflow in terms of liquidity and higher competition. In the past  lenders could be tied up with their custodian but nowadays they are much more aware of the type of profitability they can get through their programmes. Where is this market heading in the next 12 to 18 months? I think technological advancement will play a major role because our industry is clearly a bit behind. All in all  we are still trading like we did 15 years ago. One of the reasons for this is post-financial crisis  there was an immense amount of resource allocated towards regulatory projects such as SFTR  CSDR or Basel IV. Now that these are mostly behind us  I expect many resources will be reallocated to the business  one focus of work being technological advancement. I have seen a lot of new platforms coming to the market that are very smart  well-designed and offer solutions to the issue I outlined previously of staying in touch with the market. On a wider note  it is clear market dynamics are changing. Central bank monetary policies are implemented through two main tools: quantitative tightening and rate increases. These are not going to stop until there is a clear effect on inflation. It feels that this will be the case for the next 12 to 18 months. Central banks’ balance sheets are still inflated from all these years of buying government and corporate bonds. Central banks have ceased increasing their bond holdings and started an ongoing cycle of rate increases that have led to a widespread rise in yields. This creates more demand from the buy-side for opportunistic trading and comes on top of already high demand from banks for liquidity  balance sheet management and financing. Volatility due to this lack of liquidity will continue until there is a normalisation in the market dynamics  which I do not expect to see until more collateral is released from the central banks back into the private sector and inflation anchors at an acceptable level. What projects is Clearstream working on that you would like to outline? In keeping with the times  the main areas we are working in at the moment are digitisation and automation. One particular example is our automated collateral management application called OSCAR  which enables participants to easily define collateral baskets and integrate them in their own IT systems. We are also involved as a trusted third party for the HQLAx platform. Within our securities lending services  we have focused on expanding the breath of asset classes and markets we are active in  in particular equities and ETFs. Furthermore  we have concentrated efforts over the past year and beyond to automate significant parts of the operational lifecycle of securities lending  with success so far. In short  in the coming year  we will be focused on the rationalisation of our collateral platform with a view to increase customer efficiency and collateral mobility.,Can you share with our readers some of your career highlights so far?I’ve witnessed significant phases of the financial industry  notably the run-up of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008  which saw the increasing prevalence of the securities lending.

When I started trading at the beginning of the 2000s  everything was voice-based  and we were booking trades manually. There was only one platform  which had just started operating at the time. There is clearly a push towards automation now as well as rationalisation. When I say ‘rationalisation ' I mean that I am seeing more departments merging: equities  fixed income or collateral optimisation coming together under the same umbrella. I am also seeing more flows going through platforms. This is a positive development  but you also need to take a step back and have a view of what is happening in the market. I think it's about trying to find a good balance when it comes to automation as there are bespoke segments of our industry that will always require a manual human touch.Finally  I am seeing lenders becoming more involved in managing their securities lending programmes. They historically have been more passive because securities lending was seen as more of an add-on to mitigate their custody costs. But over the years  lenders have become active on that end. It has been very positive for the industry because we have seen much more inflow in terms of liquidity and higher competition. In the past  lenders could be tied up with their custodian but nowadays they are much more aware of the type of profitability they can get through their programmes.Where is this market heading in the next 12 to 18 months?I think technological advancement will play a major role because our industry is clearly a bit behind. All in all  we are still trading like we did 15 years ago. One of the reasons for this is post-financial crisis  there was an immense amount of resource allocated towards regulatory projects such as SFTR  CSDR or Basel IV.Now that these are mostly behind us  I expect many resources will be reallocated to the business  one focus of work being technological advancement. I have seen a lot of new platforms coming to the market that are very smart  well-designed and offer solutions to the issue I outlined previously of staying in touch with the market.On a wider note  it is clear market dynamics are changing. Central bank monetary policies are implemented through two main tools: quantitative tightening and rate increases. These are not going to stop until there is a clear effect on inflation. It feels that this will be the case for the next 12 to 18 months.Central banks’ balance sheets are still inflated from all these years of buying government and corporate bonds.Central banks have ceased increasing their bond holdings and started an ongoing cycle of rate increases that have led to a widespread rise in yields. This creates more demand from the buy-side for opportunistic trading and comes on top of already high demand from banks for liquidity  balance sheet management and financing.Volatility due to this lack of liquidity will continue until there is a normalisation in the market dynamics  which I do not expect to see until more collateral is released from the central banks back into the private sector and inflation anchors at an acceptable level.What projects is Clearstream working on that you would like to outline?In keeping with the times  the main areas we are working in at the moment are digitisation and automation.One particular example is our automated collateral management application called OSCAR  which enables participants to easily define collateral baskets and integrate them in their own IT systems. We are also involved as a trusted third party for the HQLAx platform.Within our securities lending services  we have focused on expanding the breath of asset classes and markets we are active in  in particular equities and ETFs. Furthermore  we have concentrated efforts over the past year and beyond to automate significant parts of the operational lifecycle of securities lending  with success so far.In short  in the coming year  we will be focused on the rationalisation of our collateral platform with a view to increase customer efficiency and collateral mobility.About Alexandre RoquesAlexandre Roques heads Clearstream’s securities lending desk  which is responsible for the distribution of securities on behalf of clients and sits within CBL’s Banking  Funding & Financing (BFF) division.He joined Clearstream in 2009  first in Luxembourg and relocated to the UK in 2010.Prior to this  Alexandre held roles at BP2S in Paris and London working in the Markets and Financing Services Division as collateral manager and Agency Lending Sales.Alexandre holds a Masters in Finance from the ESLSCA Business School in Paris.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.53,0.11,0.36,True,English,"['ISF Q&A', 'Alexandre Roques', 'Clearstream', 'Eurosystem central bank monetary policy portfolios', 'unconventional monetary policy tools', 'high quality liquid assets', 'low interest rate environment', 'dovish monetary policy', 'traditional lender-owned assets', 'European sovereign debt', 'enriching professional experience', 'low interest rates', 'eurozone debt crisis', 'strong disruptive situations', 'strong personal connections', 'securities lending desks', 'Global Financial Crisis', 'capital market activities', 'Clearstream Securities Lending', 'securities lending trader', 'securities lending market', 'past ten years', 'central banks', 'significant phases', 'increasing prevalence', 'BNP Paribas', 'right place', 'six months', 'big ambitions', 'Clearstream Banking', 'first stop', 'positive feedback', 'unique pool', 'watershed moment', 'second lesson', 'quantitative easing', 'outright buyers', 'last resort', 'significant amounts', 'commercial banks', 'person interactions', 'one platform', 'fixed income', 'collateral optimisation', 'same umbrella', 'positive development', 'stable market', 'financial industry', 'right time', 'biggest achievement', 'unique access', 'distribution side', 'cheek way', 'industry map', 'career highlights', 'liquidity pool', 'market participants', 'readers', 'run-up', 'wobble', 'advent', 'need', 'design', 'mechanisms', 'London', 'feeling', 'start', 'lenders', 'borrowers', 'HQLA', 'counterparties', 'efficiency', 'ease', 'lessons', 'tongue', 'November', 'Draghi', 'shift', 'dynamics', 'Q4', 'surprise', 'terms', 'fees', 'flow', 'QE', 'lot', 'support', 'absence', 'volatility', 'pressure', 'burden', 'disruption', 'borrowing', 'lockdowns', 'testament', 'professionalism', 'trust', 'phone', 'people', 'addition', 'fact', 'conferences', 'events', 'communication', 'point', 'automation', 'beginning', '2000s', 'everything', 'trades', 'push', 'rationalisation', 'departments', 'equities', 'platforms', 'step', 'view']",2022-11-10,2022-11-10,globalinvestorgroup.com
12986,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/interview-giorgi-paresishvili-chairman-of-tashkent-stock-exchange/ar-AA13WZ2P,INTERVIEW: Giorgi Paresishvili  chairman of Tashkent Stock Exchange,When I first interviewed Giorgi Paresishvilli eight years ago he had just been appointed the CEO of the Georgian Stock Exchange (GSE) as well as chairman of the supervisory board of the central securities depository (CSD) and tasked with modernising the domestic capital market.,By Ben Aris in Samarakand© IntelliNews© IntelliNewsWhen I first interviewed Giorgi Paresishvilli eight years ago he had just been appointed the CEO of the Georgian Stock Exchange (GSE) as well as chairman of the supervisory board of the central securities depository (CSD) and tasked with modernising the domestic capital market.He was highly successful. In January 2016 Paresishvilli successfully plugged Georgia into the international capital markets when it hooked up to the international settlement and clearing system of Clearstream via its largest bank  the Bank of Georgia.Already regarded as the most progressive country in the Caucasus  joining Clearstream widened Georgia’s lead over its Former Soviet Union (FSU) peers further as international investors could overnight buy stocks and bonds on the local exchange directly from their trading desks in London and New York. The reform opened access to a new pool of capital of hundreds of millions of dollars and transformed the market.Paresishvilli drove through a reform programme to create an international standard capital market that its companies and banks can tap to raise capital  as well as provide investment opportunities for things like domestic pension funds.Now Paresishvilli hopes to do the same thing for Uzbekistan.“The Ministry of Finance of Uzbekistan approached me in Spring of 2022 and offered me this job”  the CEO of the Tashkent Exchange George Paresishvili told bne IntelliNews in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the Uzbek Economic Forum in Samarkand at the start of November. “They wanted me to help them develop the Uzbek capital market and open it up to foreign portfolio investors.“The Ministry of Finance was looking for someone with experience in both international and regional capital markets  and for someone who at the same time spoke Russian ” said Paresishvili  who has also worked in New York and London at international investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and at Bank of Georgia and Bank Republic (part of Societe Generale Group back then) in his native Georgia.Clearstream revolutionParesishvilli was hired to run the Tashkent Stock Exchange (TSE) in September last year and the first thing he did was fly to the Clearstream headquarters in Luxembourg to invite the company to start operations with the Uzbek capital markets.“I think they also liked the fact that we set up a link with Clearstream in Georgia  effectively opening up local securities market to foreign investors. After Georgia other regional markets – Armenia  Kazakhstan  Ukraine  Serbia  and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were linked with Clearstream and we hope it can be done in Uzbekistan as well” Hooking up Georgia to the international financial system brought in new foreign money  which at its peak equalled 10% of the outstanding bonds. A third (34%) of Russian OFZ local treasury bills were owned by foreigners its peak about two years ago  but that has fallen to 17% now. From start to finish it took Paresishvilli three years to connect the GSE to Clearstream.The work has already begun  but Paresishvilli says it will take at least a year to complete  as the IT system has to be revamped and laws changed to introduce things like nominee accounts.The government is actively anticipating the change that revolutionised the Russian capital market in 2014 and Ukraine when it joined in 2019  bringing in a fresh $20bn and $5bn of international capital to the local bond markets respectively.Odilbek Ishakov  Uzbekistan’s deputy Finance Minister  told bne IntelliNews that Uzbekistan has already issued $1bn worth of local treasury bonds this year as well as issuing its first “floater”  a bond linked to the inflation rate  and a local bond with a 10-year maturity – the longest ever – in just the last month.And in June Uzbekistan saw its first corporate bond issue on the local exchange by the white goods manufacturer Artel in a landmark deal.The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) also bought some Uzbek treasury bills in the first week of November in a landmark deal – the first foreign entity to buy a local bond and the development bank’s first investment into local securities.“The government of Uzbekistan is now starting to bring large state owned companies and banks to a local market by privatizing them through IPOs on the Tashkent Stock Exchange ” says Paresishvili. “But the liquidity on the local stock market is pretty low as we are still very much a Frontier Market.” “The development of equity market allows local corporates to deleverage by raising additional equity” Paresishvili says. “That in turn enables Uzbek banks to lend more to local companies which helps grow economy and create new jobs.”Capital markets reformsHiring Paresishvilli to run the TSE is designed to take Uzbekistan’s capital market reforms to the next level but the government has already been working on improving them since October 2019 when Uzbek president Shavkat Mirziyoyev held a meeting with several ministers and public agencies  including the Capital Markets Development Agency  where he directed them to “consolidate all relevant laws  acts and decrees into single  simple and flexible capital markets code by the end of 2020” putting capital markets reform at the top of the agenda.That was followed by another decree in April 2021 that spelled out more details of the reforms  including an upgrade of the IT system and allowing international investors to sell their shares and repatriate their earnings in hard currency for the first time. International fund AFC Capital  which had a few million dollars invested into Uzbek equity at the time  and more now  tested the system and reported that it works.The edict comes with ambitious targets that are set until the year 2023:Source: president of the Republic of Uzbekistan“The development of the equity market will allow local corporates to deleverage by offering them an alternative source of capital as they are now highly leveraged ” Paresishvilli says. “That affects the banks too as they are not so willing to lend to corporates forever.”Paresishvilli has a long shopping list of reforms that still need to be made. The local CSD needs an upgrade as almost as important as allowing foreigners to buy shares is having decent infrastructure for holding them once you own them  Paresishvilli says.“Buying shares is only half the bargain; you also need somewhere to hold the stocks once you own them. Bringing partners like Bank of New York Mellon (BONY) will help as they can also give access to many new markets ” Paresishvilli tells bne IntelliNews. “The TSE IT system also needs an upgrade  the same thing we did with the GSE.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.85,0.14,0.01,True,English,"['Tashkent Stock Exchange', 'Giorgi Paresishvili', 'INTERVIEW', 'chairman', 'international investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston', 'Russian OFZ local treasury bills', 'Uzbek president Shavkat Mirziyoyev', 'large state owned companies', 'first corporate bond issue', 'international standard capital market', 'Uzbek treasury bills', 'Russian capital market', 'Former Soviet Union', 'domestic pension funds', 'Uzbek Economic Forum', 'Societe Generale Group', 'white goods manufacturer', 'first foreign entity', 'other regional markets', 'central securities depository', 'Georgian Stock Exchange', 'international capital markets', 'regional capital markets', 'Uzbek capital markets', 'Capital markets reforms', 'international financial system', 'domestic capital market', 'capital market reforms', 'local treasury bonds', 'local stock market', 'Tashkent Stock Exchange', 'foreign portfolio investors', 'The European Bank', 'new foreign money', 'local securities market', 'local bond markets', 'deputy Finance Minister', 'first investment', 'investment opportunities', 'international investors', 'local market', 'Tashkent Exchange', 'first thing', 'first “floater', 'first week', 'foreign investors', 'local exchange', 'international settlement', 'local companies', 'Frontier Market', 'equity market', 'largest bank', 'Bank Republic', 'local corporates', 'clearing system', 'IT system', 'Uzbek banks', 'New York', 'new pool', 'new jobs', 'Ben Aris', 'supervisory board', 'progressive country', 'trading desks', 'same thing', 'exclusive interview', 'The Ministry', 'same time', 'Saudi Arabia', 'outstanding bonds', 'a year', 'nominee accounts', 'fresh $20bn', 'Odilbek Ishakov', '$1bn worth', 'inflation rate', '10-year maturity', 'last month', 'landmark deal', 'additional equity', 'next level', 'several ministers', 'public agencies', 'development bank', 'reform programme', 'Clearstream revolution', 'Clearstream headquarters', 'George Paresishvili', 'Giorgi Paresishvilli', 'native Georgia', 'bne IntelliNews', 'Samarakand', 'CEO', 'GSE', 'chairman', 'CSD', 'January', 'Caucasus', 'lead', 'FSU', 'peers', 'stocks', 'London', 'access', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'things', 'Spring', 'sidelines', 'Samarkand', 'start', 'November', 'someone', 'experience', 'CSFB', 'part', 'TSE', 'September', 'Luxembourg', 'company', 'operations', 'link', 'Armenia', 'Kazakhstan', 'Ukraine', 'Serbia', 'Kingdom', 'peak', 'foreigners', 'work', 'laws', 'government', '$5bn', 'June', 'Artel', 'Reconstruction', 'EBRD', 'IPOs', 'liquidity', 'turn', 'economy', 'October', 'meeting']",2022-11-10,2022-11-10,msn.com

We’ve bolstered our cash runway with an asset purchase agreement for our manufacturing business unit and we believe we are well-positioned to unleash the power of our IP estate and potentially redefine the cell therapy space "" said Michel Lussier  interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company.Recent HighlightsThe Company entered into a €6 million asset purchase agreement with Cellistic whereby Cellistic acquired Celyad Oncology’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade cell therapy manufacturing facilityBased on a strategic  financial and medical review  taking into account the costs associated with the pursuit of the program and the delays to reach key medical milestones following the resolution of the previously announced clinical hold  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of CYAD-101Update on Business Model and Research ProgramsAs previously announced  with Celyad 2.0  Celyad Oncology is implementing a strategic shift from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and the monetization of its IP estate through partnerships  collaborations and license agreements. The Company intends to focus its R&D efforts on areas of expertise where it believes it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platform technology and continue to bolster its IP estate.Story continuesThe Company possesses key technology and controls IP which covers the potential development of next-generation therapies  including those using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and T cell receptor Inhibitor Molecule (TIM). Celyad Oncology has expanded the IP estate in-licensed from Dartmouth College with additional patents to broadly cover aspects of allogeneic cell therapy. Current discovery programs have the potential to create additional independent IP. The Company is developing a potential next-generation NKG2D Type I receptor CAR T candidate and a technology to potentially utilize this receptor as a basis for dual CAR technology. The Company is also considering the potential to focus R&D efforts on either B7-H6 CAR T or bispecific antibody candidates for a powerful new antigenic target in the oncology field.In addition  the Company is seeking to advance its shRNA platform through multiplexing technology that allows it to modulate multiple genes simultaneously. This technology is potentially complementary to the Company’s All-in-One Vector approach  which allows for the expression of multiple shRNAs in a single construct within a single transduction step. Combining multiplexed shRNAs with CARs and additional genes of choice provides potential for broad therapeutic functionality.Update on Clinical ProgramsCYAD-211 – Allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for r/r MMThe dose-escalation Phase 1 IMMUNICY-1 trial is evaluating the tolerability and clinical activity of a single infusion of CYAD-211 following preconditioning with CyFlu (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) in patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM). CYAD-211 was developed to demonstrate potential proof of concept of shRNA technology in the clinic. Our other clinical studies of shRNA disclosed to date have demonstrated encouraging safety and bioactivity signals  and its use as a technology to avoid Graft-versus-Host disease of allogeneic CAR Ts could be a viable approach Clinical updates are expected by year endThird Quarter 2022 Financial ReviewAs of September 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €13.4 million ($13.1 million). Net cash burn during the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €1.0 million ($1.0 million)  in line with expectations. The Company confirms its previous guidance that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements up to mid-2023. This guidance does not include any potential proceeds from the equity purchase agreement established with Lincoln Park Capital Fund  LLC.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2022 and 2023 which reflect the current strategy of the Company and include expenses and cash outflows estimations in relation to the development of discretionary research programs and pipeline of products candidates  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that the release is issued.About Celyad Oncology SACelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the research and discovery of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapies for cancer.

(Euronext Paris : FR0000120388 - RX) (the ""Company"") announces that on November 9  2022  the Paris Commercial Court has ordered the conversion of the Company's reorganization proceedings  initiated by judgment of May 5  2022 1   into liquidation proceedings.This conversion follows the Paris Commercial Court's decision on July 6  2022 2 to approve a plan for the partial sale of Recylex SA as part of a ""pre-pack sale"" process to the Belgian company Campine NV.As a reminder  the partial disposal plan concerned the lead and polypropylene recycling activities at the Company's Escaudoeuvres (Nord) and Villefranche-sur-Saône (Rhône) sites  all the jobs associated with these sites and Recylex SA's interest in C2P SAS  which is wholly owned by the Company  for a total disposal price of approximately € 4 million.Campine has been managing the assets and activities included in the scope of the sale since July 7  2022. The resulting deeds of sale are in the process of being regularized.As a result of this partial disposal  Recylex S.A.'s business was reduced to a holding company activity consisting of the management of significant financial and environmental liabilities and a 50% stake in Recytech S.A.  which stake is subject to several pledges 3 .Recylex S.A. was placed in reorganization proceedings in order to study a legal solution for restructuring its debt. On July 13  2022  the Paris Commercial Court ordered the continuation of the Company's observation period until its expiry on November 5  2022.This being the case  it appeared that Recylex S.A. was no longer generating any revenues of its own  its only income consisting of dividends from Recytech S.A.Recylex S.A.'s judicial administrators considered that the company was clearly unable to draw up a recovery plan that would enable it to meet its liabilities  and referred the matter to the Paris Commercial Court for the purpose of converting the reorganization into a judicial liquidation.Story continuesAs a result  the Paris Commercial Court has taken the decision described in this press release to convert the reorganization proceedings into a judicial liquidation.In its conversion judgment  the Paris Commercial Court has in particular:terminated the observation period of the reorganization proceedings ; terminated the mission of the judicial administrators  SCP Abitbol & Rousselet  in the person of Frédéric Abitbol  and SELARL 2M & Associés  in the person of Carole Martinez ; appointed SCP Canet  in the person of Maître Patrick Canet  and SELAFA MJA  in the person of Maître Charles-Axel Chuine  as judicial liquidators ; and set at two years the period at the end of which the closure of these judicial liquidation proceedings must be examined.The parties to the judgment are thus invited to attend the next hearing set for November 7  2024.***1 See press releases of April 15  May 6 and June 15  20222 See press releases of June 15  July 1 and July 6  20223 See press release of April 15  2022 - As a reminder  the first and second rank pledges cover certain financial commitments of the Company or its former German subsidiaries to Glencore International AG  which are detailed in Note 30 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2020***Disclaimer : This press release is a non-official translation into English of the press release of the same date issued in French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (S…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today reported that a new study by scientists at .NeuroRestore  ONWARD’s research partner  has identified the specific neurons that are activated and remodeled by spinal cord stimulation  enabling individuals with spinal cord injury to stand  walk and rebuild their muscles. This discovery marks a fundamental  scientific breakthrough. The study was published yesterday in Nature.In the multi-year STIMO study  coordinated by .NeuroRestore’s co-directors – Grégoire Courtine  a neuroscience professor at EPFL and Chief Scientific Officer of ONWARD  and Jocelyne Bloch  a neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) – participants with paralysis due to spinal cord injury underwent targeted epidural electrical stimulation of the area of the spinal cord that controls leg movement. Remarkably  all participants regained motor function and the ability to walk. Three participants in the study pioneered use of an innovative lead developed by ONWARD to specifically target the areas of the spinal cord involved in leg and lower trunk movement with the intent to facilitate faster and more effective recovery of motor function.The scientists believe it is crucial to understand exactly how neuronal reorganization occurs to develop more effective treatments and improve the lives of as many people as possible. The press release by EPFL can be found here.“The findings published yesterday continue to build our strong knowledge base in spinal cord stimulation to help people with paralysis. As a result of this study and its accompanying scientific breakthrough  ONWARD and its research partners have learned precisely where to place the epidural lead and how to program stimulation to facilitate walking ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “This important work is enabling us to develop a therapy for people with spinal cord injury that aims to be precise  repeatable  and scalable.”About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries.

This was mainly driven by the strong growth rate of 20.0% y/y in recurring digital revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and licence business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordic countries  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing growth rates accelerating.The project and licence business  which is non-recurring  contributed €5.2 million (9M 2021: €6.6m). Because of the guidelines around digital invoicing that are being introduced in more and more European countries  there is an increasing demand from governments for a portal that enables the continuous real-time monitoring of each invoice. This will have a positive impact on the growth that Unifiedpost is pursuing. As indicated with our H1 2022 results  Unifiedpost expects to generate more project and licence revenue by the end of the year as the Company is expected to benefit from significant projects billed in Q4 2022.96.2% of the total group revenue results from recurring services  in line with Q2 2022.Sound growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessGroup revenue was also supported by robust growth in postage and parcel optimisation services  + 8.5% y/y in 9M 2022 to €47.1 million. Unifiedpost sees its postage and parcel optimisation business having an excellent 9M 2022. The increase in the top-line was caused by the onboarding of large new customers in combination with general price increases.Customer base grew strongly with improved momentumUnifiedpost grew its customer base further reaching a new record of 986 971 customers at the end of September (+24.5% compared to YE 2021). The consolidated business network expanded to just above 2 million companies by the end of Q3 2022  representing an estimated 8% of businesses in Europe.The total number of Banqup customers more than doubled since the beginning of FY 2021: from 35 408 YE 2021 to 80 420 at the end of Q3 2022. Banqup is Unifiedpost’s core SME-product allowing customers to create and send sales invoices  keep an overview of all (financial) documents and manage administration. The platform also offers a unique  inhouse developed payment functionality. The customer growth over the last three months includes migration effects from legacy platforms. Adjusting for such migrated users  the number of Banqup users increased by 14 654 in the first nine months of 2022.Within the French market  Unifiedpost sees the number of JeFacture customers increase steadily. The Unifiedpost management expects the growth rate of its customers in the French market to accelerate in the coming periods.The overall average revenue per unit (ARPU) in digital processing business1 reached €21.7. The decline in ARPU compared to FY2021 (€27.9) is predominantly due to two effects. The first one is a negative effect from the last quarter as that includes the licence revenue resulting from the project with the Serbian Government. The second one results from the significantly higher and increasing revenue contribution from Unifiedpost’s SME business with a structurally lower ARPU.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023Due to the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has made the target to become cash flow positive its predominant priority. The target remains to be cash flow positive for H2 2023. <End>Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

(Euronext Paris : FR0000120388 - RX) (the ""Company"") announces that on November 9  2022  the Paris Commercial Court has ordered the conversion of the Company's reorganization proceedings  initiated by judgment of May 5  2022 1   into liquidation proceedings.This conversion follows the Paris Commercial Court's decision on July 6  2022 2 to approve a plan for the partial sale of Recylex SA as part of a ""pre-pack sale"" process to the Belgian company Campine NV.As a reminder  the partial disposal plan concerned the lead and polypropylene recycling activities at the Company's Escaudoeuvres (Nord) and Villefranche-sur-Saône (Rhône) sites  all the jobs associated with these sites and Recylex SA's interest in C2P SAS  which is wholly owned by the Company  for a total disposal price of approximately € 4 million.Campine has been managing the assets and activities included in the scope of the sale since July 7  2022. The resulting deeds of sale are in the process of being regularized.As a result of this partial disposal  Recylex S.A.'s business was reduced to a holding company activity consisting of the management of significant financial and environmental liabilities and a 50% stake in Recytech S.A.  which stake is subject to several pledges 3 .Recylex S.A. was placed in reorganization proceedings in order to study a legal solution for restructuring its debt. On July 13  2022  the Paris Commercial Court ordered the continuation of the Company's observation period until its expiry on November 5  2022.This being the case  it appeared that Recylex S.A. was no longer generating any revenues of its own  its only income consisting of dividends from Recytech S.A.Recylex S.A.'s judicial administrators considered that the company was clearly unable to draw up a recovery plan that would enable it to meet its liabilities  and referred the matter to the Paris Commercial Court for the purpose of converting the reorganization into a judicial liquidation.As a result  the Paris Commercial Court has taken the decision described in this press release to convert the reorganization proceedings into a judicial liquidation.In its conversion judgment  the Paris Commercial Court has in particular:terminated the observation period of the reorganization proceedings ; terminated the mission of the judicial administrators  SCP Abitbol & Rousselet  in the person of Frédéric Abitbol  and SELARL 2M & Associés  in the person of Carole Martinez ; appointed SCP Canet  in the person of Maître Patrick Canet  and SELAFA MJA  in the person of Maître Charles-Axel Chuine  as judicial liquidators ; and set at two years the period at the end of which the closure of these judicial liquidation proceedings must be examined.The parties to the judgment are thus invited to attend the next hearing set for November 7  2024.***1 See press releases of April 15  May 6 and June 15  20222 See press releases of June 15  July 1 and July 6  20223 See press release of April 15  2022 - As a reminder  the first and second rank pledges cover certain financial commitments of the Company or its former German subsidiaries to Glencore International AG  which are detailed in Note 30 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2020***Disclaimer : This press release is a non-official translation into English of the press release of the same date issued in French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users.

We’ve bolstered our cash runway with an asset purchase agreement for our manufacturing business unit and we believe we are well-positioned to unleash the power of our IP estate and potentially redefine the cell therapy space ” said Michel Lussier  interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company.Recent HighlightsThe Company entered into a €6 million asset purchase agreement with Cellistic whereby Cellistic acquired Celyad Oncology’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade cell therapy manufacturing facilityBased on a strategic  financial and medical review  taking into account the costs associated with the pursuit of the program and the delays to reach key medical milestones following the resolution of the previously announced clinical hold  the Company has decided to discontinue the development of CYAD-101Update on Business Model and Research ProgramsAs previously announced  with Celyad 2.0  Celyad Oncology is implementing a strategic shift from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and the monetization of its IP estate through partnerships  collaborations and license agreements. The Company intends to focus its R&D efforts on areas of expertise where it believes it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platform technology and continue to bolster its IP estate.Story continuesThe Company possesses key technology and controls IP which covers the potential development of next-generation therapies  including those using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and T cell receptor Inhibitor Molecule (TIM). Celyad Oncology has expanded the IP estate in-licensed from Dartmouth College with additional patents to broadly cover aspects of allogeneic cell therapy. Current discovery programs have the potential to create additional independent IP. The Company is developing a potential next-generation NKG2D Type I receptor CAR T candidate and a technology to potentially utilize this receptor as a basis for dual CAR technology. The Company is also considering the potential to focus R&D efforts on either B7-H6 CAR T or bispecific antibody candidates for a powerful new antigenic target in the oncology field.In addition  the Company is seeking to advance its shRNA platform through multiplexing technology that allows it to modulate multiple genes simultaneously. This technology is potentially complementary to the Company’s All-in-One Vector approach  which allows for the expression of multiple shRNAs in a single construct within a single transduction step. Combining multiplexed shRNAs with CARs and additional genes of choice provides potential for broad therapeutic functionality.Update on Clinical ProgramsCYAD-211 – Allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for r/r MMThe dose-escalation Phase 1 IMMUNICY-1 trial is evaluating the tolerability and clinical activity of a single infusion of CYAD-211 following preconditioning with CyFlu (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) in patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM). CYAD-211 was developed to demonstrate potential proof of concept of shRNA technology in the clinic. Our other clinical studies of shRNA disclosed to date have demonstrated encouraging safety and bioactivity signals  and its use as a technology to avoid Graft-versus-Host disease of allogeneic CAR Ts could be a viable approach Clinical updates are expected by year endThird Quarter 2022 Financial ReviewAs of September 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €13.4 million ($13.1 million). Net cash burn during the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €1.0 million ($1.0 million)  in line with expectations. The Company confirms its previous guidance that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements up to mid-2023. This guidance does not include any potential proceeds from the equity purchase agreement established with Lincoln Park Capital Fund  LLC.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2022 and 2023 which reflect the current strategy of the Company and include expenses and cash outflows estimations in relation to the development of discretionary research programs and pipeline of products candidates  the Company continues to project that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that the release is issued.About Celyad Oncology SACelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on the research and discovery of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapies for cancer.

The quality of the solutions we provide to farmers is a key asset underpinning the resilience of our model. Our food supplement products for livestock in particular helped farmers to deal with the drought during the summer  which reduced the amount of fodder available. Today  the breadth of our ranges and their availability in a context where most other players have been faced with shortages are key factors in structuring a lasting relationship with our customers.”At 30 September 2022  consolidated revenue rose by 19% to €95.4m  representing organic growth of 9% excluding the integration of the Kabelis companies acquired in July 2022. This level of activity at 30 September 2022 represents 88% of the revenue generated in full-year 2021  confirming positive sales momentum in the third quarter  after a successful first half of the year.Consolidated Q3 2022 revenue came to €33.9m  up 20% versus Q3 2021. In organic terms  revenue grew by a strong 13%. WINFARM benefited over the quarter from strong momentum across the board  with all of its businesses recording double-digit growth over the period.Story continuesThe Farming Supplies business (88% of revenue for the quarter)  whose products are marketed under the Vital Concept brand  made revenue of €29.8m  up 19% compared with Q3 2021 (+11% organic). This performance is all the more remarkable given the demanding environment caused by persistent inflation in raw material prices  even if it has eased in recent months. In order to minimise the impact on its business  WINFARM anticipated this price pressure at an early stage by building stocks in certain items and successfully passing on purchase price increases over the months without losing customers.The Farming Nutrition business (10% of revenue for the quarter)  whose products are marketed under the Alphatech brand  made revenue of €3.5m  representing sharp organic growth of 29%. The performance of export solutions continued to drive the Group's results.ACQUISITION OF KABELIS IN FRANCEDuring Q3  WINFARM announced the acquisition of the KABELIS companies specialised in landscaping and green space development  creating a French champion on this market and the largest player in the Grand Ouest region.Founded in 2007  KABELIS specialised in fertilisers  seeds  services for local authorities  horticulture  golf courses  sports grounds  etc. and became the leading French player in landscaping and green space development.This second acquisition since the IPO  after that of BTN de Haas in the Netherlands in 2021  sees WINFARM forge ahead with the implementation of the roadmap it announced during its IPO at the end of 2020  combining organic growth and acquisitions to become a key player in the upstream agriculture sector in Europe.CONTINUED GROWTH EXPECTED IN Q4 2022Having demonstrated its ability to continue generating strong business growth during the first nine months of the year  despite a demanding environment  by offering customers solutions that contribute to operational performance and competitiveness  WINFARM is confident that it will continue to grow in Q4 2022.In the longer term  the Group reiterates its revenue target for 2025 of around €200m and an EBITDA margin of around 6.5%. It expects to achieve half of this acceleration in growth through organic growth and half through external growth.About WINFARMFounded in Loudéac  in the heart of Brittany  in the early 1990s  WINFARM is now the French leader in distance selling for the agricultural world.

This approach does not create DNA double strand breaks as does CRISPR/Cas9  or other engineered nucleases  and is a promising therapeutic strategy for genetic diseases. A key aspect to broaden the scope of possible applications is our comprehension of design rules.Cellectis used a screening approach to gain in-depth insights into the editing rules driving TALE-BE activity and applied this knowledge to design highly efficient TALE-BE compatible with potential therapeutic application. Moreover  TALE-BE show insignificant levels of by-products such as indels.Cellectis scientists combined two molecular tools  a TALEN® and a TALE-BE  to perform a double gene Knock Out (KO) of TRAC and CD52  a combination of target genes used for allogeneic CAR T-cell adoptive therapies. This combination of molecular tools paves the way to simultaneous multiplex gene engineering with more controllable outcomes.“A multiplex/multitool strategy presents several advantages: firstly  it prevents the creation of translocations often observed with the simultaneous use of several nucleases. Secondly  it allows for the possibility of going beyond multiple knock-outs while still allowing gene knock-in at the nuclease target site  altogether extending the scope of possible application ” said Alex Juillerat  Ph.D.  Vice President Gene Editing & New York Lab Head at Cellectis. “The precise positional rules we have determined for TALE-BE will allow Cellectis to unleash the full potential of these technologies for future applications.”Research data showed that:Employing a medium/high throughput strategy  Cellectis gained in-depth insight of the editing rules in cellulo  while excluding confounding factors.Designed TALE-BE targeting CD52 achieved very high frequency of gene knock-out (up to 80% of phenotypic CD52 knock out).When TALE-BE was combined with a TALEN® targeting the TRAC locus  very high frequency of double gene knock-out (up to 75% of phenotypic double gene knock-out) was achieved without the creation of translocations between the two targeted loci.This article is available on Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology website by clicking on this link.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The negative currency impact over the period was less significant than in the first half of the financial year  at -€7.7m  including -€20.3m on the Turkish lira. In a still difficult market context  the group has confirmed the gradual recovery in its activity  but it is still down -3.3% compared to the third quarter of 2019  before the health crisis.In the first nine months of the financial year  AKWEL’s turnover increased by +10.2% when taking exchange rates and scope as constants.ANALYSIS OF THE BREAKDOWN OF REVENUEThe geographical breakdown of revenue at 30 September by production zone was as follows:France: €201.8m (+5.0%)Europe (excluding France) and Africa: €201.6m (-0.6%)North America: €224.8m (+28.7%)Asia and the Middle East (including Turkey): €106.7m (+9.0%)South America: €4.3m (-20.4%)Over the first nine months  turnover from Products and Functions increased by 6.2% to €714.4m  and all product lines reported growth  with performance particularly driven by Cooling (+13.4%)  Washing (+8.5%) and Air (+6.9%). Turnover for Tooling meanwhile was €15.4m over the period.NET CASH POSITION OF €112.6mFree cash-flow generation was €6.6m in the third quarter  giving the group €112.6m in net cash (excluding debt on rental obligations)  an increase of €14.3m over the first nine months of the financial year.ANNUAL OUTLOOKBased on the performance recorded in the third quarter  AKWEL confirms its expectation of moderate growth in turnover for the whole of the 2022 financial year. Regarding profitability  the ongoing supply difficulties and inflation recorded across all operating costs  which is difficult to pass on in the short term  will  as announced  lead to a significant fall in the group’s annual current operating income.Next press release: 2022 annual revenue  9 February 2023  after the markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles.

I am encouraged by the early data we have reported on NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 both for patients naïve to prior anti-PD-1 therapy and for those whose cancer was resistant to anti-PD-1 and look forward to further evaluation of the radioenhancer for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cancers.”Story continuesNBTXR3 Activated By Radiotherapy In Combination With Nivolumab Or Pembrolizumab In Patients With Advanced Cancers: Results From An Ongoing Dose Escalation Phase I Trial — Abstract #684Summary of Updated DataReported data included 28 patients  with 21 evaluable for early signs of efficacy at the data cutoff on 22 August 2022. Treatment remained feasible and well-tolerated  with a safety profile consistent with expectations from stereotactic body radiation therapy (“SBRT”; “RT”) followed by anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.Objective reduction from baseline in target lesions (“objective reduction”) was observed in 71.43% of evaluable patients (15/21). 42.86% of evaluable patients (9/21) showed objective reduction greater than 30%. 71.43% of evaluable patients (15/21) had cancer resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure and tumor regression was observed in 66.66% of these patients (10/15).As of the data cutoff  systemic disease control was durable and had sustained for more than 6 months in 38.10% of evaluable patients (8/21). Delayed objective reduction has been observed in several patients  suggesting the potential for anti-cancer immune activity over time.The recommended phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) of RT-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1 was established at 33% of gross tumor volume in all 3 cohorts at the completion of the Study 1100 dose escalation part. The dose expansion part of the study is ongoing in the United States (“US”)  with a protocol amended for robust evaluation of RT-activated NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in patients with locoregional recurrent (“LRR”) or recurrent and/or metastatic (“R/M”) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”) that is either naïve or resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure.The Company plans to submit a registrational phase 3 protocol for the evaluation of RT-activated NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC resistant to anti-PD-1 to the US Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter of 2023.Conference Call InformationThe updated data to be presented at SITC will be discussed during a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  November 10  2022  at 8:00 AM ET / 2:00 PM CET.The live webcast of the call may be accessed by visiting the investors section of the company’s website at www.nanobiotix.com.

The complete dose escalation part included three cohorts: (i) locoregional recurrent (LRR) or R/M HNSCC amenable to reirradiation of the head and neck; (ii) lung metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1; (iii) liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1. Patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 prior to their first session of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Patients were treated with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) or nivolumab (Opdivo®) after completion of SBRT. A recommended phase 2 dose for all three cohorts was established at 33% of gross tumor volume.The dose expansion part of Study 1100 is now ongoing with a protocol amended for robust evaluation of NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC that is either naïve to prior anti-PD-1 exposure or resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure. The protocol includes three amended cohorts: (i) LRR or R/M HNSCC amenable to reirradiation that is resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure; (ii) LRR or R/M HNSCC amenable to reirradiation that is naïve to prior anti-PD-1 exposure; and (iii) non-small cell lung cancer  malignant melanoma  hepatocellular carcinoma  renal cell carcinoma  urothelial cancer  cervical cancer  triple-negative breast cancer that has metastasized to soft tissues  lung metastases  or liver metastases that is resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC  or lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Benefits from expense savings  growth initiatives  and an improvement in claims experience are more than offset by lower fees due to adverse marketsThe capital ratios of all three main units remain above their respective operating levels. Group Solvency II ratio amounts to 212%Cash Capital at Holding decreases to EUR 1 368 million  reflecting EUR 273 million dividends paid and second EUR 100 million tranche of previously announced EUR 300 million share buybackTransamerica Life Bermuda (TLB)  Aegon’s high-net-worth business  reinsured a closed life insurance portfolio with Transamerica in October. This frees up surplus capital and strengthens Transamerica’s capital positionAegon takes action to substantially reduce the capital sensitivity of its US variable annuity portfolio to equity markets and further increase the predictability of free cash flows; a third-party transaction will not be pursued in the near-termStatement of Lard Friese  CEO“In recent months  we have made great strides in the transformation of Aegon and the acceleration of our strategy. We have made substantial progress on our operational improvement plan  and have taken additional actions to maximize the value of both our US variable annuity book and TLB  Aegon’s high-net-worth insurance business. Most recently  we announced a transaction with a.s.r. in the Netherlands to create a leading Dutch insurance company.In the third quarter  our operating result declined by 11% on a constant currency basis as adverse market conditions more than offset an improvement in claims experience in the United States  expense savings and the benefit from growth initiatives. Despite inflationary headwinds  we made considerable progress with our expense savings program. We achieved additional EUR 50 million expense savings compared with last quarter  increasing the reduction in our annual addressable expenses to EUR 300 million compared with the base year 2019. The growth initiatives  aimed at improving our customer service and expanding our distribution network  positively impacted our commercial and financial results.Story continuesWe also made solid progress on our ambition to grow our strategic assets  despite continued financial market volatility and political unrest. Life insurance sales were up 24% in the United States and 16% in our Growth Markets  supported by our growing distribution capabilities. The retirement businesses across the United States  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom all reported growth in net deposits  reflecting the strength of the labor market. Commercial results in Asset Management  the UK Retail business and our US mutual fund platform were under pressure as a result of our customers’ reduced propensity to invest in the current uncertain environment.We continue to take actions to maximize the value of our financial assets. Based on extensive analysis  we have concluded that the best option with respect to the US variable annuity portfolio is to continue to own and actively manage it  at least in the near term. In October  we finalized an internal reinsurance transaction between TLB and Transamerica that freed up USD 600 million in excess capital for Transamerica. Part of this will be used to create a buffer that will substantially reduce the capital sensitivity of our US variable annuity book to equity markets.The recent action we have taken to combine our Dutch pension  life and non-life insurance  banking  and mortgage origination activities with those of a.s.r.  is pivotal to the transformation of our company and reflects our goal to build advantaged businesses in our chosen markets. The transaction enables us to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders and is in line with our strategy to release capital from mature businesses  and create leading positions in markets where Aegon is well positioned for growth.I appreciate the hard work and dedication of all our colleagues to support our customers’ needs in challenging times. Thanks to the efforts of our employees  we are able to continue to improve our operational performance and accelerate our strategy. While economic volatility will likely persist  our strong balance sheet  disciplined risk management  and focused strategy make me confident about the opportunities the future will bring.”Note: All comparisons in this release are against 3Q 2021  unless stated otherwise.

More information can be found at aegon.com.Cautionary note regarding non-EU-IFRS measuresThis document includes the following non-EU-IFRS financial measures: operating result  income tax  result before tax  market consistent value of new business  return on equity and addressable expenses. These non-EU-IFRS measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies. The reconciliation of these measures  except for market consistent value of new business and return on equity  to the most comparable EU-IFRS measure is provided in the notes to this press release. Market consistent value of new business is not based on EU-IFRS  which are used to report Aegon’s primary financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for EU-IFRS financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-EU-IFRS measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity excluding the revaluation reserve. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions) after reallocation of claim handling expenses to benefits paid. This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are expenses reflected in the operating result  excluding deferrable acquisition expenses  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to operations in CEE countries. Aegon believes that these non-EU-IFRS measures  together with the EU-IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon’s results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon’s primary financial statements.Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

13029,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/will-ramsay-sell-its-french-assets-20221108-p5bwkp,Ramsay Health Care will update the market Friday - but will he keep French assets? - The Australian Financial Review,Ramsay Health Care will update the market Friday - but will he keep French assets?  The Australian Financial Review,Talks dragged out for more than 12 months. While Ramsay’s key shareholder  The Paul Ramsay Foundation  was keen to get a deal done  talks fell over on September 26.Ramsay’s share price has since cratered to just $59.26 each.Schroder Investment Management portfolio manager Ray David said in a note that Ramsay’s property portfolio is what attracted KKR to the company  which is the heart of Ramsay’s competitive advantage.Ramsay owns 47 freehold hospital sites out of 70 sites in Australia  including Hollywood Private Hospital (WA) and Greenslopes Private Hospital (QLD). Freehold beds reach about 6700  which has allowed Ramsay to deliver more than 10 per cent return on assets from brownfield expansion.Mr David said this network can’t be replicated today for a commercial return.Rival Healthscope’s public-private Northern Beaches Hospital was the first greenfield site in Sydney in over 20 years and came at a construction cost of $600 million  or about $1.3 million per bed  excluding the land. Healthscope is owned by Brookfield.AdvertisementApplying those metrics to Ramsay’s freehold portfolio would imply a replacement cost of $8.6 billion  excluding land  he said.“Recent government hospital expansion programs imply an even higher replacement cost of over $1.8 million to $2.8 million per bed ” Mr David said.Overseas  Ramsay’s $1.9 billion expansion into France led to a part ownership at 52.5 per cent of Ramsay Generale de Sante  which is listed on the Euronext with a market value of $3.2 billion.In 2010  Ramsay first entered France buying a 57 per cent interest in Group Proclif SAS in the greater Paris region. It became Ramsay Sante  and grew over time by aquisition including the 2018 buy of Capio AB  a Scandinavian private health care operator.While Sante has a formidable position in France  with 21 per cent of the private sector  the industry is heavily regulated with the government setting tariff rates. Its operating margins before COVID-19 struck were already under pressure.A big hurdle in any deal with the KKR was the inability to conduct due diligence on Sante  with its board reluctant to provide access given KKR owns a major stake in its main rival Elsan  which has about the same size market share in France.AdvertisementMr David argues the divestment of Sante  or a restructure of ownership would simplify Ramsay’s accounts  lifting returns  and reducing gearing. Sante is carrying $2.5 billion of debt  compared to Ramsay Australia/UK of $2.3 billion.“Obfuscating the attractive returns from the Australian business is the complex holding structure of the European assets  which if resolved  could redraw investors’ attention back to the attractive growth and return profile of the Australian private hospital network ” he said.While Ramsay’s Australian operations are still suffering from the omicron wave estimated $40 million impact in first quarter 2023  with restrictions removed  elective surgery volumes should start to bounce back from the second half.“As volumes return  profit margins should improve ” Mr David said.Also working in Ramsay’s favour is a new three-year deal it signed with health insurance giant Bupa in August which seemed to have more favourable terms. Health insurers have gained significantly through COVID-19 amid fewer claims by customers.Mr David added that Ramsay should also benefit from the government looking to accelerate visa processing for international skilled labour  especially healthcare workers.Between the lack of immigration and nurse burnout  Ramsay has been forced to use more expensive agency staff over the past two years.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.28,0.08,0.64,True,English,"['The Australian Financial Review', 'Ramsay Health Care', 'French assets', 'market', 'Schroder Investment Management portfolio manager', 'Scandinavian private health care operator', 'Recent government hospital expansion programs', 'public-private Northern Beaches Hospital', 'same size market share', 'The Paul Ramsay Foundation', 'Australian private hospital network', 'Ramsay Generale de Sante', 'Hollywood Private Hospital', 'Greenslopes Private Hospital', 'health insurance giant', 'Group Proclif SAS', 'greater Paris region', 'complex holding structure', 'international skilled labour', 'expensive agency staff', 'first greenfield site', '47 freehold hospital sites', '57 per cent interest', 'elective surgery volumes', 'past two years', 'higher replacement cost', 'new three-year deal', '10 per cent return', 'private sector', 'freehold portfolio', 'Health insurers', 'share price', 'property portfolio', 'brownfield expansion', '$1.9 billion expansion', '52.5 per cent', 'market value', '21 per cent', 'Australian business', 'Australian operations', 'first quarter', 'Freehold beds', 'construction cost', 'key shareholder', 'Ray David', 'competitive advantage', 'Mr David', 'commercial return', 'Capio AB', 'formidable position', 'tariff rates', 'operating margins', 'big hurdle', 'due diligence', 'major stake', 'main rival', 'investors’ attention', 'attractive growth', 'return profile', 'omicron wave', '$40 million impact', 'second half', 'profit margins', 'favourable terms', 'fewer claims', 'visa processing', 'healthcare workers', 'nurse burnout', 'Rival Healthscope', 'part ownership', 'attractive returns', 'European assets', 'Ramsay Australia', '70 sites', '20 years', 'Talks', '12 months', 'September', 'note', 'KKR', 'company', 'heart', 'QLD', 'Sydney', 'land', 'Brookfield', 'Advertisement', 'France', 'Euronext', 'time', '2018 buy', 'industry', 'COVID', 'pressure', 'inability', 'board', 'access', 'Elsan', 'divestment', 'restructure', 'accounts', 'gearing', 'debt', 'UK', 'restrictions', 'Bupa', 'August', 'customers', 'lack', 'immigration']",2022-11-08,2022-11-10,afr.com

Product sales of the Company’s travel vaccines are still expected to reach €70 million to €80 million despite supply challenges and COVID-19 product sales are expected to reach €30 million to €40 million. Other Revenues are expected to reach approximately €240 million. They will be mainly related to COVID-19 revenue recognition in relation to the UK and EC APAs and will have no impact on cash. Other Revenues not related to COVID-19 will be negative in 2022 due to the increased refund liability resulting from the amendment of the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer.Given phasing of clinical trial expenses and accelerated wind-down of VLA2001 related activities  Valneva now expects lower R&D expenses of €95 million to €110 million compared to the €120 million to €135 million previously communicated. The Company remains committed to advancing its late-stage vaccine candidates and to further expanding its R&D pipeline  including  but not limited to  through the advancement of some of the Company’s pre-clinical candidates towards clinical entry.As part of the communicated reshape strategy  Valneva is in the process of re-sizing its operations which is expected to result in a reduction of approximately 20% to 25% of its existing workforce. Post restructuring  the Company’s total workforce is expected to be approximately 25% above pre-COVID levels enabling the Company to retain key talents and additional expertise to successfully execute on its strategy. This re-sizing and re-focusing is expected to result in annualized savings of approximately €12 million.Story continuesFinancial Information(unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS)€ in million Nine months ending September 30 2022 2021 Total revenues 249.9 69.8 Product sales 74.4 45.5 Net loss (99.1) (245.9) Adjusted EBITDA loss (38.0) (227.6) Cash (at end of period) 261.0 247.9Saint-Herblain (France)  November 10  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported consolidated financial results for the first nine months of the year  ended September 30  2022. The condensed consolidated interim financial results are available on the Company’s website (Financial Reports – Valneva).Valneva will provide a live webcast of its nine months financial results conference call beginning at3 p.m. CET/9 a.m. EST today. This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/cay4shasThomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “Valneva is continuing to successfully execute on its key activities. Raising over €100 million in the current economic environment  attracting new investors  and maintaining support of our existing shareholders clearly underlines the value of the Company’s fundamentals  its R&D pipeline and our strategic ambitions. We will continue to fully pursue the Company’s strategic priorities  including advancing our chikungunya vaccine candidate towards marketing approval and launch  completing the Phase 3 trial of our Lyme disease vaccine candidate  progressing pre-clinical assets  and focusing on strengthening our clinical pipeline. The re-sizing of our operations will allow us to increase efficiency and focus on achieving our operational and strategic business objectives.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study initiatedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.Recruitment of approximately 6 000 participants five years of age and older for the Phase 3 clinical study “VALOR” (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists) is currently ongoing in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe3. Enrollment for the study  which investigates the efficacy  safety  and immunogenicity of VLA15  is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023. As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between the two companies  Valneva received a $25 million milestone payment from Pfizer in October following initiation of the Phase 3 study.Pending successful Phase 3 completion  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA154. In June 2022  the terms of this collaboration were updated  and Pfizer invested €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva as part of an Equity Subscription Agreement5.Valneva will continue to pay its 40% contribution to the Phase 3 activities over 2022 and 2023.If approved  Pfizer will commercialize VLA15 and Valneva will be eligible to receive substantial milestone and royalty payments.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553BLA rolling submission with U.S. FDA initiatedVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 120 countries with the potential to rapidly expand further. There are currently no preventive vaccines or effective treatments for the chikungunya virus available  and VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate that successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 studies6 7 and the first chikungunya vaccine candidate for which a regulatory filing process has been initiated with the U.S. FDA.Valneva initiated BLA rolling submission with the FDA for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above in August 20228. This BLA submission is part of the accelerated approval pathway agreed with the FDA in 20209 and follows final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 202210 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202211.Valneva expects to complete its BLA submission by the end of 2022. Once completed  and if the FDA accepts the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility along with the action due date upon which it will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in the first half of 2023.Valneva has presented and will continue to present clinical data for VLA1553 at high-profile medical and scientific congresses12. Recently  the Company highlighted additional immunological results from an expanded panel of serological samples from adults over 65 years of age who received VLA1553 at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) Annual Meeting. Similar to the pivotal data presented previously  the results from the expanded cohort continue to show that older adults generated similarly high seroresponse rates compared to younger adults in the pivotal Phase 3 study13. The Company is also expecting to report twelve-month antibody persistence data in late 2022.At the recent meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  Valneva presented an overview of VLA1553 safety and immunogenicity results and the chikungunya working group provided a preliminary review and timeline towards ACIP’s recommendation decision. Ahead of the anticipated February 2024 ACIP vote  the working group plans to present further on CHIKV traveler epidemiology and disease burden  a more comprehensive review of immunogenicity and safety data as part of its Grading of Recommendations  Assessment  Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment  and longer-term additional data in younger age groups.A clinical trial of VLA1553 in adolescents is also ongoing in Brazil14 for which topline results are expected in the first half of 2023. This trial may support future regulatory submissions and label extensions following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the U.S. This ongoing clinical trial conducted by Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesThe Company continues to progress select pre-clinical assets and focus on strengthening its future clinical pipeline. The Company is currently focused on two pre-clinical assets  VLA1554 and VLA2112. The hMPV candidate  VLA1554  is a pre-fusion recombinant protein subunit vaccine targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection in children and is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and in older adults. VLA1554 is currently in pre-clinical proof of concept studies. VLA2112 is a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  which is one of the most common human viruses and can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses. VLA2112 is currently in a late-stage evaluation phase.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the U.S.  Canada and Europe.In the first nine months of 2022  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €22.9 million compared to €33.7 million in the first nine months of 2021  as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the U.S. Department of Defense. This decrease was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €19.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €4.6 million in the first nine months of 2021.CHOLERA / ETEC15-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC16  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.In the first nine months of 2022  DUKORAL® sales increased to €9.2 million compared to €0.5 million in the first nine months of 2021  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001  is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in Europe17 and was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). It is produced using Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company’s commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®.In addition to its marketing approval in Europe  Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine received conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom18 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates19 and Kingdom of Bahrain20. During the third quarter of 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) also issued recommendations for use of the vaccine  including for a booster dose of VLA2001 four to six months after completion of the primary series. The vaccine generated sales of €23.9 million during the first nine months of 2022.Following a revised purchase agreement with the EC in July 2022  which included VLA2001 orders of 1.25 million21  Valneva has been delivering doses to participating EU Member States (Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria). Valneva has retained inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase and  in parallel  is continuing discussions on potential additional supply and financing agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 15 months currently.Valneva reported first positive heterologous booster results for VLA2001 in August 202222 and expects additional heterologous booster data following primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine or natural COVID-19 infection in the fourth quarter of 2022.Subject to regulatory assessments  heterologous booster results may support label extensions for VLA2001  additional product approvals and/or additional scientific recommendations.In light of the reduced order volume from EU Member States  Valneva suspended internal and terminated external manufacturing of VLA2001. Valneva is executing its “reshape” strategy including re-sizing which will allow the Company to increase efficiency and focus on its operational and strategic business objectives.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In June 2020  the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic  pursuant to which it agreed to commercialize Bavarian Nordic’s marketed vaccines for rabies (Rabipur®/RabAvert®) and tick-borne encephalitis  leveraging its commercial infrastructure in Canada  the United Kingdom  France and Austria. In September 2022  Valneva also announced a partnership with VBI Vaccines for the marketing and distribution of the only3-antigen Hepatitis B vaccine  PreHevbri®  in select European markets23. Valneva and VBI expect PreHevbri to be available in these countries in early 2023.In the first nine months of 2022  third party product sales increased by 64.6% to €18.4 million from €11.2 million in the first nine months of 2021.Nine-Month 2022 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €249.9 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €69.8 million in the first nine months of 2021  an increase of 257.8%.Product sales  including COVID-19 vaccine sales  increased by 63.7% to €74.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €45.5 million in the first nine months of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed positively to €4.9 million of the change in product sales. Product sales from commercial products amounted to €50.6 million in the first nine months of 2022  an increase of 11.2% compared to the first nine months of 2021. Product sales related to COVID-19 amounted to €23.9 million.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales decreased by 32.1% to €22.9 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €33.7 million in the first nine months of 2021  primarily as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the DoD during the period. This decrease was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €19.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €4.6 million in the first nine months of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations also contributed positively for €4.6 million to the change in IXIARO® product sales. DUKORAL® also benefited from this recovery in the private travel market as sales increased significantly to €9.2 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €0.5 million in the first nine months of 2021. COVID-19 vaccine sales amounted to €23.9 million resulting from shipments to participating EU Member States and Bahrain. Third Party product sales increased by 64.6% to €18.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 from €11.2 million in the first nine months of 2021  driven by growth related to Valneva’s distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sale of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other Revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services  amounted to €175.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €24.4 million in the first nine months of 2021. This increase is attributable to €89.4 million of released refund liability as a result of the settlement with the UK government as well as a release of non-refundable advance payments from EU Member States amounting to €110.8 million. This was partially offset by €36.1 million of negative revenue resulting from an increase in the refund liability linked to the amendment to the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer. Valneva’s future contribution to the VLA15 Phase 3 study will go against the refund liability included in the balance sheet.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €202.7 million in the first nine months of 2022. The gross margin on commercial product sales amounted to 55.4% compared to 37.8% in the first nine months of 2021. COGS of €6.4 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 72.0%. COGS of €3.7 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 60.0%  which was positively impacted by provision releases resulting from reduced expiry risks on inventory. Of the remaining COGS in the first nine months of 2022  €12.4 million were related to the Third-Party products distribution business  €174.0 million to the COVID-19 vaccine business and €6.2 million to cost of services. COGS of the COVID-19 vaccine program included effects from the significant reduction of sales volumes to EU Member States. In the first nine months of 2021  overall COGS were €159.6 million  of which €142.4 million related to cost of goods and €17.2 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €75.4 million in the first nine months of 2022  compared to €117.2 million in the first nine months of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by lower clinical trials costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program advancing towards licensure as well as reduced spend on the COVID-19 program. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first nine months of 2022 amounted to €13.1 million compared to €15.0 million in the first nine months of 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first nine months of 2022 notably included €4.3 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €2.8 million in the first nine months of 2021. In the first nine months of 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €23.3 million from €31.7 million in the first nine months of 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a non-cash accrual adjustment of €30.6 million related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to a cost of €13.7 million in the first nine months of 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €7.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 from €16.0 million in the first nine months of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending and an increase of other expenses related to the provision for the ongoing Vivalis / Intercell merger litigation proceedings.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €57.1 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €237.6 million in the first nine months of 2021  of which the COVID-19 operating loss represented €14.2 million and €194.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021  respectively and the other segments represented €42.9 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €43.2 million in the first nine months of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in the first nine months of 2022 was €38.0 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €227.6 million in the first nine months of 2021.Net ResultIn the first nine months of 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €99.1 million compared to a net loss of €245.9 million in the first nine months of 2021.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in the first nine months of 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €39.8 million  compared to a net finance expense of €6.6 million in the first nine months of 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €26.5 million in the first nine months of 2022  primarily driven by non-cash revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €5.3 million in the first nine months of 2021. Interest expenses net of interest income were €13.3 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €11.9 million in the first nine months of 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €189.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €36.5 million of cash generated by operating activities in the first nine months of 2021. Cash outflows in the first nine months of 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period and non-cash revenues (cash received in previous periods)  while during the first nine months of 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments received related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €22.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €69.9 million in the first nine months of 2021  both mainly a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €121.6 million in the first nine months of 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer as well as a draw-down in September on the credit facility provided by Deerfield & Orbimed24. Cash inflows in the first nine months of 2021 amounted to €74.6 million which was mainly a result of proceeds from issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement in May of 2021.Cash and cash equivalents decreased to €261.0 million as of September 30  2022  compared to €346.7 million as of December 31  2021 and consisted of €258.1 million in cash and €3.0 million in restricted cash. The cash decrease mainly resulted from COVID-19-related investments into fixed assets  R&D and Manufacturing expenses. Net proceeds from the recent global offering were received in October and are not included in the cash position reported per September 30  2022.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Nine months ending September 30 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Loss for the period (99.1) (245.9) Add: Income tax expense 2.2 1.6 Total Finance income (0.1) (0.2) Total Finance expense 13.4 12.1 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net 26.5 (5.3) Result from investments in associates - 0.1 Amortization 5.3 4.9 Depreciation 10.6 5.1 Impairment 3.3 - Adjusted EBITDA (38.0) (227.6)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

During the summer period we saw an increased demand for our solutions resulting in an accelerated customer growth  even though in many markets the digital B2B invoicing is not mandatory today. We put a lot of effort in the geographical expansion of our services throughout Europe  and I’m happy we are succeeding. Our team and solutions prove daily that we are highly scalable: the platform is available in 32 countries  adapted to local needs. During last summer our team for government licence business delivered to the high expectations with the go-live in Serbia. I am proud of the results and the achievements of our Unifiedpost team. We look forward to duplicating this together with our partners for all major licensing deals we have in the pipeline.”Key financial figures(EUR million) Q3 2022 YTD Q3 2022 YTD Q3 2021 Change (%) Digital processing revenue 29.3 88.6 76.1 +16.4% Recurring digital processing revenue 27.1 83.4 69.5 +20.0% Non-recurring digital revenue 2.2 5.2 6.6 -21.2% Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 14.7 47.1 43.4 +8.5% Group revenue 44.0 135.7 119.5 +13.6%Key business KPI’s(#) End Q3 2022 End Q2 2022 End Q1 2022 End Q4 2021 Customers 986 971 910 845 857 313 792 594 Paying customers 453 417 430 524 402 494 368 277 Customers paid by 3rd parties 533 554 480 321 454 819 424.317 Companies in business network 2 023 460 1 745 401 1 615 062 1 504 895 Banqup customers 80 420 68 546 56 000 35 408 Organic growth (new subscriptions) 3 928 5 529 5 197 4 855 Migrated 7 847 7 116 15 395 - Banqup customers Belgium (Billtobox) 37 459 35 382 31 884 28 864 Banqup customers France (JeFacture) 4 087 3 591 2 844 2 072Double-digit growth rates in digital processing businessUnifiedpost grew its revenue in the first nine months of 2022 by 13.6% y/y to €135.7 million  driven by strong growth of the recurring digital processing revenue combined with a sound growth in postage and parcel optimisation services.Growth digital processing mainly driven by organic growthThe Group saw its revenue from digital processing increasing by 16.4% y/y to €88.6 in the first three quarters. 13.8% of the growth was organic. This was mainly driven by the strong growth rate of 20.0% y/y in recurring digital revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and licence business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordic countries  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing growth rates accelerating.The project and licence business  which is non-recurring  contributed €5.2 million (9M 2021: €6.6m). Because of the guidelines around digital invoicing that are being introduced in more and more European countries  there is an increasing demand from governments for a portal that enables the continuous real-time monitoring of each invoice. This will have a positive impact on the growth that Unifiedpost is pursuing. As indicated with our H1 2022 results  Unifiedpost expects to generate more project and licence revenue by the end of the year as the Company is expected to benefit from significant projects billed in Q4 2022.96.2% of the total group revenue results from recurring services  in line with Q2 2022.Sound growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessGroup revenue was also supported by robust growth in postage and parcel optimisation services  + 8.5% y/y in 9M 2022 to €47.1 million. Unifiedpost sees its postage and parcel optimisation business having an excellent 9M 2022. The increase in the top-line was caused by the onboarding of large new customers in combination with general price increases.Customer base grew strongly with improved momentumUnifiedpost grew its customer base further reaching a new record of 986 971 customers at the end of September (+24.5% compared to YE 2021). The consolidated business network expanded to just above 2 million companies by the end of Q3 2022  representing an estimated 8% of businesses in Europe.The total number of Banqup customers more than doubled since the beginning of FY 2021: from 35 408 YE 2021 to 80 420 at the end of Q3 2022. Banqup is Unifiedpost’s core SME-product allowing customers to create and send sales invoices  keep an overview of all (financial) documents and manage administration. The platform also offers a unique  inhouse developed payment functionality. The customer growth over the last three months includes migration effects from legacy platforms. Adjusting for such migrated users  the number of Banqup users increased by 14 654 in the first nine months of 2022.Within the French market  Unifiedpost sees the number of JeFacture customers increase steadily. The Unifiedpost management expects the growth rate of its customers in the French market to accelerate in the coming periods.The overall average revenue per unit (ARPU) in digital processing business1 reached €21.7. The decline in ARPU compared to FY2021 (€27.9) is predominantly due to two effects. The first one is a negative effect from the last quarter as that includes the licence revenue resulting from the project with the Serbian Government. The second one results from the significantly higher and increasing revenue contribution from Unifiedpost’s SME business with a structurally lower ARPU.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023Due to the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has made the target to become cash flow positive its predominant priority. The target remains to be cash flow positive for H2 2023. <End>Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

Nov. 10  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced updated data from the Company’s phase 1 immunotherapy study  Study 1100. These data will be presented during the 37th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”).“Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 are the backbone of cancer immunotherapy and expanding the benefits of these therapies to more patients by improving response rates is one of the most urgent challenges facing the oncology community today ” said Jared Weiss  MD  Professor  Medicine-Oncology at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center  and member of the Nanobiotix Scientific Advisory Board. “Novel combinations that can help to stimulate an immune response and overcome or circumvent resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors could provide the key to unlocking the full potential of these life-saving therapeutics for larger groups of patients. I am encouraged by the early data we have reported on NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 both for patients naïve to prior anti-PD-1 therapy and for those whose cancer was resistant to anti-PD-1 and look forward to further evaluation of the radioenhancer for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cancers.”NBTXR3 Activated By Radiotherapy In Combination With Nivolumab Or Pembrolizumab In Patients With Advanced Cancers: Results From An Ongoing Dose Escalation Phase I Trial — Abstract #684Summary of Updated DataReported data included 28 patients  with 21 evaluable for early signs of efficacy at the data cutoff on 22 August 2022. Treatment remained feasible and well-tolerated  with a safety profile consistent with expectations from stereotactic body radiation therapy (“SBRT”; “RT”) followed by anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.Objective reduction from baseline in target lesions (“objective reduction”) was observed in 71.43% of evaluable patients (15/21). 42.86% of evaluable patients (9/21) showed objective reduction greater than 30%. 71.43% of evaluable patients (15/21) had cancer resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure and tumor regression was observed in 66.66% of these patients (10/15).As of the data cutoff  systemic disease control was durable and had sustained for more than 6 months in 38.10% of evaluable patients (8/21). Delayed objective reduction has been observed in several patients  suggesting the potential for anti-cancer immune activity over time.The recommended phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) of RT-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1 was established at 33% of gross tumor volume in all 3 cohorts at the completion of the Study 1100 dose escalation part. The dose expansion part of the study is ongoing in the United States (“US”)  with a protocol amended for robust evaluation of RT-activated NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in patients with locoregional recurrent (“LRR”) or recurrent and/or metastatic (“R/M”) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”) that is either naïve or resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure.The Company plans to submit a registrational phase 3 protocol for the evaluation of RT-activated NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC resistant to anti-PD-1 to the US Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter of 2023.Conference Call InformationThe updated data to be presented at SITC will be discussed during a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  November 10  2022  at 8:00 AM ET / 2:00 PM CET.The live webcast of the call may be accessed by visiting the investors section of the company’s website at www.nanobiotix.com.

The Company recommends that participants join 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call and will be archived on the company's website.About Study 1100Study 1100 is a phase 1  multicenter  dose escalation and dose expansion study in the United States. The complete dose escalation part included three cohorts: (i) locoregional recurrent (LRR) or R/M HNSCC amenable to reirradiation of the head and neck; (ii) lung metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1; (iii) liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1. Patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 prior to their first session of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Patients were treated with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) or nivolumab (Opdivo®) after completion of SBRT. A recommended phase 2 dose for all three cohorts was established at 33% of gross tumor volume.The dose expansion part of Study 1100 is now ongoing with a protocol amended for robust evaluation of NBTXR3 plus anti-PD-1 in patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC that is either naïve to prior anti-PD-1 exposure or resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure. The protocol includes three amended cohorts: (i) LRR or R/M HNSCC amenable to reirradiation that is resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure; (ii) LRR or R/M HNSCC amenable to reirradiation that is naïve to prior anti-PD-1 exposure; and (iii) non-small cell lung cancer  malignant melanoma  hepatocellular carcinoma  renal cell carcinoma  urothelial cancer  cervical cancer  triple-negative breast cancer that has metastasized to soft tissues  lung metastases  or liver metastases that is resistant to prior anti-PD-1 exposure.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC  or lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The quality of the solutions we provide to farmers is a key asset underpinning the resilience of our model. Our food supplement products for livestock in particular helped farmers to deal with the drought during the summer  which reduced the amount of fodder available. Today  the breadth of our ranges and their availability in a context where most other players have been faced with shortages are key factors in structuring a lasting relationship with our customers.”At 30 September 2022  consolidated revenue rose by 19% to €95.4m  representing organic growth of 9% excluding the integration of the Kabelis companies acquired in July 2022. This level of activity at 30 September 2022 represents 88% of the revenue generated in full-year 2021  confirming positive sales momentum in the third quarter  after a successful first half of the year.Consolidated Q3 2022 revenue came to €33.9m  up 20% versus Q3 2021. In organic terms  revenue grew by a strong 13%. WINFARM benefited over the quarter from strong momentum across the board  with all of its businesses recording double-digit growth over the period.The Farming Supplies business (88% of revenue for the quarter)  whose products are marketed under the Vital Concept brand  made revenue of €29.8m  up 19% compared with Q3 2021 (+11% organic). This performance is all the more remarkable given the demanding environment caused by persistent inflation in raw material prices  even if it has eased in recent months. In order to minimise the impact on its business  WINFARM anticipated this price pressure at an early stage by building stocks in certain items and successfully passing on purchase price increases over the months without losing customers.The Farming Nutrition business (10% of revenue for the quarter)  whose products are marketed under the Alphatech brand  made revenue of €3.5m  representing sharp organic growth of 29%. The performance of export solutions continued to drive the Group's results.ACQUISITION OF KABELIS IN FRANCEDuring Q3  WINFARM announced the acquisition of the KABELIS companies specialised in landscaping and green space development  creating a French champion on this market and the largest player in the Grand Ouest region.Founded in 2007  KABELIS specialised in fertilisers  seeds  services for local authorities  horticulture  golf courses  sports grounds  etc. and became the leading French player in landscaping and green space development.This second acquisition since the IPO  after that of BTN de Haas in the Netherlands in 2021  sees WINFARM forge ahead with the implementation of the roadmap it announced during its IPO at the end of 2020  combining organic growth and acquisitions to become a key player in the upstream agriculture sector in Europe.CONTINUED GROWTH EXPECTED IN Q4 2022Having demonstrated its ability to continue generating strong business growth during the first nine months of the year  despite a demanding environment  by offering customers solutions that contribute to operational performance and competitiveness  WINFARM is confident that it will continue to grow in Q4 2022.In the longer term  the Group reiterates its revenue target for 2025 of around €200m and an EBITDA margin of around 6.5%. It expects to achieve half of this acceleration in growth through organic growth and half through external growth.About WINFARMFounded in Loudéac  in the heart of Brittany  in the early 1990s  WINFARM is now the French leader in distance selling for the agricultural world.

After the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for VidPrevtyn® Beta  the vaccine was approved by the European Commission  as a booster for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults 18 years of age and older. Designed to provide broad protection against multiple variants  the protein-based COVID-19 booster vaccine is based on the Beta variant antigen and includes GSK’s pandemic adjuvant. VidPrevtyn Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunization against SARS_CoV_2 in adults who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral COVID vaccine. Shipments of VidPrevtyn Beta are ready to be distributed to European countries as per Advance Purchase Agreements.Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“Today’s approval validates our research in developing a novel solution for the COVID-19 pandemic. As we’re ready to start first shipments  VidPrevtyn Beta will be an important new option to protect populations against multiple strains of COVID-19.”Philip DormitzerGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines  GSK“This EC approval is an important step in providing further vaccine solutions to Europe for the coming winter. Our protein-based  adjuvanted vaccine candidate has the potential to make an important contribution to public health as the pandemic evolves further.”In registration studies  carried out at times when Omicron strains were predominantly circulating  the vaccine induced a strong immune response against multiple variants. Registration studies included a Phase 3 primary efficacy trial (VAT08 Stage 2) and two separate immunogenicity studies  including one comparative study with approved mRNA booster as comparatori ii.About VidPrevtyn BetaVidPrevtyn Beta is a monovalent  recombinant-protein next-generation COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sanofi  modelled on the Beta variant and including GSK’s pandemic adjuvant. The same recombinant-protein technology is used in Sanofi’s approved seasonal flu vaccines. Next-generation COVID-19 vaccines are based on a variant-adapted approach  using a strain other than the parental strain of SARS-CoV-2 (D614 strain).About COVIBOOST Immunogenicity & Safety StudyThe independent COVIBOOST (VAT013) study conducted by the Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) investigated VidPrevtyn Beta following primary vaccination with two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s Comirnaty vaccine (BNT162b2). VidPrevtyn Beta generated a higher immune response (as measured by neutralizing antibody titers) than Pfizer-BioNTech’s booster or the Sanofi-GSK first-generation booster  both of which target the original D614 parent strain. In this study  which included 247 adult subjects (18-73 years-old)  all three vaccines also elicited neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron BA.1 variant  with highest responses generated by the Sanofi-GSK next-generation candidate  one month after injection. VidPrevtyn Beta also elicited around 2.5 times more neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.1 and  in an exploratory analysis  against BA.4 / BA.5 strains than mRNA COVID-19 booster comparator.About the VAT02 Immunogenicity & Safety StudyImmunogenicity studies included VAT02 Cohort 2 and COVIBOOST which evaluated the booster formulation modelled on the Beta variant and including GSK’s pandemic adjuvant. In the Phase 3 VAT02 Cohort 2 study  the vaccine induced (at day 15 following booster vaccination) a significant boost in antibody titers above baseline against multiple variants of concern (13-fold increase against D614 parent virus  34-fold increase against the COVID-19 Beta strain) in 18-55 years-old adults previously primed with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In the VAT02 cohort 2 study  reactions were mostly mild to moderate  transient and self resolutive.About the VAT08 Stage 2 Efficacy & Safety StudyThe VAT08 Phase 3 Stage 2 study is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial investigating primary vaccination with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine containing both parental (D614) and Beta strains. The results showed a 64.7% efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults  regardless of their SARS-CoV-2 infection status prior to vaccination  and 75.1% efficacy in participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. This study was the first ever to report efficacy data in an Omicron environment.Across all the above-mentioned studies  the Sanofi-GSK bivalent next-generation vaccine candidate was well-tolerated  with an acceptable safety profile.About BARDA supportResearch and development for VidPrevtyn are supported by U.S. federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)  Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under Contract # HHSO100201600005I  and in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical  Biological  Radiological and Nuclear Defense under Contract # W15QKN-16-9-1002  and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).About the Sanofi and GSK partnershipIn the collaboration between the two companies  Sanofi provides its recombinant antigen and will be the marketing authorization holder.

We had an exceptional order intake for Location Intelligence Services compared to the same period last year. Moreover  we expect the top line to continue its growth on a full year basis.""The current financial year covers the 12 months period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. The first quarter of this financial year covers the period from 1 July to 30 September 2022.In the first quarter  GeoJunxion’s business showed a very strong performance: Revenue doubled (+102%) compared to the same quarter of the previous financial year. Order intake was more than 6 times bigger than the value in Q1 last year. In this extremely positive first quarter of FY 2022/23  we booked orders for a value higher than during the entire accounting year 2021-22. Operational expenses reduced by 10% YoY. The operating result  the result before tax and the Net Profit all turned to positive numbers. The cash flow for the quarter was negative by €388 K  as this metric lags revenue generation by approximately 2 months. This cash out is expected to be recovered during Q2 when the open receivable will be collected.The main driver for the growth in the current accounting quarter is our Location Intelligence Service. As announced in August  we won significant new contracts. The execution of these projects absorbed most of the company’s resources during the quarter and is still on-going.Story continuesFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Q1 2022/23 (July–September) vs SAME PERIOD 2021/22102 % revenue growth for Q1 2022/23 compared to the same period in 2021/22;10% reduction in Net Operational Expenses ( OPEX ) for Q1 2022/23 compared to the same period in 2021/22;Operating Profit of €644 K for Q1 2022/23  compared to an Operating Loss of €125 K in Q1 of 2021/22;EBITDA and EBT positive in Q1 2022/23 by respectively €875 K and €565 K;Net Profit after tax of €448 K in Q1 2022/23  compared to a Net Loss of €155 K in Q1 of 2021/22.OUTLOOK FOR THE ACCOUNTING YEAR 2022-2023Despite the uncertainty pictured by the European Central Bank in their September economic outlook  GeoJunxion expects the top line to continue its growth by 25 to 30% for the full year 2022-2023 compared to 2021-22. This expectation is built on orders booked in the first quarter of 2022-23 and a promising pipeline of opportunities. As a result of inflationary pressure and growing staff costs to deliver revenues  we expect our full year cost base to increase by 5 to 10%. GeoJunxion is reasonably confident to convert the above-mentioned guidance into positive EBITDA and EBIT at break-even  or close to that  for this financial year. On this basis  cash flow is also expected to be positive for the full accounting year 2022-23.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in different industries and market sectors.This strategy has proven itself  as it delivered year-on-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than one-off opportunities. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically also retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  which can be subsequently resold to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodata.Flexible licensing models at competitive pricing.Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs.Highly customised solutions and content creation.Market DevelopmentsWhile clear signs of improvement were showing in some industry sectors  the conflict in Ukraine and its direct and indirect consequences brought new concerns in the market. Existing and perspective customers continue to pay great attention to all their expenditures. GeoJunxion has no direct material business exposure to the events in Ukraine. We have no active customers  or deliveries due to  or to be received from Ukraine or Russia. GeoJunxion is however exposed to rising inflation rates  resulting from increased energy and other raw material prices. This is likely to have an impact on the salary & benefit expenses of our staff in the near future.All the above said  the demand for location-aware content is still increasing in various industries and markets despite the general concerns on the health of the global economy.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains  by far  with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this sector we dedicated most of the project execution efforts during the first quarter of the financial year 2022/23. However  it also has interesting opportunities in the pipeline to be explored during the coming months.In automotive we see growing opportunities with the adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance). There is also a growing demand for more cost-effective mapping solutions while providing the most up-to-date and relevant data content. Premium data content towards safety on the road and environmental sustainability remain our major interest and focus of development.GeoJunxion also believes that other opportunities will be identified in markets traditionally consuming geo-localized data such as Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Geo-Marketing  Business Analysis  Travel & Tourism  as well as with the Public Administration.Business DevelopmentIn Q1 (July to September) 2022-23  the Location Intelligence Services have played  once again  a fundamental role in our business development. We completed the execution of tailor-made Location Intelligence contracts  won during the previous quarters and started with the execution of newly won projects. These new contracts will continue to convert into revenue during the second quarter as well.During the quarter  our Sales and Business development teams attended various events in person and remotely  to promote GeoJunxion’s brand  products and services:GeoJunxion was present at the State of The Map (SoTM) 2022 in Florence (Italy) with our Head of Sales and Marketing  Arjan Spigt  and CBO  Francesco Altamura. State of the Map is the annual event for all mappers and OpenStreetMap users. The State of the Map conference was a three-day hybrid conference where our people had the opportunity to meet with various potential partners and clients. It also offered the opportunity to share opinions about future development in the field of geo-localized data and location intelligence technology.In September  our Head of R&D  Johannes Smits  attended  the ITS World Congress in Los Angeles  as a speaker In July  we announced a partnership with the Dutch Red Cross  providing a custom-made digital map to assist first-aid responders to quickly find and get to the precise location in case of an emergency at the Zwarte Cross  a 4-day Dutch festival. The Red Cross was present with hundreds of volunteers  to supervise an area of 2 800 000 m2 and about 220 000 visitors. This makes it the biggest Dutch event and requires a high safety standard. The Red Cross has been partnering with the Zwarte Cross for many years. GeoJunxion developed the digital map of the area with all relevant Points of Interest (POI)  such as entrances  campgrounds  stages  and all the Red Cross first aid locations. On top of the Outdoor Venue Plan of the event area  GeoJunxion created a grid to help the volunteers to identify the precise locations. In case of an emergency  the volunteers receive the grid location of the emergency place and are guided to this location on their mobile device. In this way  they can easily find and navigate to the emergency location and intervene quickly.At the end of July  GeoJunxion announced also to have signed a NDW framework agreement with Royal HaskoningDHV  together with 11 other partners. This consortium was created to deliver traffic data from non-road systems such as Probe Vehicle Data  Floating Car Data and crowd-sourced data. The National Data Portal for Road Traffic (NDW) will use the contract to supply traffic data from navigation systems  vehicles and mobile apps  among other things. In addition  the consortium will be given the opportunity to offer complete services based on that traffic data. The data supply and services relate to new methods for traffic management  asset management  traffic safety analyses and evaluations. The use of Floating Car Data  Probe Vehicle Data and crowd-sourced data is central to applying data science and advanced analytics.Product DevelopmentSchool Safety ZonesThe quarter from July to September is the one when students return to school across Europe and around the World. This means that more vehicles and vulnerable pedestrians are on the road on weekdays. Increased traffic and density of pedestrians in certain areas can also increase the risk of collisions between vehicles and children or their relatives commuting to/from school.European statistics  global and for each individual Country  confirm that thousands of accidents happen during schooldays close to schools  with serious consequences and injuries. Such accidents often involve car or bike drivers failing to recognize the vulnerable pedestrians on the road. Most of these accidents occur as children are getting on/off buses or crossing intersections near the school. The root causes are various: when drivers are speeding  driving recklessly or distracted and weather conditions may worsen those risky behaviors.To prevent similar situations  certain countries started adopting and enforcing School Safety Zones by law. Speed limits through those areas  during school hours  are often limited to encouraging drivers to slow down and pay more attention to children and pedestrians. In other cases  areas may be completely closed to traffic. Drivers who are caught speeding in school zones or entering areas closed to traffic are subject to severe penalties and fines.Unfortunately  not many Countries in Europe adopted these solutions. Even in cases where such limitations are in force  the decision of adopting and implementing such solutions is left to local Municipalities. The result is that we still lack wide adoption of School Safety Zones to protect children from (deadly) accidents.For this reasons GeoJunxion decided to build and maintain up to date a unique database of School Safety Zones  including those defined and enforced by local Municipalities  as well as hundreds of thousands of areas created through proprietary algorithms  taking in consideration the location of the schools  bus stops  zebra crossing  dangerous road intersections and many other parameters.Eco Alert ZonesIn parallel with the efforts on the School Safety Zones  GeoJunxion has continued the real-time maintenance of the Eco Alert Zones  which are continuously increasing in number. While at the beginning of 2022 the total number of environmental areas encoded in the EAZ data suite was about 2500  as of today it exceeds 2750  with an increase of 10% in less than a year. This confirms the relevance of this type of data and the strategic decision to have invested in such a development.Custom project executionAs already remarked  however  the biggest challenge this past quarter was to execute the custom project for a global Tech Company. That project required a significant scale up of our resources  mainly in Operations. This has been achieved during the summer period  when  usually  limited resources are available. This is an additional reason to be proud of the efforts made and satisfied with the results achieved. The GeoJunxion team showed great adaptability and flexibility: this allowed the company to promptly react to the client’s request and timely made partial deliveries  despite the extensive scope and the challenging deadlines.Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  the product development was focused on continuing the development and refinement of new data for the unnamed Infotainment System Manufacturer. The partnership together with this important Tier 1 manufacturer in the Automotive Industry is strengthening month-over-month. This is in line with our Company's strategy  starting with custom Proof of Concepts converted and expanded step by step into bigger projects  aiming to build a long strategic partnership.ORDER INTAKEThe order intake for the first quarter of this financial year 2022/23 (July-September 2022) showed an increase of more than 6 times compared with the same period of the previous year  thanks to the big Location Intelligence Contract announced early August. The value of orders booked in this remarkable first quarter of FY 2022/23  exceeded the total order intake during the entire financial year 2021-22.REVENUEIn Q1 2022-23  revenue increased by +102%  doubling the amount realized during the same quarter last year.GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue showed a reduction  primarily due to the timing of the project execution. This will be caught up during Q2 2022-23. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research and collection of data sets and creation of geo-located content.OPERATING RESULTThe Q1 2022-23 operating result showed a profit €644K  compared to a loss of €125K during the same quarter last year. There are three main drivers for this year over year improvement:A very strong increase in revenue: +€691K (+102% YoY)A decrease in operational expenses: -€15K (2% YoY). This primarily resulting from lower personnel expenses (-24K) linked to the December 2021 restructuring  lower other operating expenses (-€24K)  linked to diligent cost saving measures and organizational structure simplification. These savings are partially offset by higher depreciation  and amortisation costs (+€21).Higher Capitalized development costs +€24K (+22%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.ORGANIZATIONGeoJunxion has received Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the Prestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen. This independent assessment showed that GeoJunxion offers high-quality employment to people who have difficulty accessing the labor market and collaborates with like-minded organizations. With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion continues to make great progress in turning its business around from a digital map supplier to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with a subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue model. The results reported for Q1 2022-23 with growing revenue and a net profit for the quarter  are evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITORWith the 2021-22 Annual Accounts recently published and strong Q1 2022-23 results in hand  we are starting another round of consultations reaching out to OOB/PIE licensed auditing firms in the Netherlands. In the past two years  we have consistently delivered results  showing a continuous growth YoY  in accordance with our guidance. We have significantly reduced the Group’s complexity and  consequently  the inherent risks. We believe that our position is stronger and more persuasive. Therefore  we will re-engage auditing firms with renewed energy and determination  with the goal to secure a statutory auditor for the current and subsequent accounting years.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws.The 2021-22 annual report  as published on 27 October 2022  describes the primary strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the annual report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts.On the Social aspect  we continue to pay particular attention on preventive actions to limit exposure of our people to Covid-19  encouraging and supporting smart working from home  combined with making the best use of our office space to facilitate personal contact and create an optimal work environment. Our people are our key assets  and we do whatever we can to keep them safe and healthy.BOARD OF MANAGEMENT STATEMENTThe Board of Management hereby declares that  to the best of its knowledge  the summarized Q1 (July – September 2022) interim consolidated financial statements  drawn up in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”  represents a faithful rendering of the assets  liabilities  financial position  profit and cash flow of GeoJunxion NV and its subsidiary as stated in the consolidated financial statements  and that the Board Report  as included in this Interim Financial statements  represents a faithful rendering of the information required in relation to item 5:25d subs 8 and 9 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.GROUP STRUCTUREThe GeoJunxion group structure was simplified to a maximum extent during the past 2 years.

This frees up surplus capital and strengthens Transamerica’s capital positionAegon takes action to substantially reduce the capital sensitivity of its US variable annuity portfolio to equity markets and further increase the predictability of free cash flows; a third-party transaction will not be pursued in the near-termStatement of Lard Friese  CEO“In recent months  we have made great strides in the transformation of Aegon and the acceleration of our strategy. We have made substantial progress on our operational improvement plan  and have taken additional actions to maximize the value of both our US variable annuity book and TLB  Aegon’s high-net-worth insurance business. Most recently  we announced a transaction with a.s.r. in the Netherlands to create a leading Dutch insurance company.In the third quarter  our operating result declined by 11% on a constant currency basis as adverse market conditions more than offset an improvement in claims experience in the United States  expense savings and the benefit from growth initiatives. Despite inflationary headwinds  we made considerable progress with our expense savings program. We achieved additional EUR 50 million expense savings compared with last quarter  increasing the reduction in our annual addressable expenses to EUR 300 million compared with the base year 2019. The growth initiatives  aimed at improving our customer service and expanding our distribution network  positively impacted our commercial and financial results.We also made solid progress on our ambition to grow our strategic assets  despite continued financial market volatility and political unrest. Life insurance sales were up 24% in the United States and 16% in our Growth Markets  supported by our growing distribution capabilities. The retirement businesses across the United States  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom all reported growth in net deposits  reflecting the strength of the labor market. Commercial results in Asset Management  the UK Retail business and our US mutual fund platform were under pressure as a result of our customers’ reduced propensity to invest in the current uncertain environment.We continue to take actions to maximize the value of our financial assets. Based on extensive analysis  we have concluded that the best option with respect to the US variable annuity portfolio is to continue to own and actively manage it  at least in the near term. In October  we finalized an internal reinsurance transaction between TLB and Transamerica that freed up USD 600 million in excess capital for Transamerica. Part of this will be used to create a buffer that will substantially reduce the capital sensitivity of our US variable annuity book to equity markets.The recent action we have taken to combine our Dutch pension  life and non-life insurance  banking  and mortgage origination activities with those of a.s.r.  is pivotal to the transformation of our company and reflects our goal to build advantaged businesses in our chosen markets. The transaction enables us to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders and is in line with our strategy to release capital from mature businesses  and create leading positions in markets where Aegon is well positioned for growth.I appreciate the hard work and dedication of all our colleagues to support our customers’ needs in challenging times. Thanks to the efforts of our employees  we are able to continue to improve our operational performance and accelerate our strategy. While economic volatility will likely persist  our strong balance sheet  disciplined risk management  and focused strategy make me confident about the opportunities the future will bring.”Note: All comparisons in this release are against 3Q 2021  unless stated otherwise.

These non-EU-IFRS measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies. The reconciliation of these measures  except for market consistent value of new business and return on equity  to the most comparable EU-IFRS measure is provided in the notes to this press release. Market consistent value of new business is not based on EU-IFRS  which are used to report Aegon’s primary financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for EU-IFRS financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-EU-IFRS measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity excluding the revaluation reserve. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions) after reallocation of claim handling expenses to benefits paid. This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are expenses reflected in the operating result  excluding deferrable acquisition expenses  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to operations in CEE countries. Aegon believes that these non-EU-IFRS measures  together with the EU-IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon’s results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon’s primary financial statements.Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

After a development phase extended by 18 months due to the Covid pandemic  this major revamp has involved all of Artprice's databases and services.After a call for tenders at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level and committed external consultants to audit and develop a complete overhaul of Artprice.com  with a solid UI/UX approach (UX and UI respectively stand for User Experience and User Interface). The results of this user-centric approach will be visible in mid-December.The new website will also boast a new economic model with the inclusion of paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers will be primarily the 6 400 auction houses worldwide affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now be able to highlight their future sales in paying advertiser mode  based on the search criteria used by Artprice's 5.4 million users. The resulting targeting will be extremely relevant.We note that for over 50 years  the economic model of auction houses has systematically involved advertising costs – announcing details of upcoming sales – that accounted for approximately 34% of their overall costs  regardless of the country or the size of their activity.Since auctions are now 98% advertised on the Internet  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their sales for a fee has found the best solution on our new website. It is only logical that auction houses now consider their advertisement of future sales (34% of the cost of the sale) makes more sense on the Internet rather than in the printed press.In the past  Artprice has always considered online advertising incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and notoriety. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to demand from auction houses for advertising while maintaining Artprice's core DNA.In the new roll-out  the 6 400 auction operators will be able to integrate and merge the announcements of their future sales into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  along with ""pushing"" the artists selected as favorites to Artprice's 5.4 million users (alerts by text messages  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  My Artists page  etc.).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 400 auction houses affiliated with Artprice since 1997 will ultimately exceed our subscription revenue (currently 90% of Artprice's total revenue). Artprice therefore believes that by responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  the new business model could double its future revenue.In responding to the numerous and repeated requests from its 6 400 affiliated auction houses around the world to be able to profitably advertise their future sales  Artprice has made every effort to remain faithful to its principle of prioritizing the readability of its databases.Significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in early January 2023   a complete overhaul of the Artists Pages in AI and Web 3.0  Art NFTs for better global visibility of the 800 000 artists listed by Artprice by ArtmarketArtmarket.com will be introducing a significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in January 2023 that will generate an increase in future income. As Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.The fee increases follow extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  being well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find anywhere else. Our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 must now be commercially exploited at its true value. Remember that our databases are continually updated with ultra-detailed and qualified data: well over a million new data logs every year.According to a consensus of art market professionals  Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making support tools  signatures & monograms  information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for €350/year  450 queries for €975/year and  in the event of overrun  €2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competitions' offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from €265 to €529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with further margin for additional price rises in the future.Somewhat counter-intuitively – given the geopolitical and economic context – the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has clearly outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. As the end of the year approaches  it is clear that the war in Ukraine and fears of a major recession have not had a negative impact on the art market.On 8 November last  AFP  the French Press Agency  highlighted this phenomenon in an article titled ""Collection of Microsoft co-founder could fetch over a billion dollars in New York""  adding ""By auctioning in New York the art collected by Paul Allen (Microsoft's co-founder who died in 2018)  Christie's is aiming for a historic sales record in a bold move that reflects a market whose indicators are higher than ever  despite the geopolitical and economic crises.""During December 2022  as part of our major revamp  we will be introducing significant changes to the presentation of our databases and Artist Pages on Artprice by Artmarket. This development  conceived with a UI/UX approach  will therefore be effective ahead of the tariff increase with the objective of boosting Artmarket.com's revenues from the very start of 2023.Conceived after 18 months of in-depth analysis by a highly specialized team of UI/UX consultants  the changes we are introducing take into account the sentiment of users when they navigate our digital media (databases and services). The objective of UX design is to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and/or prospective customers as much as possible in order to make it easier and more intuitive  both on mobile and desktop devices. As a result of these changes the expectations and needs of Artprice's customers and users will be better satisfied.Thanks to UX design  online navigation is more fluid and more effective. It eliminates the incomprehension that users often encounters in their daily online experiences and takes into account not just the logistics of online navigation  but also the 'emotional' aspect of online navigation.The Interface aspect (UI design) of our modifications has focused on enhancing the interaction of Artprice users with our databases and services. This approach has been used at all stages in the development of our new website  right through to its roll-out in mid-December 2022.Unlike UX (user experience)  UI is more focused on the visual aspect in order to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services. The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field in order to acquire new market shares.The Artists Pages are the principal and most common entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. It is for this reason that our website revamp has aimed to reposition artists at the heart of the art market  a position that is inevitable with the production of Art NFTs which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This global overhaul of Artprice aims to give its customers and users a better experience  in line with their needs  after several years of collecting and analyzing their queries  in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will at last allow the exploitation of the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and printed sales catalogs in the world. Dating back to 1700  and owned by Artprice  this collection is the very foundation of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and of its position as the World Leader in Art Market Information for the past 25 years.Thus  Artprice users and prospects will now be able to navigate from the Artist Pages to several centuries of knowledge that Artprice by Artmarket's historians and editors have been organizing over the last 25 years  allowing them to immerse themselves in the exceptional and mysterious history of the art market.These new pages will highlight the wealth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  with high added value. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) will allow access to very relevant and personalized recommendations  to enhance customers' knowledge of the art market and to generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more business revenue.Indeed  this feature takes Artprice by Artmarket clients and users into a Web 3.0 dimension and – by extension – into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.During the course of the development of our major roll-out scheduled in December 2022  Artprice listened to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  but art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  they have absolutely no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.These are the new clients of Artmarket.com  whose services they have frequently requested. Their main demand in recent years has been that we post art prices in ETH and BTC in all Artprice databases.This huge global community could not understand why Artprice's reference databases only quoted prices in the world's main fiat currencies  without the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC)  which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding Stablecoins).Appreciating the business opportunity represented by 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs  Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams therefore moved quickly to respond positively to their demand.Artmarket.com has therefore once again taken a major step forward that required considerable reflection and an imposing volume of work. As a result since September 2022  Artprice now quotes 8 828 384 art auction results in Bitcoin (going back to 1 February 2011 when 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707) and 5 814 866 art auction results in Ethereum (going back to 7 August 2015 when 1 Ethereum was worth $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  the tens of millions of calculations underlying this ambitious project were made using the value of the respective cryptocurrencies on the days the respective sales were concluded. The values were calculated by Artmarket.com's proprietary IT systems.https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/12/artmarket_com-adds-ethereum-and-bitcoin-to-its-multi-currency-artprice-databases-to-meet-the-needs-of-its-customers-and-prepareSince 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population in order to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable and above all contextualized data.Indeed  when navigating our new website  clients and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of the GAFAs.Over the years  Artprice  as the World Leader in Art Market Information  has been a partner in numerous essential and historic collaborations with artists. Their contributions have been clearly reflected in the development of our new interface with users.The other essential collaboration has of course been with the auction houses which will now have a growing interest in collaborating with Artprice. Henceforward we will promote their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  thereby generating new recurring income for Artprice with its proprietary Intranet  which has been the reference work tool for auction houses for many years.After two years of R&D – extended by the circumstances of the Covid pandemic – Artmarket.com customers  partners and members will be able to immerse themselves in a new experience at the heart of the art market. This is undoubtedly one of the founding steps for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with its positioning fundamentally improved by the referencing of images on search engines (SEOs) and the dual objectives of increasing traffic in order to conquer new market shares and to monopolize the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databases.We have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow a better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies with regard to new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture and the sentiments of our customers.Moreover  as regards the exchange of Art NFTs on its Marketplace and given the current energy context  Artmarket.com is pleased to have preferred Ethereum for a long time and fully supports the remarks by France's Minister of the Economy  Mr. Bruno Le Maire  as indicated in a previous press release:https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-already-positioned-on-nfts-with-artprice-reacts-to-an-interview-on-bfm-crypto-with-bruno-le-maire-and-notably-hisArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that in the first two quarters of 2022  the phenomenon of Art NFTs became a lasting segment of the art market on all continents with an acceleration of turnover and volumes in the second half of 2022 due notably to the purge of crypto-currencies and much more favorable new legislation in the USA as well as the introduction of regulatory framework in Europe that prevents crypto-abuse/fraud and enhances the confidence of consumers  investors and operators.These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.Artprice invites you to read the latest Banques Notes published by the European Center for Research in Banking and Finance  with the analysis of Blanche Sousi  Professor Emeritus of the University of Lyon 3  Jean Monnet Chair ad personam in European banking and monetary law:""The European Regulation MiCAR has just been adopted: are NFTs regulated?

13044,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555940-phathom-pharma-approved-drugs-upcoming-pdufa-smallish-addressable-market,Phathom Pharma: Approved Drugs  Upcoming PDUFA  Smallish Addressable Market (NASDAQ:PHAT),Phathom Pharmaceuticals  a Takeda spinoff  has a drug approved in H. pylori. Click here to read our analysis of PHAT stock.,"libre de droit/iStock via Getty ImagesPhathom Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ:PHAT) develops treatments for gastrointestinal diseases. The company was spun out of Takeda  in collaboration with Frazier Healthcare Partners  to develop and commercialize vonoprazan  a next-generation P-CAB (potassium-competitive acid blocker) drug that is superior to proton pump inhibitors  has a longer half-life than traditional PPIs  and requires less cycles of administration to achieve full effect.In May 2022  vonoprazan was approved for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in adults  in a triple pack with clarithromycin and amoxicillin  and a dual pack with just amoxicillin. While there are other approved drugs  the company states that  ""vonoprazan-based treatments offer two new therapeutic options that have demonstrated superior eradication rates as compared to standard of care lansoprazole-based triple therapy."" In a phase 3 trial called PHALCON-HP  vonoprazan triple therapy and vonoprazan dual therapy successfully met the study's primary non-inferiority endpoints and all secondary endpoints  demonstrating superior eradication rates versus lansoprazole-based triple therapy among all patients including in patients with clarithromycin resistant strains of H. pylori.In another phase 3 study called PHALCON-EE  vonoprazan demonstrated non-inferiority - in erosive esophagitis ('EE')  a type of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - to current standard of care Prevacid  currently owned by Novartis (NVS). In certain secondary but critical measures  it showed superiority  in fact.Data came from the phase 3 PHALCON-EE trial with 1000 EE patients enrolled across the US and EU. These patients were randomized to 20 mg vonoprazan in a healing phase and either 10 or 20 mg in a maintenance phase. The study compared these drug arms directly with Prevacid or lansoprazole. Data showed that in the healing phase  vonoprazan had a healing rate of 93% compared to 85% in Prevacid at 8 weeks (p<0.0001). In an exploratory superiority test  the p-value was also <0.0001. Although vonoprazan did not do as well in heartburn at Day 3  it met the primary and all secondary endpoints in the maintenance phase  demonstrating superiority in maintenance of healing (79% for vonoprazan 10 mg  81% for vonoprazan 20 mg  and 72% for Prevacid).Safety-wise  as well  vonoprazan held its own against Prevacid  with comparable safety profiles except in one specific arm  which also included 5 covid patients.This was the data the company took to the FDA  and vonoprazan has a PDUFA for this indication on Jan 11  2023.Addressable marketsH. pylori is estimated to affect nearly 115 million people in the U.S. and  with growing antibiotic resistance  now has a declining eradication rate. The global market is estimated at $600mn in 2021. The EE market  on the other hand  is slated to be $1.5bn by 2030. According to a GlobalData report:'Eosinophilic Esophagitis - Opportunity Assessment and Forecast to 2030'  reveals that the growth in this market will be driven by sales of high-priced biologics such as Sanofi (Euronext: SAN) and Regeneron's (Nasdaq: REGN) Dupixent (dupilumab)  Bristol Myers Squibb's cendakimab (RPC-4046)  and AstraZeneca's Fasenra (benralizumab). Dupixent is expected to become the market leader with $915.6 million in sales in 2030.Thus  despite the new and upcoming approvals  the total addressable market for vonoprazan in these two indications is small  given that the market is heavily differentiated  small in size to begin with  and dominated by large players. Jefferies analyst Caleb Ezell projected $200 million in peak sales in H. pylori infection.Rest of pipelinePhathom has just this one drug in clinical trials but in two other indications - daily dosing and as-needed treatment of heartburn associated with Nonerosive Reflux Disease (NERD). In a phase 2 trial called PHALCON-NERD  vonoprazan met the primary endpoint in all doses against placebo. A phase 3 trial is ongoing  with data expected in 1Q 2023.FinancialsPHAT has a market cap of $382mn and a cash reserve of $197mn. They also have an additional $100 million available under the Company's term loan with Hercules Capital. Research and development expenses for the third quarter were $19.0 million  while general and administrative expenses were $23.5 million. At that rate of expenses  they have a cash runway of just around 5-7 quarters  starting from the previous quarter. So that runway will see them through barely to 2024  and then  or before then  they will need cash.The company states that they have a cash runway to 2024.RisksPHAT has a low trading volume  so that lack of liquidity could be a problem for short-term investors. More than 90% of the company is held by funds  insiders  and other non-retailers. That explains the low trading volume.There's some competitive risk. While vonoprazan's data is better than lansoprazole's  a number of biologics  like I mentioned  are established players in the market.PHAT is a microcap company  so there's always that risk of programs looking promising and then fizzling out. That could happen even with larger companies  but they can absorb more punishment  given their bulk. Microcap companies like PHAT can't; they may either make you a lot of money  or they may take your entire investment and go...phut...no pun intended.Bottom lineIf you take the cash position and add it to vonoprazan's peak sales analyst estimate in just the approved indication  you sort of go beyond its current market cap  indicating that the market is giving zero value to the rest of the pipeline  including EE where it has strong data and a near-term PDUFA and NERD where it has strong phase 2 data and a near-term phase 3 topline data. The drug already sells nearly $850mn annually  mostly in GERD  in Japan  under Takeda. I think  if you consider all of that and the current low price  PHAT looks quite attractive  although  I must say  a little unexciting  given the less than blockbuster status of the total addressable markets here.",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.16,0.15,0.69,True,English,"['Smallish Addressable Market', 'Phathom Pharma', 'Upcoming PDUFA', 'Drugs', 'NASDAQ', 'two new therapeutic options', 'care lansoprazole-based triple therapy', 'Frazier Healthcare Partners', 'proton pump inhibitors', 'superior eradication rates', 'gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'comparable safety profiles', 'growing antibiotic resistance', 'Bristol Myers Squibb', 'Nonerosive Reflux Disease', 'low trading volume', 'one specific arm', 'clarithromycin resistant strains', 'declining eradication rate', 'H. pylori) infection', 'H. pylori infection', 'exploratory superiority test', 'two other indications', 'phase 3 PHALCON-EE trial', 'primary non-inferiority endpoints', 'total addressable market', 'vonoprazan dual therapy', 'two indications', 'triple pack', 'dual pack', 'Addressable markets', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'phase 3 trial', 'phase 2 trial', 'one drug', 'Getty Images', 'gastrointestinal diseases', 'next-generation P-CAB', 'longer half-life', 'traditional PPIs', 'less cycles', 'full effect', 'secondary endpoints', 'erosive esophagitis', 'critical measures', '115 million people', 'U.S.', 'other hand', 'GlobalData report', 'Eosinophilic Esophagitis', 'Opportunity Assessment', 'upcoming approvals', 'Jefferies analyst', 'Caleb Ezell', 'clinical trials', 'daily dosing', 'primary endpoint', 'term loan', 'Hercules Capital', 'third quarter', '5-7 quarters', 'previous quarter', 'short-term investors', 'other non-retailers', 'healing phase', 'maintenance phase', 'healing rate', 'global market', 'EE market', 'market leader', 'market cap', 'cash reserve', 'drug arms', 'development expenses', 'administrative expenses', 'Phathom Pharmaceuticals', 'vonoprazan-based treatments', 'current standard', 'high-priced biologics', 'large players', 'competitive risk', 'phase 3 study', 'cash runway', '1000 EE patients', '5 covid patients', 'peak sales', 'microcap company', '20 mg vonoprazan', 'droit', 'NASDAQ', 'Takeda', 'collaboration', 'administration', 'May', 'adults', 'amoxicillin', 'drugs', 'type', 'GERD', 'Novartis', 'NVS', 'fact', 'Prevacid', '8 weeks', 'p-value', 'heartburn', 'Day', 'FDA', 'PDUFA', 'Jan', 'Forecast', 'growth', 'Sanofi', 'Euronext', 'Regeneron', 'REGN', 'Dupixent', 'dupilumab', 'cendakimab', 'AstraZeneca', 'Fasenra', 'benralizumab', 'size', 'Rest', 'pipeline', 'NERD', 'doses', 'placebo', '1Q', 'Financials', 'Research', 'general', 'Risks', 'lack', 'liquidity', 'problem', 'More', 'funds', 'insiders', 'number', '85']",2022-11-10,2022-11-10,seekingalpha.com

Product sales outside of COVID-19 grew by double digits (11.2%) vs. prior period€175.5 million of other revenues (vs €24.4 million in the first nine months of 2021) mainly driven by revenue recognition related to previous COVID-19 vaccine supply agreementsCash and cash equivalents of €261.0 million at the end of September 2022Excludes €102.9 million of gross proceeds received in October 2022 from an upsized global offering 1Includes drawing the final tranche ($20 million) from Deerfield & Orbimed loan agreement2Continu ed progress ion o f late-stage clinical programs as guidedLyme Disease Vaccine Candidate VLA15Phase 3 study recruitment ongoing; enrollment completion expected in the second quarter of 2023Single-Shot Chikungunya Vaccine Candidate VLA1553Ongoing rolling submission for Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); submission completion expected by end of 2022Progression of pre-clinical assets and focus on strengthening the Company’s clinical pipelineVLA1554 (human metapneumovirus) and VLA2112 (Epstein-Barr virus) currently prioritizedUpdated FY 2022 F ina ncial G uidanceValneva reiterates expected total revenues of €340 million to €360 million  noting continued recovery of travel vaccine sales  further revenue recognition linked to payments received under the Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with each of the European Commission (EC) and United Kingdom (UK) and the expected sales from the revised EC APA. Product sales of the Company’s travel vaccines are still expected to reach €70 million to €80 million despite supply challenges and COVID-19 product sales are expected to reach €30 million to €40 million. Other Revenues are expected to reach approximately €240 million. They will be mainly related to COVID-19 revenue recognition in relation to the UK and EC APAs and will have no impact on cash. Other Revenues not related to COVID-19 will be negative in 2022 due to the increased refund liability resulting from the amendment of the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer.Given phasing of clinical trial expenses and accelerated wind-down of VLA2001 related activities  Valneva now expects lower R&D expenses of €95 million to €110 million compared to the €120 million to €135 million previously communicated. The Company remains committed to advancing its late-stage vaccine candidates and to further expanding its R&D pipeline  including  but not limited to  through the advancement of some of the Company’s pre-clinical candidates towards clinical entry.As part of the communicated reshape strategy  Valneva is in the process of re-sizing its operations which is expected to result in a reduction of approximately 20% to 25% of its existing workforce. Post restructuring  the Company’s total workforce is expected to be approximately 25% above pre-COVID levels enabling the Company to retain key talents and additional expertise to successfully execute on its strategy. This re-sizing and re-focusing is expected to result in annualized savings of approximately €12 million.Financial Information(unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS)€ in million Nine months ending September 30 2022 2021 Total revenues 249.9 69.8 Product sales 74.4 45.5 Net loss (99.1) (245.9) Adjusted EBITDA loss (38.0) (227.6) Cash (at end of period) 261.0 247.9Saint-Herblain (France)  November 10  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported consolidated financial results for the first nine months of the year  ended September 30  2022. The condensed consolidated interim financial results are available on the Company’s website (Financial Reports – Valneva).Valneva will provide a live webcast of its nine months financial results conference call beginning at3 p.m. CET/9 a.m. EST today. This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/cay4shasThomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “Valneva is continuing to successfully execute on its key activities. Raising over €100 million in the current economic environment  attracting new investors  and maintaining support of our existing shareholders clearly underlines the value of the Company’s fundamentals  its R&D pipeline and our strategic ambitions. We will continue to fully pursue the Company’s strategic priorities  including advancing our chikungunya vaccine candidate towards marketing approval and launch  completing the Phase 3 trial of our Lyme disease vaccine candidate  progressing pre-clinical assets  and focusing on strengthening our clinical pipeline. The re-sizing of our operations will allow us to increase efficiency and focus on achieving our operational and strategic business objectives.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study initiatedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.Recruitment of approximately 6 000 participants five years of age and older for the Phase 3 clinical study “VALOR” (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists) is currently ongoing in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe3. Enrollment for the study  which investigates the efficacy  safety  and immunogenicity of VLA15  is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023. As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between the two companies  Valneva received a $25 million milestone payment from Pfizer in October following initiation of the Phase 3 study.Pending successful Phase 3 completion  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA154. In June 2022  the terms of this collaboration were updated  and Pfizer invested €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva as part of an Equity Subscription Agreement5.Valneva will continue to pay its 40% contribution to the Phase 3 activities over 2022 and 2023.If approved  Pfizer will commercialize VLA15 and Valneva will be eligible to receive substantial milestone and royalty payments.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553BLA rolling submission with U.S. FDA initiatedVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 120 countries with the potential to rapidly expand further. There are currently no preventive vaccines or effective treatments for the chikungunya virus available  and VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate that successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 studies6 7 and the first chikungunya vaccine candidate for which a regulatory filing process has been initiated with the U.S. FDA.Valneva initiated BLA rolling submission with the FDA for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above in August 20228. This BLA submission is part of the accelerated approval pathway agreed with the FDA in 20209 and follows final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 202210 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202211.Valneva expects to complete its BLA submission by the end of 2022. Once completed  and if the FDA accepts the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility along with the action due date upon which it will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in the first half of 2023.Valneva has presented and will continue to present clinical data for VLA1553 at high-profile medical and scientific congresses12. Recently  the Company highlighted additional immunological results from an expanded panel of serological samples from adults over 65 years of age who received VLA1553 at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) Annual Meeting. Similar to the pivotal data presented previously  the results from the expanded cohort continue to show that older adults generated similarly high seroresponse rates compared to younger adults in the pivotal Phase 3 study13. The Company is also expecting to report twelve-month antibody persistence data in late 2022.At the recent meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  Valneva presented an overview of VLA1553 safety and immunogenicity results and the chikungunya working group provided a preliminary review and timeline towards ACIP’s recommendation decision. Ahead of the anticipated February 2024 ACIP vote  the working group plans to present further on CHIKV traveler epidemiology and disease burden  a more comprehensive review of immunogenicity and safety data as part of its Grading of Recommendations  Assessment  Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment  and longer-term additional data in younger age groups.A clinical trial of VLA1553 in adolescents is also ongoing in Brazil14 for which topline results are expected in the first half of 2023. This trial may support future regulatory submissions and label extensions following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the U.S. This ongoing clinical trial conducted by Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesThe Company continues to progress select pre-clinical assets and focus on strengthening its future clinical pipeline. The Company is currently focused on two pre-clinical assets  VLA1554 and VLA2112. The hMPV candidate  VLA1554  is a pre-fusion recombinant protein subunit vaccine targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection in children and is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and in older adults. VLA1554 is currently in pre-clinical proof of concept studies. VLA2112 is a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  which is one of the most common human viruses and can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses. VLA2112 is currently in a late-stage evaluation phase.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the U.S.  Canada and Europe.In the first nine months of 2022  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €22.9 million compared to €33.7 million in the first nine months of 2021  as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the U.S. Department of Defense. This decrease was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €19.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €4.6 million in the first nine months of 2021.CHOLERA / ETEC15-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC16  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.In the first nine months of 2022  DUKORAL® sales increased to €9.2 million compared to €0.5 million in the first nine months of 2021  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001  is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in Europe17 and was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). It is produced using Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company’s commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®.In addition to its marketing approval in Europe  Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine received conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom18 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates19 and Kingdom of Bahrain20. During the third quarter of 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) also issued recommendations for use of the vaccine  including for a booster dose of VLA2001 four to six months after completion of the primary series. The vaccine generated sales of €23.9 million during the first nine months of 2022.Following a revised purchase agreement with the EC in July 2022  which included VLA2001 orders of 1.25 million21  Valneva has been delivering doses to participating EU Member States (Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria). Valneva has retained inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase and  in parallel  is continuing discussions on potential additional supply and financing agreements with various other governments around the world to deploy remaining inventory. VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to be extended to up to 24 months  compared to 15 months currently.Valneva reported first positive heterologous booster results for VLA2001 in August 202222 and expects additional heterologous booster data following primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine or natural COVID-19 infection in the fourth quarter of 2022.Subject to regulatory assessments  heterologous booster results may support label extensions for VLA2001  additional product approvals and/or additional scientific recommendations.In light of the reduced order volume from EU Member States  Valneva suspended internal and terminated external manufacturing of VLA2001. Valneva is executing its “reshape” strategy including re-sizing which will allow the Company to increase efficiency and focus on its operational and strategic business objectives.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In June 2020  the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic  pursuant to which it agreed to commercialize Bavarian Nordic’s marketed vaccines for rabies (Rabipur®/RabAvert®) and tick-borne encephalitis  leveraging its commercial infrastructure in Canada  the United Kingdom  France and Austria. In September 2022  Valneva also announced a partnership with VBI Vaccines for the marketing and distribution of the only3-antigen Hepatitis B vaccine  PreHevbri®  in select European markets23. Valneva and VBI expect PreHevbri to be available in these countries in early 2023.In the first nine months of 2022  third party product sales increased by 64.6% to €18.4 million from €11.2 million in the first nine months of 2021.Nine-Month 2022 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €249.9 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €69.8 million in the first nine months of 2021  an increase of 257.8%.Product sales  including COVID-19 vaccine sales  increased by 63.7% to €74.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €45.5 million in the first nine months of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed positively to €4.9 million of the change in product sales. Product sales from commercial products amounted to €50.6 million in the first nine months of 2022  an increase of 11.2% compared to the first nine months of 2021. Product sales related to COVID-19 amounted to €23.9 million.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales decreased by 32.1% to €22.9 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €33.7 million in the first nine months of 2021  primarily as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the DoD during the period. This decrease was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €19.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €4.6 million in the first nine months of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations also contributed positively for €4.6 million to the change in IXIARO® product sales. DUKORAL® also benefited from this recovery in the private travel market as sales increased significantly to €9.2 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €0.5 million in the first nine months of 2021. COVID-19 vaccine sales amounted to €23.9 million resulting from shipments to participating EU Member States and Bahrain. Third Party product sales increased by 64.6% to €18.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 from €11.2 million in the first nine months of 2021  driven by growth related to Valneva’s distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sale of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other Revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services  amounted to €175.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €24.4 million in the first nine months of 2021. This increase is attributable to €89.4 million of released refund liability as a result of the settlement with the UK government as well as a release of non-refundable advance payments from EU Member States amounting to €110.8 million. This was partially offset by €36.1 million of negative revenue resulting from an increase in the refund liability linked to the amendment to the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer. Valneva’s future contribution to the VLA15 Phase 3 study will go against the refund liability included in the balance sheet.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €202.7 million in the first nine months of 2022. The gross margin on commercial product sales amounted to 55.4% compared to 37.8% in the first nine months of 2021. COGS of €6.4 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 72.0%. COGS of €3.7 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 60.0%  which was positively impacted by provision releases resulting from reduced expiry risks on inventory. Of the remaining COGS in the first nine months of 2022  €12.4 million were related to the Third-Party products distribution business  €174.0 million to the COVID-19 vaccine business and €6.2 million to cost of services. COGS of the COVID-19 vaccine program included effects from the significant reduction of sales volumes to EU Member States. In the first nine months of 2021  overall COGS were €159.6 million  of which €142.4 million related to cost of goods and €17.2 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €75.4 million in the first nine months of 2022  compared to €117.2 million in the first nine months of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by lower clinical trials costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program advancing towards licensure as well as reduced spend on the COVID-19 program. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first nine months of 2022 amounted to €13.1 million compared to €15.0 million in the first nine months of 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first nine months of 2022 notably included €4.3 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €2.8 million in the first nine months of 2021. In the first nine months of 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €23.3 million from €31.7 million in the first nine months of 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a non-cash accrual adjustment of €30.6 million related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to a cost of €13.7 million in the first nine months of 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €7.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 from €16.0 million in the first nine months of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending and an increase of other expenses related to the provision for the ongoing Vivalis / Intercell merger litigation proceedings.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €57.1 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €237.6 million in the first nine months of 2021  of which the COVID-19 operating loss represented €14.2 million and €194.4 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021  respectively and the other segments represented €42.9 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €43.2 million in the first nine months of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in the first nine months of 2022 was €38.0 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €227.6 million in the first nine months of 2021.Net ResultIn the first nine months of 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €99.1 million compared to a net loss of €245.9 million in the first nine months of 2021.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in the first nine months of 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €39.8 million  compared to a net finance expense of €6.6 million in the first nine months of 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €26.5 million in the first nine months of 2022  primarily driven by non-cash revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €5.3 million in the first nine months of 2021. Interest expenses net of interest income were €13.3 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €11.9 million in the first nine months of 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €189.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €36.5 million of cash generated by operating activities in the first nine months of 2021. Cash outflows in the first nine months of 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period and non-cash revenues (cash received in previous periods)  while during the first nine months of 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments received related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €22.5 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to €69.9 million in the first nine months of 2021  both mainly a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €121.6 million in the first nine months of 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer as well as a draw-down in September on the credit facility provided by Deerfield & Orbimed24. Cash inflows in the first nine months of 2021 amounted to €74.6 million which was mainly a result of proceeds from issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement in May of 2021.Cash and cash equivalents decreased to €261.0 million as of September 30  2022  compared to €346.7 million as of December 31  2021 and consisted of €258.1 million in cash and €3.0 million in restricted cash. The cash decrease mainly resulted from COVID-19-related investments into fixed assets  R&D and Manufacturing expenses. Net proceeds from the recent global offering were received in October and are not included in the cash position reported per September 30  2022.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Nine months ending September 30 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Loss for the period (99.1) (245.9) Add: Income tax expense 2.2 1.6 Total Finance income (0.1) (0.2) Total Finance expense 13.4 12.1 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net 26.5 (5.3) Result from investments in associates - 0.1 Amortization 5.3 4.9 Depreciation 10.6 5.1 Impairment 3.3 - Adjusted EBITDA (38.0) (227.6)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

13048,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-reports-q3-revenue-growth-y-o-y-and-announces-significant-increase-in-subscription-and-service-prices-deployment-of-the-most-advanced-version-of-artpricecom-301673766.html,Artmarket.com reports Q3 revenue growth (y-o-y) and announces significant increase in subscription and service prices  deployment of the most advanced version of Artprice.com,PARIS  Nov. 10  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Artmarket.com reports Q3 revenue growth (y-o-y) and announces significant increase in subscription and service prices  deployment of the most advanced version of Artprice.com in mid-December which will lead  among other th…,"PARIS  Nov. 10  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Artmarket.com reports Q3 revenue growth (y-o-y) and announces significant increase in subscription and service prices  deployment of the most advanced version of Artprice.com in mid-December which will lead  among other things  to a change in the economic model with paid advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services  its Artist pages and its Web 3.0 dimension.Future events in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023In mid-December 2022  Artprice by Artmarket will deploy its new version  the most advanced in its history  that will allow it to provide a much more comprehensive response to customer inquiries and information queries in this digital decade. After a development phase extended by 18 months due to the Covid pandemic  this major revamp has involved all of Artprice's databases and services.After a call for tenders at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level and committed external consultants to audit and develop a complete overhaul of Artprice.com  with a solid UI/UX approach (UX and UI respectively stand for User Experience and User Interface). The results of this user-centric approach will be visible in mid-December.The new website will also boast a new economic model with the inclusion of paying advertisers fully integrated into its databases and services. These advertisers will be primarily the 6 400 auction houses worldwide affiliated with Artprice for more than two decades and which now conduct 98% of their sales online. They will now be able to highlight their future sales in paying advertiser mode  based on the search criteria used by Artprice's 5.4 million users. The resulting targeting will be extremely relevant.We note that for over 50 years  the economic model of auction houses has systematically involved advertising costs – announcing details of upcoming sales – that accounted for approximately 34% of their overall costs  regardless of the country or the size of their activity.Since auctions are now 98% advertised on the Internet  the pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their sales for a fee has found the best solution on our new website. It is only logical that auction houses now consider their advertisement of future sales (34% of the cost of the sale) makes more sense on the Internet rather than in the printed press.In the past  Artprice has always considered online advertising incompatible with its databases in terms of readability and notoriety. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to demand from auction houses for advertising while maintaining Artprice's core DNA.In the new roll-out  the 6 400 auction operators will be able to integrate and merge the announcements of their future sales into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  along with ""pushing"" the artists selected as favorites to Artprice's 5.4 million users (alerts by text messages  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  My Artists page  etc.).It is quite possible that the advertising revenue generated by these 6 400 auction houses affiliated with Artprice since 1997 will ultimately exceed our subscription revenue (currently 90% of Artprice's total revenue). Artprice therefore believes that by responding to a long-standing request from its partner auction houses  the new business model could double its future revenue.In responding to the numerous and repeated requests from its 6 400 affiliated auction houses around the world to be able to profitably advertise their future sales  Artprice has made every effort to remain faithful to its principle of prioritizing the readability of its databases.Significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in early January 2023   a complete overhaul of the Artists Pages in AI and Web 3.0  Art NFTs for better global visibility of the 800 000 artists listed by Artprice by ArtmarketArtmarket.com will be introducing a significant increase in subscriptions and services fees in January 2023 that will generate an increase in future income. As Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.The fee increases follow extensive consultation with Artprice by Artmarket customers who will continue to benefit from our databases and services  being well aware that they find essential data in Artprice that they cannot find anywhere else. Our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 must now be commercially exploited at its true value. Remember that our databases are continually updated with ultra-detailed and qualified data: well over a million new data logs every year.According to a consensus of art market professionals  Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making support tools  signatures & monograms  information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for €350/year  450 queries for €975/year and  in the event of overrun  €2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competitions' offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from €265 to €529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world. In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with further margin for additional price rises in the future.Somewhat counter-intuitively – given the geopolitical and economic context – the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100© index  which has clearly outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market. As the end of the year approaches  it is clear that the war in Ukraine and fears of a major recession have not had a negative impact on the art market.On 8 November last  AFP  the French Press Agency  highlighted this phenomenon in an article titled ""Collection of Microsoft co-founder could fetch over a billion dollars in New York""  adding ""By auctioning in New York the art collected by Paul Allen (Microsoft's co-founder who died in 2018)  Christie's is aiming for a historic sales record in a bold move that reflects a market whose indicators are higher than ever  despite the geopolitical and economic crises.""During December 2022  as part of our major revamp  we will be introducing significant changes to the presentation of our databases and Artist Pages on Artprice by Artmarket. This development  conceived with a UI/UX approach  will therefore be effective ahead of the tariff increase with the objective of boosting Artmarket.com's revenues from the very start of 2023.Conceived after 18 months of in-depth analysis by a highly specialized team of UI/UX consultants  the changes we are introducing take into account the sentiment of users when they navigate our digital media (databases and services). The objective of UX design is to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and/or prospective customers as much as possible in order to make it easier and more intuitive  both on mobile and desktop devices. As a result of these changes the expectations and needs of Artprice's customers and users will be better satisfied.Thanks to UX design  online navigation is more fluid and more effective. It eliminates the incomprehension that users often encounters in their daily online experiences and takes into account not just the logistics of online navigation  but also the 'emotional' aspect of online navigation.The Interface aspect (UI design) of our modifications has focused on enhancing the interaction of Artprice users with our databases and services. This approach has been used at all stages in the development of our new website  right through to its roll-out in mid-December 2022.Unlike UX (user experience)  UI is more focused on the visual aspect in order to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services. The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field in order to acquire new market shares.The Artists Pages are the principal and most common entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin. It is for this reason that our website revamp has aimed to reposition artists at the heart of the art market  a position that is inevitable with the production of Art NFTs which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This global overhaul of Artprice aims to give its customers and users a better experience  in line with their needs  after several years of collecting and analyzing their queries  in strict compliance with the legislation in force in Europe and the USA.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.In addition  the major overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will at last allow the exploitation of the largest proprietary collection of original manuscripts and printed sales catalogs in the world. Dating back to 1700  and owned by Artprice  this collection is the very foundation of Artprice's digital standardization of the art market and of its position as the World Leader in Art Market Information for the past 25 years.Thus  Artprice users and prospects will now be able to navigate from the Artist Pages to several centuries of knowledge that Artprice by Artmarket's historians and editors have been organizing over the last 25 years  allowing them to immerse themselves in the exceptional and mysterious history of the art market.These new pages will highlight the wealth of Artmarket.com's databases and services  with high added value. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) will allow access to very relevant and personalized recommendations  to enhance customers' knowledge of the art market and to generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more business revenue.Indeed  this feature takes Artprice by Artmarket clients and users into a Web 3.0 dimension and – by extension – into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.During the course of the development of our major roll-out scheduled in December 2022  Artprice listened to both its historical customers and its new customers and prospects.Indeed  with cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. Accustomed to speculation and risk-taking  but art enthusiasts and collectors nonetheless  they have absolutely no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe.These are the new clients of Artmarket.com  whose services they have frequently requested. Their main demand in recent years has been that we post art prices in ETH and BTC in all Artprice databases.This huge global community could not understand why Artprice's reference databases only quoted prices in the world's main fiat currencies  without the two main cryptocurrencies (ETH and BTC)  which weigh more than 82% of the 21 000 cryptocurrencies (excluding Stablecoins).Appreciating the business opportunity represented by 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs  Artprice by Artmarket's IT  econometric and marketing teams therefore moved quickly to respond positively to their demand.Artmarket.com has therefore once again taken a major step forward that required considerable reflection and an imposing volume of work. As a result since September 2022  Artprice now quotes 8 828 384 art auction results in Bitcoin (going back to 1 February 2011 when 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.7  £0.434031 and €0.50707) and 5 814 866 art auction results in Ethereum (going back to 7 August 2015 when 1 Ethereum was worth $3  £1.93626 and €2.735523).Naturally  the tens of millions of calculations underlying this ambitious project were made using the value of the respective cryptocurrencies on the days the respective sales were concluded. The values were calculated by Artmarket.com's proprietary IT systems.https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/09/12/artmarket_com-adds-ethereum-and-bitcoin-to-its-multi-currency-artprice-databases-to-meet-the-needs-of-its-customers-and-prepareSince 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population in order to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable and above all contextualized data.Indeed  when navigating our new website  clients and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of art market news and will be privileged players within a human and educational approach  which is often lacking in the world of the GAFAs.Over the years  Artprice  as the World Leader in Art Market Information  has been a partner in numerous essential and historic collaborations with artists. Their contributions have been clearly reflected in the development of our new interface with users.The other essential collaboration has of course been with the auction houses which will now have a growing interest in collaborating with Artprice. Henceforward we will promote their future sales with discreet and effective prestige  thereby generating new recurring income for Artprice with its proprietary Intranet  which has been the reference work tool for auction houses for many years.After two years of R&D – extended by the circumstances of the Covid pandemic – Artmarket.com customers  partners and members will be able to immerse themselves in a new experience at the heart of the art market. This is undoubtedly one of the founding steps for the future of Artprice by Artmarket  with its positioning fundamentally improved by the referencing of images on search engines (SEOs) and the dual objectives of increasing traffic in order to conquer new market shares and to monopolize the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs.According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice:""Artprice by Artmarket.com has patiently and methodically given itself all the means to evolve in response to the needs of Art Market professionals. All the indicators are positive for the future and we project a doubling of revenue  notably by opening up to paying advertisers integrated into our services and databases.We have also developed  since 2017  processes to optimize the use of our servers  by limiting the power required and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers by 40%. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow a better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies with regard to new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Server Group  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and which is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture and the sentiments of our customers.Moreover  as regards the exchange of Art NFTs on its Marketplace and given the current energy context  Artmarket.com is pleased to have preferred Ethereum for a long time and fully supports the remarks by France's Minister of the Economy  Mr. Bruno Le Maire  as indicated in a previous press release:https://www.actusnews.com/fr/artmarket/cp/2022/10/20/artmarket_com-already-positioned-on-nfts-with-artprice-reacts-to-an-interview-on-bfm-crypto-with-bruno-le-maire-and-notably-hisArtprice by Artmarket.com confirms that in the first two quarters of 2022  the phenomenon of Art NFTs became a lasting segment of the art market on all continents with an acceleration of turnover and volumes in the second half of 2022 due notably to the purge of crypto-currencies and much more favorable new legislation in the USA as well as the introduction of regulatory framework in Europe that prevents crypto-abuse/fraud and enhances the confidence of consumers  investors and operators.These regulations have been the subject of studies  colloquia and proposals to major French and European government bodies by Blanche Sousi and the Art & Law Institute  where Artprice by Artmarket has been heavily involved as a long-standing member since 1997.Artprice invites you to read the latest Banques Notes published by the European Center for Research in Banking and Finance  with the analysis of Blanche Sousi  Professor Emeritus of the University of Lyon 3  Jean Monnet Chair ad personam in European banking and monetary law:""The European Regulation MiCAR has just been adopted: are NFTs regulated?

It also includes the consolidation of the cash and cash equivalents of Versantis for the first time  which amounted to €5.1 million.RevenueRevenue2 for the first nine months of 2022 amounted to €14 129 thousand compared to €20 thousand for the same period in 2021.The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the partial recognition of the €40.0 million deferred income  which was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 following the conclusion of the strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with Ipsen on December 17  2021. The revenue recognized out of this deferred income amounted to €13 050 thousand for the first nine months of 2022.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with severe chronic liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs. GENFIT is a pioneer in the research and development of therapeutic and diagnostic solutions in liver diseases  with a rich history and strong scientific heritage spanning more than two decades.

Topline data is expected to be announced in the second quarter 2023. In 2021  GENFIT signed an exclusive licensing agreement with IPSEN to develop  manufacture and commercialize elafibranor in PBC and other indications.4 GENFIT is also developing GNS5613 in cholangiocarcinoma following the acquisition of exclusive rights in this indication from Genoscience Pharma in 20215. In ACLF  a Phase 1 clinical program with nitazoxanide has been initiated in 2021  and GENFIT further expanded its ACLF pipeline in 2022 via the acquisition of Swiss-based clinical-stage company Versantis  with a Phase 2 ready program evaluating liposomes technology and a preclinical stage small molecule. As part of its diagnostic solutions franchise  the Company entered into an agreement with Labcorp in 2021 to commercialize NASHnext®  powered by GENFIT’s proprietary diagnostic technology NIS4®  and recently developed NIS2+™  an evolutionary and optimized diagnostic tool in identifying at-risk NASH.GENFIT has facilities in Lille and Paris  France  and Cambridge  MA  USA.
