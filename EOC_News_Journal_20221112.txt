The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the convertible loan notes shall vest in Baklid Invest AS  CeWi Invest AS  Fougner Invest AS  Trellevika Invest AS  Fredrik Fougner  Skadi AS  TTC Invest AS and Windchange Invest AB. Prior to the proposal for the directed convertible notes issue  the Shareholder considered the possibility of proposing a rights issue but concluded that a rights issue would be significantly more time consuming and entail significantly higher costs and increased exposure to potential market volatility compared to a directed issue. Furthermore  it is considered that the current stock market climate makes it likely that  in the case of a rights issue  the issue would not be subscribed to the required extent and that guarantee commitments would therefore have to be procured to ensure that the Company is provided with sufficient capital  which in turn risks entailing additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such a guarantee subscription. In view of the above  the Shareholder has considered that a directed convertible notes issue on the proposed terms is the most advantageous for the Company and its shareholders  especially in view of the Company's need for immediate financing to clear overdue debt and for continued expansion of the business.The nominal amount of the convertible debenture shall be SEK 1 or multiples thereof. The loan carries an annual interest rate of 6 per cent in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 1B . Terms of the convertible loan notes issue  including the conversion price  have been determined following arms lengths negotiations with the subscribers.

Registration begins at 07:45 (CET).PARTICIPATIONShareholders who wish to attend the extraordinary general meeting must:be recorded as shareholders in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB on Friday 17 November 2022;notify the Company of their participation no later than on 21 November 2022  preferably before 16:00 (CET).

The notification should be accompanied  where applicable  by powers of attorney  registration certificates and other documents of authority.NOMINEE-REGISTERED SHARESShareholders whose shares are nominee-registered must  in order to have the right to attend the extraordinary general meeting  temporarily re-register their shares in their own name. Such registration  which normally takes a few days  must be effected (registered with Euroclear Sweden AB) no later 21 November 2022 and nominees should therefore be instructed to do so well in advance.PROXYShareholders represented by proxy shall issue a written and dated power of attorney signed by the shareholder. The power of attorney may not be issued earlier than one year before the date of the general meeting  with the exception of the power of attorney specifies a longer period  up to a maximum of five years. A power of attorney issued by a legal entity shall have a registration certificate attached  or if such certificate does not exist  equivalent documents.

A power of attorney form may be ordered from the Company and are available on the Company‚Äôs website www.hoylu.com .PROPOSED AGENDAOpening of the extraordinary general meeting Appointment of a chairman of the general meeting Preparation and approval of the voting register Appointment of one (1) or two (2) persons to verify the minutes of the meeting Determination of whether the extraordinary general meeting was duly convened Approval of the agenda Resolution on directed issue of convertible notes Resolution to authorize the board of directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions Closure of the extraordinary general meetingPROPOSED RESOLUTIONSResolution on directed issue of convertible notes (item 7)The shareholder Alden AS (the ‚ÄúShareholder‚Äù) proposes that the company shall raise a convertible loan in a nominal amount not exceeding SEK 37 042 807 through a private placement of convertible loan notes  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 3 053 772.70 SEK upon full conversion of the loan notes. The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the convertible loan notes shall vest in Baklid Invest AS  CeWi Invest AS  Fougner Invest AS  Trellevika Invest AS  Fredrik Fougner  Skadi AS  TTC Invest AS and Windchange Invest AB. Prior to the proposal for the directed convertible notes issue  the Shareholder considered the possibility of proposing a rights issue but concluded that a rights issue would be significantly more time consuming and entail significantly higher costs and increased exposure to potential market volatility compared to a directed issue. Furthermore  it is considered that the current stock market climate makes it likely that  in the case of a rights issue  the issue would not be subscribed to the required extent and that guarantee commitments would therefore have to be procured to ensure that the Company is provided with sufficient capital  which in turn risks entailing additional costs and/or further dilution depending on the type of consideration paid for such a guarantee subscription. In view of the above  the Shareholder has considered that a directed convertible notes issue on the proposed terms is the most advantageous for the Company and its shareholders  especially in view of the Company's need for immediate financing to clear overdue debt and for continued expansion of the business.The nominal amount of the convertible debenture shall be SEK 1 or multiples thereof. The loan carries an annual interest rate of 6 per cent in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 1B .

13082,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4556492-intercontinental-exchange-great-quality-attractively-priced,Intercontinental Exchange Stock: Great Quality  Attractively Priced (ICE),Intercontinental Exchange is a fantastic business in a fantastic industry - a rare 'natural monopoly' whose returns are not regulated. Read more more on ICE stock.,"Spencer Platt/Getty Images NewsSince my previous article a couple of months ago  Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) has made some  quite immaterial  gains: about 1% from capital gains and 0.5% from dividends. To be honest  I think 1.5% in two months  which annualizes to slightly over 9% a year  is pretty all right (you can tell I'm not a very aggressive investor). Its price now stands at $102.54. Is it still a buy?I believe ICE remains undervalued at the present  that it had a consistently excellent track record in the past  barring one odd blip which will be discussed later; and that its long-term future prospects are brilliant. In this article I explain why.Company profileICE operates three lines of businesses: Exchanges; Fixed Income and Data Services; and Mortgage Technologies. In the Exchanges segment  ICE operates a number of regulated marketplaces for trading and clearing financial instruments  such as shares and derivatives (think the New York Stock Exchange  which it owns). In the Fixed Income and Data Services  ICE provides services such as fixed income pricing  reference data  indices  and analytics. In the Mortgage Technologies segment  ICE uses machine learning algorithms to provide streamlined and simplified solutions for mortgage lenders  which allow them to originate loans more efficiently.They have minority stakes in subsidiary companies. Among them the point of interest is Bakkt  the black sheep of the family. I will touch on it briefly later.Their main competitors are other exchanges based in the US  such as Nasdaq (NDAQ) and the CME Group (CME). They also compete against exchanges worldwide  such as the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Deutsche Boerse (OTCPK:DBOEY)Some statistics at a glance  as of close of business on November. 10  2022:Share price: $102.54Market cap: $54.3 billionP/E ratio: 22.7Debt / EBITDA ratio: 3.8Operating margin: 39.3%Profit margin: 14.4%Upside caseIn this section I describe why I believe ICE shares are undervalued.DCF ValuationI use the discounted cash flow method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 42% above its current price. I consider DCF appropriate to use for the valuation because in the last 10 years ICE has been profitable every year  and has paid out dividends in every year.The DCF method gives the fair present value of a share as:V0 = D1 / (r - g)Calculating gI estimate g  the sustainable growth rate for ICE  as:g = RR x ROEMy review of sell-side analyst reports suggests that the median forward-looking return on equity (ROE) for ICE is slightly below 14.8%.On a trailing twelve months basis (for the avoidance of doubt  from Q3 2021 through to Q2 2022)  ICE has earnings per share of $4.51  and paid a dividend of $1.47. The retention ratio is calculated as retained earnings divided by earnings per share. In this case  I find that the retention ratio is 67.4%.This yields a sustainable dividend growth rate of 10.0%. I note that this is materially above the S&P 500's historical dividend CAGR of 6.5%  but it is materially below ICE's historical dividend CAGR (14.2%)  as well as its net profit CAGR (9.3%)--not only are exchanges profitable businesses  ICE is also nursing a number of promising ventures in the wings. Therefore  I consider 10.0% a reasonable estimate of ICE's dividend growth rate.Calculating D1ICE pays dividends quarterly. Therefore  I set D1 as the sum of the four dividend payments in the next twelve months  which will occur in Dec. 2022  and Mar.  Jun. and Sep. 2023.ICE has already declared a dividend of $1.52 for the year 2022. Of this amount  they will pay the remaining quarter in December. Therefore  I set $0.76 as first half of D1.I assume the dividend payments in 2023 will grow at the sustainable growth rate of 10.0%. Therefore  I set $0.418 as the quarterly payments for 2023. Quite nicely  it is also the median analyst forecast for ICE's dividend payment for the year.In this case  I set D1 as $1.64.Calculating rI estimate r  my required rate of return for ICE  as:r = RFR + beta * (TMR - RFR)Since the inception of the S&P 500 in 1957  it has provided investors with an annualized total return of 11.88%. I use the most recent Effective Fed Funds Rate for which data is available (as of November 2022) of 3.83% as the risk free rate. I note that ICE's 5-year monthly equity beta is around 0.90.Therefore  I calculate the required rate of return for ICE asr = 3.83% + 0.9 * (11.88% - 3.83%) = 11.1%.Calculating V0In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $1.64 / (11.1% - 10.0%) = $145.75. This is 42% above its current price of $102.54 as of Nov. 10  2022: a substantial margin of safety.I show my work in Table 1 below.Table 1: DCF valuationEPS $ [a] Dividend in Year 0 $ [b] 1.47 Retention ratio % [c] = 1- [a]/[b] 67.4 ROE % [d] 14.8 Sustainable growth % [e] = [c]*[d] 10.0 Required rate of return % [f] 11.1 Dividend in Year 1 $ [g] 1.64 Fair value in Year 0 $ [h] = [g]/([f]-[e]) 145.75 Share price at valuation date $ [i] 102.54 Implied upside % [j] = [h] / [i] - 1 42 Click to enlargeEV/EBITDA ValuationAs a cross-check  I use the EV/EBITDA valuation method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 26% above its current price. I favor the DCF approach (when it is feasible) over the EV/EBITDA approach  as the method of finding suitable comparables is  in my view  neither exactly a science nor an art  but something close to black magic--highly subjective and sensitive to manipulation.Nevertheless  EV/EBITDA can be useful as a sense-check to the DCF approach. Let's take a look.I select five comparables for ICE: NASDAQ  CME  Cboe  the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Deutsche Boerse AG. In Table 2 below I note the values for their EVs  EBITDAs  and the corresponding ratios  as well as the average of their EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.9x. (Note that I cannot use Euronext  because it has negative EV.)Table 2: EV / EBITDA ratiosComparators EV EBITDA EV / EBITDA CME Group $ b 62.7 4.0 15.7 Cboe Global Markets $ b 14.7 0.6 23.6 NASDAQ $ b 36.7 1.9 19.7 London Stock Exchange $ b 59.2 4.4 13.5 Deutsche B√∂rse $ b 40.4 2.6 15.5 Average 17.6 Click to enlargeI apply the average ratio of 17.6x to estimate the fair value of ICE's EV. I note that EV is the sum of market capitalization and total debt  less cash and cash equivalents. Therefore  I subtract  from my estimate of the fair value of ICE's EV  the total debt  and then add back cash and cash equivalents  to arrive at a fair estimate of ICE's market capitalization.In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $129.35. This is 26% above its current price of $102.54 as of Nov. 10  2022  well below the value estimated from the DCF approach  but still a decent margin of safety.I show my calculations in Table 3 below.Table 3: EV / EBITDA valuationEBITDA $ b [a] 4.9 Fair value EV $ b [b] = [a] x 17.6 85.7 Total debt $ b [c] 18.4 Cash and cash equivalents $ b [d] 1.2 Fair value market cap $ b [e] = [b]-[c]+[d] 69 Actual market cap $ b [f] 54.3 Implied upside [g] = [e]/[f]-1 26.2% Share price at valuation date $ [h] 102.54 Implied fair value of share price $ [i] = [h]*(1+[g]) 129.35 Click to enlargeDownside caseIn this section  I discuss the downside case for ICE.Bakkt in perilIn my previous EV/EBITDA valuation approach  I estimated a $148.70 fair value for ICE using a 16.4x multiple. Why has the fair value dropped to $129.35 when I now use a higher  17.6x multiple?Clearly  EBITDA must have decreased. Specifically  whereas interest  tax  depreciation and amortization have not much changed  earnings that has  to be blunt  dived off a cliff.The reason for that has been mentioned in my previous article: Bakkt Rekt. I wrote:in their 2021 financial statement [ICE] noted  with smug self-satisfaction  that 'We recorded a pre-tax gain on the (Bakkt) transaction of $1.4 billion' (p. 105)... So what gives? Bakkt's share price  which plunged from a high of $42.56 to $2.56 as of Sep. 2  2022. How did ICE put it  also in their 2021 FS? ""We may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in Bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model."" (p. 20)Yes  the collapse of Bakkt's market value  and of the cryptocurrency market more generally  has materially and adversely affected ICE's earnings  which took a $1.1 billion impairment on the value of its holdings in Bakkt in Oct. 28. But  really  it's not so bad because it's (i) as expected; and (ii) perhaps even not quite as bad as expected: after all  they recorded a $1.4 billion gain from the transaction  so there is theoretically $0.3 billion still left over.To be clear  I believe Bakkt is a risky  and perhaps given the current economic climate a rather unwise  investment; and I believe it will probably continue to weigh down ICE's performance. But I also think the worst of it is likely over. The lion's share of Bakkt's market cap is already wiped out.The impact of the $1.1 billion impairment can be easily detected in ICE's financial performance over time. For example  ICE's revenue growth looks fine:Figure 1: Historical revenue growthI pro-rate 2022 revenue by multiplying revenues in the first three quarters by 4/3. (My analysis  based ICE financial statements)If anything  its latest quarterly report for Q3 2022 indicates that it experienced a year-on-year growth in revenue from Q3 2021  from $2.28 billion to $2.39 billion  which  considering the turbulent economic climate  is a great signal of its underlying business strength. (Similarly  its operating profits  which are unaffected by Bakkt  rose from $892 million to $932 million in the same period.)However  its profit margins dived sharply from 44% in 2021 to 14% in 2022. Worse  in Q3 2022 alone  it has negative profit margins of -7.3%. That's the first time it's registered a (quarterly) loss since it acquired NYSE in 2014.Figure 2: Historical marginsI use Q1-Q3 average margins for 2022  and end-of-year margins for all other years (My analysis  based on ICE financial statements)Inflation and interest rate risksGiven that inflationary forces are still likely to remain strong  the interest rate risks to ICE remain considerable. Ukraine and Russia continue to be at war  China sticks proudly to its frankly  in my opinion  insane policy of zero-Covid lockdowns  and the disappointing Republican performance in the midterms means the Democratic impulse to expansionary policies will likely remain unchecked.As a result  inflation remains well above the 2% Fed target and will stay there for some time. Likewise  the Fed is likely to keep increasing its funds rate  as long as inflation remains high.When interest rates are high  it is more attractive to keep money in a savings account  rather than use it for trading stocks and shares. Because of this  there may be lower trading activities  and hence lower sales  on ICE's platforms. Higher interest rates also make mortgages less attractive to potential homebuyers  which may reduce the demand for ICE's Mortgage Technology Services.Finally  if and when a recession strikes  the stock market rout is certain to affect trading activities on ICE adversely. But  fingers crossed  perhaps the world may yet avoid a recession  at least in the US.On the other hand  CPI inflation in October was 7.7%  and well below the 8.0% expected by economists. This may mark an inflection point in inflation: I believe the world is adjusting to the lockdown in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If so  the inflationary shocks of these events will continue to decline. Then ICE may yet experience a resurgence in sales and profits as trading activities pick up again.This prospect remains highly uncertain  but that is where the profit opportunity comes in. Once it becomes certain  one way or another  the market will price it in. Keeping tabs on inflation and interest rate movements will be crucial for investors of ICE.ConclusionI rate ICE a buy because  given what we are certain of now  I believe the fair value of ICE shares is around 42% above the current market value of their shares. But I do not rate it a strong buy  because there remains substantial risks. If you are a long-term investor  I do not believe you will regret having ICE in your portfolio; and I believe $102.54 is an attractive price to buy more ICE shares.",positive,0.99,0.01,0.0,mixed,0.57,0.14,0.29,True,English,"['Intercontinental Exchange Stock', 'Great Quality', 'recent Effective Fed Funds Rate', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'trailing twelve months basis', 'London Stock Exchange Group', '5-year monthly equity beta', 'sustainable dividend growth rate', 'next twelve months', 'sustainable growth rate', 'Getty Images News', 'excellent track record', 'one odd blip', 'long-term future prospects', 'machine learning algorithms', 'cash flow method', 'sell-side analyst reports', 'median analyst forecast', 'risk free rate', 'historical dividend CAGR', 'net profit CAGR', 'The DCF method', 'median forward-looking return', 'annualized total return', 'fixed income pricing', 'four dividend payments', 'Mortgage Technologies segment', 'fair present value', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'two months', 'required rate', 'CME Group', 'Profit margin', 'fair value', 'mortgage lenders', 'Spencer Platt', 'aggressive investor', 'Company profile', 'three lines', 'financial instruments', 'simplified solutions', 'minority stakes', 'subsidiary companies', 'black sheep', 'main competitors', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Market cap', 'P/E ratio', 'EBITDA ratio', 'Operating margin', 'DCF Valuation', 'last 10 years', 'retention ratio', 'S&P 500', 'promising ventures', 'reasonable estimate', 'remaining quarter', 'first half', 'quarterly payments', 'substantial margin', 'Exchanges segment', 'current price', 'reference data', 'previous article', 'capital gains', 'profitable businesses', 'Data Services', 'other exchanges', 'Upside case', 'Share price', 'Calculating D1', 'ICE shares', '11.1 Dividend', 'D1.', 'NYSE', 'immaterial', 'dividends', 'buy', 'past', 'number', 'regulated', 'marketplaces', 'trading', 'derivatives', 'indices', 'analytics', 'streamlined', 'loans', 'point', 'interest', 'Bakkt', 'family', 'Nasdaq', 'NDAQ', 'LSEG', 'DBOEY', 'statistics', 'glance', 'close', 'November', 'Debt', 'section', 'V0', 'ROE', 'review', 'avoidance', 'doubt', 'Q3', 'Q2', 'earnings', 'wings', 'sum', 'Dec.', 'Mar.', 'Jun.', 'Sep.', 'amount', 'December', 'RFR', 'inception', 'investors', 'Nov.', 'safety', 'work', 'EPS', 'date', '14.', '0.0', '3.']",2022-11-11,2022-11-12,seekingalpha.com

This financing solution with Kepler Cheuvreux has already been a well-proven success for Global Bioenergies: the two-year contract signed in August 2020 raised ‚Ç¨13.6 million and the valuation of Global Bioenergies doubled over the same period.This transaction aims to strengthen the Company‚Äôs financial structure. The funds raised will mainly go towards prefinancing the production of Isonaturane¬Æ 12 on the new ‚ÄúHorizon 2‚Äù line and performing engineering studies for the 2 000 tonne/year Horizon 3 plant  construction of which is to be financed via an SPV in 2023. This transaction was implemented in accordance with the 12th resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders of 18 June 2021.In accordance with the terms of the agreement  Kepler Cheuvreux has undertaken to subscribe  at its own initiative  to a maximum of 2 490 000 shares representing an issue amount of around ‚Ç¨11 million2 over a maximum period of 24 months  provided that the contractual terms and conditions are met. The shares will be issued on the basis of an average volume-weighted share price over the two trading days preceding each issue  less a maximum discount of 5.0%. These conditions allow Kepler Cheuvreux  acting as financial intermediary  to guarantee the subscription of shares throughout the term of the agreement.Global Bioenergies retains the option to suspend or terminate the agreement at any time.If the facility is fully utilised  a shareholder holding 1.00% of Global Bioenergies‚Äô share capital prior to the implementation of the new equity line would see his or her interest reduced to 0.86%3 of the share capital on a non-diluted basis.The number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be communicated on a monthly basis on the Global Bioenergies website.Story continuesThis issue will not give rise to the preparation of a prospectus subject to the approval of the AMF.Samuel Dubruque  Chief Financial Officer of Global Bioenergies  said: ‚ÄúThe Company has now embarked on commercial production and aims to produce by the end of 2023 three batches of several tonnes of Isonaturane¬Æ 12 each intended for major make-up companies. Meanwhile  an SPV is being created for the next plant  known as Horizon 3  which will be larger  integrated and capable of producing at costs compatible with the extensive skincare and haircare markets. During this bustling period  an equity line such as the one renewed today with our partner  Kepler Cheuvreux  will strengthen our available cash (‚Ç¨7.3 million at present) in a flexible and adaptable manner  and will round out the range of financing solutions required for our development.‚ÄùAbout GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

We are very pleased with today‚Äôs outcome as we continue our mission to improve lives of people living with inflammatory diseases.‚ÄùThe product labels of all JAK inhibitors will be updated to include a precautionary approach for patients aged 65 years or above  those at increased risk of major cardiovascular problems (such as heart attack or stroke)  those who smoke or have done so for a long time in the past and those at increased risk of cancer. For those at-risk patients  the recommendation is that JAK inhibitors  including Jyseleca  should be used only if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. The CHMP followed PRAC‚Äôs recommendation that JAK inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for blood clots in the lungs and in deep veins (venous thromboembolism  VTE) other than those listed above.Following today‚Äôs CHMP opinion  filgotinib 200mg once daily remains the recommended dose for the treatment of patients with RA. For patients with UC  filgotinib 200mg once daily remains the recommended dose for induction and maintenance therapy. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients aged 65 years or above and/or at risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE)  VTE or malignancy  namely 100mg once daily dose in patients with RA  which can be escalated to 200mg in case of insufficient disease control. For at-risk patients with UC  the initiation dose remains unchanged  but a maintenance dose of 100mg should be considered. In case of a flare of disease  the dose should be escalated to 200mg once daily. For long-term treatment in patients with above risk factors  the lowest effective dose should be used.‚ÄúThe recommendation by the PRAC reflects the concerns raised by the substance class mainly in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis ‚Äù said Dr. Stefan Schreiber  Professor of Medicine and Gastroenterology at the Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel  Director of the Clinic for Internal Medicine at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Leader of Translational Inflammation Research Group in the Kiel University. ‚ÄúIt is comforting to see that we still have the option for a benefit-oriented use of filgotinib in ulcerative colitis to provide fast anti-inflammatory efficacy to the main patient group.‚ÄùProfessor Lars Erik V√∏lund Kristensen  Professor and CSO at the Parker Institute  University of Copenhagen and Associate Professor at Lund University  Sweden  said  ""It is reassuring to see that we can still use JAK inhibitors to help a large proportion of our arthritis patients to obtain fast acting and effective anti-inflammatory treatment. I find that PRAC's recommendation harmonizes well with the concerns raised by the Oral Surveillance study  which included older rheumatoid arthritis patients with cardiovascular risk factors.""The CHMP opinion follows the recommendation of the PRAC which carried out a safety review (Article 20 procedure) of all EU-approved JAK inhibitors  including filgotinib  following the Oral Surveillance data on tofacitinib and recent data from a retrospective observational study with baricitinib. The Article 20 procedure is a specific pharmacovigilance (PV) procedure which allowed the EMA to investigate the quality  efficacy  and safety issues for one or more centrally approved products ‚Äì in this case a safety review on MACE  VTE  serious infections  malignancies  and mortality for the JAK inhibitors authorised in inflammatory diseases.The European Commission decision is expected by January 2023  approximately 60 days after today‚Äôs CHMP opinion  following which the language in the ‚Äòspecial warnings and precautions for use‚Äô and the ‚Äòposology‚Äô sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) will be updated.About filgotinibFilgotinib is marketed as Jyseleca in the European Union (incl. Norway)  Great Britain  and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

RA often follows a painful  progressively debilitating course  depriving patients of the ability to continue their daily lives and leading to physical disability. Despite current treatments  RA continues to pose a substantial burden to people living with the disease  comprised of the daily health issues directly related to their RA  such as pain  and the complications of managing comorbid conditions.1 2 3About ulcerative colitisUlcerative colitis (UC) is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that occurs as a result of an abnormal immune system response. Across Europe an estimated 2.5 - 3 million people4 are affected by IBD  which includes UC and Crohn‚Äôs disease (CD). UC is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by periods of flare ups followed by remission. In addition to the physical impact from flare ups  there is also a psychological impact associated with UC. It causes significant impairments on quality of life and a poor prognosis is often seen in patients with symptoms of moderate to severe UC at diagnosis.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

We are very pleased with today‚Äôs outcome as we continue our mission to improve lives of people living with inflammatory diseases.‚ÄùThe product labels of all JAK inhibitors will be updated to include a precautionary approach for patients aged 65 years or above  those at increased risk of major cardiovascular problems (such as heart attack or stroke)  those who smoke or have done so for a long time in the past and those at increased risk of cancer. For those at-risk patients  the recommendation is that JAK inhibitors  including Jyseleca  should be used only if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. The CHMP followed PRAC‚Äôs recommendation that JAK inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for blood clots in the lungs and in deep veins (venous thromboembolism  VTE) other than those listed above.Story continuesFollowing today‚Äôs CHMP opinion  filgotinib 200mg once daily remains the recommended dose for the treatment of patients with RA. For patients with UC  filgotinib 200mg once daily remains the recommended dose for induction and maintenance therapy. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients aged 65 years or above and/or at risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE)  VTE or malignancy  namely 100mg once daily dose in patients with RA  which can be escalated to 200mg in case of insufficient disease control. For at-risk patients with UC  the initiation dose remains unchanged  but a maintenance dose of 100mg should be considered. In case of a flare of disease  the dose should be escalated to 200mg once daily. For long-term treatment in patients with above risk factors  the lowest effective dose should be used.‚ÄúThe recommendation by the PRAC reflects the concerns raised by the substance class mainly in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis ‚Äù said Dr. Stefan Schreiber  Professor of Medicine and Gastroenterology at the Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel  Director of the Clinic for Internal Medicine at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Leader of Translational Inflammation Research Group in the Kiel University. ‚ÄúIt is comforting to see that we still have the option for a benefit-oriented use of filgotinib in ulcerative colitis to provide fast anti-inflammatory efficacy to the main patient group.‚ÄùProfessor Lars Erik V√∏lund Kristensen  Professor and CSO at the Parker Institute  University of Copenhagen and Associate Professor at Lund University  Sweden  said  ""It is reassuring to see that we can still use JAK inhibitors to help a large proportion of our arthritis patients to obtain fast acting and effective anti-inflammatory treatment. I find that PRAC's recommendation harmonizes well with the concerns raised by the Oral Surveillance study  which included older rheumatoid arthritis patients with cardiovascular risk factors.""The CHMP opinion follows the recommendation of the PRAC which carried out a safety review (Article 20 procedure) of all EU-approved JAK inhibitors  including filgotinib  following the Oral Surveillance data on tofacitinib and recent data from a retrospective observational study with baricitinib. The Article 20 procedure is a specific pharmacovigilance (PV) procedure which allowed the EMA to investigate the quality  efficacy  and safety issues for one or more centrally approved products ‚Äì in this case a safety review on MACE  VTE  serious infections  malignancies  and mortality for the JAK inhibitors authorised in inflammatory diseases.The European Commission decision is expected by January 2023  approximately 60 days after today‚Äôs CHMP opinion  following which the language in the ‚Äòspecial warnings and precautions for use‚Äô and the ‚Äòposology‚Äô sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) will be updated.About filgotinibFilgotinib is marketed as Jyseleca in the European Union (incl.

Both quarterly revenue and earning were higher than the quarterly average for the first half year. Also  from an operational standpoint our key divisions ‚Äì Dredging & Inland Infra and Offshore Energy ‚Äì had a good quarter.Boskalis‚Äô strategy is structured around three activity clusters that bring value to society with the objective of creating sustainable growth. During the last quarter  numerous impressive and impactful projects were under execution of which a selection is highlighted below.Creating Innovative InfrastructureAs Boskalis  we facilitate world trade  support economic development  and create infrastructure and new land for society. Projects contributing to this pillar include the following.In the Philippines  the construction of a huge sand body measuring nearly 1 700 hectares on the outskirts of Manila for the new Manila International Airport is in full swing. The dredging vessels  including the largest within the fleet  have delivered more than one third of the required total volume of 150 million cubic meters. As part of the project scope  a 360-meter-long quay wall is being constructed with the use of six large caissons that were transported from Spain by our heavy transport vessel BOKA Vanguard. The project is being executed in line with strict international environmental and social standards.In Denmark  the construction of the Fehmarnbelt tunnel that connects Scandinavia to Central Europe is in full progressing. The work harbor on the Danish end of the tunnel has been completed and work on the dredging of the 18 kilometer long tunnel trench is underway. Once completed  this will be the longest submersed tunnel in the world reducing the rail travel time between Hamburg and Copenhagen from 4.5 hours to 2.5 hours which will also result in a significant reduction of CO2 emissions.In Finland  Boskalis was awarded the 2022 Project of the Year Award by the Finnish Project Management Association for the deepening of the Vuosaari Channel in the port of Helsinki. The project scope included the deepening of the existing access channel to 13 meters and a significant part of the dredged material was reused for the reclamation of land for the new residential and office area Hernesaari in the Finnish capital. Boskalis was praised for its active communications with the local community.A noteworthy newly acquired project concerns the development of the Europa Terminal for the port of Antwerp in Belgium to ensure that the port can continue to receive the largest container ships and increase capacity by a third.Advancing the Energy TransitionBoskalis seeks to help expand access to renewable power and facilitates the energy transition by developing infrastructure to deliver affordable and clean energy. During the past quarter  a number of key projects contributed to this cluster.In Taiwan  Boskalis has been active on multiple offshore wind projects  the largest of which is the Changfang & Xidao development. The recently commissioned crane vessel Bokalift 2 has rounded off its 2022 installation campaign of jackets and pinpiles. The remaining jackets and pinpiles will be installed in 2023.In France  Boskalis together with its consortium partners recently completed the installation scope of 71 Gravity Base Structures (GBS) that serve as the turbine foundations for F√©camp offshore wind. In addition to the seabed preparation scope  Boskalis was responsible for the scour protection and ballasting of these concrete foundations. The project is expected to generate sufficient electricity to meet the domestic requirements of more than 770 000 people with an estimated reduction of two million tons of CO2 per annum.Survey and Subsea Services provide specialist services to the offshore energy sector. The third quarter utilization of the fleet was exceptionally high. In addition to the deployment of vessels in the Middle East  a significant amount of work was carried out in the North Sea.Protection through Climate AdaptationFor more than a century Boskalis has been active in providing protection against the forces of nature. Today  we help protect populations and the natural environment from the consequences of climate change  such as rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions through our coastal defense and riverbank protection activities. A selection of projects currently under execution include the following.Early 2022 Boskalis was awarded the contract to protect a part of the eroded coastline of Togo and Benin in Western Africa. The coastal protection project is part of the West African Coastal Areas Management (WACA) program.In the Netherlands  the multi-year project to reinforce the Markermeer dikes north of Amsterdam is in full swing. The Markermeer dikes are part of the Zuyder Sea dikes that have protected the hinterland for centuries from the former Zuyder Sea and now from the Markermeer lake. The dike reinforcement is necessary because more than 30 kilometers of the dikes no longer meet the standards for water safety  while nearly 1.2 million people live in the hinterland. The project is part of the national flood protection program and is being executed in an innovative alliance contract.Distinguishing AssetsTogether with our human capital  Boskalis‚Äô strength lies in its ability to deploy proprietary  distinguishing assets.The recently commissioned Bokalift 2 crane vessel is currently undergoing a further modification with two tools being added to the vessel for offshore wind projects. The US Southfork and Revolution Wind farms require the installation of 2 300-ton monopiles measuring up to 114 meters long and 10 meters in diameter next year. Currently  an upending hinge is being prepared for installation in Singapore which will be used to upright the monopiles into a vertical position. Once installed  the Bokalift 2 will sail for Rotterdam where a motion compensated pile gripper frame will be installed in early 2023.Boskalis recently expanded its offshore fleet with the acquisition of the BOKA Northern Ocean Construction Support Vessel (CSV). This is the fourth CSV in the series BOKA Tiamat  BOKA Atlantic and BOKA Southern Ocean. With her large deck space and 400-ton crane  the BOKA Northern Ocean is a CSV that belongs to the high-end CSV market. This is a very important market for Boskalis ranging from installation work for Subsea Services or Subsea Cables to floating wind farms. Thanks to its A&R system (abandonment and recovery) with winches  the new CSV can lower objects of up to 350 tons to depths of up to 3 000 meters.Looking aheadLooking ahead  the order book stands at EUR 5.1 billion offering a solid foundation for the rest of this year and the period thereafter. Based on the fleet planning and works in portfolio  Boskalis‚Äô full year EBITDA outlook is unchanged. Adjusted for exceptional items  the 2022 EBITDA is expected to approximate EUR 500 million. For 2022  the unchanged capital expenditures outlook is approximately EUR 450 million  including dry-dockings however excluding possible acquisitions.Furthermore  the financial position of Boskalis is very solid and improved in the course of the quarter to a net cash position of EUR 207 million  excluding lease liabilities. Looking at the opportunities in the market  Boskalis intends to further invest in sustainable growth in line with its strategic agenda.The public offer by HAL for all outstanding shares of Boskalis was concluded in September. HAL acquired more than 95% of all the shares during the (post) offer period which has resulted in a delisting of Boskalis. As of 9 November 2022  Boskalis is no longer listed on Euronext Amsterdam.FOR FURTHER INFORMATIONMartijn L.D.

This financing solution with Kepler Cheuvreux has already been a well-proven success for Global Bioenergies: the two-year contract signed in August 2020 raised ‚Ç¨13.6 million and the valuation of Global Bioenergies doubled over the same period.This transaction aims to strengthen the Company‚Äôs financial structure. The funds raised will mainly go towards prefinancing the production of Isonaturane¬Æ 12 on the new ‚ÄúHorizon 2‚Äù line and performing engineering studies for the 2 000 tonne/year Horizon 3 plant  construction of which is to be financed via an SPV in 2023. This transaction was implemented in accordance with the 12th resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders of 18 June 2021.In accordance with the terms of the agreement  Kepler Cheuvreux has undertaken to subscribe  at its own initiative  to a maximum of 2 490 000 shares representing an issue amount of around ‚Ç¨11 million2 over a maximum period of 24 months  provided that the contractual terms and conditions are met. The shares will be issued on the basis of an average volume-weighted share price over the two trading days preceding each issue  less a maximum discount of 5.0%. These conditions allow Kepler Cheuvreux  acting as financial intermediary  to guarantee the subscription of shares throughout the term of the agreement.Global Bioenergies retains the option to suspend or terminate the agreement at any time.If the facility is fully utilised  a shareholder holding 1.00% of Global Bioenergies‚Äô share capital prior to the implementation of the new equity line would see his or her interest reduced to 0.86%3 of the share capital on a non-diluted basis.The number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be communicated on a monthly basis on the Global Bioenergies website.This issue will not give rise to the preparation of a prospectus subject to the approval of the AMF.Samuel Dubruque  Chief Financial Officer of Global Bioenergies  said: ‚ÄúThe Company has now embarked on commercial production and aims to produce by the end of 2023 three batches of several tonnes of Isonaturane¬Æ 12 each intended for major make-up companies. Meanwhile  an SPV is being created for the next plant  known as Horizon 3  which will be larger  integrated and capable of producing at costs compatible with the extensive skincare and haircare markets. During this bustling period  an equity line such as the one renewed today with our partner  Kepler Cheuvreux  will strengthen our available cash (‚Ç¨7.3 million at present) in a flexible and adaptable manner  and will round out the range of financing solutions required for our development.‚ÄùAbout GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

November 11  2022. The European Medicines Agency‚Äôs Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion  recommending the approval of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In September 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis.Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient‚Äôs quality of life among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful ‚Äì with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin ‚Äì and can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  showing Dupixent significantly reduced itch (the primary endpoint) and skin lesions compared to placebo. Dupixent also significantly improved health-related quality of life while reducing measures of skin pain and symptoms of anxiety/depression. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included conjunctivitis.The use of Dupixent in adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

13104,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4556492-intercontinental-exchange-great-quality-attractively-priced,Intercontinental Exchange Stock: Great Quality  Attractively Priced (ICE),Intercontinental Exchange is a fantastic business in a fantastic industry - a rare 'natural monopoly' whose returns are not regulated. Read more more on ICE stock.,"Spencer Platt/Getty Images NewsSince my previous article a couple of months ago  Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) has made some  quite immaterial  gains: about 1% from capital gains and 0.5% from dividends. To be honest  I think 1.5% in two months  which annualizes to slightly over 9% a year  is pretty all right (you can tell I'm not a very aggressive investor). Its price now stands at $102.54. Is it still a buy?I believe ICE remains undervalued at the present  that it had a consistently excellent track record in the past  barring one odd blip which will be discussed later; and that its long-term future prospects are brilliant. In this article I explain why.Company profileICE operates three lines of businesses: Exchanges; Fixed Income and Data Services; and Mortgage Technologies. In the Exchanges segment  ICE operates a number of regulated marketplaces for trading and clearing financial instruments  such as shares and derivatives (think the New York Stock Exchange  which it owns). In the Fixed Income and Data Services  ICE provides services such as fixed income pricing  reference data  indices  and analytics. In the Mortgage Technologies segment  ICE uses machine learning algorithms to provide streamlined and simplified solutions for mortgage lenders  which allow them to originate loans more efficiently.They have minority stakes in subsidiary companies. Among them the point of interest is Bakkt  the black sheep of the family. I will touch on it briefly later.Their main competitors are other exchanges based in the US  such as Nasdaq (NDAQ) and the CME Group (CME). They also compete against exchanges worldwide  such as the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Deutsche Boerse (OTCPK:DBOEY)Some statistics at a glance  as of close of business on November. 10  2022:Share price: $102.54Market cap: $54.3 billionP/E ratio: 22.7Debt / EBITDA ratio: 3.8Operating margin: 39.3%Profit margin: 14.4%Upside caseIn this section I describe why I believe ICE shares are undervalued.DCF ValuationI use the discounted cash flow method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 42% above its current price. I consider DCF appropriate to use for the valuation because in the last 10 years ICE has been profitable every year  and has paid out dividends in every year.The DCF method gives the fair present value of a share as:V0 = D1 / (r - g)Calculating gI estimate g  the sustainable growth rate for ICE  as:g = RR x ROEMy review of sell-side analyst reports suggests that the median forward-looking return on equity (ROE) for ICE is slightly below 14.8%.On a trailing twelve months basis (for the avoidance of doubt  from Q3 2021 through to Q2 2022)  ICE has earnings per share of $4.51  and paid a dividend of $1.47. The retention ratio is calculated as retained earnings divided by earnings per share. In this case  I find that the retention ratio is 67.4%.This yields a sustainable dividend growth rate of 10.0%. I note that this is materially above the S&P 500's historical dividend CAGR of 6.5%  but it is materially below ICE's historical dividend CAGR (14.2%)  as well as its net profit CAGR (9.3%)--not only are exchanges profitable businesses  ICE is also nursing a number of promising ventures in the wings. Therefore  I consider 10.0% a reasonable estimate of ICE's dividend growth rate.Calculating D1ICE pays dividends quarterly. Therefore  I set D1 as the sum of the four dividend payments in the next twelve months  which will occur in Dec. 2022  and Mar.  Jun. and Sep. 2023.ICE has already declared a dividend of $1.52 for the year 2022. Of this amount  they will pay the remaining quarter in December. Therefore  I set $0.76 as first half of D1.I assume the dividend payments in 2023 will grow at the sustainable growth rate of 10.0%. Therefore  I set $0.418 as the quarterly payments for 2023. Quite nicely  it is also the median analyst forecast for ICE's dividend payment for the year.In this case  I set D1 as $1.64.Calculating rI estimate r  my required rate of return for ICE  as:r = RFR + beta * (TMR - RFR)Since the inception of the S&P 500 in 1957  it has provided investors with an annualized total return of 11.88%. I use the most recent Effective Fed Funds Rate for which data is available (as of November 2022) of 3.83% as the risk free rate. I note that ICE's 5-year monthly equity beta is around 0.90.Therefore  I calculate the required rate of return for ICE asr = 3.83% + 0.9 * (11.88% - 3.83%) = 11.1%.Calculating V0In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $1.64 / (11.1% - 10.0%) = $145.75. This is 42% above its current price of $102.54 as of Nov. 10  2022: a substantial margin of safety.I show my work in Table 1 below.Table 1: DCF valuationEPS $ [a] Dividend in Year 0 $ [b] 1.47 Retention ratio % [c] = 1- [a]/[b] 67.4 ROE % [d] 14.8 Sustainable growth % [e] = [c]*[d] 10.0 Required rate of return % [f] 11.1 Dividend in Year 1 $ [g] 1.64 Fair value in Year 0 $ [h] = [g]/([f]-[e]) 145.75 Share price at valuation date $ [i] 102.54 Implied upside % [j] = [h] / [i] - 1 42 Click to enlargeEV/EBITDA ValuationAs a cross-check  I use the EV/EBITDA valuation method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 26% above its current price. I favor the DCF approach (when it is feasible) over the EV/EBITDA approach  as the method of finding suitable comparables is  in my view  neither exactly a science nor an art  but something close to black magic--highly subjective and sensitive to manipulation.Nevertheless  EV/EBITDA can be useful as a sense-check to the DCF approach. Let's take a look.I select five comparables for ICE: NASDAQ  CME  Cboe  the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Deutsche Boerse AG. In Table 2 below I note the values for their EVs  EBITDAs  and the corresponding ratios  as well as the average of their EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.9x. (Note that I cannot use Euronext  because it has negative EV.)Table 2: EV / EBITDA ratiosComparators EV EBITDA EV / EBITDA CME Group $ b 62.7 4.0 15.7 Cboe Global Markets $ b 14.7 0.6 23.6 NASDAQ $ b 36.7 1.9 19.7 London Stock Exchange $ b 59.2 4.4 13.5 Deutsche B√∂rse $ b 40.4 2.6 15.5 Average 17.6 Click to enlargeI apply the average ratio of 17.6x to estimate the fair value of ICE's EV. I note that EV is the sum of market capitalization and total debt  less cash and cash equivalents. Therefore  I subtract  from my estimate of the fair value of ICE's EV  the total debt  and then add back cash and cash equivalents  to arrive at a fair estimate of ICE's market capitalization.In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $129.35. This is 26% above its current price of $102.54 as of Nov. 10  2022  well below the value estimated from the DCF approach  but still a decent margin of safety.I show my calculations in Table 3 below.Table 3: EV / EBITDA valuationEBITDA $ b [a] 4.9 Fair value EV $ b [b] = [a] x 17.6 85.7 Total debt $ b [c] 18.4 Cash and cash equivalents $ b [d] 1.2 Fair value market cap $ b [e] = [b]-[c]+[d] 69 Actual market cap $ b [f] 54.3 Implied upside [g] = [e]/[f]-1 26.2% Share price at valuation date $ [h] 102.54 Implied fair value of share price $ [i] = [h]*(1+[g]) 129.35 Click to enlargeDownside caseIn this section  I discuss the downside case for ICE.Bakkt in perilIn my previous EV/EBITDA valuation approach  I estimated a $148.70 fair value for ICE using a 16.4x multiple. Why has the fair value dropped to $129.35 when I now use a higher  17.6x multiple?Clearly  EBITDA must have decreased. Specifically  whereas interest  tax  depreciation and amortization have not much changed  earnings that has  to be blunt  dived off a cliff.The reason for that has been mentioned in my previous article: Bakkt Rekt. I wrote:in their 2021 financial statement [ICE] noted  with smug self-satisfaction  that 'We recorded a pre-tax gain on the (Bakkt) transaction of $1.4 billion' (p. 105)... So what gives? Bakkt's share price  which plunged from a high of $42.56 to $2.56 as of Sep. 2  2022. How did ICE put it  also in their 2021 FS? ""We may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in Bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model."" (p. 20)Yes  the collapse of Bakkt's market value  and of the cryptocurrency market more generally  has materially and adversely affected ICE's earnings  which took a $1.1 billion impairment on the value of its holdings in Bakkt in Oct. 28. But  really  it's not so bad because it's (i) as expected; and (ii) perhaps even not quite as bad as expected: after all  they recorded a $1.4 billion gain from the transaction  so there is theoretically $0.3 billion still left over.To be clear  I believe Bakkt is a risky  and perhaps given the current economic climate a rather unwise  investment; and I believe it will probably continue to weigh down ICE's performance. But I also think the worst of it is likely over. The lion's share of Bakkt's market cap is already wiped out.The impact of the $1.1 billion impairment can be easily detected in ICE's financial performance over time. For example  ICE's revenue growth looks fine:Figure 1: Historical revenue growthI pro-rate 2022 revenue by multiplying revenues in the first three quarters by 4/3. (My analysis  based ICE financial statements)If anything  its latest quarterly report for Q3 2022 indicates that it experienced a year-on-year growth in revenue from Q3 2021  from $2.28 billion to $2.39 billion  which  considering the turbulent economic climate  is a great signal of its underlying business strength. (Similarly  its operating profits  which are unaffected by Bakkt  rose from $892 million to $932 million in the same period.)However  its profit margins dived sharply from 44% in 2021 to 14% in 2022. Worse  in Q3 2022 alone  it has negative profit margins of -7.3%. That's the first time it's registered a (quarterly) loss since it acquired NYSE in 2014.Figure 2: Historical marginsI use Q1-Q3 average margins for 2022  and end-of-year margins for all other years (My analysis  based on ICE financial statements)Inflation and interest rate risksGiven that inflationary forces are still likely to remain strong  the interest rate risks to ICE remain considerable. Ukraine and Russia continue to be at war  China sticks proudly to its frankly  in my opinion  insane policy of zero-Covid lockdowns  and the disappointing Republican performance in the midterms means the Democratic impulse to expansionary policies will likely remain unchecked.As a result  inflation remains well above the 2% Fed target and will stay there for some time. Likewise  the Fed is likely to keep increasing its funds rate  as long as inflation remains high.When interest rates are high  it is more attractive to keep money in a savings account  rather than use it for trading stocks and shares. Because of this  there may be lower trading activities  and hence lower sales  on ICE's platforms. Higher interest rates also make mortgages less attractive to potential homebuyers  which may reduce the demand for ICE's Mortgage Technology Services.Finally  if and when a recession strikes  the stock market rout is certain to affect trading activities on ICE adversely. But  fingers crossed  perhaps the world may yet avoid a recession  at least in the US.On the other hand  CPI inflation in October was 7.7%  and well below the 8.0% expected by economists. This may mark an inflection point in inflation: I believe the world is adjusting to the lockdown in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If so  the inflationary shocks of these events will continue to decline. Then ICE may yet experience a resurgence in sales and profits as trading activities pick up again.This prospect remains highly uncertain  but that is where the profit opportunity comes in. Once it becomes certain  one way or another  the market will price it in. Keeping tabs on inflation and interest rate movements will be crucial for investors of ICE.ConclusionI rate ICE a buy because  given what we are certain of now  I believe the fair value of ICE shares is around 42% above the current market value of their shares. But I do not rate it a strong buy  because there remains substantial risks. If you are a long-term investor  I do not believe you will regret having ICE in your portfolio; and I believe $102.54 is an attractive price to buy more ICE shares.",positive,0.99,0.01,0.0,mixed,0.57,0.14,0.29,True,English,"['Intercontinental Exchange Stock', 'Great Quality', 'recent Effective Fed Funds Rate', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'trailing twelve months basis', 'London Stock Exchange Group', '5-year monthly equity beta', 'sustainable dividend growth rate', 'next twelve months', 'sustainable growth rate', 'Getty Images News', 'excellent track record', 'one odd blip', 'long-term future prospects', 'machine learning algorithms', 'cash flow method', 'sell-side analyst reports', 'median analyst forecast', 'risk free rate', 'historical dividend CAGR', 'net profit CAGR', 'The DCF method', 'median forward-looking return', 'annualized total return', 'fixed income pricing', 'four dividend payments', 'Mortgage Technologies segment', 'fair present value', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'two months', 'required rate', 'CME Group', 'Profit margin', 'fair value', 'mortgage lenders', 'Spencer Platt', 'aggressive investor', 'Company profile', 'three lines', 'financial instruments', 'simplified solutions', 'minority stakes', 'subsidiary companies', 'black sheep', 'main competitors', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Market cap', 'P/E ratio', 'EBITDA ratio', 'Operating margin', 'DCF Valuation', 'last 10 years', 'retention ratio', 'S&P 500', 'promising ventures', 'reasonable estimate', 'remaining quarter', 'first half', 'quarterly payments', 'substantial margin', 'Exchanges segment', 'current price', 'reference data', 'previous article', 'capital gains', 'profitable businesses', 'Data Services', 'other exchanges', 'Upside case', 'Share price', 'Calculating D1', 'ICE shares', '11.1 Dividend', 'D1.', 'NYSE', 'immaterial', 'dividends', 'buy', 'past', 'number', 'regulated', 'marketplaces', 'trading', 'derivatives', 'indices', 'analytics', 'streamlined', 'loans', 'point', 'interest', 'Bakkt', 'family', 'Nasdaq', 'NDAQ', 'LSEG', 'DBOEY', 'statistics', 'glance', 'close', 'November', 'Debt', 'section', 'V0', 'ROE', 'review', 'avoidance', 'doubt', 'Q3', 'Q2', 'earnings', 'wings', 'sum', 'Dec.', 'Mar.', 'Jun.', 'Sep.', 'amount', 'December', 'RFR', 'inception', 'investors', 'Nov.', 'safety', 'work', 'EPS', 'date', '14.', '0.0', '3.']",2022-11-11,2022-11-12,seekingalpha.com

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion  recommending the approval of Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In September 2022  Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis.Prurigo nodularis is a chronic  debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient's quality of life among inflammatory skin diseases  due to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful ‚Äì with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin ‚Äì and can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials  PRIME and PRIME2  showing Dupixent significantly reduced itch (the primary endpoint) and skin lesions compared to placebo. Dupixent also significantly improved health-related quality of life while reducing measures of skin pain and symptoms of anxiety/depression. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included conjunctivitis.The use of Dupixent in adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  prurigo nodularis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the EU and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies.
