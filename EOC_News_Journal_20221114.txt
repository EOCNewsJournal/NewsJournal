It is the result of nearly 18 months of in-depth evaluation by our customer of our technology  which has demonstrated its relevance compared to the most advanced alternatives in the industry  the quality of our teams  whom I would like to thank for the remarkable work that was done throughout these discussions  and of our ability  as a strategic partner company to offer the guarantees required to sign a contract of this magnitude with a major international player. This contract is further proof of the change of dimension initiated by our company and a further step towards becoming one of the world leaders in our market.‚ÄùA MAJOR CONTRACT  WHICH CONFIRMS KALRAY'S ABILITY TO CONVINCE MARKET LEADERSThis major contract was signed with an American company listed on the NASDAQ  a major player in the industry that generated several tens of billions of dollars in revenue in 2021 and had a market capitalization of over one hundred billion dollars.The contract covers the development and supply of acceleration cards based on Kalray's DPU processors  on which the customer intends to build the next generation of its products and services. This agreement includes technical  commercial and financial terms and represents a commercial potential of several tens of millions of Euros per year. The signing of this contract demonstrates Kalray's ability to win over the most demanding players in the market and to sign contracts with very high revenue-generating potential.AND CONFIRMS THE RELEVANCE OF KALRAY'S TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODELThe key criterion in the customer's choice was the ability of Kalray's technology and its offering of acceleration cards to process the customer's data with the best performance/price and performance/consumption ratio. The advanced tests showed that Kalray's solution was a factor of 3 to 5 times better than the competition  representing a potential savings for the customer of several hundred million dollars over the life of the project. In addition to this cost/performance advantage  Kalray's solutions can be easily programmed and can handle a wide variety of data processing in parallel  which traditional alternatives such as GPUs or FPGAs do not allow.Kalray's ability to support such a large contract comes from its ""fabless"" business model. Like other high-growth companies like NVIDIA  Kalray does not have a factory. Instead  Kalray relies on industry partners such as TSMC  the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer  and Wistron  one of the world's largest card and server manufacturers  to manufacture its hardware solutions without having to invest in a production facility.A CONTRACT IN 3 CLEARLY DEFINED STAGESThe first phase began with the signing of the contract and covers the manufacturing of an ultra-high performance accelerator card including 4 Kalray MPPA¬Æ DPU processors and the support of the customer's development teams for the development of their next generation product. The customer has already committed $1 million to Kalray to cover the various phases of this milestone  which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.The second step will be for the customer  once performance is confirmed  to launch pre-series production of its new generation of product  resulting in initial multi-million Euro card orders.The third step will be volume production  which should represent orders of several thousand cards per year  i.e. revenues of several tens of millions of Euros per year  over a period of at least 5 years  which should be starting in 2025.This signature is in line with Kalray's strategy to work with major players looking for a unique technology for very large projects. The company is currently in discussions with several players with the same profile and believes that this first major contract should be a catalyst for signing new contracts with this type of first tier customer and with all its prospects in general.ABOUT KALRAYKalray is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies and solutions for high-performance  data centric computing markets  from cloud to edge.Kalray provides a full range of products to enable smarter  more efficient  and energy-wise data-intensive applications and infrastructures.

Results showed that lacutamab produced a global objective response rate (ORR) of 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]  13.8-50.0) in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF patients (n=21)  including 2 complete responses and 4 partial responses.The Company announced that it will report preliminary data from the Phase 2 TELLOMAK study in S√©zary syndrome at the ASH (American Society of Hematology) 2022 Annual Congress on 10 December. The ASH abstract states that the preliminary data demonstrate that lacutamab showed clinical activity and a favorable safety profile. In the heavily pre-treated post-mogamulizumab patient population with an average of six prior lines of therapy  in the Intention to treat population (ITT) population  the global confirmed ORR was 21.6% (8/37). Confirmed ORR in the skin was 35.1% (13/37) and confirmed ORR in the blood was 37.8% (14/37). Additional data will be presented at the ASH 2022 Annual Congress.On 11 September  at the ESMO 2022 conference  the Company presented a poster on the ongoing lacutamab Phase 1b trial design in monotherapy in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).Two clinical trials are underway evaluating lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory PTCL: Phase 1b trial: a Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate lacutamab as a monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed PTCL. Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.ANKET‚Ñ¢ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):An 18 October edition of Cell Reports Medicine described the development of Innate‚Äôs fit-for-purpose ANKET‚Ñ¢ antibody-based tetra-specific molecule to harness the antitumor functions of NK cells  boosting their capacity to proliferate  to accumulate at the tumor site and to kill tumor cells.Progress continues toward investigational new drug (IND) filing in 2023 for the CD20 targeted tetra-specific ANKET‚Ñ¢  IPH6501.Sanofi will present two posters on SAR‚Äô579/IPH6101 and SAR‚Äô514/IPH6401 at the ASH 2022 Annual Congress on the 11 and 12 December: An open-label  first-in-human  dose-escalation study of SAR443579 administered as single agent by intravenous infusion in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplasia (HR-MDS) The Novel Trifunctional Anti-BCMA NK Cell Engager SAR‚Äô514 Has Potent in-Vitro and in-Vivo Anti-Myeloma Effect through Dual NK Cell EngagementThe Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi continues  evaluating IPH6101/SAR‚Äô579  the first NKp46/CD16-based CD123-targeted ANKET‚Ñ¢ NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).It was previously announced that Sanofi had made the decision to progress IPH6401/SAR‚Äô514 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies.

Positive initial Phase I data announced in June 2022 confirmed the mechanism of action of BT-001 as a single agent and demonstrated first signs of anti-tumor activity.The papers‚Äô two co-first authors  Dr Monika Semmrich  Principal Scientist at BioInvent  and Dr Jean-Baptiste Marchand  Head of the Protein Science Lab at Transgene  will each receive a monetary prize. The award has been presented at the SITC Meeting Awards Ceremony  taking place Friday  November 11 from 8:00 ‚Äì 8:20 a.m. EST.The full paper can be accessed here.KEYTRUDA¬Æ is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene‚Äôs Invir.IO‚Ñ¢ platform and its patented large-capacity VV cop TK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent‚Äôs proprietary n-CoDeR¬Æ/F.I.R.S.T‚Ñ¢ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody will be greatly improved. BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent.

Nov. 14  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced completion of the dose escalation part of a phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with locally advanced (LA) or borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer (PC). The phase 1 study (‚ÄúStudy 2019-1001‚Äù) is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson).‚ÄúThe tolerable safety profile  establishment of recommended phase 2 dose  and early signals of efficacy we have observed in the dose escalation part for locally advanced patients of our phase 1 study give us confidence to now include borderline resectable patients in the expansion part ‚Äù said Leonard A. Farber  MD  Chief Clinical and Medical Affairs Officer at Nanobiotix. ‚ÄúIn the borderline resectable pancreatic cancer population  a positive correlation has been observed between achieving resectability through local and systemic control with preoperative therapy and potentially improving survival outcomes. Inclusion of the borderline resectable stage in the study will also expand the eligible patient population to include a larger proportion of pancreatic cancer patients  allowing for the robust evaluation of NBTXR3‚Äôs potential to have a significant impact in this recalcitrant disease.‚ÄùStudy 2019-1001 is being conducted as part of the ongoing strategic collaboration between Nanobiotix and MD Anderson. The complete dose escalation part of the study recruited 11 patients  and all patients had unresectable disease at study entry. A single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 followed by 15 fractions of RT showed to be feasible and well-tolerated and the recommended phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 was established at 42% of gross tumor volume.Notably  one patient on Study 2019-1001 had a partial response 9 months after RT and has had durable local control for over two years. One other patient experienced local control that allowed unresectable disease to become resectable. Negative margin surgery (‚ÄúR0 surgery‚Äù) was achieved for this patient and pathological complete response was observed. The dose expansion part of the study will include more robust evaluation of patients with borderline resectable disease at study entry.About Study 2019-1001Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare  deadly disease. Given that surgery with R0 resection (i.e.  macroscopically complete tumor removal with negative microscopic surgical margins) remains the only hope for long-term survival  clinical trials have investigated various neoadjuvant strategies‚Äîwherein patients receive anti-cancer drugs or radiation prior to surgery‚Äîto increase the surgery-eligible population while also increasing the R0 resection rate.MD Anderson Study 2019-1001 is an open-label  single-arm  prospective phase I study consisting of two parts: (i) dose-escalation to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); and (ii) expansion at RP2D.The patient population will include adults (age ‚â• 18 years) with borderline resectable (BR) or locally advanced (LA) PC that are radiographically non-metastatic at screening  and that have not previously received radiation therapy or surgery for pancreatic cancer. The complete dose escalation part recruited 11 patients with unresectable LAPC and the RP2D was established at 42% of gross tumor volume. Twelve additional patients with either LAPC or BRPC will be enrolled for the RP2D expansion.The objectives of the study are the determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  and the RP2D.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate‚Äôs physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy‚Äîthe same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program‚Äîbeginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC  or lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company‚Äôs focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

It will have the particularity of being part of a global project to secure an industrial site  combining human resources (security agents) and technological tool. This project is unparalleled in the world and foreshadows the future of the private security sector by combining people and technology  based on a unique and non-disruptive business model. It is now piloted by our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech and perfectly concretizes our strategy of dronification of the private security sector.Combined with the opening in early 2023 of our demonstration site in South Africa created in partnership with the University of Pretoria  this very positive commercial development could allow us to achieve our 2023 target  which is to market 9 systems  representing revenues of ‚Ç¨1.1 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨0.45 million (41%).The second system in our range of ""security"" solutions  ISS Spotter wired is also experiencing an acceleration in its commercial development.First  several negotiations are advanced for sales of systems  mainly out of France  which could correspond to more than 10 units sold in the coming months.Story continuesSecondly  a training program has started within our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech  aimed at building a team of security agents with the remote pilot license. This team will make it possible to offer  during sporting and cultural events that will be numerous in France from 2023  a complete ""√† la carte"" service combining wired ISS Spotter system and authorized operators. Our ambitions for 2023  which are based on current sales contacts and orders already recorded  correspond to 25 systems sold and 50 missions completed  representing revenues of ‚Ç¨2.9 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨1.7 million (59%).The third and final system under our DDSA branch (Delta Drone SA and its support subsidiaries in France) is the Countbot automated inventory solution. In this area  we have set up a particular scheme  because of our partnership strategy with one of the main players in the sector worldwide: he is our exclusive customer  who is responsible for him either to resell the acquired systems or to offer them as services  the missions being in this case exclusively carried out by Delta Drone's teams. The first successful missions  including the very emblematic one on behalf of L'Or√©al last September  confirm that Countbot is the most successful solution on the market  combining minimum completion time  success rate (decoding) greater than 99% and total safety of people and goods during warehouse missions.Given sustained demand from a growing number of world-renowned manufacturers  our ambition for 2023 is to market 6 systems and carry out 60 missions  all representing revenues of ‚Ç¨1.1 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨0.45 million (42%).The three systems proposed by the DDSA branch (ISS Spotter automatic and ISS Spotter wired for the security sector  Countbot for the warehouse logistics sector) have been designed and developed for several years by our subsidiary ""design office""  the company Delta Drone Engineering based in Nantes. They are now operational and no longer require the same R&D investment  even if changes will be periodically proposed thanks to feedback from field experience.For this reason  to support a sufficient workload and to succeed in transforming the design office into a profit center  we have worked in recent months to expand the R&D offer for customers outside the group  often as part of projects ""derivative"" of our own solutions.Thanks to this new momentum  a first major project is in the start-up phase  which could absorb a large part of our engineers' working time. We have also increased opportunities to pool R&D efforts with several of our UDT holdings  thus completing the overall workload plan of the Design Office.All these R&D activities should represent in 2023 ""third-party"" revenues of around ‚Ç¨0.8 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨0.7 million (85%)  making it possible to fully self-finance our subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering.In parallel with all these commercial developments  which could represent total revenues of around ‚Ç¨5.9 million and a gross margin of around ‚Ç¨3.3 million (56%) for the DDSA branch alone  a vigorous cost reduction action has been carried out  resulting in a significant reduction in the DDSA branch workforce and a planned reduction in several purchasing positions. Thanks to these actions  the 2023 payroll of the DDSA branch will be limited to ‚Ç¨2.1 million (a reduction of more than half compared to the previous amount) and all other operating expenses will be reduced to ‚Ç¨1.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨2.5 million previously  i.e.  an overall operating expense of approximately ‚Ç¨3.5 million.However  the now realistic prospect of achieving EBITDA breakeven in 2023 requires financing the associated working capital requirement. This is now the main reason why Delta Drone must continue to raise sufficient funds.This effort corresponds to only a few million  which unfortunately represents a very high dilution for the shareholder compared to the very low level of market capitalization. Obviously  a more ""reasonable"" level of market capitalization  better reflecting the size and position of the group as well as its promising prospects  would have the mechanical effect of greatly limiting the dilutive impact of the financing selected. In addition  the achievement of the objectives will have the immediate effect of significantly reducing the use of such financing  since the group will be in a positive cash flow situation.The emerging nature of the drone sector does not seriously allow for the consideration of other types of more traditional financing  such as bank debt  especially since the latter would have the effect of generating financial charges likely to absorb the first positive cash flow.2 ‚Äì The other three branches of the group continue their development satisfactorilyThrough its operating subsidiaries  mainly ATM Group Security  the DDHT (Delta Drone Human & Tech) branch achieves sustainable revenues of more than ‚Ç¨12 million  solidly based on multi-year contracts . It is profitable and an essential part of the group's strategy for the dronification of the security sector and for the success of inventory missions.The DDI branch (Delta Drone International and its subsidiaries) achieved revenues of approximately ‚Ç¨4 million  consolidated its leading position in Africa and continued its development in Australia. It aims for a result close to balance in 2023The UDT branch creates industrial synergies with the group and benefits from the successful fundraising of several of its investments: the value of the portfolio now exceeds ‚Ç¨10 million.In its historical private security business  the DDHT branch benefits from a market that is growing overall  boosted by the prospect of major sporting events that will take place in France in the coming years. However  the shortage of labour is becoming structural and the pressure on production costs (in particular the increase in wages in connection with the revaluation of the ‚ÄúSMIC‚Äù) penalizes the entire profession.Faced with this contrasting environment  DDHT strives to strengthen its attractiveness for new staff  but also for existing employees  in particular thanks to the opportunities to benefit from training and to evolve towards better paid tasks.As such  training  either to become an operator as part of Countbot missions  or to become a drone remote pilot are original and very differentiating professional opportunities.Since the beginning of September  the acquisition of an additional 3% of the capital allows Delta Drone to hold today 58.2% of Delta Drone International (DDI)  a company listed on the ASX stock exchange in Sydney  Australia and whose market capitalization is around 10 MAU$.A few weeks ago (October 17  2022)  DDI's South African subsidiary Rocketmine Pty Ltd announced the signing of a 2-year contract of KAU$516 with Rutenburg Platinium Mines Ltd Mogalakwena  a 100% subsidiary of the Anglo American mining group  consolidating its position as the African market leader in drone services for the mining industry.Like the DDHT branch  DDI is part of a logic of multi-year contracts  thus contributing strongly to the sustainability of the group and its visibility in the medium term.The DDI sub-group represents consolidated revenues of approximately ‚Ç¨4 million and fully self-finances its development. It aims for a result close to balance for 2023.Several of the companies in the UDT portfolio have strengthened their position in their respective markets  attracting the attention and interest of major international players. As a first-time investor  UDT systematically adopts a strategy of being at the side of the managers  in order to facilitate the conclusion of fundraising  while maintaining an active role as a member of the Management Committees.At the same time  the mutual trust that has been forged over the years now makes it possible to start a process of pooling R&D expertise  a source of significant productivity for the group and for the companies in its ecosystem.All information contained in this press release will be communicated by means of press releases as they are executed. Negotiations and contracts signed in the field of security (ISS Spotter systems) concern the vast majority of large international groups and governments  for which strict confidentiality is required. As far as possible  however  information will be communicated to shareholders  particularly during future general meetings.About Delta Drone : The Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the sector of civil drones for professional use.

AllianceThe Company has established a long-term strategic alliance and first right of refusal with Tiffany & Co. Canada  a subsidiary of world famous New York based Tiffany & Co.  to purchase up to 100% of the future production of rough diamonds from the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project at then current prices to be determined by the parties on an ongoing basis. In conjunction with this first right of refusal  Tiffany & Co. Canada also provided the Company with financing to advance the Project. Tiffany & Co. is now owned by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH)  a publicly traded company which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange (Euronext) under the symbol LVMH and on the OTC under the symbol LVMHF. For additional information on Tiffany & Co.  please visit their website at www.tiffany.com.About Krone-Endora at VenetiaIn February 2011  Diamcor acquired the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project from De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited  consisting of the prospecting rights over the farms Krone 104 and Endora 66  which represent a combined surface area of approximately 5 888 hectares directly adjacent to De Beers' flagship Venetia Diamond Mine in South Africa. On September 11  2014  the Company announced that the South African Department of Mineral Resources had granted a Mining Right for the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project encompassing 657.71 hectares of the Project's total area of 5 888 hectares. The Company has also submitted an application for a mining right over the remaining areas of the Project. The deposits which occur on the properties of Krone and Endora have been identified as a higher-grade ""Alluvial"" basal deposit which is covered by a lower-grade upper ""Eluvial"" deposit. The deposits are proposed to be the result of the direct-shift (in respect to the ""Eluvial"" deposit) and erosion (in respect to the ""Alluvial"" deposit) of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia Kimberlite areas. The deposits on Krone-Endora occur in two layers with a maximum total depth of approximately 15.0 metres from surface to bedrock  allowing for a very low-cost mining operation to be employed with the potential for near-term diamond production from a known high-quality source. Krone-Endora also benefits from the significant development of infrastructure and services already in place due to its location directly adjacent to the Venetia Mine.Qualified Person Statement:Mr. James P.

As such  no distinction is made in third-party management  which is presented solely in agent form.This presentation therefore allows a direct reading of syndication fees  sales commissions  and management fees.This new presentation has no impact on EBITDA  operating income  or net income. The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.DYNAMIC GROWTH IN OWNED AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AT END-SEPTEMBER 2022Owned activities grew by ‚Ç¨34.2 million over nine months  with respective increases of ‚Ç¨14.2 million for leasing activity and ‚Ç¨20.0 million for equipment sales activity thanks to sales of own-account containers  which outperformed.Management activity grew by ‚Ç¨3.3 million  with an increase of ‚Ç¨1.6 million in syndication fees (Freight Railcars and Containers activities) and sales fees on used equipment belonging to investors (+‚Ç¨1.4 million in the Containers activity).ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY DIVISIONThe Freight Railcars activity rose (+11.3%) to ‚Ç¨40.4 million in the first nine months:Owned activity expanded by ‚Ç¨3.6 million  resulting from an increase in leasing revenue from owned equipment (+15.7%)  driven by growth in the utilisation rate (87.1% versus 84.6% over the same period in 2021) and by the leasing of newly acquired railcars.Management activity was also up  with syndication fees increasing by ‚Ç¨0.4 million with transactions carried out in June 2022.The River Barges activity saw a boost in revenue of ‚Ç¨5.1 million thanks to the vigorous level of barge chartering in the Rhine basin. The utilisation rate in the third quarter of 2022 was nearly 100% in the division.The Containers activity posted a sharp increase of ‚Ç¨33.9 million. The performance of leasing activity remained strong (+‚Ç¨5.4 million) with an average utilisation rate of 98.1% over the period. However  most of the increase came from sales of owned equipment (new built containers trading activity)  which rose by ‚Ç¨25.8 million. Management activity increased by ‚Ç¨2.8 million  spurred by syndication fees in the second quarter and commissions on the sale of investor equipment.The Modular Buildings activity in Africa  presented on the ""Miscellaneous"" line  was down ‚Ç¨5.6 million with fewer projects delivered than in 2021.Restated Revenue from activities Q1 2022Q2 2022Q3 2022TOTAL 2022Q1 2021Q2 2021Q3 2021TOTAL 2021(in ‚Ç¨ thousand) Leasing revenue on owned equipment 10 544 11 142 11 292 32 978 9 152 9 223 10 123 28 498 Ancillary services 1 858 1 177 1 820 4 855 1 873 1 724 1 951 5 548 Total leasing activity 12 402 12 319 13 112 37 833 11 025 10 947 12 074 34 046 Sales of owned equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total sales of equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total of owned activity 12 512 12 557 13 481 38 550 11 345 11 350 12 236 34 931 Syndication fees 0 446 1 447 0 0 0 0 Management fees 466 451 507 1 424 463 470 451 1 384 Total of management activity 466 897 508 1 871 463 470 451 1 384 Total Freight railcars 12 978 13 454 13 989 40 421 11 808 11 820 12 687 36 315 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 1 619 1 789 1 869 5 277 1 688 1 745 1 770 5 203 Ancillary services 1 807 2 385 3 788 7 980 683 972 1 286 2 941 Total leasing activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 371 2 717 3 056 8 144 Sales of owned equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total sales of equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total of owned activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 412 2 717 3 056 8 185 Management fees 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total of management activity 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total River Barges 3 440 4 179 5 668 13 287 2 418 2 723 3 061 8 202 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 3 342 3 973 4 013 11 328 2 384 2 654 2 572 7 610 Ancillary services 2 070 1 325 1 779 5 174 191 1 054 2 297 3 542 Total leasing activity 5 412 5 298 5 792 16 502 2 575 3 708 4 869 11 152 Sales of owned equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total sales of equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total of owned activity 18 617 17 873 18 759 55 249 6 055 7 232 10 860 24 147 Syndication fees 0 2 076 64 2 140 17 946 48 1 011 Management fees 498 530 565 1 593 428 415 439 1 282 Sales fees 336 1 349 801 2 486 591 358 181 1 130 Total of management activity 834 3 955 1 430 6 219 1 036 1 719 668 3 423 Total Containers 19 451 21 828 20 189 61 468 7 091 8 951 11 528 27 570 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 4 5 4 13 5 11 15 31 Ancillary services -3 -3 3 -3 -2 -3 -4 -9 Total leasing activity 1 2 7 10 3 8 11 22 Sales of owned equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total sales of equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total of owned activity 1 548 1 438 2 063 5 049 3 247 4 409 2 990 10 646 Other capital gains on disposals 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Others 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Miscellaneous and eliminations 1 548 1 438 2 069 5 055 3 247 4 415 2 990 10 652 Total Restated Revenue from activities 37 417 40 899 41 915 120 231 24 564 27 909 30 266 82 739OUTLOOKIn the current context of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates  Touax continues to roll out its activities  thanks to a resilient business model and recurring revenues based on long-term contracts. The Group plans to seize new asset acquisition opportunity over the coming months  while also adopting a prudent investment policy. The current inflationary environment has a positive effect on the valuation of the portfolio of assets. However  prices have normalised in the container business  with the purchase price of new containers returning to the average levels of 2020.From a structural and medium- to long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from developments in relation to infrastructures  e-commerce and intermodal logistics as they keep pace with the expectations of consumers  industrial groups  public authorities  lenders and investors around green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS22 March 2023: Press release on annual results (English/French)22 March 2023: Presentation of annual results to financial analysts in Paris (in French)23 March 2023: Investor call (in English)TOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

Nov. 14  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with c‚Ä¶,Data show that radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 was feasible and well tolerated in the complete dose escalation part of a Study 2019-1001  a phase 1 evaluation of NBTXR3 for patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinomaThe recommended phase 2 dose for radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 in pancreatic cancer was established at 42% of gross tumor volume and the dose expansion part of the study is ongoing in the United StatesThe company expects to report safety and early efficacy data from the escalation part of the study at a medical congress in 2023PARIS and CAMBRIDGE  Mass.  Nov. 14  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced completion of the dose escalation part of a phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with locally advanced (LA) or borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer (PC). The phase 1 study (‚ÄúStudy 2019-1001‚Äù) is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson).‚ÄúThe tolerable safety profile  establishment of recommended phase 2 dose  and early signals of efficacy we have observed in the dose escalation part for locally advanced patients of our phase 1 study give us confidence to now include borderline resectable patients in the expansion part ‚Äù said Leonard A. Farber  MD  Chief Clinical and Medical Affairs Officer at Nanobiotix. ‚ÄúIn the borderline resectable pancreatic cancer population  a positive correlation has been observed between achieving resectability through local and systemic control with preoperative therapy and potentially improving survival outcomes. Inclusion of the borderline resectable stage in the study will also expand the eligible patient population to include a larger proportion of pancreatic cancer patients  allowing for the robust evaluation of NBTXR3‚Äôs potential to have a significant impact in this recalcitrant disease.‚ÄùStudy 2019-1001 is being conducted as part of the ongoing strategic collaboration between Nanobiotix and MD Anderson. The complete dose escalation part of the study recruited 11 patients  and all patients had unresectable disease at study entry. A single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 followed by 15 fractions of RT showed to be feasible and well-tolerated and the recommended phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 was established at 42% of gross tumor volume.Notably  one patient on Study 2019-1001 had a partial response 9 months after RT and has had durable local control for over two years. One other patient experienced local control that allowed unresectable disease to become resectable. Negative margin surgery (‚ÄúR0 surgery‚Äù) was achieved for this patient and pathological complete response was observed. The dose expansion part of the study will include more robust evaluation of patients with borderline resectable disease at study entry.About Study 2019-1001Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare  deadly disease. Given that surgery with R0 resection (i.e.  macroscopically complete tumor removal with negative microscopic surgical margins) remains the only hope for long-term survival  clinical trials have investigated various neoadjuvant strategies‚Äîwherein patients receive anti-cancer drugs or radiation prior to surgery‚Äîto increase the surgery-eligible population while also increasing the R0 resection rate.MD Anderson Study 2019-1001 is an open-label  single-arm  prospective phase I study consisting of two parts: (i) dose-escalation to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); and (ii) expansion at RP2D.The patient population will include adults (age ‚â• 18 years) with borderline resectable (BR) or locally advanced (LA) PC that are radiographically non-metastatic at screening  and that have not previously received radiation therapy or surgery for pancreatic cancer. The complete dose escalation part recruited 11 patients with unresectable LAPC and the RP2D was established at 42% of gross tumor volume. Twelve additional patients with either LAPC or BRPC will be enrolled for the RP2D expansion.The objectives of the study are the determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  and the RP2D.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate‚Äôs physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy‚Äîthe same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program‚Äîbeginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC  or lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company‚Äôs focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYOctober was a mixed month for Structured Debt Markets as European CLO debt tranches experienced a price rebound - especially the ones that were significantly hit in September - while US CLO performances were slightly negative. As a result Volta‚Äôs net asset value (‚ÄúNAV‚Äù) declined by -2.6% in October.Diving into Volta‚Äôs underlying sub asset classes  monthly performances** were as follow: +0.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -3.9% for CLO Equity tranches; +1.7% for CLO Debt tranches (driven by +6.2% on European CLO debt); and -0.4% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund‚Äôs NAV).As for every quarter  October was an heavy month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. We were expecting relatively healthy ones across the board and our positions did deliver on that front. Volta received in October the equivalent of ‚Ç¨9.1m in terms of interest and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received ‚Ç¨23.4m interest and coupons. A 22.3% annualized cash flow to NAV.Looking at fundamentals  we continued to see slightly more downgrades than upgrades in both the US and the European loan markets  although at a very moderate pace. We have been highlighting for months through this channel of communication the fact that inflation per se can positively impact companies‚Äô balance sheets. The release of Q3 earnings demonstrated once more that when revenues increase (in nominal amount) at a high pace  earnings can be maintained or even increased despite companies suffering from margin pressure. At the time of writing this publication  90% of the S&P companies have reported their Q3 earnings; revenues are up 12.2% (from the previous quarter) allowing earnings to grow by ‚Äúonly‚Äù 3.9%.Story continuesIn the meantime  this increase in revenues is eroding the real value of debt. We believe that the real value of debt for the average US company was basically eroded by 20% in the last two years when considering that from Q3 2020 to Q4 2022 the US GDP grew by 20% in nominal terms. This relationship between nominal growth and debt and the maitainance of healthy earnings can explain why rating agencies have so far been relatively slow (and they may be correct in doing so) in downgrading debt even though many companies do suffer or will suffer from higher interest rates.Our view remains that the overall dynamics are still more favorable for the US relative to Europe. At the end of October  12 months running default rates in Loans were still low at 0.4% in Europe and 0.8% in the US. We expect to see more deterioration in Europe than in the US in the coming quarters and consider it reasonable to see default rates move in the 2% area in the US and in the 3% area in Europe for 2023.This kind of default pattern will not materially impact the distribution of interests by Volta‚Äôs assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.We recently opened a European CLO Warehouse as part of this strategy. No loans have yet been purchased but we expect to start ramping assets in the near term to take advantage of significant price discounts and patiently build a very profitable CLO Equity position.As at the end of October 2022  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨206.8m or ‚Ç¨5.65 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.5% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.1% as at 30 September 2022  0.4% was at 31 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2Story continuesgMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 People living with MG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100 000 population; approximately 36 000 to 60 000 cases.4 In Europe  the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100 000 population.5""People living with gMG experience high treatment burden  on top of the debilitating impact of the condition  and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments to support the gMG community. Our goal is to provide a solution that can help meet these needs and transform lives "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""The acceptance of the NDA by the FDA as well as the acceptance of the MAA by the EMA  brings us one step further on our journey towards approval for this medicine. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this important new treatment option to patients.""The NDA and MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293)  which demonstrated at week 12 that treatment with zilucoplan (0.3 mg/kg daily) resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in key gMG-specific outcomes compared with placebo in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. The study met its primary endpoint with zilucoplan showing a placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.09 points in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at week 12 (p<0.001).6Zilucoplan demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile  showing a similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%). The most common TEAEs were injection site bruising  headache  and diarrhea. Rates of treatment discontinuation due to a TEAE were low and all patients who completed the 12-week treatment period have entered the ongoing RAISE-XT open-label extension study (NCT04225871).6 7In the RAISE study  174 adult patients were randomised to receive daily SC  self-administered doses of placebo (N=88) or zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg (N=86). Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms.6As a complement C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan is a targeted therapy that inhibits key components in the underlying pathophysiology of gMG  addressing the underlying mechanism of neuromuscular junction damage.8 9""We are deeply committed to improving outcomes for the gMG community. People who live with gMG suffer unpredictable  fluctuating  and debilitating symptoms  which have a huge impact on their lives. We want to help reduce the day-to-day burden of this challenging disease "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""If approved  zilucoplan has the potential to address the unmet need for people with gMG by providing targeted improvements in signs and symptoms of gMG disease activity and severity. A benefit of targeted treatment is that it may help reduce the adverse events that can be associated with non-specific immunosuppressive treatment of gMG.""UCB anticipates making regulatory filings for zilucoplan in gMG in Great Britain  Japan  and rest of the world from Q3 2022 onwards.Alongside zilucoplan  UCB is also investigating rozanolixizumab  a SC-administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  as a potential treatment for gMG. UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions for rozanolixizumab later this year.10For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comU.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655daphne.teo@ucb.comCorporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700 000 people worldwide.11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3  4gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4  12 gMG can occur in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.13 14 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade.15 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR-Ab+ gMG.About the zilucoplan RAISE study 6 7The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12  time to rescue therapy  the proportion with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1)  the proportion with a ‚â•3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ‚â•5-point reduction in QMG without rescue therapy  all measured at Week 12. The secondary safety endpoint is incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the 12 week RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open label extension study  RAISE-XT.For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About ZilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.9 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.1 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About RozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is an SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.16 15Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.17 Orphan designation was granted in 202018 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

It will have the particularity of being part of a global project to secure an industrial site  combining human resources (security agents) and technological tool. This project is unparalleled in the world and foreshadows the future of the private security sector by combining people and technology  based on a unique and non-disruptive business model. It is now piloted by our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech and perfectly concretizes our strategy of dronification of the private security sector.Combined with the opening in early 2023 of our demonstration site in South Africa created in partnership with the University of Pretoria  this very positive commercial development could allow us to achieve our 2023 target  which is to market 9 systems  representing revenues of ‚Ç¨1.1 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨0.45 million (41%).The second system in our range of ""security"" solutions  ISS Spotter wired is also experiencing an acceleration in its commercial development.First  several negotiations are advanced for sales of systems  mainly out of France  which could correspond to more than 10 units sold in the coming months.Secondly  a training program has started within our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech  aimed at building a team of security agents with the remote pilot license. This team will make it possible to offer  during sporting and cultural events that will be numerous in France from 2023  a complete ""√† la carte"" service combining wired ISS Spotter system and authorized operators. Our ambitions for 2023  which are based on current sales contacts and orders already recorded  correspond to 25 systems sold and 50 missions completed  representing revenues of ‚Ç¨2.9 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨1.7 million (59%).The third and final system under our DDSA branch (Delta Drone SA and its support subsidiaries in France) is the Countbot automated inventory solution. In this area  we have set up a particular scheme  because of our partnership strategy with one of the main players in the sector worldwide: he is our exclusive customer  who is responsible for him either to resell the acquired systems or to offer them as services  the missions being in this case exclusively carried out by Delta Drone's teams. The first successful missions  including the very emblematic one on behalf of L'Or√©al last September  confirm that Countbot is the most successful solution on the market  combining minimum completion time  success rate (decoding) greater than 99% and total safety of people and goods during warehouse missions.Given sustained demand from a growing number of world-renowned manufacturers  our ambition for 2023 is to market 6 systems and carry out 60 missions  all representing revenues of ‚Ç¨1.1 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨0.45 million (42%).The three systems proposed by the DDSA branch (ISS Spotter automatic and ISS Spotter wired for the security sector  Countbot for the warehouse logistics sector) have been designed and developed for several years by our subsidiary ""design office""  the company Delta Drone Engineering based in Nantes. They are now operational and no longer require the same R&D investment  even if changes will be periodically proposed thanks to feedback from field experience.For this reason  to support a sufficient workload and to succeed in transforming the design office into a profit center  we have worked in recent months to expand the R&D offer for customers outside the group  often as part of projects ""derivative"" of our own solutions.Thanks to this new momentum  a first major project is in the start-up phase  which could absorb a large part of our engineers' working time. We have also increased opportunities to pool R&D efforts with several of our UDT holdings  thus completing the overall workload plan of the Design Office.All these R&D activities should represent in 2023 ""third-party"" revenues of around ‚Ç¨0.8 million and a gross margin of ‚Ç¨0.7 million (85%)  making it possible to fully self-finance our subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering.In parallel with all these commercial developments  which could represent total revenues of around ‚Ç¨5.9 million and a gross margin of around ‚Ç¨3.3 million (56%) for the DDSA branch alone  a vigorous cost reduction action has been carried out  resulting in a significant reduction in the DDSA branch workforce and a planned reduction in several purchasing positions. Thanks to these actions  the 2023 payroll of the DDSA branch will be limited to ‚Ç¨2.1 million (a reduction of more than half compared to the previous amount) and all other operating expenses will be reduced to ‚Ç¨1.5 million  compared to ‚Ç¨2.5 million previously  i.e.  an overall operating expense of approximately ‚Ç¨3.5 million.However  the now realistic prospect of achieving EBITDA breakeven in 2023 requires financing the associated working capital requirement. This is now the main reason why Delta Drone must continue to raise sufficient funds.This effort corresponds to only a few million  which unfortunately represents a very high dilution for the shareholder compared to the very low level of market capitalization. Obviously  a more ""reasonable"" level of market capitalization  better reflecting the size and position of the group as well as its promising prospects  would have the mechanical effect of greatly limiting the dilutive impact of the financing selected. In addition  the achievement of the objectives will have the immediate effect of significantly reducing the use of such financing  since the group will be in a positive cash flow situation.The emerging nature of the drone sector does not seriously allow for the consideration of other types of more traditional financing  such as bank debt  especially since the latter would have the effect of generating financial charges likely to absorb the first positive cash flow.2 ‚Äì The other three branches of the group continue their development satisfactorilyThrough its operating subsidiaries  mainly ATM Group Security  the DDHT (Delta Drone Human & Tech) branch achieves sustainable revenues of more than ‚Ç¨12 million  solidly based on multi-year contracts . It is profitable and an essential part of the group's strategy for the dronification of the security sector and for the success of inventory missions.The DDI branch (Delta Drone International and its subsidiaries) achieved revenues of approximately ‚Ç¨4 million  consolidated its leading position in Africa and continued its development in Australia. It aims for a result close to balance in 2023The UDT branch creates industrial synergies with the group and benefits from the successful fundraising of several of its investments: the value of the portfolio now exceeds ‚Ç¨10 million.In its historical private security business  the DDHT branch benefits from a market that is growing overall  boosted by the prospect of major sporting events that will take place in France in the coming years. However  the shortage of labour is becoming structural and the pressure on production costs (in particular the increase in wages in connection with the revaluation of the ‚ÄúSMIC‚Äù) penalizes the entire profession.Faced with this contrasting environment  DDHT strives to strengthen its attractiveness for new staff  but also for existing employees  in particular thanks to the opportunities to benefit from training and to evolve towards better paid tasks.As such  training  either to become an operator as part of Countbot missions  or to become a drone remote pilot are original and very differentiating professional opportunities.Since the beginning of September  the acquisition of an additional 3% of the capital allows Delta Drone to hold today 58.2% of Delta Drone International (DDI)  a company listed on the ASX stock exchange in Sydney  Australia and whose market capitalization is around 10 MAU$.A few weeks ago (October 17  2022)  DDI's South African subsidiary Rocketmine Pty Ltd announced the signing of a 2-year contract of KAU$516 with Rutenburg Platinium Mines Ltd Mogalakwena  a 100% subsidiary of the Anglo American mining group  consolidating its position as the African market leader in drone services for the mining industry.Like the DDHT branch  DDI is part of a logic of multi-year contracts  thus contributing strongly to the sustainability of the group and its visibility in the medium term.The DDI sub-group represents consolidated revenues of approximately ‚Ç¨4 million and fully self-finances its development. It aims for a result close to balance for 2023.Several of the companies in the UDT portfolio have strengthened their position in their respective markets  attracting the attention and interest of major international players. As a first-time investor  UDT systematically adopts a strategy of being at the side of the managers  in order to facilitate the conclusion of fundraising  while maintaining an active role as a member of the Management Committees.At the same time  the mutual trust that has been forged over the years now makes it possible to start a process of pooling R&D expertise  a source of significant productivity for the group and for the companies in its ecosystem.All information contained in this press release will be communicated by means of press releases as they are executed. Negotiations and contracts signed in the field of security (ISS Spotter systems) concern the vast majority of large international groups and governments  for which strict confidentiality is required. As far as possible  however  information will be communicated to shareholders  particularly during future general meetings.About Delta Drone : The Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the sector of civil drones for professional use.

Atos and its ecosystem of partners have already successfully delivered the main part of the Leonardo system  hosted and managed by Cineca computing center located in the Technopole of Bologna.With this new cluster  Atos and Cineca will support the EU‚Äôs mission and sovereignty by fighting against environmental and medical emergency situations. It will contribute to the mitigation and management of risks due to extreme situations  natural events  earthquakes  tsunamis  volcanic events  flash flood  and for the fight against pandemic and epidemic situations.The modeling of scientific phenomena today requires high performance simulations  data analysis  artificial intelligence  and data visualization. The Leonardo system will enable extremely high throughput with low power consumption. This AI supercomputer will have a computing power of 250 petaflops when fully completed (on the High-Performance Linpack test basis)  or 250 million billion floating point operations per second ‚Äì 10 times more than Cineca‚Äôs previous system ‚Äì with a storage capacity of over 100 petabytes.The system is built on Atos' BullSequana XH2000 supercomputer direct liquid-cooled (DLC) nodes  each with four NVIDIA A100 Tense Core GPUs and a single 3rd Generation Intel¬Æ Xeon¬Æ Scalable processor. The system relies on Micron‚Äôs leading-edge DDR5 DRAM technology   to enable the extreme bandwidth and system performance required to meet High-Performance Computing demands. It will also use NVIDIA Quantum 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking platform  with smart In-Network Computing acceleration engines that enable extremely low latency and high data throughput to provide the highest AI and HPC application performance and scalability. It is equipped with approximately 3 500 Intel¬Æ Xeon¬Æ processors and 14 000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with a performance of 10 ExaFLOPS in reduced precision  typical of AI applications. The Data-centric partition is based on BullSequana X2140 three-node CPU Blade and is equipped with two 4th Generation Intel¬Æ Xeon¬Æ Scalable processors (previously codenamed Sapphire Rapids) each with 56 cores.Access to the data center  first delayed due to the pandemic  was quickly provided to the Atos and Cineca teams in late July  thanks a strong collaboration between both teams on-site. Since then  over 155 racks of equipment have been delivered  installed  and networked to allow the teams to do initial HPL (High Performance Linpack test) runs while the system is still being fully configured.Anders Dam Jensen  Executive Director of the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU)  said: ‚ÄúToday's announcement is another testimony to the fact that EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is delivering on its objectives. Despite Leonardo installation only having started a few months ago  it is already ranked as the 4th fastest supercomputer in the world. By combining the best of Artificial Intelligence and HPC technologies  this EuroHPC machine will be a valuable resource for European research and industry to innovate and bring benefits to citizens in fields such as medicine  energy  and agriculture. Leonardo's ranking on the Top500 list is another example of the results which can be achieved through European cooperation.""Sanzio Bassini  Director of the HPC Department  CINECA said ""CINECA confirms its commitment in the development of the HPC ecosystem in Italy and in Europe. This new achievement  obtained in a challenging short time  demonstrates as European competence and technology is highly mastered and capable to provide to the public and private scientific community access to HPC system co-designed to meet at the same time high productivity capacity and extremely high computational performance‚ÄùEmmanuel Le Roux  SVP  Global head of HPC  AI and Quantum  Atos  commented ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs achievement is yet another example of Atos‚Äô commitment to Europe‚Äôs economic and technological sovereignty in an energy-optimized environment. As a world-class leader in HPC  Atos is committed to pave the way to Exascale systems by pushing the technological boundaries with a hybridization strategy and by providing increased performance. We are proud to collaborate with EuroHPC and Cineca to make the best of HPC and AI technologies  helping Italian and European scientists and researchers prevent medical and environmental crisis.""Atos now has 43 supercomputers in the TOP500  with two new systems in the ranking including Leonardo and P√©gaso system hosted by Petrobras.From November 13th to November 18th 2022  Atos will take part in SC2022: come meet our experts on booth #2809!

As such  no distinction is made in third-party management  which is presented solely in agent form.This presentation therefore allows a direct reading of syndication fees  sales commissions  and management fees.This new presentation has no impact on EBITDA  operating income  or net income. The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.DYNAMIC GROWTH IN OWNED AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AT END-SEPTEMBER 2022Owned activities grew by ‚Ç¨34.2 million over nine months  with respective increases of ‚Ç¨14.2 million for leasing activity and ‚Ç¨20.0 million for equipment sales activity thanks to sales of own-account containers  which outperformed.Management activity grew by ‚Ç¨3.3 million  with an increase of ‚Ç¨1.6 million in syndication fees (Freight Railcars and Containers activities) and sales fees on used equipment belonging to investors (+‚Ç¨1.4 million in the Containers activity).ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY DIVISIONThe Freight Railcars activity rose (+11.3%) to ‚Ç¨40.4 million in the first nine months:Owned activity expanded by ‚Ç¨3.6 million  resulting from an increase in leasing revenue from owned equipment (+15.7%)  driven by growth in the utilisation rate (87.1% versus 84.6% over the same period in 2021) and by the leasing of newly acquired railcars.Management activity was also up  with syndication fees increasing by ‚Ç¨0.4 million with transactions carried out in June 2022.The River Barges activity saw a boost in revenue of ‚Ç¨5.1 million thanks to the vigorous level of barge chartering in the Rhine basin. The utilisation rate in the third quarter of 2022 was nearly 100% in the division.The Containers activity posted a sharp increase of ‚Ç¨33.9 million. The performance of leasing activity remained strong (+‚Ç¨5.4 million) with an average utilisation rate of 98.1% over the period. However  most of the increase came from sales of owned equipment (new built containers trading activity)  which rose by ‚Ç¨25.8 million. Management activity increased by ‚Ç¨2.8 million  spurred by syndication fees in the second quarter and commissions on the sale of investor equipment.The Modular Buildings activity in Africa  presented on the ""Miscellaneous"" line  was down ‚Ç¨5.6 million with fewer projects delivered than in 2021.Restated Revenue from activities Q1 2022Q2 2022Q3 2022TOTAL 2022Q1 2021Q2 2021Q3 2021TOTAL 2021(in ‚Ç¨ thousand) Leasing revenue on owned equipment 10 544 11 142 11 292 32 978 9 152 9 223 10 123 28 498 Ancillary services 1 858 1 177 1 820 4 855 1 873 1 724 1 951 5 548 Total leasing activity 12 402 12 319 13 112 37 833 11 025 10 947 12 074 34 046 Sales of owned equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total sales of equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total of owned activity 12 512 12 557 13 481 38 550 11 345 11 350 12 236 34 931 Syndication fees 0 446 1 447 0 0 0 0 Management fees 466 451 507 1 424 463 470 451 1 384 Total of management activity 466 897 508 1 871 463 470 451 1 384 Total Freight railcars 12 978 13 454 13 989 40 421 11 808 11 820 12 687 36 315 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 1 619 1 789 1 869 5 277 1 688 1 745 1 770 5 203 Ancillary services 1 807 2 385 3 788 7 980 683 972 1 286 2 941 Total leasing activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 371 2 717 3 056 8 144 Sales of owned equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total sales of equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total of owned activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 412 2 717 3 056 8 185 Management fees 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total of management activity 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total River Barges 3 440 4 179 5 668 13 287 2 418 2 723 3 061 8 202 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 3 342 3 973 4 013 11 328 2 384 2 654 2 572 7 610 Ancillary services 2 070 1 325 1 779 5 174 191 1 054 2 297 3 542 Total leasing activity 5 412 5 298 5 792 16 502 2 575 3 708 4 869 11 152 Sales of owned equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total sales of equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total of owned activity 18 617 17 873 18 759 55 249 6 055 7 232 10 860 24 147 Syndication fees 0 2 076 64 2 140 17 946 48 1 011 Management fees 498 530 565 1 593 428 415 439 1 282 Sales fees 336 1 349 801 2 486 591 358 181 1 130 Total of management activity 834 3 955 1 430 6 219 1 036 1 719 668 3 423 Total Containers 19 451 21 828 20 189 61 468 7 091 8 951 11 528 27 570 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 4 5 4 13 5 11 15 31 Ancillary services -3 -3 3 -3 -2 -3 -4 -9 Total leasing activity 1 2 7 10 3 8 11 22 Sales of owned equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total sales of equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total of owned activity 1 548 1 438 2 063 5 049 3 247 4 409 2 990 10 646 Other capital gains on disposals 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Others 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Miscellaneous and eliminations 1 548 1 438 2 069 5 055 3 247 4 415 2 990 10 652 Total Restated Revenue from activities 37 417 40 899 41 915 120 231 24 564 27 909 30 266 82 739OUTLOOKIn the current context of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates  Touax continues to roll out its activities  thanks to a resilient business model and recurring revenues based on long-term contracts. The Group plans to seize new asset acquisition opportunity over the coming months  while also adopting a prudent investment policy. The current inflationary environment has a positive effect on the valuation of the portfolio of assets. However  prices have normalised in the container business  with the purchase price of new containers returning to the average levels of 2020.From a structural and medium- to long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from developments in relation to infrastructures  e-commerce and intermodal logistics as they keep pace with the expectations of consumers  industrial groups  public authorities  lenders and investors around green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS22 March 2023: Press release on annual results (English/French)22 March 2023: Presentation of annual results to financial analysts in Paris (in French)23 March 2023: Investor call (in English)TOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

The study was initiated at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2021 and is currently ongoing in the US. The objective of the study is to document whether LTX-315 in combination with pembrolizumab is effective in inducing tumor responses in patients who have failed prior anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy.The clinical trial has now been extended to Spain  France and Norway and sites are opened in all three countries. The expansion of the site network will mitigate recruitment challenges  drive enrollment towards completion and extend the clinical impact field for LTX-315. The European branch of the study is performed at highly recognized sites with intratumoral immunotherapy expertise  led by melanoma experts at each site. It will follow the same protocol as in the US.The regulatory application in Europe was approved in Q3 2022  and efforts to initiate recruitment of patients is ongoing with the aim to complete enrollment in the study in early 2023.""We are very pleased to now be able to recruit patients in three European countries that will help us to complete the ongoing ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II study""  says CEO and Co-founder of Lytix Biopharma  √òystein Rekdal.CONTACT:For more information  please contact:Ole Peter Nordby  [email protected]SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.74,0.25,0.0,True,English,"['Lytix Biopharma', 'ATLAS-IT-05 study', 'expansion', 'Europe', 'anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy', 'ongoing ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II study', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center', 'Phase II combination study', 'SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS', 'Norwegian immuno-oncology company', 'intratumoral immunotherapy expertise', 'Ole Peter Nordby', 'clinical impact field', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'three European countries', 'ATLAS-IT-05 study', 'three countries', 'European branch', 'clinical trial', 'advanced melanoma', 'tumor responses', 'melanoma experts', 'same protocol', 'regulatory application', '√òystein Rekdal', 'site activation', 'site network', 'recruitment challenges', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'LTX-315', 'pembrolizumab', 'patients', 'US', 'objective', 'prior', 'Spain', 'France', 'sites', 'expansion', 'enrollment', 'completion', 'Q3', 'efforts', 'aim', 'early 2023', 'CEO', 'founder', 'CONTACT', 'information']",2022-11-14,2022-11-14,prnewswire.com

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYOctober was a mixed month for Structured Debt Markets as European CLO debt tranches experienced a price rebound - especially the ones that were significantly hit in September - while US CLO performances were slightly negative. As a result Volta‚Äôs net asset value (‚ÄúNAV‚Äù) declined by -2.6% in October.Diving into Volta‚Äôs underlying sub asset classes  monthly performances** were as follow: +0.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -3.9% for CLO Equity tranches; +1.7% for CLO Debt tranches (driven by +6.2% on European CLO debt); and -0.4% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund‚Äôs NAV).As for every quarter  October was an heavy month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. We were expecting relatively healthy ones across the board and our positions did deliver on that front. Volta received in October the equivalent of ‚Ç¨9.1m in terms of interest and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received ‚Ç¨23.4m interest and coupons. A 22.3% annualized cash flow to NAV.Looking at fundamentals  we continued to see slightly more downgrades than upgrades in both the US and the European loan markets  although at a very moderate pace. We have been highlighting for months through this channel of communication the fact that inflation per se can positively impact companies‚Äô balance sheets. The release of Q3 earnings demonstrated once more that when revenues increase (in nominal amount) at a high pace  earnings can be maintained or even increased despite companies suffering from margin pressure. At the time of writing this publication  90% of the S&P companies have reported their Q3 earnings; revenues are up 12.2% (from the previous quarter) allowing earnings to grow by ‚Äúonly‚Äù 3.9%.In the meantime  this increase in revenues is eroding the real value of debt. We believe that the real value of debt for the average US company was basically eroded by 20% in the last two years when considering that from Q3 2020 to Q4 2022 the US GDP grew by 20% in nominal terms. This relationship between nominal growth and debt and the maitainance of healthy earnings can explain why rating agencies have so far been relatively slow (and they may be correct in doing so) in downgrading debt even though many companies do suffer or will suffer from higher interest rates.Our view remains that the overall dynamics are still more favorable for the US relative to Europe. At the end of October  12 months running default rates in Loans were still low at 0.4% in Europe and 0.8% in the US. We expect to see more deterioration in Europe than in the US in the coming quarters and consider it reasonable to see default rates move in the 2% area in the US and in the 3% area in Europe for 2023.This kind of default pattern will not materially impact the distribution of interests by Volta‚Äôs assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.We recently opened a European CLO Warehouse as part of this strategy. No loans have yet been purchased but we expect to start ramping assets in the near term to take advantage of significant price discounts and patiently build a very profitable CLO Equity position.As at the end of October 2022  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨206.8m or ‚Ç¨5.65 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.5% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.1% as at 30 September 2022  0.4% was at 31 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 People living with MG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100 000 population; approximately 36 000 to 60 000 cases.4 In Europe  the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100 000 population.5""People living with gMG experience high treatment burden  on top of the debilitating impact of the condition  and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments to support the gMG community. Our goal is to provide a solution that can help meet these needs and transform lives "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""The acceptance of the NDA by the FDA as well as the acceptance of the MAA by the EMA  brings us one step further on our journey towards approval for this medicine. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this important new treatment option to patients.""The NDA and MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293)  which demonstrated at week 12 that treatment with zilucoplan (0.3 mg/kg daily) resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in key gMG-specific outcomes compared with placebo in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. The study met its primary endpoint with zilucoplan showing a placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.09 points in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at week 12 (p<0.001).6Zilucoplan demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile  showing a similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%). The most common TEAEs were injection site bruising  headache  and diarrhea. Rates of treatment discontinuation due to a TEAE were low and all patients who completed the 12-week treatment period have entered the ongoing RAISE-XT open-label extension study (NCT04225871).6 7In the RAISE study  174 adult patients were randomised to receive daily SC  self-administered doses of placebo (N=88) or zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg (N=86). Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms.6As a complement C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan is a targeted therapy that inhibits key components in the underlying pathophysiology of gMG  addressing the underlying mechanism of neuromuscular junction damage.8 9""We are deeply committed to improving outcomes for the gMG community. People who live with gMG suffer unpredictable  fluctuating  and debilitating symptoms  which have a huge impact on their lives. We want to help reduce the day-to-day burden of this challenging disease "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""If approved  zilucoplan has the potential to address the unmet need for people with gMG by providing targeted improvements in signs and symptoms of gMG disease activity and severity. A benefit of targeted treatment is that it may help reduce the adverse events that can be associated with non-specific immunosuppressive treatment of gMG.""UCB anticipates making regulatory filings for zilucoplan in gMG in Great Britain  Japan  and rest of the world from Q3 2022 onwards.Alongside zilucoplan  UCB is also investigating rozanolixizumab  a SC-administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  as a potential treatment for gMG. UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions for rozanolixizumab later this year.10For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01[email protected]U.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655[email protected]Corporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64[email protected]Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14[email protected]About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700 000 people worldwide.11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3  4gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4  12 gMG can occur in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.13 14 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade.15 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR-Ab+ gMG.About the zilucoplan RAISE study 6   7The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12  time to rescue therapy  the proportion with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1)  the proportion with a ‚â•3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ‚â•5-point reduction in QMG without rescue therapy  all measured at Week 12. The secondary safety endpoint is incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the 12 week RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open label extension study  RAISE-XT.For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About ZilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.9 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.1 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About RozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is an SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.16 15Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.17 Orphan designation was granted in 202018 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

The study was initiated at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2021 and is currently ongoing in the US. The objective of the study is to document whether LTX-315 in combination with pembrolizumab is effective in inducing tumor responses in patients who have failed prior anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy.The clinical trial has now been extended to Spain  France and Norway and sites are opened in all three countries. The expansion of the site network will mitigate recruitment challenges  drive enrollment towards completion and extend the clinical impact field for LTX-315. The European branch of the study is performed at highly recognized sites with intratumoral immunotherapy expertise  led by melanoma experts at each site. It will follow the same protocol as in the US.The regulatory application in Europe was approved in Q3 2022  and efforts to initiate recruitment of patients is ongoing with the aim to complete enrollment in the study in early 2023.""We are very pleased to now be able to recruit patients in three European countries that will help us to complete the ongoing ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II study""  says CEO and Co-founder of Lytix Biopharma  √òystein Rekdal.CONTACT:For more information  please contact:Ole Peter Nordby  ole.peter.nordby@lytixbiopharma.comView original content:SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.74,0.25,0.0,True,English,"['Lytix Biopharma', 'ATLAS-IT-05 study', 'expansion', 'Europe', 'anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy', 'ongoing ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II study', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center', 'Phase II combination study', 'SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS', 'Norwegian immuno-oncology company', 'intratumoral immunotherapy expertise', 'clinical impact field', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'three European countries', 'Ole Peter Nordby', 'ATLAS-IT-05 study', 'three countries', 'European branch', 'clinical trial', 'advanced melanoma', 'tumor responses', 'melanoma experts', 'same protocol', 'regulatory application', '√òystein Rekdal', 'original content', 'site activation', 'site network', 'recruitment challenges', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'LTX-315', 'pembrolizumab', 'patients', 'US', 'objective', 'prior', 'Spain', 'France', 'sites', 'expansion', 'enrollment', 'completion', 'Q3', 'efforts', 'aim', 'early 2023', 'CEO', 'founder', 'CONTACT', 'information']",2022-11-14,2022-11-14,fox19.com
