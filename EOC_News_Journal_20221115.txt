It is the result of nearly 18 months of in-depth evaluation by our customer of our technology  which has demonstrated its relevance compared to the most advanced alternatives in the industry  the quality of our teams  whom I would like to thank for the remarkable work that was done throughout these discussions  and of our ability  as a strategic partner company to offer the guarantees required to sign a contract of this magnitude with a major international player. This contract is further proof of the change of dimension initiated by our company and a further step towards becoming one of the world leaders in our market.”A MAJOR CONTRACT  WHICH CONFIRMS KALRAY'S ABILITY TO CONVINCE MARKET LEADERSThis major contract was signed with an American company listed on the NASDAQ  a major player in the industry that generated several tens of billions of dollars in revenue in 2021 and had a market capitalization of over one hundred billion dollars.The contract covers the development and supply of acceleration cards based on Kalray's DPU processors  on which the customer intends to build the next generation of its products and services. This agreement includes technical  commercial and financial terms and represents a commercial potential of several tens of millions of Euros per year. The signing of this contract demonstrates Kalray's ability to win over the most demanding players in the market and to sign contracts with very high revenue-generating potential.AND CONFIRMS THE RELEVANCE OF KALRAY'S TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODELThe key criterion in the customer's choice was the ability of Kalray's technology and its offering of acceleration cards to process the customer's data with the best performance/price and performance/consumption ratio. The advanced tests showed that Kalray's solution was a factor of 3 to 5 times better than the competition  representing a potential savings for the customer of several hundred million dollars over the life of the project. In addition to this cost/performance advantage  Kalray's solutions can be easily programmed and can handle a wide variety of data processing in parallel  which traditional alternatives such as GPUs or FPGAs do not allow.Kalray's ability to support such a large contract comes from its ""fabless"" business model. Like other high-growth companies like NVIDIA  Kalray does not have a factory. Instead  Kalray relies on industry partners such as TSMC  the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer  and Wistron  one of the world's largest card and server manufacturers  to manufacture its hardware solutions without having to invest in a production facility.A CONTRACT IN 3 CLEARLY DEFINED STAGESThe first phase began with the signing of the contract and covers the manufacturing of an ultra-high performance accelerator card including 4 Kalray MPPA® DPU processors and the support of the customer's development teams for the development of their next generation product. The customer has already committed $1 million to Kalray to cover the various phases of this milestone  which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.The second step will be for the customer  once performance is confirmed  to launch pre-series production of its new generation of product  resulting in initial multi-million Euro card orders.The third step will be volume production  which should represent orders of several thousand cards per year  i.e. revenues of several tens of millions of Euros per year  over a period of at least 5 years  which should be starting in 2025.This signature is in line with Kalray's strategy to work with major players looking for a unique technology for very large projects. The company is currently in discussions with several players with the same profile and believes that this first major contract should be a catalyst for signing new contracts with this type of first tier customer and with all its prospects in general.ABOUT KALRAYKalray is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies and solutions for high-performance  data centric computing markets  from cloud to edge.Kalray provides a full range of products to enable smarter  more efficient  and energy-wise data-intensive applications and infrastructures.

Results showed that lacutamab produced a global objective response rate (ORR) of 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]  13.8-50.0) in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF patients (n=21)  including 2 complete responses and 4 partial responses.The Company announced that it will report preliminary data from the Phase 2 TELLOMAK study in Sézary syndrome at the ASH (American Society of Hematology) 2022 Annual Congress on 10 December. The ASH abstract states that the preliminary data demonstrate that lacutamab showed clinical activity and a favorable safety profile. In the heavily pre-treated post-mogamulizumab patient population with an average of six prior lines of therapy  in the Intention to treat population (ITT) population  the global confirmed ORR was 21.6% (8/37). Confirmed ORR in the skin was 35.1% (13/37) and confirmed ORR in the blood was 37.8% (14/37). Additional data will be presented at the ASH 2022 Annual Congress.On 11 September  at the ESMO 2022 conference  the Company presented a poster on the ongoing lacutamab Phase 1b trial design in monotherapy in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).Two clinical trials are underway evaluating lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory PTCL: Phase 1b trial: a Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate lacutamab as a monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed PTCL. Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.ANKET™ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):An 18 October edition of Cell Reports Medicine described the development of Innate’s fit-for-purpose ANKET™ antibody-based tetra-specific molecule to harness the antitumor functions of NK cells  boosting their capacity to proliferate  to accumulate at the tumor site and to kill tumor cells.Progress continues toward investigational new drug (IND) filing in 2023 for the CD20 targeted tetra-specific ANKET™  IPH6501.Sanofi will present two posters on SAR’579/IPH6101 and SAR’514/IPH6401 at the ASH 2022 Annual Congress on the 11 and 12 December: An open-label  first-in-human  dose-escalation study of SAR443579 administered as single agent by intravenous infusion in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplasia (HR-MDS) The Novel Trifunctional Anti-BCMA NK Cell Engager SAR’514 Has Potent in-Vitro and in-Vivo Anti-Myeloma Effect through Dual NK Cell EngagementThe Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi continues  evaluating IPH6101/SAR’579  the first NKp46/CD16-based CD123-targeted ANKET™ NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).It was previously announced that Sanofi had made the decision to progress IPH6401/SAR’514 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies.

The paper on BT-001 was highlighted at the annual Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) conference being held November 8-12  2022 in Boston  MA.The annual award  judged by a prestigious review committee of SITC leadership and the JITC Editorial Board  recognizes one paper in the “Oncolytic and Local Immunotherapy” category for presenting outstanding research on the role of therapeutic agents designed to target tumor cells or the tumor microenvironment.The winning paper  Vectorized Treg-depleting αCTLA-4 elicits antigen cross-presentation and CD8+ T cell immunity to reject ‘cold’ tumors  demonstrates in vivo proof of concept for Treg depleting immune checkpoint blocking vectorized αCTLA-4 as a highly effective and safe strategy to target CTLA-4.Transgene and BioInvent are co-developing BT-001  an oncolytic virus developed using Transgene’s Invir.IO™ platform that is armed with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody to illicit a strong and effective anti-tumor response. The drug is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial as a single agent and in combination with the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) against solid tumors. Positive initial Phase I data announced in June 2022 confirmed the mechanism of action of BT-001 as a single agent and demonstrated first signs of anti-tumor activity.The papers’ two co-first authors  Dr Monika Semmrich  Principal Scientist at BioInvent  and Dr Jean-Baptiste Marchand  Head of the Protein Science Lab at Transgene  will each receive a monetary prize. The award has been presented at the SITC Meeting Awards Ceremony  taking place Friday  November 11 from 8:00 – 8:20 a.m. EST.The full paper can be accessed here.KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene’s Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VV cop TK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent’s proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody will be greatly improved. BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent.

(HYSR)...,"NEW YORK  NY / ACCESSWIRE / November 14  2022 / TECO 2030 ASA (Oslo Stock Exchange:TECO)(OTCQX:TECFF) is pleased to announce that it has accepted an NOK 100 million investment from SunHydrogen  Inc. (HYSR).A US-based company  SunHydrogen is the developer of a breakthrough technology to make renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water. Currently in development  SunHydrogen's technology utilizes a nanoparticle-based approach in which billions of microscopic nanoparticles split apart water at the molecular level into oxygen and green hydrogen.Because SunHydrogen's technology directly uses the electrical charges created by sunlight to generate hydrogen  the Company's nanoparticle technology does not rely on grid power or require costly power electronics. Additionally  SunHydrogen's planned scalable system configuration of many individual hydrogen-generating panels ensures redundancy and stability.Through its cooperation with SunHydrogen  TECO 2030 will look to bolster its international visibility  specifically in the US  and further its zero emission fuel cell projects around the world.TECO 2030 ASA  Monday  November 14  2022  Press release pictureTECO 2030 is currently accelerating the transition to renewable fuels by developing and building Europe's first gigafactory of hydrogen PEM fuel cell stacks for medium to heavy-duty trucks and PEM fuel cell modules for maritime applications.Following the investment  SunHydrogen will be invited for one board position on TECO 2030's board of directors. As part of the investment  the two parties agree to further regulate their joint intention to pursue a potential business combination through which an up-listing of the investor on a US exchange will be explored.""I am pleased to announce this strategic investment by SunHydrogen which will give us more visibility and a strong strategic partner in the US which has very ambitious hydrogen plans "" said TECO 2030's CEO Tore Enger. ""I am looking forward to cooperating with SunHydrogen on our mission toward zero emission fuel cell projects "" Mr. Enger added.Story continues""SunHydrogen believes strongly in TECO 2030's mission "" said SunHydrogen's CEO Tim Young. ""We are committed to furthering the green hydrogen economy  and through our cooperation with TECO 2030  we believe our companies can make a significant impact in a fast-growing market that Goldman Sachs estimates to be worth $12 trillion by 2050.""About TECO 2030TECO 2030 is a Norwegian based clean tech company developing zero-emission technology for the maritime and heavy industry sectors. We are developing PEM hydrogen fuel cell stacks and PEM hydrogen fuel cell modules that enable ships and other heavy-duty applications to become emission-free. The company is listed on Euronext Growth on Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker TECO and in New York  OTCQX under the ticker TECFF. TECO 2030 is a spinoff from TECO Maritime Group  a group that has provided technology and services to the global shipping industry since 1994. For more information  please visit www.teco2030.no.About SunHydrogen  Inc.SunHydrogen is developing a breakthrough  low-cost technology to make renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water  including seawater and wastewater. The only byproduct of hydrogen fuel is pure water  unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil  coal and natural gas that release carbon dioxide and other contaminants into the atmosphere when used. By optimizing the science of water electrolysis at the nano-level  our low-cost nanoparticles mimic photosynthesis to efficiently use sunlight to separate hydrogen from water  ultimately producing environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen.

Nov. 14  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced completion of the dose escalation part of a phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with locally advanced (LA) or borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer (PC). The phase 1 study (“Study 2019-1001”) is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson).“The tolerable safety profile  establishment of recommended phase 2 dose  and early signals of efficacy we have observed in the dose escalation part for locally advanced patients of our phase 1 study give us confidence to now include borderline resectable patients in the expansion part ” said Leonard A. Farber  MD  Chief Clinical and Medical Affairs Officer at Nanobiotix. “In the borderline resectable pancreatic cancer population  a positive correlation has been observed between achieving resectability through local and systemic control with preoperative therapy and potentially improving survival outcomes. Inclusion of the borderline resectable stage in the study will also expand the eligible patient population to include a larger proportion of pancreatic cancer patients  allowing for the robust evaluation of NBTXR3’s potential to have a significant impact in this recalcitrant disease.”Study 2019-1001 is being conducted as part of the ongoing strategic collaboration between Nanobiotix and MD Anderson. The complete dose escalation part of the study recruited 11 patients  and all patients had unresectable disease at study entry. A single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 followed by 15 fractions of RT showed to be feasible and well-tolerated and the recommended phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 was established at 42% of gross tumor volume.Notably  one patient on Study 2019-1001 had a partial response 9 months after RT and has had durable local control for over two years. One other patient experienced local control that allowed unresectable disease to become resectable. Negative margin surgery (“R0 surgery”) was achieved for this patient and pathological complete response was observed. The dose expansion part of the study will include more robust evaluation of patients with borderline resectable disease at study entry.About Study 2019-1001Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare  deadly disease. Given that surgery with R0 resection (i.e.  macroscopically complete tumor removal with negative microscopic surgical margins) remains the only hope for long-term survival  clinical trials have investigated various neoadjuvant strategies—wherein patients receive anti-cancer drugs or radiation prior to surgery—to increase the surgery-eligible population while also increasing the R0 resection rate.MD Anderson Study 2019-1001 is an open-label  single-arm  prospective phase I study consisting of two parts: (i) dose-escalation to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); and (ii) expansion at RP2D.The patient population will include adults (age ≥ 18 years) with borderline resectable (BR) or locally advanced (LA) PC that are radiographically non-metastatic at screening  and that have not previously received radiation therapy or surgery for pancreatic cancer. The complete dose escalation part recruited 11 patients with unresectable LAPC and the RP2D was established at 42% of gross tumor volume. Twelve additional patients with either LAPC or BRPC will be enrolled for the RP2D expansion.The objectives of the study are the determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  and the RP2D.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC  or lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

It will have the particularity of being part of a global project to secure an industrial site  combining human resources (security agents) and technological tool. This project is unparalleled in the world and foreshadows the future of the private security sector by combining people and technology  based on a unique and non-disruptive business model. It is now piloted by our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech and perfectly concretizes our strategy of dronification of the private security sector.Combined with the opening in early 2023 of our demonstration site in South Africa created in partnership with the University of Pretoria  this very positive commercial development could allow us to achieve our 2023 target  which is to market 9 systems  representing revenues of €1.1 million and a gross margin of €0.45 million (41%).The second system in our range of ""security"" solutions  ISS Spotter wired is also experiencing an acceleration in its commercial development.First  several negotiations are advanced for sales of systems  mainly out of France  which could correspond to more than 10 units sold in the coming months.Story continuesSecondly  a training program has started within our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech  aimed at building a team of security agents with the remote pilot license. This team will make it possible to offer  during sporting and cultural events that will be numerous in France from 2023  a complete ""à la carte"" service combining wired ISS Spotter system and authorized operators. Our ambitions for 2023  which are based on current sales contacts and orders already recorded  correspond to 25 systems sold and 50 missions completed  representing revenues of €2.9 million and a gross margin of €1.7 million (59%).The third and final system under our DDSA branch (Delta Drone SA and its support subsidiaries in France) is the Countbot automated inventory solution. In this area  we have set up a particular scheme  because of our partnership strategy with one of the main players in the sector worldwide: he is our exclusive customer  who is responsible for him either to resell the acquired systems or to offer them as services  the missions being in this case exclusively carried out by Delta Drone's teams. The first successful missions  including the very emblematic one on behalf of L'Oréal last September  confirm that Countbot is the most successful solution on the market  combining minimum completion time  success rate (decoding) greater than 99% and total safety of people and goods during warehouse missions.Given sustained demand from a growing number of world-renowned manufacturers  our ambition for 2023 is to market 6 systems and carry out 60 missions  all representing revenues of €1.1 million and a gross margin of €0.45 million (42%).The three systems proposed by the DDSA branch (ISS Spotter automatic and ISS Spotter wired for the security sector  Countbot for the warehouse logistics sector) have been designed and developed for several years by our subsidiary ""design office""  the company Delta Drone Engineering based in Nantes. They are now operational and no longer require the same R&D investment  even if changes will be periodically proposed thanks to feedback from field experience.For this reason  to support a sufficient workload and to succeed in transforming the design office into a profit center  we have worked in recent months to expand the R&D offer for customers outside the group  often as part of projects ""derivative"" of our own solutions.Thanks to this new momentum  a first major project is in the start-up phase  which could absorb a large part of our engineers' working time. We have also increased opportunities to pool R&D efforts with several of our UDT holdings  thus completing the overall workload plan of the Design Office.All these R&D activities should represent in 2023 ""third-party"" revenues of around €0.8 million and a gross margin of €0.7 million (85%)  making it possible to fully self-finance our subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering.In parallel with all these commercial developments  which could represent total revenues of around €5.9 million and a gross margin of around €3.3 million (56%) for the DDSA branch alone  a vigorous cost reduction action has been carried out  resulting in a significant reduction in the DDSA branch workforce and a planned reduction in several purchasing positions. Thanks to these actions  the 2023 payroll of the DDSA branch will be limited to €2.1 million (a reduction of more than half compared to the previous amount) and all other operating expenses will be reduced to €1.5 million  compared to €2.5 million previously  i.e.  an overall operating expense of approximately €3.5 million.However  the now realistic prospect of achieving EBITDA breakeven in 2023 requires financing the associated working capital requirement. This is now the main reason why Delta Drone must continue to raise sufficient funds.This effort corresponds to only a few million  which unfortunately represents a very high dilution for the shareholder compared to the very low level of market capitalization. Obviously  a more ""reasonable"" level of market capitalization  better reflecting the size and position of the group as well as its promising prospects  would have the mechanical effect of greatly limiting the dilutive impact of the financing selected. In addition  the achievement of the objectives will have the immediate effect of significantly reducing the use of such financing  since the group will be in a positive cash flow situation.The emerging nature of the drone sector does not seriously allow for the consideration of other types of more traditional financing  such as bank debt  especially since the latter would have the effect of generating financial charges likely to absorb the first positive cash flow.2 – The other three branches of the group continue their development satisfactorilyThrough its operating subsidiaries  mainly ATM Group Security  the DDHT (Delta Drone Human & Tech) branch achieves sustainable revenues of more than €12 million  solidly based on multi-year contracts . It is profitable and an essential part of the group's strategy for the dronification of the security sector and for the success of inventory missions.The DDI branch (Delta Drone International and its subsidiaries) achieved revenues of approximately €4 million  consolidated its leading position in Africa and continued its development in Australia. It aims for a result close to balance in 2023The UDT branch creates industrial synergies with the group and benefits from the successful fundraising of several of its investments: the value of the portfolio now exceeds €10 million.In its historical private security business  the DDHT branch benefits from a market that is growing overall  boosted by the prospect of major sporting events that will take place in France in the coming years. However  the shortage of labour is becoming structural and the pressure on production costs (in particular the increase in wages in connection with the revaluation of the “SMIC”) penalizes the entire profession.Faced with this contrasting environment  DDHT strives to strengthen its attractiveness for new staff  but also for existing employees  in particular thanks to the opportunities to benefit from training and to evolve towards better paid tasks.As such  training  either to become an operator as part of Countbot missions  or to become a drone remote pilot are original and very differentiating professional opportunities.Since the beginning of September  the acquisition of an additional 3% of the capital allows Delta Drone to hold today 58.2% of Delta Drone International (DDI)  a company listed on the ASX stock exchange in Sydney  Australia and whose market capitalization is around 10 MAU$.A few weeks ago (October 17  2022)  DDI's South African subsidiary Rocketmine Pty Ltd announced the signing of a 2-year contract of KAU$516 with Rutenburg Platinium Mines Ltd Mogalakwena  a 100% subsidiary of the Anglo American mining group  consolidating its position as the African market leader in drone services for the mining industry.Like the DDHT branch  DDI is part of a logic of multi-year contracts  thus contributing strongly to the sustainability of the group and its visibility in the medium term.The DDI sub-group represents consolidated revenues of approximately €4 million and fully self-finances its development. It aims for a result close to balance for 2023.Several of the companies in the UDT portfolio have strengthened their position in their respective markets  attracting the attention and interest of major international players. As a first-time investor  UDT systematically adopts a strategy of being at the side of the managers  in order to facilitate the conclusion of fundraising  while maintaining an active role as a member of the Management Committees.At the same time  the mutual trust that has been forged over the years now makes it possible to start a process of pooling R&D expertise  a source of significant productivity for the group and for the companies in its ecosystem.All information contained in this press release will be communicated by means of press releases as they are executed. Negotiations and contracts signed in the field of security (ISS Spotter systems) concern the vast majority of large international groups and governments  for which strict confidentiality is required. As far as possible  however  information will be communicated to shareholders  particularly during future general meetings.About Delta Drone : The Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the sector of civil drones for professional use.

The Company has a well-established operational and production history in South Africa and extensive prior experience supplying rough diamonds to the world market.About the Tiffany & Co. AllianceThe Company has established a long-term strategic alliance and first right of refusal with Tiffany & Co. Canada  a subsidiary of world famous New York based Tiffany & Co.  to purchase up to 100% of the future production of rough diamonds from the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project at then current prices to be determined by the parties on an ongoing basis. In conjunction with this first right of refusal  Tiffany & Co. Canada also provided the Company with financing to advance the Project. Tiffany & Co. is now owned by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH)  a publicly traded company which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange (Euronext) under the symbol LVMH and on the OTC under the symbol LVMHF. For additional information on Tiffany & Co.  please visit their website at www.tiffany.com.About Krone-Endora at VenetiaIn February 2011  Diamcor acquired the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project from De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited  consisting of the prospecting rights over the farms Krone 104 and Endora 66  which represent a combined surface area of approximately 5 888 hectares directly adjacent to De Beers' flagship Venetia Diamond Mine in South Africa. On September 11  2014  the Company announced that the South African Department of Mineral Resources had granted a Mining Right for the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project encompassing 657.71 hectares of the Project's total area of 5 888 hectares. The Company has also submitted an application for a mining right over the remaining areas of the Project. The deposits which occur on the properties of Krone and Endora have been identified as a higher-grade ""Alluvial"" basal deposit which is covered by a lower-grade upper ""Eluvial"" deposit. The deposits are proposed to be the result of the direct-shift (in respect to the ""Eluvial"" deposit) and erosion (in respect to the ""Alluvial"" deposit) of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia Kimberlite areas. The deposits on Krone-Endora occur in two layers with a maximum total depth of approximately 15.0 metres from surface to bedrock  allowing for a very low-cost mining operation to be employed with the potential for near-term diamond production from a known high-quality source. Krone-Endora also benefits from the significant development of infrastructure and services already in place due to its location directly adjacent to the Venetia Mine.Qualified Person Statement:Mr. James P.

The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.DYNAMIC GROWTH IN OWNED AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AT END-SEPTEMBER 2022Owned activities grew by €34.2 million over nine months  with respective increases of €14.2 million for leasing activity and €20.0 million for equipment sales activity thanks to sales of own-account containers  which outperformed.Management activity grew by €3.3 million  with an increase of €1.6 million in syndication fees (Freight Railcars and Containers activities) and sales fees on used equipment belonging to investors (+€1.4 million in the Containers activity).ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY DIVISIONThe Freight Railcars activity rose (+11.3%) to €40.4 million in the first nine months:Owned activity expanded by €3.6 million  resulting from an increase in leasing revenue from owned equipment (+15.7%)  driven by growth in the utilisation rate (87.1% versus 84.6% over the same period in 2021) and by the leasing of newly acquired railcars.Management activity was also up  with syndication fees increasing by €0.4 million with transactions carried out in June 2022.The River Barges activity saw a boost in revenue of €5.1 million thanks to the vigorous level of barge chartering in the Rhine basin. The utilisation rate in the third quarter of 2022 was nearly 100% in the division.The Containers activity posted a sharp increase of €33.9 million. The performance of leasing activity remained strong (+€5.4 million) with an average utilisation rate of 98.1% over the period. However  most of the increase came from sales of owned equipment (new built containers trading activity)  which rose by €25.8 million. Management activity increased by €2.8 million  spurred by syndication fees in the second quarter and commissions on the sale of investor equipment.The Modular Buildings activity in Africa  presented on the ""Miscellaneous"" line  was down €5.6 million with fewer projects delivered than in 2021.Restated Revenue from activities Q1 2022Q2 2022Q3 2022TOTAL 2022Q1 2021Q2 2021Q3 2021TOTAL 2021(in € thousand) Leasing revenue on owned equipment 10 544 11 142 11 292 32 978 9 152 9 223 10 123 28 498 Ancillary services 1 858 1 177 1 820 4 855 1 873 1 724 1 951 5 548 Total leasing activity 12 402 12 319 13 112 37 833 11 025 10 947 12 074 34 046 Sales of owned equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total sales of equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total of owned activity 12 512 12 557 13 481 38 550 11 345 11 350 12 236 34 931 Syndication fees 0 446 1 447 0 0 0 0 Management fees 466 451 507 1 424 463 470 451 1 384 Total of management activity 466 897 508 1 871 463 470 451 1 384 Total Freight railcars 12 978 13 454 13 989 40 421 11 808 11 820 12 687 36 315 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 1 619 1 789 1 869 5 277 1 688 1 745 1 770 5 203 Ancillary services 1 807 2 385 3 788 7 980 683 972 1 286 2 941 Total leasing activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 371 2 717 3 056 8 144 Sales of owned equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total sales of equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total of owned activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 412 2 717 3 056 8 185 Management fees 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total of management activity 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total River Barges 3 440 4 179 5 668 13 287 2 418 2 723 3 061 8 202 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 3 342 3 973 4 013 11 328 2 384 2 654 2 572 7 610 Ancillary services 2 070 1 325 1 779 5 174 191 1 054 2 297 3 542 Total leasing activity 5 412 5 298 5 792 16 502 2 575 3 708 4 869 11 152 Sales of owned equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total sales of equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total of owned activity 18 617 17 873 18 759 55 249 6 055 7 232 10 860 24 147 Syndication fees 0 2 076 64 2 140 17 946 48 1 011 Management fees 498 530 565 1 593 428 415 439 1 282 Sales fees 336 1 349 801 2 486 591 358 181 1 130 Total of management activity 834 3 955 1 430 6 219 1 036 1 719 668 3 423 Total Containers 19 451 21 828 20 189 61 468 7 091 8 951 11 528 27 570 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 4 5 4 13 5 11 15 31 Ancillary services -3 -3 3 -3 -2 -3 -4 -9 Total leasing activity 1 2 7 10 3 8 11 22 Sales of owned equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total sales of equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total of owned activity 1 548 1 438 2 063 5 049 3 247 4 409 2 990 10 646 Other capital gains on disposals 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Others 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Miscellaneous and eliminations 1 548 1 438 2 069 5 055 3 247 4 415 2 990 10 652 Total Restated Revenue from activities 37 417 40 899 41 915 120 231 24 564 27 909 30 266 82 739OUTLOOKIn the current context of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates  Touax continues to roll out its activities  thanks to a resilient business model and recurring revenues based on long-term contracts. The Group plans to seize new asset acquisition opportunity over the coming months  while also adopting a prudent investment policy. The current inflationary environment has a positive effect on the valuation of the portfolio of assets. However  prices have normalised in the container business  with the purchase price of new containers returning to the average levels of 2020.From a structural and medium- to long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from developments in relation to infrastructures  e-commerce and intermodal logistics as they keep pace with the expectations of consumers  industrial groups  public authorities  lenders and investors around green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS22 March 2023: Press release on annual results (English/French)22 March 2023: Presentation of annual results to financial analysts in Paris (in French)23 March 2023: Investor call (in English)TOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

Nov. 14  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced completion of the dose escalation part of a phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with locally advanced (LA) or borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer (PC). The phase 1 study (“Study 2019-1001”) is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson).“The tolerable safety profile  establishment of recommended phase 2 dose  and early signals of efficacy we have observed in the dose escalation part for locally advanced patients of our phase 1 study give us confidence to now include borderline resectable patients in the expansion part ” said Leonard A. Farber  MD  Chief Clinical and Medical Affairs Officer at Nanobiotix. “In the borderline resectable pancreatic cancer population  a positive correlation has been observed between achieving resectability through local and systemic control with preoperative therapy and potentially improving survival outcomes. Inclusion of the borderline resectable stage in the study will also expand the eligible patient population to include a larger proportion of pancreatic cancer patients  allowing for the robust evaluation of NBTXR3’s potential to have a significant impact in this recalcitrant disease.”Study 2019-1001 is being conducted as part of the ongoing strategic collaboration between Nanobiotix and MD Anderson. The complete dose escalation part of the study recruited 11 patients  and all patients had unresectable disease at study entry. A single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 followed by 15 fractions of RT showed to be feasible and well-tolerated and the recommended phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 was established at 42% of gross tumor volume.Notably  one patient on Study 2019-1001 had a partial response 9 months after RT and has had durable local control for over two years. One other patient experienced local control that allowed unresectable disease to become resectable. Negative margin surgery (“R0 surgery”) was achieved for this patient and pathological complete response was observed. The dose expansion part of the study will include more robust evaluation of patients with borderline resectable disease at study entry.About Study 2019-1001Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare  deadly disease. Given that surgery with R0 resection (i.e.  macroscopically complete tumor removal with negative microscopic surgical margins) remains the only hope for long-term survival  clinical trials have investigated various neoadjuvant strategies—wherein patients receive anti-cancer drugs or radiation prior to surgery—to increase the surgery-eligible population while also increasing the R0 resection rate.MD Anderson Study 2019-1001 is an open-label  single-arm  prospective phase I study consisting of two parts: (i) dose-escalation to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); and (ii) expansion at RP2D.The patient population will include adults (age ≥ 18 years) with borderline resectable (BR) or locally advanced (LA) PC that are radiographically non-metastatic at screening  and that have not previously received radiation therapy or surgery for pancreatic cancer. The complete dose escalation part recruited 11 patients with unresectable LAPC and the RP2D was established at 42% of gross tumor volume. Twelve additional patients with either LAPC or BRPC will be enrolled for the RP2D expansion.The objectives of the study are the determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  and the RP2D.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study was launched in 2021. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company-sponsored phase I clinical study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC  or lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIX:Nanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

13175,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volta-finance-limited-net-asset-171500623.html,Volta Finance Limited - Net Asset Value as at 31 October 2022,Volta Finance Limited (VTA / VTAS) – October 2022 monthly report NOT FOR RELEASE  DISTRIBUTION  OR PUBLICATION  IN WHOLE OR PART  IN OR INTO THE UNITED...,"Volta Finance LimitedVolta Finance Limited (VTA / VTAS) – October 2022 monthly reportNOT FOR RELEASE  DISTRIBUTION  OR PUBLICATION  IN WHOLE OR PART  IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES*****Guernsey  14 November 2022AXA IM has published the Volta Finance Limited (the “Company” or “Volta Finance” or “Volta”) monthly report for October. The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYOctober was a mixed month for Structured Debt Markets as European CLO debt tranches experienced a price rebound - especially the ones that were significantly hit in September - while US CLO performances were slightly negative. As a result Volta’s net asset value (“NAV”) declined by -2.6% in October.Diving into Volta’s underlying sub asset classes  monthly performances** were as follow: +0.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -3.9% for CLO Equity tranches; +1.7% for CLO Debt tranches (driven by +6.2% on European CLO debt); and -0.4% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund’s NAV).As for every quarter  October was an heavy month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. We were expecting relatively healthy ones across the board and our positions did deliver on that front. Volta received in October the equivalent of €9.1m in terms of interest and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €23.4m interest and coupons. A 22.3% annualized cash flow to NAV.Looking at fundamentals  we continued to see slightly more downgrades than upgrades in both the US and the European loan markets  although at a very moderate pace. We have been highlighting for months through this channel of communication the fact that inflation per se can positively impact companies’ balance sheets. The release of Q3 earnings demonstrated once more that when revenues increase (in nominal amount) at a high pace  earnings can be maintained or even increased despite companies suffering from margin pressure. At the time of writing this publication  90% of the S&P companies have reported their Q3 earnings; revenues are up 12.2% (from the previous quarter) allowing earnings to grow by “only” 3.9%.Story continuesIn the meantime  this increase in revenues is eroding the real value of debt. We believe that the real value of debt for the average US company was basically eroded by 20% in the last two years when considering that from Q3 2020 to Q4 2022 the US GDP grew by 20% in nominal terms. This relationship between nominal growth and debt and the maitainance of healthy earnings can explain why rating agencies have so far been relatively slow (and they may be correct in doing so) in downgrading debt even though many companies do suffer or will suffer from higher interest rates.Our view remains that the overall dynamics are still more favorable for the US relative to Europe. At the end of October  12 months running default rates in Loans were still low at 0.4% in Europe and 0.8% in the US. We expect to see more deterioration in Europe than in the US in the coming quarters and consider it reasonable to see default rates move in the 2% area in the US and in the 3% area in Europe for 2023.This kind of default pattern will not materially impact the distribution of interests by Volta’s assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.We recently opened a European CLO Warehouse as part of this strategy. No loans have yet been purchased but we expect to start ramping assets in the near term to take advantage of significant price discounts and patiently build a very profitable CLO Equity position.As at the end of October 2022  Volta’s NAV was €206.8m or €5.65 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.5% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.1% as at 30 September 2022  0.4% was at 31 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2Story continuesgMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 People living with MG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100 000 population; approximately 36 000 to 60 000 cases.4 In Europe  the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100 000 population.5""People living with gMG experience high treatment burden  on top of the debilitating impact of the condition  and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments to support the gMG community. Our goal is to provide a solution that can help meet these needs and transform lives "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""The acceptance of the NDA by the FDA as well as the acceptance of the MAA by the EMA  brings us one step further on our journey towards approval for this medicine. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this important new treatment option to patients.""The NDA and MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293)  which demonstrated at week 12 that treatment with zilucoplan (0.3 mg/kg daily) resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in key gMG-specific outcomes compared with placebo in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. The study met its primary endpoint with zilucoplan showing a placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.09 points in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at week 12 (p<0.001).6Zilucoplan demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile  showing a similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%). The most common TEAEs were injection site bruising  headache  and diarrhea. Rates of treatment discontinuation due to a TEAE were low and all patients who completed the 12-week treatment period have entered the ongoing RAISE-XT open-label extension study (NCT04225871).6 7In the RAISE study  174 adult patients were randomised to receive daily SC  self-administered doses of placebo (N=88) or zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg (N=86). Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms.6As a complement C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan is a targeted therapy that inhibits key components in the underlying pathophysiology of gMG  addressing the underlying mechanism of neuromuscular junction damage.8 9""We are deeply committed to improving outcomes for the gMG community. People who live with gMG suffer unpredictable  fluctuating  and debilitating symptoms  which have a huge impact on their lives. We want to help reduce the day-to-day burden of this challenging disease "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""If approved  zilucoplan has the potential to address the unmet need for people with gMG by providing targeted improvements in signs and symptoms of gMG disease activity and severity. A benefit of targeted treatment is that it may help reduce the adverse events that can be associated with non-specific immunosuppressive treatment of gMG.""UCB anticipates making regulatory filings for zilucoplan in gMG in Great Britain  Japan  and rest of the world from Q3 2022 onwards.Alongside zilucoplan  UCB is also investigating rozanolixizumab  a SC-administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  as a potential treatment for gMG. UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions for rozanolixizumab later this year.10For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comU.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655daphne.teo@ucb.comCorporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700 000 people worldwide.11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3  4gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4  12 gMG can occur in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.13 14 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade.15 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR-Ab+ gMG.About the zilucoplan RAISE study 6 7The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12  time to rescue therapy  the proportion with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1)  the proportion with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG without rescue therapy  all measured at Week 12. The secondary safety endpoint is incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the 12 week RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open label extension study  RAISE-XT.For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About ZilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.9 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.1 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About RozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is an SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.16 15Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.17 Orphan designation was granted in 202018 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

It will have the particularity of being part of a global project to secure an industrial site  combining human resources (security agents) and technological tool. This project is unparalleled in the world and foreshadows the future of the private security sector by combining people and technology  based on a unique and non-disruptive business model. It is now piloted by our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech and perfectly concretizes our strategy of dronification of the private security sector.Combined with the opening in early 2023 of our demonstration site in South Africa created in partnership with the University of Pretoria  this very positive commercial development could allow us to achieve our 2023 target  which is to market 9 systems  representing revenues of €1.1 million and a gross margin of €0.45 million (41%).The second system in our range of ""security"" solutions  ISS Spotter wired is also experiencing an acceleration in its commercial development.First  several negotiations are advanced for sales of systems  mainly out of France  which could correspond to more than 10 units sold in the coming months.Secondly  a training program has started within our subsidiary Delta Drone Human & Tech  aimed at building a team of security agents with the remote pilot license. This team will make it possible to offer  during sporting and cultural events that will be numerous in France from 2023  a complete ""à la carte"" service combining wired ISS Spotter system and authorized operators. Our ambitions for 2023  which are based on current sales contacts and orders already recorded  correspond to 25 systems sold and 50 missions completed  representing revenues of €2.9 million and a gross margin of €1.7 million (59%).The third and final system under our DDSA branch (Delta Drone SA and its support subsidiaries in France) is the Countbot automated inventory solution. In this area  we have set up a particular scheme  because of our partnership strategy with one of the main players in the sector worldwide: he is our exclusive customer  who is responsible for him either to resell the acquired systems or to offer them as services  the missions being in this case exclusively carried out by Delta Drone's teams. The first successful missions  including the very emblematic one on behalf of L'Oréal last September  confirm that Countbot is the most successful solution on the market  combining minimum completion time  success rate (decoding) greater than 99% and total safety of people and goods during warehouse missions.Given sustained demand from a growing number of world-renowned manufacturers  our ambition for 2023 is to market 6 systems and carry out 60 missions  all representing revenues of €1.1 million and a gross margin of €0.45 million (42%).The three systems proposed by the DDSA branch (ISS Spotter automatic and ISS Spotter wired for the security sector  Countbot for the warehouse logistics sector) have been designed and developed for several years by our subsidiary ""design office""  the company Delta Drone Engineering based in Nantes. They are now operational and no longer require the same R&D investment  even if changes will be periodically proposed thanks to feedback from field experience.For this reason  to support a sufficient workload and to succeed in transforming the design office into a profit center  we have worked in recent months to expand the R&D offer for customers outside the group  often as part of projects ""derivative"" of our own solutions.Thanks to this new momentum  a first major project is in the start-up phase  which could absorb a large part of our engineers' working time. We have also increased opportunities to pool R&D efforts with several of our UDT holdings  thus completing the overall workload plan of the Design Office.All these R&D activities should represent in 2023 ""third-party"" revenues of around €0.8 million and a gross margin of €0.7 million (85%)  making it possible to fully self-finance our subsidiary Delta Drone Engineering.In parallel with all these commercial developments  which could represent total revenues of around €5.9 million and a gross margin of around €3.3 million (56%) for the DDSA branch alone  a vigorous cost reduction action has been carried out  resulting in a significant reduction in the DDSA branch workforce and a planned reduction in several purchasing positions. Thanks to these actions  the 2023 payroll of the DDSA branch will be limited to €2.1 million (a reduction of more than half compared to the previous amount) and all other operating expenses will be reduced to €1.5 million  compared to €2.5 million previously  i.e.  an overall operating expense of approximately €3.5 million.However  the now realistic prospect of achieving EBITDA breakeven in 2023 requires financing the associated working capital requirement. This is now the main reason why Delta Drone must continue to raise sufficient funds.This effort corresponds to only a few million  which unfortunately represents a very high dilution for the shareholder compared to the very low level of market capitalization. Obviously  a more ""reasonable"" level of market capitalization  better reflecting the size and position of the group as well as its promising prospects  would have the mechanical effect of greatly limiting the dilutive impact of the financing selected. In addition  the achievement of the objectives will have the immediate effect of significantly reducing the use of such financing  since the group will be in a positive cash flow situation.The emerging nature of the drone sector does not seriously allow for the consideration of other types of more traditional financing  such as bank debt  especially since the latter would have the effect of generating financial charges likely to absorb the first positive cash flow.2 – The other three branches of the group continue their development satisfactorilyThrough its operating subsidiaries  mainly ATM Group Security  the DDHT (Delta Drone Human & Tech) branch achieves sustainable revenues of more than €12 million  solidly based on multi-year contracts . It is profitable and an essential part of the group's strategy for the dronification of the security sector and for the success of inventory missions.The DDI branch (Delta Drone International and its subsidiaries) achieved revenues of approximately €4 million  consolidated its leading position in Africa and continued its development in Australia. It aims for a result close to balance in 2023The UDT branch creates industrial synergies with the group and benefits from the successful fundraising of several of its investments: the value of the portfolio now exceeds €10 million.In its historical private security business  the DDHT branch benefits from a market that is growing overall  boosted by the prospect of major sporting events that will take place in France in the coming years. However  the shortage of labour is becoming structural and the pressure on production costs (in particular the increase in wages in connection with the revaluation of the “SMIC”) penalizes the entire profession.Faced with this contrasting environment  DDHT strives to strengthen its attractiveness for new staff  but also for existing employees  in particular thanks to the opportunities to benefit from training and to evolve towards better paid tasks.As such  training  either to become an operator as part of Countbot missions  or to become a drone remote pilot are original and very differentiating professional opportunities.Since the beginning of September  the acquisition of an additional 3% of the capital allows Delta Drone to hold today 58.2% of Delta Drone International (DDI)  a company listed on the ASX stock exchange in Sydney  Australia and whose market capitalization is around 10 MAU$.A few weeks ago (October 17  2022)  DDI's South African subsidiary Rocketmine Pty Ltd announced the signing of a 2-year contract of KAU$516 with Rutenburg Platinium Mines Ltd Mogalakwena  a 100% subsidiary of the Anglo American mining group  consolidating its position as the African market leader in drone services for the mining industry.Like the DDHT branch  DDI is part of a logic of multi-year contracts  thus contributing strongly to the sustainability of the group and its visibility in the medium term.The DDI sub-group represents consolidated revenues of approximately €4 million and fully self-finances its development. It aims for a result close to balance for 2023.Several of the companies in the UDT portfolio have strengthened their position in their respective markets  attracting the attention and interest of major international players. As a first-time investor  UDT systematically adopts a strategy of being at the side of the managers  in order to facilitate the conclusion of fundraising  while maintaining an active role as a member of the Management Committees.At the same time  the mutual trust that has been forged over the years now makes it possible to start a process of pooling R&D expertise  a source of significant productivity for the group and for the companies in its ecosystem.All information contained in this press release will be communicated by means of press releases as they are executed. Negotiations and contracts signed in the field of security (ISS Spotter systems) concern the vast majority of large international groups and governments  for which strict confidentiality is required. As far as possible  however  information will be communicated to shareholders  particularly during future general meetings.About Delta Drone : The Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the sector of civil drones for professional use.

Atos and its ecosystem of partners have already successfully delivered the main part of the Leonardo system  hosted and managed by Cineca computing center located in the Technopole of Bologna.With this new cluster  Atos and Cineca will support the EU’s mission and sovereignty by fighting against environmental and medical emergency situations. It will contribute to the mitigation and management of risks due to extreme situations  natural events  earthquakes  tsunamis  volcanic events  flash flood  and for the fight against pandemic and epidemic situations.The modeling of scientific phenomena today requires high performance simulations  data analysis  artificial intelligence  and data visualization. The Leonardo system will enable extremely high throughput with low power consumption. This AI supercomputer will have a computing power of 250 petaflops when fully completed (on the High-Performance Linpack test basis)  or 250 million billion floating point operations per second – 10 times more than Cineca’s previous system – with a storage capacity of over 100 petabytes.The system is built on Atos' BullSequana XH2000 supercomputer direct liquid-cooled (DLC) nodes  each with four NVIDIA A100 Tense Core GPUs and a single 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor. The system relies on Micron’s leading-edge DDR5 DRAM technology   to enable the extreme bandwidth and system performance required to meet High-Performance Computing demands. It will also use NVIDIA Quantum 200Gb/s InfiniBand networking platform  with smart In-Network Computing acceleration engines that enable extremely low latency and high data throughput to provide the highest AI and HPC application performance and scalability. It is equipped with approximately 3 500 Intel® Xeon® processors and 14 000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with a performance of 10 ExaFLOPS in reduced precision  typical of AI applications. The Data-centric partition is based on BullSequana X2140 three-node CPU Blade and is equipped with two 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (previously codenamed Sapphire Rapids) each with 56 cores.Access to the data center  first delayed due to the pandemic  was quickly provided to the Atos and Cineca teams in late July  thanks a strong collaboration between both teams on-site. Since then  over 155 racks of equipment have been delivered  installed  and networked to allow the teams to do initial HPL (High Performance Linpack test) runs while the system is still being fully configured.Anders Dam Jensen  Executive Director of the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU)  said: “Today's announcement is another testimony to the fact that EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is delivering on its objectives. Despite Leonardo installation only having started a few months ago  it is already ranked as the 4th fastest supercomputer in the world. By combining the best of Artificial Intelligence and HPC technologies  this EuroHPC machine will be a valuable resource for European research and industry to innovate and bring benefits to citizens in fields such as medicine  energy  and agriculture. Leonardo's ranking on the Top500 list is another example of the results which can be achieved through European cooperation.""Sanzio Bassini  Director of the HPC Department  CINECA said ""CINECA confirms its commitment in the development of the HPC ecosystem in Italy and in Europe. This new achievement  obtained in a challenging short time  demonstrates as European competence and technology is highly mastered and capable to provide to the public and private scientific community access to HPC system co-designed to meet at the same time high productivity capacity and extremely high computational performance”Emmanuel Le Roux  SVP  Global head of HPC  AI and Quantum  Atos  commented “Today’s achievement is yet another example of Atos’ commitment to Europe’s economic and technological sovereignty in an energy-optimized environment. As a world-class leader in HPC  Atos is committed to pave the way to Exascale systems by pushing the technological boundaries with a hybridization strategy and by providing increased performance. We are proud to collaborate with EuroHPC and Cineca to make the best of HPC and AI technologies  helping Italian and European scientists and researchers prevent medical and environmental crisis.""Atos now has 43 supercomputers in the TOP500  with two new systems in the ranking including Leonardo and Pégaso system hosted by Petrobras.From November 13th to November 18th 2022  Atos will take part in SC2022: come meet our experts on booth #2809!

As such  no distinction is made in third-party management  which is presented solely in agent form.This presentation therefore allows a direct reading of syndication fees  sales commissions  and management fees.This new presentation has no impact on EBITDA  operating income  or net income. The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.DYNAMIC GROWTH IN OWNED AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AT END-SEPTEMBER 2022Owned activities grew by €34.2 million over nine months  with respective increases of €14.2 million for leasing activity and €20.0 million for equipment sales activity thanks to sales of own-account containers  which outperformed.Management activity grew by €3.3 million  with an increase of €1.6 million in syndication fees (Freight Railcars and Containers activities) and sales fees on used equipment belonging to investors (+€1.4 million in the Containers activity).ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY DIVISIONThe Freight Railcars activity rose (+11.3%) to €40.4 million in the first nine months:Owned activity expanded by €3.6 million  resulting from an increase in leasing revenue from owned equipment (+15.7%)  driven by growth in the utilisation rate (87.1% versus 84.6% over the same period in 2021) and by the leasing of newly acquired railcars.Management activity was also up  with syndication fees increasing by €0.4 million with transactions carried out in June 2022.The River Barges activity saw a boost in revenue of €5.1 million thanks to the vigorous level of barge chartering in the Rhine basin. The utilisation rate in the third quarter of 2022 was nearly 100% in the division.The Containers activity posted a sharp increase of €33.9 million. The performance of leasing activity remained strong (+€5.4 million) with an average utilisation rate of 98.1% over the period. However  most of the increase came from sales of owned equipment (new built containers trading activity)  which rose by €25.8 million. Management activity increased by €2.8 million  spurred by syndication fees in the second quarter and commissions on the sale of investor equipment.The Modular Buildings activity in Africa  presented on the ""Miscellaneous"" line  was down €5.6 million with fewer projects delivered than in 2021.Restated Revenue from activities Q1 2022Q2 2022Q3 2022TOTAL 2022Q1 2021Q2 2021Q3 2021TOTAL 2021(in € thousand) Leasing revenue on owned equipment 10 544 11 142 11 292 32 978 9 152 9 223 10 123 28 498 Ancillary services 1 858 1 177 1 820 4 855 1 873 1 724 1 951 5 548 Total leasing activity 12 402 12 319 13 112 37 833 11 025 10 947 12 074 34 046 Sales of owned equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total sales of equipment 110 238 369 717 320 403 162 885 Total of owned activity 12 512 12 557 13 481 38 550 11 345 11 350 12 236 34 931 Syndication fees 0 446 1 447 0 0 0 0 Management fees 466 451 507 1 424 463 470 451 1 384 Total of management activity 466 897 508 1 871 463 470 451 1 384 Total Freight railcars 12 978 13 454 13 989 40 421 11 808 11 820 12 687 36 315 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 1 619 1 789 1 869 5 277 1 688 1 745 1 770 5 203 Ancillary services 1 807 2 385 3 788 7 980 683 972 1 286 2 941 Total leasing activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 371 2 717 3 056 8 144 Sales of owned equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total sales of equipment 0 0 0 0 41 0 0 41 Total of owned activity 3 426 4 174 5 657 13 257 2 412 2 717 3 056 8 185 Management fees 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total of management activity 14 5 11 30 6 6 5 17 Total River Barges 3 440 4 179 5 668 13 287 2 418 2 723 3 061 8 202 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 3 342 3 973 4 013 11 328 2 384 2 654 2 572 7 610 Ancillary services 2 070 1 325 1 779 5 174 191 1 054 2 297 3 542 Total leasing activity 5 412 5 298 5 792 16 502 2 575 3 708 4 869 11 152 Sales of owned equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total sales of equipment 13 205 12 575 12 967 38 747 3 480 3 524 5 991 12 995 Total of owned activity 18 617 17 873 18 759 55 249 6 055 7 232 10 860 24 147 Syndication fees 0 2 076 64 2 140 17 946 48 1 011 Management fees 498 530 565 1 593 428 415 439 1 282 Sales fees 336 1 349 801 2 486 591 358 181 1 130 Total of management activity 834 3 955 1 430 6 219 1 036 1 719 668 3 423 Total Containers 19 451 21 828 20 189 61 468 7 091 8 951 11 528 27 570 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 4 5 4 13 5 11 15 31 Ancillary services -3 -3 3 -3 -2 -3 -4 -9 Total leasing activity 1 2 7 10 3 8 11 22 Sales of owned equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total sales of equipment 1 547 1 436 2 056 5 039 3 244 4 401 2 979 10 624 Total of owned activity 1 548 1 438 2 063 5 049 3 247 4 409 2 990 10 646 Other capital gains on disposals 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Others 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 6 Total Miscellaneous and eliminations 1 548 1 438 2 069 5 055 3 247 4 415 2 990 10 652 Total Restated Revenue from activities 37 417 40 899 41 915 120 231 24 564 27 909 30 266 82 739OUTLOOKIn the current context of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates  Touax continues to roll out its activities  thanks to a resilient business model and recurring revenues based on long-term contracts. The Group plans to seize new asset acquisition opportunity over the coming months  while also adopting a prudent investment policy. The current inflationary environment has a positive effect on the valuation of the portfolio of assets. However  prices have normalised in the container business  with the purchase price of new containers returning to the average levels of 2020.From a structural and medium- to long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from developments in relation to infrastructures  e-commerce and intermodal logistics as they keep pace with the expectations of consumers  industrial groups  public authorities  lenders and investors around green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS22 March 2023: Press release on annual results (English/French)22 March 2023: Presentation of annual results to financial analysts in Paris (in French)23 March 2023: Investor call (in English)TOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

The study was initiated at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2021 and is currently ongoing in the US. The objective of the study is to document whether LTX-315 in combination with pembrolizumab is effective in inducing tumor responses in patients who have failed prior anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy.The clinical trial has now been extended to Spain  France and Norway and sites are opened in all three countries. The expansion of the site network will mitigate recruitment challenges  drive enrollment towards completion and extend the clinical impact field for LTX-315. The European branch of the study is performed at highly recognized sites with intratumoral immunotherapy expertise  led by melanoma experts at each site. It will follow the same protocol as in the US.The regulatory application in Europe was approved in Q3 2022  and efforts to initiate recruitment of patients is ongoing with the aim to complete enrollment in the study in early 2023.""We are very pleased to now be able to recruit patients in three European countries that will help us to complete the ongoing ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II study""  says CEO and Co-founder of Lytix Biopharma  Øystein Rekdal.CONTACT:For more information  please contact:Ole Peter Nordby  [email protected]SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.74,0.25,0.0,True,English,"['Lytix Biopharma', 'ATLAS-IT-05 study', 'expansion', 'Europe', 'anti PD 1/PD L1 immune checkpoint therapy', 'ongoing ATLAS-IT-05 Phase II study', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center', 'Phase II combination study', 'SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS', 'Norwegian immuno-oncology company', 'intratumoral immunotherapy expertise', 'Ole Peter Nordby', 'clinical impact field', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'three European countries', 'ATLAS-IT-05 study', 'three countries', 'European branch', 'clinical trial', 'advanced melanoma', 'tumor responses', 'melanoma experts', 'same protocol', 'regulatory application', 'Øystein Rekdal', 'site activation', 'site network', 'recruitment challenges', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'LTX-315', 'pembrolizumab', 'patients', 'US', 'objective', 'prior', 'Spain', 'France', 'sites', 'expansion', 'enrollment', 'completion', 'Q3', 'efforts', 'aim', 'early 2023', 'CEO', 'founder', 'CONTACT', 'information']",2022-11-14,2022-11-15,prnewswire.com

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYOctober was a mixed month for Structured Debt Markets as European CLO debt tranches experienced a price rebound - especially the ones that were significantly hit in September - while US CLO performances were slightly negative. As a result Volta’s net asset value (“NAV”) declined by -2.6% in October.Diving into Volta’s underlying sub asset classes  monthly performances** were as follow: +0.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -3.9% for CLO Equity tranches; +1.7% for CLO Debt tranches (driven by +6.2% on European CLO debt); and -0.4% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund’s NAV).As for every quarter  October was an heavy month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. We were expecting relatively healthy ones across the board and our positions did deliver on that front. Volta received in October the equivalent of €9.1m in terms of interest and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received €23.4m interest and coupons. A 22.3% annualized cash flow to NAV.Looking at fundamentals  we continued to see slightly more downgrades than upgrades in both the US and the European loan markets  although at a very moderate pace. We have been highlighting for months through this channel of communication the fact that inflation per se can positively impact companies’ balance sheets. The release of Q3 earnings demonstrated once more that when revenues increase (in nominal amount) at a high pace  earnings can be maintained or even increased despite companies suffering from margin pressure. At the time of writing this publication  90% of the S&P companies have reported their Q3 earnings; revenues are up 12.2% (from the previous quarter) allowing earnings to grow by “only” 3.9%.In the meantime  this increase in revenues is eroding the real value of debt. We believe that the real value of debt for the average US company was basically eroded by 20% in the last two years when considering that from Q3 2020 to Q4 2022 the US GDP grew by 20% in nominal terms. This relationship between nominal growth and debt and the maitainance of healthy earnings can explain why rating agencies have so far been relatively slow (and they may be correct in doing so) in downgrading debt even though many companies do suffer or will suffer from higher interest rates.Our view remains that the overall dynamics are still more favorable for the US relative to Europe. At the end of October  12 months running default rates in Loans were still low at 0.4% in Europe and 0.8% in the US. We expect to see more deterioration in Europe than in the US in the coming quarters and consider it reasonable to see default rates move in the 2% area in the US and in the 3% area in Europe for 2023.This kind of default pattern will not materially impact the distribution of interests by Volta’s assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.We recently opened a European CLO Warehouse as part of this strategy. No loans have yet been purchased but we expect to start ramping assets in the near term to take advantage of significant price discounts and patiently build a very profitable CLO Equity position.As at the end of October 2022  Volta’s NAV was €206.8m or €5.65 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 1.5% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.1% as at 30 September 2022  0.4% was at 31 July 2022 and 0.4% as at 30 June 2022..** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Validation confirms that the application is complete and the formal review process by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) can begin. Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 People living with MG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3 In the U.S. the prevalence of MG is estimated at 14 to 20 per 100 000 population; approximately 36 000 to 60 000 cases.4 In Europe  the prevalence is estimated at 10 per 100 000 population.5""People living with gMG experience high treatment burden  on top of the debilitating impact of the condition  and there is a clear need for additional targeted treatments to support the gMG community. Our goal is to provide a solution that can help meet these needs and transform lives "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""The acceptance of the NDA by the FDA as well as the acceptance of the MAA by the EMA  brings us one step further on our journey towards approval for this medicine. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to help bring this important new treatment option to patients.""The NDA and MAA are based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 RAISE study (NCT04115293)  which demonstrated at week 12 that treatment with zilucoplan (0.3 mg/kg daily) resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in key gMG-specific outcomes compared with placebo in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. The study met its primary endpoint with zilucoplan showing a placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.09 points in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at week 12 (p<0.001).6Zilucoplan demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile  showing a similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%). The most common TEAEs were injection site bruising  headache  and diarrhea. Rates of treatment discontinuation due to a TEAE were low and all patients who completed the 12-week treatment period have entered the ongoing RAISE-XT open-label extension study (NCT04225871).6 7In the RAISE study  174 adult patients were randomised to receive daily SC  self-administered doses of placebo (N=88) or zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg (N=86). Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms.6As a complement C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan is a targeted therapy that inhibits key components in the underlying pathophysiology of gMG  addressing the underlying mechanism of neuromuscular junction damage.8 9""We are deeply committed to improving outcomes for the gMG community. People who live with gMG suffer unpredictable  fluctuating  and debilitating symptoms  which have a huge impact on their lives. We want to help reduce the day-to-day burden of this challenging disease "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""If approved  zilucoplan has the potential to address the unmet need for people with gMG by providing targeted improvements in signs and symptoms of gMG disease activity and severity. A benefit of targeted treatment is that it may help reduce the adverse events that can be associated with non-specific immunosuppressive treatment of gMG.""UCB anticipates making regulatory filings for zilucoplan in gMG in Great Britain  Japan  and rest of the world from Q3 2022 onwards.Alongside zilucoplan  UCB is also investigating rozanolixizumab  a SC-administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  as a potential treatment for gMG. UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions for rozanolixizumab later this year.10For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01[email protected]U.S. Communications  Rare DiseasesDaphne TeoT +1.770.880.7655[email protected]Corporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64[email protected]Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14[email protected]About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting more than 700 000 people worldwide.11 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.3  4gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4  12 gMG can occur in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.13 14 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade.15 Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR-Ab+ gMG.About the zilucoplan RAISE study 6   7The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Week 12  time to rescue therapy  the proportion with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1)  the proportion with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG without rescue therapy  all measured at Week 12. The secondary safety endpoint is incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the 12 week RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open label extension study  RAISE-XT.For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About ZilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.9 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.1 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.2The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About RozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is an SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.16 15Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.17 Orphan designation was granted in 202018 by the European Commission for rozanolixizumab to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Super-efficient Deutsche Bahn stretches its tentacles from stadt to strand – and now it’s about to be dirt cheap  too  with a €49-a-month ticket on the horizon  slated to launch some time early next year.Having tried the experimental €9-a-month ticket this summer  I would readily go back for the €49er to revisit some favourite corners that are otherwise hard to reach. Personally  I’m not bothered that this unlimited monthly pass will only include regional trains  not intercity expresses  because it’s the regions I’m interested in. And I want to savour passing landscapes at a gentle trot  not have them whizz past in a blur.With that in mind  I’ve worked out what would be the ideal German train circuit  to be completed in around a week.Goerlitz has cinematic connections (Andrew Eames)I’d start from Cologne (the entry hub for Eurostar-connected trains from Brussels) and dip south to Koblenz where you can change to the rambling Moselle line and end up in Traben-Trarbach (three hours  two changes). The Moselle is like the Rhine  complete with castles on hilltops and with steep banks quilted with vineyards  but on a far more intimate scale. The railway crisscrosses the river  threading together winemaker villages such as Traben-Trarbach  where I’d stay in the art nouveau Hotel Bellevue by the river (doubles from £125; bellevue-hotel.de) If the weather was kind  I’d cycle along the riverbank and walk the vineyard trails.From here  I’d retrace my steps to Koblenz  then wind through the Unesco-recognised Rhine gorge south to Mainz  before transitting Frankfurt and heading cross-country to Eisenach (seven hours  three changes) in the former east. This handsome town is set in a bucolic  forested river valley where wild boar roam  and is the location of the Wartburg  a spectacular  part-Romanesque castle which rises on a hilltop out of the Thuringian Forest. Protestant reformer Martin Luther hid from his enemies here in a wood-panelled room  and you too can stay up above the forest in the Romantik Hotel auf der Wartburg  which clings to the castle walls (doubles from £234; wartburghotel.de).This handsome town is set in a bucolic  forested river valley where wild boar roamFrom Eisenach it’s a straightforward journey eastwards to Dresden (4.5 hours  one change)  nicknamed the Florence of the Elbe thanks in part to paintings of the riverside city by Canaletto. It’s a place of immense culture with a fabulous old town  painstakingly rebuilt following obliteration by Allied bombs in World War II. The teapot-shaped Frauenkirche hosts regular concerts  there are galleries of Masters Old and New  and stately ancient paddlesteamers flap-flap up and down the rive Elbe. Stay opposite the Frauenkirche in the Dresden Townhouse (doubles from £114; vagabondclub.com).From Dresden there’s one further step east I would make  cross-country to where Görlitz straddles the Polish border (1.5 hours  direct). Preserved partly by virtue of its remoteness  this immaculate little town is a film director’s paradise. The likes of the Book Thief and Grand Budapest Hotel were made here  and such is the constant throughput of film and television crews that the town has been nicknamed Görlywood. Stay the night in this unexpectedly cinematic bolthole by booking a stay at the Hotel Börse (doubles from £108; boerse-goerlitz.de).Having gone as far east as is possible  it’s time to head north. A long day on the train (10 hours  six changes  or with a half-way break with an overnight stay in good old Berlin) would take me up to Germany’s Baltic coast.The Raging Roland steam train is covered by the new rail pass (Andrew Eames)In the old days when it was trains  not planes  that took people on beach holidays  the Baltic shore was the favoured retreat  initially of the aristocracy  then the Communist elite. In particular  they liked the (causeway-connected) island of Rügen  where the traditional resort of Binz still looks as it did in the 1920s. There are villas of distinctive Bäder architecture  a mix of art nouveau and Long Island clapperboard with ornate wooden balconies and rooftop octagons  plus spa hotel the Kurhaus Binz with a proper ballroom (doubles from £133; travelcharme.com). The beach here is magnificent  six miles of immaculate sand  and if it’s a bit chilly for swimming then there’s always the Raging Roland  a period steam train which runs along from resort to resort  weaving through patches of forest (fare also included in the €49 ticket).From Binz  I’m starting back to Cologne – but first with an overnight in Hamburg (4.5 hours  one change) to visit Miniatur Wunderland  a model railway housed in an old spice warehouse in the port that has become phenomenally successful. And before you demur that model railways are not your thing  this one really is something special: the layout is divided into whole miniaturised nations  it has an airport with real life departures  special lighting for different times of day  and surreal touches of quite un-Germanic humour. Stay near the Hauptbahnhof at Hotel Wedina (doubles from £137; hotelwedina.de).Spend the night in the Wartburg castle (Andrew Eames)The return to Cologne crosses the heathery Luneberg Heath and eventually winds through the Rühr  the nation’s industrial powerhouse  a fascinating place of smokestacks and slag heaps. If the journey seems too long (seven hours  three changes) there’s a delightful half-timbered town  Celle  halfway across  with a lovely hotel  the Fürstenhof – very well priced given that it has five stars (doubles from £133; althoffcollection.com).Travel essentialsFor international train travel go to trainline.com  and for domestic travel within Germany  see bahn.com.,positive,1.0,0.0,0.0,mixed,0.62,0.09,0.29,True,English,"['perfect train trip', 'Germany', 'The Raging Roland steam train', 'distinctive Bäder architecture', 'ideal German train circuit', 'bucolic, forested river valley', 'art nouveau Hotel Bellevue', 'period steam train', 'Hotel Börse', 'weekly expert advice', 'Super-efficient Deutsche Bahn', 'unlimited monthly pass', 'World War II', 'stately ancient paddlesteamers', 'ornate wooden balconies', 'Grand Budapest Hotel', 'good train journey', 'valid email address', 'spectacular, part-Romanesque castle', 'good old Berlin', 'Long Island clapperboard', 'experimental €9-a-month ticket', 'Unesco-recognised Rhine gorge', 'new rail pass', 'free travel email', 'fabulous old town', 'immaculate little town', 'The Independent', 'The Moselle', 'Romantik Hotel', 'spa hotel', 'castle walls', 'straightforward journey', 'Masters Old', 'long day', 'old days', 'immaculate sand', 'handsome town', 'Simon Calder', 'money-saving discounts', 'privacy notice', '€49-a-month ticket', 'favourite corners', 'intercity expresses', 'passing landscapes', 'gentle trot', 'a week', 'cinematic connections', 'Andrew Eames', 'Moselle line', 'two changes', 'steep banks', 'intimate scale', 'winemaker villages', 'vineyard trails', 'three changes', 'former east', 'wild boar', 'Protestant reformer', 'Martin Luther', 'wood-panelled room', 'one change', 'riverside city', 'immense culture', 'Allied bombs', 'regular concerts', 'Görlitz', 'Polish border', 'Book Thief', 'constant throughput', 'television crews', 'cinematic bolthole', 'six changes', 'half-way break', 'Baltic coast', 'Baltic shore', 'Communist elite', 'Rügen', 'rooftop octagons', 'proper ballroom', 'six miles', 'regional trains', 'Eurostar-connected trains', 'teapot-shaped Frauenkirche', 'rive Elbe', 'film director', 'overnight stay', 'beach holidays', 'three hours', 'seven hours', 'Thuringian Forest', 'Dresden Townhouse', 'traditional resort', 'Kurhaus Binz', '€49 ticket', '4.5 hours', 'offers', 'events', 'updates', 'verifyErrors', 'Something', 'Germany', 'tentacles', 'horizon', 'time', '€49er', 'regions', 'blur', 'mind', 'Goerlitz', 'Cologne', 'entry', 'hub', 'Brussels', 'Koblenz', 'Traben-Trarbach', 'castles', 'hilltops', 'vineyards', 'railway', 'doubles', 'weather', 'riverbank', 'steps', 'Mainz', 'Frankfurt', 'country', 'Eisenach', 'location', 'Wartburg', 'enemies', 'Florence', 'paintings', 'Canaletto', 'place', 'obliteration', 'galleries', 'virtue', 'remoteness', 'paradise', 'likes', 'planes', 'people', 'retreat', 'aristocracy', '1920s', 'villas', 'mix', 'swimming', 'patches', 'fare']",2022-11-15,2022-11-15,independent.co.uk

A very large share of Encavis revenue of around 95% is generated through fixed  long-term contracts and hedges. Encavis AG is only benefiting to a limited extent from high prices on the electricity market. The Company has already taken the precaution of factoring in the current debate surrounding a retroactive windfall tax on revenues respectively revenue skimming in various European countries as of September 1st  2022  to give a true and fair view on its key figures and set aside provisions of EUR 30.3 million. Without these provisions  revenue in the reporting period would have been correspondingly higher.The Group increased electricity production from Renewable Energy by +19% to around 2 583 gigawatt hours (GWh/previous year: 2 170 GWh) during the first nine months of fiscal year 2022. Revenue grew by 37% to EUR 354.8 million (previous year: EUR 259.1 million). This strong growth of more than EUR 95 million has to be split to around 60% to the Groups portfolio to solar parks (a good EUR +57 million) and to 35% (around EUR +34 million) of wind farms and Encavis Asset Management (EAM) contributed additional 5% revenue increase (EUR +5 million) to the Groups performance. Revenue increase of 29% of the solar parks was mainly driven by the 21% higher electricity production due to capacity increases and the improved weather conditions. Revenue growth of the wind farm portfolio by around 70% is based on the 14% increased production volume of electricity and to the larger extend on the significantly higher electricity prices in the first nine months 2022 compared to the same period 2021.Operating earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (operating EBITDA) increased by 39% to EUR 271.3 million (previous year: EUR 195.4 million) in the first nine months of the 2022 financial year. Resulting in an increase of operating earnings before interest and taxes (operating EBIT) of 45% to EUR 166.9 million (previous year: EUR 115.1 million) after nine months. Considering the high level of prices for electricity the Group invests into a comprehensive technical optimisation to increase the productivity of its PV asset portfolio.This ultimately resulted in significantly improved operating earnings per share (EPS) of EUR 0.51 in the first nine months of 2022  an increase by 38% compared to the EUR 0.37 operating earnings per share in the same period in 2021.The cash flow from operating activities rose by around 45% to EUR 271.5 million (previous year: EUR 187.1 million).Based on the decision of the Council of the European Union on September 29th  2022  to introcude a price cap for energy market prices  Encavis reflects these plans of a retroactive price limit effective as of September 1st  2022  with the in our opinion most likely outcome in our key figures. With this we do present to the market a true and fair view on our Company in these turbulent times. Even with these limits we confirm our Guidance for FY 2022  explained Dr Christoph Husmann  CFO of Encavis AG.At the start of November  the forecast for the fourth quarter of 2022 takes into account the elevated market prices for electricity  current debate on an energy price cap  prices from the fixed feed-in tariffs (FiT) and the private purchase agreements (PPA) for electricity. The additional investment in boosting the productivity of the systems has also been factored in to the updated planning  as has the higher tax liability due to the improved results. Therefore Encavis AG confirms the outlook for the full-year 2022 provided in August 2022 and still expects to reach the target of 500 MW in acquisitions for the fiscal year 2022.About ENCAVIS:Encavis AG (Prime Standard; ISIN: DE0006095003; ticker symbol: ECV) is a producer of electricity from Renewable Energies listed on the MDAX of Deutsche Börse AG.

The cash flow from operating activities rose by around 45% to EUR 271.5 million (previous year: EUR 187.1 million).„Based on the decision of the Council of the European Union on September 29th  2022  to introcude a price cap for energy market prices  Encavis reflects these plans of a retroactive price limit effective as of September 1st  2022  with the in our opinion most likely outcome in our key figures.

Even with these limits we confirm our Guidance for FY 2022“  explained Dr Christoph Husmann  CFO of Encavis AG.

In particular  they include the activities of the operating companies Crypto Blockchain Industries  SA  OP Productions  LLC and Free Reign East  LLC from April 1  2022 to September 30  2022. The figures in the tables in this press release are rounded to thousands of euros.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTAnalysis of preliminary consolidated resultsAt September 30  2022  CBI recorded preliminary revenue of €2 395.5k  mainly from licenses and services concluded with partners Chain Games and Cornucopias.Over the 6 months of commercial activities  the revenue from the sale of NFTs and tokens is mainly derived from sales or pre-sales made for AlphaVerse  with Chain Games and Horyou AlphaVerse in particular.The pro forma gross margin was 98.64% of revenue for the period.Preliminary research and development costs of €538.9K are related to the operation and development of AlphaVerse. The Company mobilizes significant external resources  including 3 independent studios  specialized in the development of blockchain-based worlds and innovative video games. This allows to keep a flexible cost structure and to benefit from a pool of skills adapted to the pace of AlphaVerse’s development. Concerning the metaverse  the value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not given rise to amortization as of September 30  2022  as this amortization starts at the opening of the metaverse.Preliminary marketing and sales expenses of €667.0K include the promotion of AlphaVerse through the launch of online marketing campaigns. Expenses for the period are also related to the OP Productions game.Preliminary general and administrative expenses for the period mainly reflect the salaries of the management and holding staff (6 full-time equivalents)  as well as general expenses related to the listing of the Company’s shares on the Euronext Growth market.The preliminary operating profit from ordinary activities for the first half of the year  at €587.8K  or 24.5% of revenue  reflects the increased development of the activities  particularly AlphaVerse.Other income and expenses in the amount of €(1 243.0) K consist of the depreciation of crypto-currency inventories and tokens valued at the closing price of September 30  2022  in connection with the change in the value of its assets over the period. After taking this impairment into account  preliminary operating income was €(655.2)K  compared to €134.9 K for the same period last year.Preliminary consolidated financial expenses reflect interest on the Ker Ventures loan at the legal rate and IFRS 16 restatements relating to rents. Preliminary consolidated financial income mainly reflects capital gains realized by the investment services provider TSAF in the context of the CBI share liquidity contract. Preliminary consolidated minority interests represent the amount attributable to the 23% owners of OP Productions  LLC and Free Reign East  LLC and amounted to €2.1k for the period.The preliminary consolidated net result (Group share) for the period amounts to a net loss of (694.7) K€  compared to a profit of 96.3 K€ for the same period of the previous financial year  in a phase of increasing activity and projects  which will strengthen the commercial activity as they progress.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETASSETS (in €’000) September 30  2022 March 31  2022 Intangible assets 11 540 7 11 014 5 Tangible assets 13 3 11 8 IFRS 16 restatement (leases) 2 104 7 2 236 2 Financial assets 8 144 9 8 144 9 LONG-TERM ASSETS 21 803 6 21 407 4 Inventory of cryptocurrencies and NFTs 2 615 6 2 828 5 Accounts receivable 250 2 440 4 Other current assets 449 8 - Cash and liquidity 582 8 2 647 2 SHORT-TERM ASSETS 3 898 4 5 916 1 TOTAL ASSETS 25 702 0 27 323 5 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES (in €’000) September 30  2022 March 31  2022 Share capital 24 458 8 24 258 8 Premium and consolidated reserves (7 040 3) (10 446 8) Net Income  Group share ( 694 7) 3 807 0 CONSOLIDATED EQUITY  GROUPE SHARE 16 723 8 17 619 0 Minority interests 241 1 206 6 TOTAL CONSOLIDATED EQUITY 16 964 9 17 825 6 Shareholders’ loan 4 767 6 4 573 4 Restatement IFRS 16 (leases) 1 894 6 2 015 6 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 6 662 2 6 589 0 Short term lease liabilities 240 1 236 5 Accounts payable 1 598 6 2 559 2 Other liabilities 236 2 113 2 SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES 2 074 9 2 908 9 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 25 702 0 27 323 5Analysis of the preliminary consolidated balance sheetAmounts invested in the development of the games and the metaverse are capitalized and then amortized from the time they are brought into use. The value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not been amortized as at September 30  2022. This amortization will start at the opening of the metaverse after the test phase. Thus  as at September 30  2022  preliminary consolidated intangible assets amounted to €11.5m  compared with €11.0m as at March 31  2022.The portfolio of shares and financial instruments is unlisted and valued on the basis of the contribution value  i.e. €8.1m for this first half.The inventory of cryptocurrencies is initially recognized on the basis of the acquisition price. At the accounting year end  each cryptocurrency is then valued based on the volume weighted average price at that date to reflect the value of each cryptocurrency and the overall portfolio. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is less than its market value  no unrealized gain is recognized. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is higher than its market value  an impairment is recognized in the income statement. It is reflected in this first half-year in the category of operating ""Other income and expenses"".The Company has not deposited its assets on any trading platform. They are retained in the Company's own wallets.Preliminary consolidated equity  Group Share  amounts to €16.7m as at September 30  2022. The change is due to the profit for the year 2021-2022  the asset contributions made by Ker Ventures  EURL during the period  the October 2021 private placement of shares  all reduced by the redemption price of the warrant issued to the Atari Group  as part of the agreement of March 30  2022.Preliminary consolidated net cash / financial liabilitiesAt September 30  2022  the Group had €582.7k in cash and cash equivalents.IFRS 16 (restatement of leases) has been applied and has resulted in the recognition of assets of €2 104.7k and liabilities of €2 134.7k (of which €1 894.6k is long term and the balance short term).Outlook for the year 2022-2023 (ending March 31  2023)CBI intends to continue to develop AlphaVerse to become one of the leading Web3.0 players worldwide.For the 2022-2023 financial year  CBI's objective is to achieve significant growth in its community  which will ensure the growth of its future activities. Revenue and profit levels for 2022-2023 will depend on the pace at which the universes are opened and the progress of pre-sales of NFTs linked to these universes. In a highly volatile market  these levels are difficult to predict at this stage. All employees are focused on the development of AlphaVerse  both technologically and in the implementation of new partnerships  particularly in the field of football.Disclaimer:The realisation of projects  as well as their operational budget and financing plan  remain fundamentally subject to uncertainties  and the non-realisation of the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of assets and liabilities.About CBICRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (“CBI”) is a French company that develops  operates and invests in video games  business applications and selected projects relating to the blockchain  non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and cryptocurrencies.

PAM solution enables organizations to minimize risks that are related to cyberattacks outside of the network perimeter  malicious insider threats  and third-party access.Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure to effectively manage and access information or data from devices or locations in less time. With cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations were able to minimize the IT cost  increase the ROI  simplify the IT infrastructure  and effectively manage IT resources. However  by adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations are now facing challenges like increasing attack surface  cybersecurity vulnerabilities and managing and monitoring privileged data. Additionally  organizations and IT teams are facing issues while coping with identities and resources across cloud and hybrid environments  as cybercriminals are now leveraging advanced technologies to easily access and damage privileged data and user credentials in any organizational IT system. Therefore  organizations have started adopting cloud-native PAM solutions to mitigate and prevent advanced attacks. With the PAM solutions  organizations can provide improve protection and govern security risks  track the movement of data and workloads  protect data sharing between public and private cloud  and manage privileged access across traditional  virtual  and cloud environments.Additional Resources:For more information about WALLIX visit hereSPARK Matrix: Privileged Access Management (PAM)  2022 LinkPrivilege Access ManagementAbout WALLIXA software company providing cybersecurity solutions  WALLIX is the European specialist in digital Identity and Access Security Solutions.

Data from teni evaluable diuretic-resistant heart failure patients with persistent congestion who have completed the 16-week follow-up period after intensive DSR therapy confirm the previously reported strong interim dataii showing important and long-lasting clinical benefits.To evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of the Company’s second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0)  a single-arm  open-label  Phase 1 study has been initiated in Canada (YUKON) with up to 10 patients on peritoneal dialysis receiving a single treatment of DSR 2.0. The first patient has been dosed successfully and the results of this study will be used to determine dosing of DSR 2.0 in MOJAVE. Data from YUKON  together with CHIHUAHUA  a further Phase 1 study in Mexico intended to support the US INDiii filing of DSR 2.0  planned for Q1 2023. These replace the previously planned SAHARA extension study with DSR 2.0. Approval of the US IND will enable the Company to start MOJAVE  its randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  planned for H1 2023.Story continuesDr. Jeffrey Testani  Associate Professor at Yale University and Heart Failure Scientific Advisor to Sequana Medical  commented: “Congestion is a key driver of heart failure and remains the leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization in this large and growing patient population. Diuretic-resistance is widespread and the usual therapeutic approach is just adding more diuretics  further worsening the underlying issues. There are no therapies that seek to correct the cardio-renal pathophysiology causing the diuretic-resistance. The SAHARA results are highly encouraging and indicate the potential for DSR therapy to deliver clinically meaningful decongestion and durable improvements in cardio-renal function and thus diuretic response.”Dr. Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  added: “These results are very positive and reinforce our view that DSR is a potential disease-modifying heart failure therapy. We are excited to have the first patient dosed with DSR 2.0 and we are confident that this second-generation product will deliver important therapeutic and safety benefits. I would like to thank the investigators  patients and care personnel involved in both SAHARA and YUKON  and we look forward to commencing MOJAVE  the first randomized controlled multi-center study in the US using DSR 2.0.”SAHARA top-line resultsAt baseline  all teni evaluable patients with persistent congestion due to heart failure were on high dose loop diuretics (mean furosemide equivalent dose of 360 mg/day) and had an overall high disease severity  including a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 23% and mean NT-proBNP of 6 628 pg/mL. At the start of the study treatment period  loop diuretics were withheld  and patients underwent intensive DSR therapy with DSR 1.0 for two weeks (phase 1) which was repeated up to two times depending on patients’ euvolemic state (i.e.  normal amount of body fluids)  diuretic response and stable DSR dosing at the end of phase 1. Patients who achieved euvolemia and had adequate diuretic response entered the maintenance DSR treatment phase with monthly DSR dosing for 16 weeks (phase 2).All ten evaluable patients safely  effectively and rapidly eliminated the persistent congestion and achieved euvolemia within one week of commencing intensive DSR therapy  resulting in a mean weight loss of 7kg at the end of phase 1. During the intensive DSR period (phase 1)  the diuretic response of the kidney was near-normalised  with mean six-hour excretion of sodium increasing more than 160% vs. baseline  as well as a considerable improvement in cardio-renal health  with a mean reduction in NT-proBNPiv of 38% vs. baseline and a mean improvement in eGFRv of 7% vs. baseline despite the dramatic fluid loss.The improvement in cardio-renal health was broadly maintained at the end of phase 2 (16 weeks post intensive DSR period) demonstrated by a mean 33% reduction in NT-proBNP and a stable eGFR.The need for loop diuretics was dramatically reduced for many months following completion of the intensive DSR therapy (see table below)  which the Company believes is a demonstration of the durable improvement in cardio-renal health.Evaluable patient No. of months post intensive DSR period Reduction in diuretic dose vs. baseline 01-01 15 90% 01-03 13 100% 01-04 12 90% 01-05 12 100% 01-06 10 100% 01-08 10 90% 01-09 9 67% 01-10 9 95% 01-11 6 93% 01-12 6 100%No clinically relevant changes in serum sodium levels or progressive hyponatremia were observed in any of the evaluable patients. There were three serious adverse events in three of the evaluable patients  including two having a blocked peritoneal catheter (both during phase 2) and one with stable angina (started post phase 2  ongoing). The Data Monitoring Committee assessed both peritoneal catheter blockages as definitely related to the study device but unrelated to the implant procedure or study treatment  and the stable agina as unrelated to the study device  implant procedure  or treatment.All evaluable patients treated with DSR therapy in the RED DESERT and SAHARA clinical studies experienced no congestion-related heart failure hospital re-admissions during the entire study period and all patients improved their NYHAvi status by at least one class. The clinical benefits observed in RED DESERT and SAHARA resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Modelvii.On track to start M OJAVE with DSR 2.0 in H1 2023The Company is progressing development of its proprietary DSR 2.0 product  a sodium-free dextrose / icodextrin solution expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile and with a robust intellectual property protection. Data from two interventional  single-centre  single-arm studies  one in Canada (YUKON) and one in Mexico (CHIHUAHUA) will evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of DSR 2.0. Both studies will enroll up to ten stable peritoneal dialysis patients who will receive a single treatment of DSR 2.0  administered through their peritoneal dialysis catheter. The first patient has been treated successfully in YUKON and data from both studies intended to support the filing of the US IND  planned for Q1 2023. The choice of peritoneal dialysis patients is driven by their pre-existing peritoneal dialysis catheter.Following initial discussions with the FDA  MOJAVE  a randomized controlled Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  is on track to start in H1 2023 assuming FDA approval of the US IND. The intention is to enrol 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  with 20 patients randomised to DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten patients randomised to usual care for CHF alone. Following four weeks of DSR therapy there will be a three-month safety follow-up period. Prior to enrolment of these 30 patients  three additional patients will be enrolled in a non-randomized safety cohort and will receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for CHF for up to four weeks. Progression to the enrolment of the 30 randomized patients will be dependent upon DSMBviii approval following their review of the initial three patients. More details on the final study design will be announced following FDA approval of the US IND. Interim data of MOJAVE are planned for H2 2023 and top-line results are expected in mid 2024.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsMary Clark  Nick Bastin  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0)7931 500 066About fluid overload in heart failure (AKA congestion)Heart failure is the leading cause of US hospitalizations in patients over 65 years old and 90% of these admissions are due to fluid overload  which is recognized as the primary driver of morbidity and hospitalization. Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About DSR® (Direct Sodium Removal) in heart failureSequana Medical considers its proprietary DSR to be a disease modifying therapy for heart failure. Fluid accumulation in heart failure patients is caused by the retention of too much sodium. The DSR drug-based approach directly tackles this key clinical problem of sodium overload  and works in partnership with the kidneys to safely and rapidly eliminate the excess fluid. Complementary to existing heart failure therapies  clinical proof-of-concept studies using the Company’s first-generation DSR product (DSR 1.0) have shown that DSR can i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate fluid overload in heart failure patients  ii) improve the health of the heart and preserve renal function  and iii) restore the ability of the kidney to manage the fluid and sodium naturally  resulting in a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for diuretic drugs. In DSR treated patients  there have been no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during the study follow-up period  all patients improved their NYHA status by at least one class and the clinical benefits observed in the clinical studies resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model. The Company is currently preparing an IND application for its second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) in the US and plans to begin a US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial in H1 2023. Composition of matter and method patents have been granted for DSR therapy in the US and Europe.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. Fluid overload is a well-recognized problem in these growing diseases  causing severe problems for the large number of patients for whom current medicines are no longer effective. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary platforms that work with the body to remove this excess fluid  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.

Rave Companion addresses the long-standing industry challenge of duplicate data entry by enabling structured and unstructured data from any electronic health record to be directly utilized by Rave EDC  within a few clicks.“ The number of data points collected as part of a clinical trial has increased exponentially and sites are looking for scalable and easy to use solutions to connect to their EHR and reduce data entry ” said Dan Braga  vice president EHR Solutions and Healthcare at Medidata. “ Rave Companion is an elegant solution that helps sites utilize existing data from any EHR system instead of re-entering it for clinical trials purposes.”Medidata has conducted more than 29 000 trials  with more than 1.5M life science professionals around the world using its industry-leading platform. Rave Companion was designed in a way to provide out of the box functionality for unstructured data  as well as advanced EHR integration capabilities for those sites connected to Medidata’s broad and quickly expanding network of research sites. Rave Companion works by mirroring the Rave eCRF schema in a “companion” tool that floats on top of the screen and follows site users as they navigate through various records systems that are needed to contribute to the research database.For unstructured data  or for sites not yet connected to Medidata’s network  Rave Companion eliminates “swivel chair” activities and allows the Rave EDC experience to travel with users as they go to their EHR  or other clinical systems  to find the appropriate patient data. Instead of coming back to type it in  users can now simply click on the value and the eCRF will be filled out for them.Coming next year  Rave Companion will also include the presentation of EHR data directly within the solution  meaning that users will never have to leave Rave EDC to complete eCRFs  keeping the whole experience in one place.Medidata will unveil Rave Companion at its premier life sciences event  NEXT New York November 15-16. Participants will learn how Medidata is addressing the challenges of data entry during a session titled  “ Solving the EHR to EDC Challenge: A New Perspective  Approach and Technology ” featuring Gene Vinson  executive director  Clinical Vendor Management at Syneos Health and Medidata's Dan Braga and Samir Jain  senior director  EHR Solutions.Medidata is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Systèmes  which with its 3DEXPERIENCE platform is positioned to lead the digital transformation of life sciences in the age of personalized medicine with the first end-to-end scientific and business platform  from research to commercialization.About MedidataMedidata is leading the digital transformation of life sciences  creating hope for millions of patients.

(NYSE: VOYA)  is releasing new findings from a consumer research survey revealing that  while the broad scope of workplace benefits and savings offerings for employees continues to evolve  the employer-sponsored retirement plan remains a critical component to attracting and retaining talent. Specifically  Voya’s research found that  among working Americans  60% are more likely to stay with their current employer if they offer an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Equally important to working individuals were a competitive salary or compensation package (64%) and flexible work hours (63%).“We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has forever changed the workplace benefits and savings landscape and  as a result  many employers continue to evolve their offerings to support their workforce  particularly as an opportunity to attract and retain talent in today’s competitive market ” said Heather Lavallee  CEO  Wealth Solutions  and president and CEO-elect  Voya Financial. “At the same time  amid new offerings such as flexible or hybrid work arrangements  employers need to remember the employer-sponsored retirement plan is a critical component to helping individuals prepare for a more secure financial future.”Focus remains on the long termWith many already thinking ahead to 2023  Voya’s survey also revealed that  due to inflation  more than three-quarters (76%) of individuals are extremely likely or likely to spend less on non-essential items next year  which generally could include things such as meals out  vacations or luxury goods. At the same time  they are maintaining a focus on the long-term benefits of saving  with nearly 7-in-10 (68%) of Americans saying they have plans to save for retirement next year. This focus on preparing for the long term becomes even more important as individuals continue to want to “stay the course” despite today’s market uncertainty. For example  Voya’s survey also revealed that a majority (81%) of Americans find having a long-term view for their investments important or extremely important  with 79% agreeing on the importance of staying the course during a volatile market.“It’s extremely encouraging to see individuals keeping a focus on their long-term goals  despite the rollercoaster of financial extremes many have experienced over the past several years ” added Lavallee. “All employers should take note of the steadfastness that working Americans are expressing when it comes to the value of building their retirement savings through their workplace plan. This is particularly important as our survey also found that 75% of individuals plan to follow a financial plan and budget in 2023.”Workplace benefits continue to play a valuable role in the lives of working AmericansWhile a retirement plan remains an important aspect of the overall workplace benefits and savings package  Voya’s survey reinforced the valuable role that workplace benefits are playing in the lives of working Americans  particularly when it comes to both their health and wealth needs. More than half (52%) of employed individuals said they are more likely to stay with their current employer if they offer: physical health benefits/programs such as gym reimbursement/discounts  points/bonuses earned based on physical activity  weight loss challenges  etc.  financial wellness benefits/program such as access to tools and resources for budgeting  building savings  reducing debt  etc.  and a workplace emergency-savings plan (51%). In addition  nearly half (49%) are more likely to stay with their current employer if they offer access to voluntary benefit offerings like critical illness  hospital indemnity  disability income  accident insurance  etc.  and 47% are more likely to stay with access to health spending and savings accounts (HSA  FSA  dependent care account).“While we at Voya believe that having a focus on driving greater outcomes for retirement is vital to supporting today’s workforce  the financial uncertainty surrounding many individuals today also brings about a shift in mindset when it comes to the holistic wellness needs of employees ” added Rob Grubka  CEO  Health Solutions at Voya. “As many employers face an intensifying market attracting and retaining talent  the new year brings a great opportunity to evaluate your offerings to help stand out as an employer of choice. And for employees  simply knowing what’s available can only benefit you. So  it’s important to understand your options  particularly if that means being more curious at your own employer.”“More and more employers today are being proactive with their offerings as they understand the short-term financial needs of their workforce can have a direct impact on their ability to save for the long term ” added Lavallee. “Programs that provide student loan debt support  caregiver needs  building emergency savings and access to financial professionals or advice tools are all things to ask about when it comes to support the breadth of financial planning needs individuals face today.”As an industry leader focused on the delivery of workplace benefits  savings and investment solutions to and through the workplace  Voya is committed to delivering on its mission to make a secure financial future possible for all Americans — one person  one family  one institution at a time.All data based on the results of a Voya Financial survey conducted Oct. 10-11  2022  on the Ipsos eNation omnibus online platform among 1 004 adults (461 employed) aged 18+ in the U.S..About Voya Financial®Voya Financial  Inc.

We are seeing new attitudes impacting everything from living situations and well-being to community and consumption. People have taken time out and a step back  to determine what work…,Our sentiment about life has shifted significantly over the past few years. We are seeing new attitudes impacting everything from living situations and well-being to community and consumption. People have taken time out and a step back  to determine what works best for them moving forward. And as they focus on what they really need to be happy and healthy  incorporating the importance of community in their personal needs  they bring our society to shift. And this way  individuals’ changes become a collective transforming force. And its impact is having a significant influence on nearly every aspect of society and business.Recognizing The Nuances in Changes and The Takeouts For HospitalityWhile these shifting mindsets might seem sudden  they have been brewing beneath the surface. The COVID time out propelled these changes forward a bit faster than they might have normally evolved  but the underlying desire for change was still there.Those of us doing business in the hospitality industry need to recognize these attitude changes do indeed impact us as we look to welcome guests into our hotels  resorts  restaurants  spas and more. Individuals are no longer the same they once were. How does it impact our activities? How do we build opportunities on those changes?Exploring shifts in individual convictions and behavior  we looked at how people are addressing their own individual needs and desires  but are also considering how they can fit into and be an integral part of their community and collective - how people manage to apply their personal rhythm to remote work and society solicitations  how their connection to community does not stop them from travelling and discovering abroad. We are seeing well-being becoming one of their main demands  well beyond its physical aspect  and juggling with ethics and convenience as they envisage new purchases.These transformations are not without conflicting beliefs as they can point in diametrically opposing directions or present nuances which may be challenging to navigate  but can enrich and help refine the paths forward.Source: AccorFor example  when we examine how people want to fit in the world  in a recent Accor consumer study conducted across 7 countries  we see that 60% of travelers state that “I like to do what I want  when I want”*  putting their vision first. Yet  they also want to acknowledge the importance of quality relationship with others  listed as the N°1 factor for happiness and health in a study conducted by Harvard.**The good news is seemingly opposite viewpoints actually offer new routes for innovation in services and experiences and can be leveraged into exciting opportunities to innovate  collaborate  and successfully drive business.We invited educator and leading hospitality expert Dr. Lalia Rach  together with Tom Goodwin  author and specialist in innovation  to share their perspectives on people’s new mindsets and on how this could impact hospitality today. Read their full contribution here.Exploring 4 Key Trends For HospitalityWe have identified four key areas  substantially impacted through those mindset shifts  exploring how they translate into key trends directly connected to hospitality  with insights and potential for our industry.Source: AccorWe take a closer look at those 4 trends shaping opportunities in hospitalitySources:*Study conducted by Accor in 2022 among 15 000+ travelers in 7 countries**Harvard Study of Adult Development – conducted since 1938 and still going onAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

However  this demand for original content is meeting up with a VFX production capacity still impacted by an unprecedented level of attrition.The Group has identified and implemented significant actions since the summer to react. However  the anticipated improvements in recruitment  attrition and production efficiencies are not materializing at the expected pace  resulting in Technicolor Creative Studios to not deliver on time or at expected cost:Recently  a significant amount of high margin sales has been missed at The Mill  due to senior resource constraints;Some major MPC projects are being impacted by lower production efficiencies leading to late deliveries  extra spendings and margin decline.On top of significant actions already implemented since the summer  the Group is actively working on a larger transformation program  encompassing several new key senior hires  along with further optimization of processes and metrics  and moving a greater level of production to India; further details to be shared at the Q3 results call November 30th. Operational metrics are improving and will aim to exceed historical performance. However  the activity will still be affected in the fourth quarter of 2022 and probably throughout 2023.As a consequence of the above Technicolor Creative Studios is revising its Adjusted EBITDA after lease (new definition) 1 expectations as follows:For 2022: guidance is revised downwards from €120-130 million to €45-65 million at budget rate 2 or €50-70 million at actual rates 3 ;or €50-70 million at actual rates ; Preliminary view for 2023: flat or moderately up4 from expected 2022 landing  compared to €140-160 million previous estimates.An analyst audio webcast hosted by Christian Roberton  CEO and Laurent Carozzi  CFO will be held today  November 15  2022  at 6:30pm CET.Audio WebcastPlease find below the link to the webcast:Conf Call Nov 2022Conference call(Please use this option only if you wish to ask questions by phone)Dial the access number below 10mn before the call:France: +33 172727403 PIN: 22158323#United Kingdom: +442071943759 PIN: 22158323#United States: +1 6467224916 PIN: 22158323#Financial CalendarQ3 2022 business updateODDO Conference2022 Full Year Results November 30th  2022January 10  2023March 8  2023***Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

The figures in the tables in this press release are rounded to thousands of euros.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTAnalysis of preliminary consolidated resultsAt September 30  2022  CBI recorded preliminary revenue of €2 395.5k  mainly from licenses and services concluded with partners Chain Games and Cornucopias.Over the 6 months of commercial activities  the revenue from the sale of NFTs and tokens is mainly derived from sales or pre-sales made for AlphaVerse  with Chain Games and Horyou AlphaVerse in particular.The pro forma gross margin was 98.64% of revenue for the period.Preliminary research and development costs of €538.9K are related to the operation and development of AlphaVerse. The Company mobilizes significant external resources  including 3 independent studios  specialized in the development of blockchain-based worlds and innovative video games. This allows to keep a flexible cost structure and to benefit from a pool of skills adapted to the pace of AlphaVerse’s development. Concerning the metaverse  the value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not given rise to amortization as of September 30  2022  as this amortization starts at the opening of the metaverse.Preliminary marketing and sales expenses of €667.0K include the promotion of AlphaVerse through the launch of online marketing campaigns. Expenses for the period are also related to the OP Productions game.Preliminary general and administrative expenses for the period mainly reflect the salaries of the management and holding staff (6 full-time equivalents)  as well as general expenses related to the listing of the Company’s shares on the Euronext Growth market.The preliminary operating profit from ordinary activities for the first half of the year  at €587.8K  or 24.5% of revenue  reflects the increased development of the activities  particularly AlphaVerse.Other income and expenses in the amount of €(1 243.0) K consist of the depreciation of crypto-currency inventories and tokens valued at the closing price of September 30  2022  in connection with the change in the value of its assets over the period. After taking this impairment into account  preliminary operating income was €(655.2)K  compared to €134.9 K for the same period last year.Preliminary consolidated financial expenses reflect interest on the Ker Ventures loan at the legal rate and IFRS 16 restatements relating to rents. Preliminary consolidated financial income mainly reflects capital gains realized by the investment services provider TSAF in the context of the CBI share liquidity contract. Preliminary consolidated minority interests represent the amount attributable to the 23% owners of OP Productions  LLC and Free Reign East  LLC and amounted to €2.1k for the period.The preliminary consolidated net result (Group share) for the period amounts to a net loss of (694.7) K€  compared to a profit of 96.3 K€ for the same period of the previous financial year  in a phase of increasing activity and projects  which will strengthen the commercial activity as they progress.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETASSETS (in €’000) September 30  2022 March 31  2022 Intangible assets 11 540 7 11 014 5 Tangible assets 13 3 11 8 IFRS 16 restatement (leases) 2 104 7 2 236 2 Financial assets 8 144 9 8 144 9 LONG-TERM ASSETS 21 803 6 21 407 4 Inventory of cryptocurrencies and NFTs 2 615 6 2 828 5 Accounts receivable 250 2 440 4 Other current assets 449 8 - Cash and liquidity 582 8 2 647 2 SHORT-TERM ASSETS 3 898 4 5 916 1 TOTAL ASSETS 25 702 0 27 323 5 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES (in €’000) September 30  2022 March 31  2022 Share capital 24 458 8 24 258 8 Premium and consolidated reserves (7 040 3) (10 446 8) Net Income  Group share ( 694 7) 3 807 0 CONSOLIDATED EQUITY  GROUPE SHARE 16 723 8 17 619 0 Minority interests 241 1 206 6 TOTAL CONSOLIDATED EQUITY 16 964 9 17 825 6 Shareholders’ loan 4 767 6 4 573 4 Restatement IFRS 16 (leases) 1 894 6 2 015 6 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 6 662 2 6 589 0 Short term lease liabilities 240 1 236 5 Accounts payable 1 598 6 2 559 2 Other liabilities 236 2 113 2 SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES 2 074 9 2 908 9 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 25 702 0 27 323 5Analysis of the preliminary consolidated balance sheetAmounts invested in the development of the games and the metaverse are capitalized and then amortized from the time they are brought into use. The value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not been amortized as at September 30  2022. This amortization will start at the opening of the metaverse after the test phase. Thus  as at September 30  2022  preliminary consolidated intangible assets amounted to €11.5m  compared with €11.0m as at March 31  2022.The portfolio of shares and financial instruments is unlisted and valued on the basis of the contribution value  i.e. €8.1m for this first half.The inventory of cryptocurrencies is initially recognized on the basis of the acquisition price. At the accounting year end  each cryptocurrency is then valued based on the volume weighted average price at that date to reflect the value of each cryptocurrency and the overall portfolio. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is less than its market value  no unrealized gain is recognized. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is higher than its market value  an impairment is recognized in the income statement. It is reflected in this first half-year in the category of operating ""Other income and expenses"".The Company has not deposited its assets on any trading platform. They are retained in the Company's own wallets.Preliminary consolidated equity  Group Share  amounts to €16.7m as at September 30  2022. The change is due to the profit for the year 2021-2022  the asset contributions made by Ker Ventures  EURL during the period  the October 2021 private placement of shares  all reduced by the redemption price of the warrant issued to the Atari Group  as part of the agreement of March 30  2022.Preliminary consolidated net cash / financial liabilitiesAt September 30  2022  the Group had €582.7k in cash and cash equivalents.IFRS 16 (restatement of leases) has been applied and has resulted in the recognition of assets of €2 104.7k and liabilities of €2 134.7k (of which €1 894.6k is long term and the balance short term).Outlook for the year 2022-2023 (ending March 31  2023)CBI intends to continue to develop AlphaVerse to become one of the leading Web3.0 players worldwide.For the 2022-2023 financial year  CBI's objective is to achieve significant growth in its community  which will ensure the growth of its future activities. Revenue and profit levels for 2022-2023 will depend on the pace at which the universes are opened and the progress of pre-sales of NFTs linked to these universes. In a highly volatile market  these levels are difficult to predict at this stage. All employees are focused on the development of AlphaVerse  both technologically and in the implementation of new partnerships  particularly in the field of football.Disclaimer:The realisation of projects  as well as their operational budget and financing plan  remain fundamentally subject to uncertainties  and the non-realisation of the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of assets and liabilities.About CBICRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (“CBI”) is a French company that develops  operates and invests in video games  business applications and selected projects relating to the blockchain  non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and cryptocurrencies.

PAM solution enables organizations to minimize risks that are related to cyberattacks outside of the network perimeter  malicious insider threats  and third-party access.Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure to effectively manage and access information or data from devices or locations in less time. With cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations were able to minimize the IT cost  increase the ROI  simplify the IT infrastructure  and effectively manage IT resources. However  by adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations are now facing challenges like increasing attack surface  cybersecurity vulnerabilities and managing and monitoring privileged data. Additionally  organizations and IT teams are facing issues while coping with identities and resources across cloud and hybrid environments  as cybercriminals are now leveraging advanced technologies to easily access and damage privileged data and user credentials in any organizational IT system. Therefore  organizations have started adopting cloud-native PAM solutions to mitigate and prevent advanced attacks. With the PAM solutions  organizations can provide improve protection and govern security risks  track the movement of data and workloads  protect data sharing between public and private cloud  and manage privileged access across traditional  virtual  and cloud environments.Additional Resources:For more information about WALLIX visit hereSPARK Matrix: Privileged Access Management (PAM)  2022 LinkPrivilege Access ManagementAbout WALLIXA software company providing cybersecurity solutions  WALLIX is the European specialist in digital Identity and Access Security Solutions.

(OTC: HYSR)  the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and water  today announced that it has invested $10M in TECO 2030 ASA (Oslo Stock Exchange: TECO  OTCQX: TECFF).A Norway-based company  TECO 2030 is the developer of zero-emission technology for the maritime and heavy industry sectors. TECO 2030 is currently accelerating the transition to renewable fuels by developing and building Europe’s first gigafactory of hydrogen PEM fuel cell stacks for medium to heavy-duty trucks and PEM fuel cell modules for maritime applications.Most recently  TECO 2030  Shell   and additional partners received €5 million in funding from Horizon Europe to realize the HyEkoTank  a hydrogen powered tanker that will look to lead the maritime shipping sector in achieving climate targets set by the European Union.Additionally  earlier this year TECO 2030 announced a new collaboration with their longtime development partner AVL in which TECO 2030 will provide fuel cell stacks with energy capacities above 300kW for AVL’s HyTruck fuel cell system.“Over the past year  we have considered many companies in the hydrogen space for strategic investment ” said SunHydrogen’s CEO Tim Young. “We believe TECO 2030’s fuel cell technology  designed with their development partner AVL   has shown incredible potential to become a key player in the fuel cell market.”“In addition to our commitment to developing our nanoparticle technology  SunHydrogen is in parallel committed to enabling the green hydrogen economy ” Mr. Young continued. “Through our cooperation with TECO 2030  we believe our companies can make a significant impact in a fast-growing market that Goldman Sachs estimates to be worth $12 trillion by 2050.”SunHydrogen’s $10M total strategic investment is in two parts. The first is a $7M direct investment for shares equal to 9.3% of TECO 2030. The second is a $3M convertible note at 8% interest that will be convertible into 6.1 million shares at 5.08 Norwegian Krone per share.Following the investment  SunHydrogen shall designate a director to serve on TECO 2030’s board of directors. As part of the investment  the two parties agree to pursue a potential business combination and an up-listing onto a US stock exchange will be explored.“This strategic investment by SunHydrogen will give us more visibility and a strong strategic partner in the US which has very ambitious hydrogen plans ” said TECO 2030’s CEO Tore Enger. “I am looking forward to cooperating with SunHydrogen on our mission toward zero emission fuel cell projects.”About SunHydrogen  Inc.SunHydrogen is developing a breakthrough  low-cost technology to make renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water  including seawater and wastewater. The only byproduct of hydrogen fuel is pure water  unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil  coal and natural gas that release carbon dioxide and other contaminants into the atmosphere when used. By optimizing the science of water electrolysis at the nano-level  our low-cost nanoparticles mimic photosynthesis to efficiently use sunlight to separate hydrogen from water  ultimately producing environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen. Using our low-cost method to produce renewable hydrogen  we intend to enable a world of distributed hydrogen production for renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

13261,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558065-why-im-bullish-on-intercontinental-exchange,Why I'm Bullish On Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE),Intercontinental Exchange continues to do extremely well despite macroeconomic headwinds. Find out our view and recommendation of ICE stock.,FrankvandenBerghIntroductionBear markets aren't fun. Like most people  I prefer it when my net worth goes up in an almost uninterrupted straight line. However  that's not how markets work  and that's a good thing. If it weren't for sell-offs  we wouldn't be able to buy great stocks at attractive valuations. One of the stocks I've been bullish on throughout the 2022 bear market is Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE). The company behind the ICE ticker is a well-diversified player in the exchange industry  offering an increasing number of fast-growing financial products  it increases recurring revenues  and it is rapidly expanding its mortgage business. While a rapidly slowing housing market is pressuring its existing mortgage business  I believe it's a blessing instead of a curse. The valuation has dropped to attractive levels. I believe that ICE shares make for a fantastic investment the moment the market presents us with another move lower.In this article  I will tell you why that is.Weakness Caused By HousingWhile I am writing this  ICE shares have lost a quarter of their value from their all-time high. This includes a 17% rally from the October lows  fueled by expectations that the Fed may take its foot off the brake sooner than expected.There are essentially two major reasons why ICE shares are down. The first one is the most obvious  which is that market weakness has caused investors to de-risk their portfolios. This is hurting every company that isn't benefiting from strong demand in other areas (like oil and gas companies).The second reason is a bit more specific. ICE has  in addition to its transaction-based business  a lot of housing (mortgage) exposure.On a full-year basis  the company generates roughly 15% of its money in its mortgage technology segment. This segment has roughly 50% recurring revenues.MarketScreenerIf we exclude the pending acquisition of Black Night (expected to close in the first half of 2023)  we're dealing with a company that has significant exposure in consumer engagement suites (the early stages of the mortgage loan supply chain)  processing and underwriting of loans  and everything related to closing  funding  and compliance.In other words  ICE doesn't lend money  but it supports the entire process with its technology.Intercontinental ExchangeIn its third quarter  mortgage technology did very poorly  which makes sense as buying conditions for homes have reached the lowest level since the 1980s. On a side note  guess what happened in the early 1980s? Back then  conditions were terrible as central banks were forced to hike into economic weakness due to high inflation. That sounds very familiar.BloombergAnyway  in the third quarter  total mortgage technology revenue came in at $276 million  a decline of 25%  driven by a steep decline in pagination tech and closing solutions. Yet  the good news is that recurring revenue improved by 14%  bringing total recurring revenue to 60% of total segment revenue. After the Knight acquisition  total recurring mortgage revenue is expected to be 55% (based on a recovery of non-recurring revenue).Moreover  while the company does see customer weakness  it is mainly focused on the fact that it is outperforming the industry thanks to the solutions it brings to the table:In the third quarter  our Mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry driven by strong recurring revenues. The strength and resiliency that we've seen in recurring revenues has been driven by our new customers continuing to adopt our digital solutions  increased demand for our data and analytics tools and continued strong retention. Our customers remain focused on automation and efficiencies. This focus has led to increased interest in our data and analytics products  contributing to a 22% growth year-to-date in our data and analytics business.Strength In Exchanges & Fixed IncomeThe good news is that the company's core business continues to do well. After all  ICE is not known for its mortgage business  but for its operations in exchanges where the company owns the NYSE  major energy  agriculture  and financial futures  as well as fixed-income services.These segments helped the company to generate $1.8 billion in third-quarter revenue  which was in line with expectations.Intercontinental ExchangeIn its exchange segment  the company reported 4% higher revenues - 8% higher on a constant currency basis. Growth was reported in every single segment  except for energy  which saw 16% lower revenues. In this segment  the company generated $266 million in revenue  which is more than a quarter of segment revenues. This is caused by major energy contracts like ICE Brent and volatile contracts like Dutch TTF Natural Gas. This decline is mainly caused by volatile trading in the prior year  which makes it hard to beat those numbers.Operating expenses in this segment were down 8%  allowing the company to boost operating income by 10%  which shows what its asset-light business model can achieve in this environment.In fixed income and data services  the company reported 12% revenue growth (14% when adjusted for currency fluctuations).According to the company:Transaction revenues increased by 84%  including 122% growth in ICE bonds and 75% growth in our CDS clearing business. Similar to last quarter  this strong growth was driven by market volatility and rising interest rates  customers allocating additional capital to CDS trading and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenues  excluding the Euronext migration  grew by 4% in the quarter driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network as well as double-digit growth in both our consolidated feeds business and our derivative analytics.One issue was lower bond issuance  which reduces the number of bonds available for pricing. However  if the macro environment doesn't see a major deterioration  fourth-quarter results are likely to be in line with third-quarter results  which is overall very satisfying news.Year-to-date  the company saw a record recurring revenue growth of 7%. Total recurring revenues account for more than 50% of total revenues. Excluding the pending Black Knight acquisition  I expect that number to drop below 50% again as the company saw some weakness in non-recurring revenues this year.Continental ExchangeMoreover  operating income was up 10% as the company did not witness higher expenses  which is truly unique. Adjusted free cash flow rose by 7%  allowing the company to more than double capital returns for its shareholders. On a side note  if you want my view on ICE as a dividend stock  feel free to read this article.The good news is that this is likely going to continue:Despite dramatically different macroeconomic environments  over a 3-year period  you will see a similar story of compounding growth with ICE revenues increasing at a CAGR of 8%  operating income at 11% and EPS of 12%  again  a testament to the resilience and durability of our platform and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to the balance of this year -- of the year  we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us and remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.Intercontinental ExchangeNow  the good news continues as ICE is attractively valued and expected to continue high growth.ValuationIntercontinental Exchange is expected to maintain adjusted EBITDA margins of 65% going forward. Next year  the company is expected to boost EBITDA to $5.0 billion. These expectations have been unchanged in the past few months despite the further deterioration in economic growth expectations.ICE is currently trading at 14.2x 2023E EBITDA of $5.0 billion. This is based on a $71.2 billion enterprise value  consisting of its $58.5 billion market cap and $12.7 billion in enterprise value.Moreover  the implied free cash flow yield for 2023 is 6.2%  which is a terrific deal and a clear sign that ICE is trading well below what I consider fair value.Data by YChartsOver the past 10 years  ICE shares have consistently outperformed the market. I expect that to continue.That's also one of the reasons why I wrote this article. Investors looking to buy the market on weakness might like to dip their toes in this financial giant.TakeawayIntercontinental Exchange confirmed my bull case. While mortgage technology is struggling in this environment  there is no reason to believe that there's trouble on the horizon. Recurring revenues were strong - even in mortgage technologies. Transaction volumes improved  and fixed-income-related services did well despite very weak global bond transactions.Even more important is that ICE was able to manage high inflation. Its asset-light business model is expected to maintain high margins.Unfortunately  the company was not able to discuss the Black Knight deal in greater detail due to an ongoing FTC review. This deal is expected to close in the first half of 2023. I do not expect any obstacles.With regard to the valuation  I have to say that ICE remains a great bargain.However  macroeconomic conditions are terrible. My strategy is to refrain from buying large positions until the market offers us a new opportunity. That strategy is risky as it could mean I miss some upside if I'm wrong and there's no double-dip.To avoid this  investors can start buying a small position and add on a regular basis. If the stock sells off  investors can average down. If the stock takes off  investors have a foot in the door.(Dis)agree?

PAM solution enables organizations to minimize risks that are related to cyberattacks outside of the network perimeter  malicious insider threats  and third-party access.Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure to effectively manage and access information or data from devices or locations in less time. With cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations were able to minimize the IT cost  increase the ROI  simplify the IT infrastructure  and effectively manage IT resources. However  by adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations are now facing challenges like increasing attack surface  cybersecurity vulnerabilities and managing and monitoring privileged data. Additionally  organizations and IT teams are facing issues while coping with identities and resources across cloud and hybrid environments  as cybercriminals are now leveraging advanced technologies to easily access and damage privileged data and user credentials in any organizational IT system. Therefore  organizations have started adopting cloud-native PAM solutions to mitigate and prevent advanced attacks. With the PAM solutions  organizations can provide improve protection and govern security risks  track the movement of data and workloads  protect data sharing between public and private cloud  and manage privileged access across traditional  virtual  and cloud environments.Additional Resources:For more information about WALLIX visit hereSPARK Matrix: Privileged Access Management (PAM)  2022 LinkPrivilege Access ManagementAbout WALLIXA software company providing cybersecurity solutions  WALLIX is the European specialist in digital Identity and Access Security Solutions.
