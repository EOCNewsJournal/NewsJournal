Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}I do love a good train journey  and in Germany they’re pretty darn good. Super-efficient Deutsche Bahn stretches its tentacles from stadt to strand – and now it’s about to be dirt cheap  too  with a €49-a-month (£43) ticket on the horizon  slated to launch some time early next year.Having tried the experimental €9-a-month ticket this summer  I would readily go back for the €49er to revisit some favourite corners that are otherwise hard to reach. Personally  I’m not bothered that this unlimited monthly pass will only include regional trains  not intercity expresses  because it’s the regions I’m interested in. And I want to savour passing landscapes at a gentle trot  not have them whizz past in a blur.With that in mind  I’ve worked out what would be the ideal German train circuit  to be completed in around a week.Goerlitz has cinematic connections (Andrew Eames)I’d start from Cologne (the entry hub for Eurostar-connected trains from Brussels) and dip south to Koblenz  where you can change to the rambling Moselle line and end up in Traben-Trarbach (three hours  two changes). The Moselle is like the Rhine  complete with castles on hilltops and steep banks quilted with vineyards  but on a far more intimate scale. The railway criss-crosses the river  threading together winemaking villages such as Traben-Trarbach  where I’d stay in the art nouveau Hotel Bellevue by the river (doubles from £125; bellevue-hotel.de). If the weather was kind  I’d cycle along the riverbank and walk the vineyard trails.From here  I’d retrace my steps to Koblenz  then wind through the Unesco-recognised Rhine gorge south to Mainz  before transitting Frankfurt and heading cross-country to Eisenach (seven hours  three changes) in the former East Germany. This handsome town is set in a bucolic  forested river valley where wild boar roam  and is the location of the Wartburg  a spectacular  part-Romanesque castle that rises on a hilltop out of the Thuringian Forest. Protestant reformer Martin Luther hid from his enemies here in a wood-panelled room  and you too can stay up above the forest in the Romantik Hotel auf der Wartburg  which clings to the castle walls (doubles from £234; wartburghotel.de).This handsome town is set in a bucolic  forested river valley where wild boar roamFrom Eisenach it’s a straightforward journey eastwards to Dresden (4.5 hours  one change)  nicknamed the Florence of the Elbe thanks in part to paintings of the riverside city by Canaletto. It’s a place of immense culture  with a fabulous old town  painstakingly rebuilt following obliteration by Allied bombs in the Second World War. The teapot-shaped Frauenkirche hosts regular concerts  there are galleries of pictures by masters old and new  and stately ancient paddle steamers flap-flap up and down the River Elbe. Stay opposite the Frauenkirche in the Dresden Townhouse (doubles from £114; vagabondclub.com).From Dresden  there’s one further step east I would make  cross-country to where Gorlitz straddles the Polish border (1.5 hours  direct). Preserved partly by virtue of its remoteness  this immaculate little town is a film director’s paradise. The likes of The Book Thief and The Grand Budapest Hotel were made here  and such is the constant throughput of film and television crews that the town has been nicknamed Gorlywood. Stay the night in this unexpectedly cinematic bolthole by booking a stay at the Hotel Borse (doubles from £108; boerse-goerlitz.de).Having gone as far east as possible  it’s time to head north. A long day on the train (10 hours  six changes  or with a halfway break and an overnight stay in good old Berlin) would take me up to Germany’s Baltic coast.The Raging Roland steam railway is covered by the new rail pass (Andrew Eames)In the old days – when it was trains  not planes  that took people on beach holidays – the Baltic shore was the favoured retreat  initially of the aristocracy  then of the communist elite. In particular  they liked the (causeway-connected) island of Rugen  where the traditional resort of Binz still looks as it did in the 1920s. There are villas of distinctive Bader architecture  a mix of Art Nouveau and Long Island clapperboard with ornate wooden balconies and rooftop octagons  plus spa hotel the Kurhaus Binz  which has a proper ballroom (doubles from £133; travelcharme.com). The beach here is magnificent  boasting six miles of immaculate sand  and if it’s a bit chilly for swimming then there’s always the Raging Roland  a period steam railway that runs along from resort to resort  weaving through patches of forest (fare also included in the €49 ticket).From Binz  I’m starting back to Cologne – but first with an overnight in Hamburg (4.5 hours  one change) to visit Miniatur Wunderland  a model railway housed in an old spice warehouse in the port  which has become phenomenally successful. And before you demur that model railways are not your thing  this one really is something special: the layout is divided into whole miniaturised nations  and it has an airport with real-life departures  special lighting for different times of day  and surreal touches of quite un-Germanic humour. Stay near the Hauptbahnhof at Hotel Wedina (doubles from £137; hotelwedina.de).Spend the night in the Wartburg castle (Andrew Eames)The return to Cologne crosses the heathery Luneberg Heath and eventually winds through the Ruhr  the nation’s industrial powerhouse  a fascinating place of smokestacks and slag heaps. If the journey seems too long (seven hours  three changes) there’s a delightful half-timbered town  Celle  halfway across  with a lovely hotel  the Furstenhof – very well priced given that it has five stars (doubles from £133; althoffcollection.com).Travel essentialsFor international train travel  go to trainline.com  and for domestic travel within Germany  see bahn.com.,positive,1.0,0.0,0.0,mixed,0.62,0.11,0.27,True,English,"['perfect train trip', 'Germany', 'The Raging Roland steam railway', 'stately ancient paddle steamers', 'ideal German train circuit', 'bucolic, forested river valley', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', 'art nouveau Hotel Bellevue', 'period steam railway', 'The Book Thief', 'weekly expert advice', 'Super-efficient Deutsche Bahn', 'unlimited monthly pass', 'Second World War', 'new rail pass', 'distinctive Bader architecture', 'ornate wooden balconies', 'valid email address', 'spectacular, part-Romanesque castle', 'Long Island clapperboard', 'good old Berlin', 'good train journey', 'experimental €9-a-month ticket', 'Unesco-recognised Rhine gorge', 'free travel email', 'immaculate little town', 'former East Germany', 'fabulous old town', 'The Independent', 'The Moselle', 'Romantik Hotel', 'Hotel Borse', 'spa hotel', 'castle walls', 'straightforward journey', 'long day', 'immaculate sand', 'old days', 'handsome town', 'Simon Calder', 'money-saving discounts', 'privacy notice', 'favourite corners', 'intercity expresses', 'passing landscapes', 'gentle trot', 'a week', 'cinematic connections', 'Andrew Eames', 'Moselle line', 'two changes', 'steep banks', 'intimate scale', 'winemaking villages', 'vineyard trails', 'three changes', 'wild boar', 'Protestant reformer', 'Martin Luther', 'wood-panelled room', 'one change', 'riverside city', 'immense culture', 'Allied bombs', 'regular concerts', 'Polish border', 'constant throughput', 'television crews', 'cinematic bolthole', 'six changes', 'halfway break', 'Baltic coast', 'Baltic shore', 'communist elite', 'rooftop octagons', 'proper ballroom', 'six miles', 'River Elbe', 'regional trains', 'Eurostar-connected trains', 'teapot-shaped Frauenkirche', 'film director', 'overnight stay', 'beach holidays', 'Kurhaus Binz', 'three hours', 'seven hours', 'Thuringian Forest', 'Dresden Townhouse', 'traditional resort', '43) ticket', '4.5 hours', 'offers', 'events', 'updates', 'verifyErrors', 'Something', 'tentacles', 'dirt', '€49-a-month', 'horizon', 'time', '€49er', 'regions', 'blur', 'mind', 'Goerlitz', 'Cologne', 'entry', 'hub', 'Brussels', 'Koblenz', 'Traben-Trarbach', 'castles', 'hilltops', 'vineyards', 'doubles', 'weather', 'riverbank', 'steps', 'Mainz', 'Frankfurt', 'country', 'Eisenach', 'location', 'Wartburg', 'enemies', 'Florence', 'paintings', 'Canaletto', 'place', 'obliteration', 'galleries', 'pictures', 'masters', 'Gorlitz', 'virtue', 'remoteness', 'paradise', 'likes', 'planes', 'people', 'retreat', 'aristocracy', 'Rugen', '1920s', 'villas', 'mix', 'swimming', 'patches', 'fare']",2022-11-16,2022-11-16,independent.co.uk

PAM solution enables organizations to minimize risks that are related to cyberattacks outside of the network perimeter  malicious insider threats  and third-party access.Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure to effectively manage and access information or data from devices or locations in less time. With cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations were able to minimize the IT cost  increase the ROI  simplify the IT infrastructure  and effectively manage IT resources. However  by adopting cloud and hybrid infrastructure  organizations are now facing challenges like increasing attack surface  cybersecurity vulnerabilities and managing and monitoring privileged data. Additionally  organizations and IT teams are facing issues while coping with identities and resources across cloud and hybrid environments  as cybercriminals are now leveraging advanced technologies to easily access and damage privileged data and user credentials in any organizational IT system. Therefore  organizations have started adopting cloud-native PAM solutions to mitigate and prevent advanced attacks. With the PAM solutions  organizations can provide improve protection and govern security risks  track the movement of data and workloads  protect data sharing between public and private cloud  and manage privileged access across traditional  virtual  and cloud environments.Additional Resources:For more information about WALLIX visit hereSPARK Matrix: Privileged Access Management (PAM)  2022 LinkPrivilege Access ManagementAbout WALLIXA software company providing cybersecurity solutions  WALLIX is the European specialist in digital Identity and Access Security Solutions.

Data from teni evaluable diuretic-resistant heart failure patients with persistent congestion who have completed the 16-week follow-up period after intensive DSR therapy confirm the previously reported strong interim dataii showing important and long-lasting clinical benefits.To evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of the Company’s second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0)  a single-arm  open-label  Phase 1 study has been initiated in Canada (YUKON) with up to 10 patients on peritoneal dialysis receiving a single treatment of DSR 2.0. The first patient has been dosed successfully and the results of this study will be used to determine dosing of DSR 2.0 in MOJAVE. Data from YUKON  together with CHIHUAHUA  a further Phase 1 study in Mexico intended to support the US INDiii filing of DSR 2.0  planned for Q1 2023. These replace the previously planned SAHARA extension study with DSR 2.0. Approval of the US IND will enable the Company to start MOJAVE  its randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  planned for H1 2023.Story continuesDr. Jeffrey Testani  Associate Professor at Yale University and Heart Failure Scientific Advisor to Sequana Medical  commented: “Congestion is a key driver of heart failure and remains the leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization in this large and growing patient population. Diuretic-resistance is widespread and the usual therapeutic approach is just adding more diuretics  further worsening the underlying issues. There are no therapies that seek to correct the cardio-renal pathophysiology causing the diuretic-resistance. The SAHARA results are highly encouraging and indicate the potential for DSR therapy to deliver clinically meaningful decongestion and durable improvements in cardio-renal function and thus diuretic response.”Dr. Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  added: “These results are very positive and reinforce our view that DSR is a potential disease-modifying heart failure therapy. We are excited to have the first patient dosed with DSR 2.0 and we are confident that this second-generation product will deliver important therapeutic and safety benefits. I would like to thank the investigators  patients and care personnel involved in both SAHARA and YUKON  and we look forward to commencing MOJAVE  the first randomized controlled multi-center study in the US using DSR 2.0.”SAHARA top-line resultsAt baseline  all teni evaluable patients with persistent congestion due to heart failure were on high dose loop diuretics (mean furosemide equivalent dose of 360 mg/day) and had an overall high disease severity  including a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 23% and mean NT-proBNP of 6 628 pg/mL. At the start of the study treatment period  loop diuretics were withheld  and patients underwent intensive DSR therapy with DSR 1.0 for two weeks (phase 1) which was repeated up to two times depending on patients’ euvolemic state (i.e.  normal amount of body fluids)  diuretic response and stable DSR dosing at the end of phase 1. Patients who achieved euvolemia and had adequate diuretic response entered the maintenance DSR treatment phase with monthly DSR dosing for 16 weeks (phase 2).All ten evaluable patients safely  effectively and rapidly eliminated the persistent congestion and achieved euvolemia within one week of commencing intensive DSR therapy  resulting in a mean weight loss of 7kg at the end of phase 1. During the intensive DSR period (phase 1)  the diuretic response of the kidney was near-normalised  with mean six-hour excretion of sodium increasing more than 160% vs. baseline  as well as a considerable improvement in cardio-renal health  with a mean reduction in NT-proBNPiv of 38% vs. baseline and a mean improvement in eGFRv of 7% vs. baseline despite the dramatic fluid loss.The improvement in cardio-renal health was broadly maintained at the end of phase 2 (16 weeks post intensive DSR period) demonstrated by a mean 33% reduction in NT-proBNP and a stable eGFR.The need for loop diuretics was dramatically reduced for many months following completion of the intensive DSR therapy (see table below)  which the Company believes is a demonstration of the durable improvement in cardio-renal health.Evaluable patient No. of months post intensive DSR period Reduction in diuretic dose vs. baseline 01-01 15 90% 01-03 13 100% 01-04 12 90% 01-05 12 100% 01-06 10 100% 01-08 10 90% 01-09 9 67% 01-10 9 95% 01-11 6 93% 01-12 6 100%No clinically relevant changes in serum sodium levels or progressive hyponatremia were observed in any of the evaluable patients. There were three serious adverse events in three of the evaluable patients  including two having a blocked peritoneal catheter (both during phase 2) and one with stable angina (started post phase 2  ongoing). The Data Monitoring Committee assessed both peritoneal catheter blockages as definitely related to the study device but unrelated to the implant procedure or study treatment  and the stable agina as unrelated to the study device  implant procedure  or treatment.All evaluable patients treated with DSR therapy in the RED DESERT and SAHARA clinical studies experienced no congestion-related heart failure hospital re-admissions during the entire study period and all patients improved their NYHAvi status by at least one class. The clinical benefits observed in RED DESERT and SAHARA resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Modelvii.On track to start M OJAVE with DSR 2.0 in H1 2023The Company is progressing development of its proprietary DSR 2.0 product  a sodium-free dextrose / icodextrin solution expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile and with a robust intellectual property protection. Data from two interventional  single-centre  single-arm studies  one in Canada (YUKON) and one in Mexico (CHIHUAHUA) will evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of DSR 2.0. Both studies will enroll up to ten stable peritoneal dialysis patients who will receive a single treatment of DSR 2.0  administered through their peritoneal dialysis catheter. The first patient has been treated successfully in YUKON and data from both studies intended to support the filing of the US IND  planned for Q1 2023. The choice of peritoneal dialysis patients is driven by their pre-existing peritoneal dialysis catheter.Following initial discussions with the FDA  MOJAVE  a randomized controlled Phase 1/2a US study of DSR 2.0  is on track to start in H1 2023 assuming FDA approval of the US IND. The intention is to enrol 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion  with 20 patients randomised to DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure (CHF) for up to four weeks and ten patients randomised to usual care for CHF alone. Following four weeks of DSR therapy there will be a three-month safety follow-up period. Prior to enrolment of these 30 patients  three additional patients will be enrolled in a non-randomized safety cohort and will receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for CHF for up to four weeks. Progression to the enrolment of the 30 randomized patients will be dependent upon DSMBviii approval following their review of the initial three patients. More details on the final study design will be announced following FDA approval of the US IND. Interim data of MOJAVE are planned for H2 2023 and top-line results are expected in mid 2024.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsMary Clark  Nick Bastin  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0)7931 500 066About fluid overload in heart failure (AKA congestion)Heart failure is the leading cause of US hospitalizations in patients over 65 years old and 90% of these admissions are due to fluid overload  which is recognized as the primary driver of morbidity and hospitalization. Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About DSR® (Direct Sodium Removal) in heart failureSequana Medical considers its proprietary DSR to be a disease modifying therapy for heart failure. Fluid accumulation in heart failure patients is caused by the retention of too much sodium. The DSR drug-based approach directly tackles this key clinical problem of sodium overload  and works in partnership with the kidneys to safely and rapidly eliminate the excess fluid. Complementary to existing heart failure therapies  clinical proof-of-concept studies using the Company’s first-generation DSR product (DSR 1.0) have shown that DSR can i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate fluid overload in heart failure patients  ii) improve the health of the heart and preserve renal function  and iii) restore the ability of the kidney to manage the fluid and sodium naturally  resulting in a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for diuretic drugs. In DSR treated patients  there have been no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during the study follow-up period  all patients improved their NYHA status by at least one class and the clinical benefits observed in the clinical studies resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model. The Company is currently preparing an IND application for its second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) in the US and plans to begin a US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial in H1 2023. Composition of matter and method patents have been granted for DSR therapy in the US and Europe.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. Fluid overload is a well-recognized problem in these growing diseases  causing severe problems for the large number of patients for whom current medicines are no longer effective. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary platforms that work with the body to remove this excess fluid  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical study of DSR 2.0  in H1 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Rave Companion addresses the long-standing industry challenge of duplicate data entry by enabling structured and unstructured data from any electronic health record to be directly utilized by Rave EDC  within a few clicks.“ The number of data points collected as part of a clinical trial has increased exponentially and sites are looking for scalable and easy to use solutions to connect to their EHR and reduce data entry ” said Dan Braga  vice president EHR Solutions and Healthcare at Medidata. “ Rave Companion is an elegant solution that helps sites utilize existing data from any EHR system instead of re-entering it for clinical trials purposes.”Medidata has conducted more than 29 000 trials  with more than 1.5M life science professionals around the world using its industry-leading platform. Rave Companion was designed in a way to provide out of the box functionality for unstructured data  as well as advanced EHR integration capabilities for those sites connected to Medidata’s broad and quickly expanding network of research sites. Rave Companion works by mirroring the Rave eCRF schema in a “companion” tool that floats on top of the screen and follows site users as they navigate through various records systems that are needed to contribute to the research database.For unstructured data  or for sites not yet connected to Medidata’s network  Rave Companion eliminates “swivel chair” activities and allows the Rave EDC experience to travel with users as they go to their EHR  or other clinical systems  to find the appropriate patient data. Instead of coming back to type it in  users can now simply click on the value and the eCRF will be filled out for them.Coming next year  Rave Companion will also include the presentation of EHR data directly within the solution  meaning that users will never have to leave Rave EDC to complete eCRFs  keeping the whole experience in one place.Medidata will unveil Rave Companion at its premier life sciences event  NEXT New York November 15-16. Participants will learn how Medidata is addressing the challenges of data entry during a session titled  “ Solving the EHR to EDC Challenge: A New Perspective  Approach and Technology ” featuring Gene Vinson  executive director  Clinical Vendor Management at Syneos Health and Medidata's Dan Braga and Samir Jain  senior director  EHR Solutions.Medidata is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Systèmes  which with its 3DEXPERIENCE platform is positioned to lead the digital transformation of life sciences in the age of personalized medicine with the first end-to-end scientific and business platform  from research to commercialization.About MedidataMedidata is leading the digital transformation of life sciences  creating hope for millions of patients.

(NYSE: VOYA)  is releasing new findings from a consumer research survey revealing that  while the broad scope of workplace benefits and savings offerings for employees continues to evolve  the employer-sponsored retirement plan remains a critical component to attracting and retaining talent. Specifically  Voya’s research found that  among working Americans  60% are more likely to stay with their current employer if they offer an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Equally important to working individuals were a competitive salary or compensation package (64%) and flexible work hours (63%).“We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has forever changed the workplace benefits and savings landscape and  as a result  many employers continue to evolve their offerings to support their workforce  particularly as an opportunity to attract and retain talent in today’s competitive market ” said Heather Lavallee  CEO  Wealth Solutions  and president and CEO-elect  Voya Financial. “At the same time  amid new offerings such as flexible or hybrid work arrangements  employers need to remember the employer-sponsored retirement plan is a critical component to helping individuals prepare for a more secure financial future.”Focus remains on the long termWith many already thinking ahead to 2023  Voya’s survey also revealed that  due to inflation  more than three-quarters (76%) of individuals are extremely likely or likely to spend less on non-essential items next year  which generally could include things such as meals out  vacations or luxury goods. At the same time  they are maintaining a focus on the long-term benefits of saving  with nearly 7-in-10 (68%) of Americans saying they have plans to save for retirement next year. This focus on preparing for the long term becomes even more important as individuals continue to want to “stay the course” despite today’s market uncertainty. For example  Voya’s survey also revealed that a majority (81%) of Americans find having a long-term view for their investments important or extremely important  with 79% agreeing on the importance of staying the course during a volatile market.“It’s extremely encouraging to see individuals keeping a focus on their long-term goals  despite the rollercoaster of financial extremes many have experienced over the past several years ” added Lavallee. “All employers should take note of the steadfastness that working Americans are expressing when it comes to the value of building their retirement savings through their workplace plan. This is particularly important as our survey also found that 75% of individuals plan to follow a financial plan and budget in 2023.”Workplace benefits continue to play a valuable role in the lives of working AmericansWhile a retirement plan remains an important aspect of the overall workplace benefits and savings package  Voya’s survey reinforced the valuable role that workplace benefits are playing in the lives of working Americans  particularly when it comes to both their health and wealth needs. More than half (52%) of employed individuals said they are more likely to stay with their current employer if they offer: physical health benefits/programs such as gym reimbursement/discounts  points/bonuses earned based on physical activity  weight loss challenges  etc.  financial wellness benefits/program such as access to tools and resources for budgeting  building savings  reducing debt  etc.  and a workplace emergency-savings plan (51%). In addition  nearly half (49%) are more likely to stay with their current employer if they offer access to voluntary benefit offerings like critical illness  hospital indemnity  disability income  accident insurance  etc.  and 47% are more likely to stay with access to health spending and savings accounts (HSA  FSA  dependent care account).“While we at Voya believe that having a focus on driving greater outcomes for retirement is vital to supporting today’s workforce  the financial uncertainty surrounding many individuals today also brings about a shift in mindset when it comes to the holistic wellness needs of employees ” added Rob Grubka  CEO  Health Solutions at Voya. “As many employers face an intensifying market attracting and retaining talent  the new year brings a great opportunity to evaluate your offerings to help stand out as an employer of choice. And for employees  simply knowing what’s available can only benefit you. So  it’s important to understand your options  particularly if that means being more curious at your own employer.”“More and more employers today are being proactive with their offerings as they understand the short-term financial needs of their workforce can have a direct impact on their ability to save for the long term ” added Lavallee. “Programs that provide student loan debt support  caregiver needs  building emergency savings and access to financial professionals or advice tools are all things to ask about when it comes to support the breadth of financial planning needs individuals face today.”As an industry leader focused on the delivery of workplace benefits  savings and investment solutions to and through the workplace  Voya is committed to delivering on its mission to make a secure financial future possible for all Americans — one person  one family  one institution at a time.All data based on the results of a Voya Financial survey conducted Oct. 10-11  2022  on the Ipsos eNation omnibus online platform among 1 004 adults (461 employed) aged 18+ in the U.S..About Voya Financial®Voya Financial  Inc.

We are seeing new attitudes impacting everything from living situations and well-being to community and consumption. People have taken time out and a step back  to determine what works best for them moving forward. And as they focus on what they really need to be happy and healthy  incorporating the importance of community in their personal needs  they bring our society to shift. And this way  individuals’ changes become a collective transforming force. And its impact is having a significant influence on nearly every aspect of society and business.Recognizing The Nuances in Changes and The Takeouts For HospitalityWhile these shifting mindsets might seem sudden  they have been brewing beneath the surface. The COVID time out propelled these changes forward a bit faster than they might have normally evolved  but the underlying desire for change was still there.Those of us doing business in the hospitality industry need to recognize these attitude changes do indeed impact us as we look to welcome guests into our hotels  resorts  restaurants  spas and more. Individuals are no longer the same they once were. How does it impact our activities? How do we build opportunities on those changes?Exploring shifts in individual convictions and behavior  we looked at how people are addressing their own individual needs and desires  but are also considering how they can fit into and be an integral part of their community and collective - how people manage to apply their personal rhythm to remote work and society solicitations  how their connection to community does not stop them from travelling and discovering abroad. We are seeing well-being becoming one of their main demands  well beyond its physical aspect  and juggling with ethics and convenience as they envisage new purchases.These transformations are not without conflicting beliefs as they can point in diametrically opposing directions or present nuances which may be challenging to navigate  but can enrich and help refine the paths forward.Source: AccorFor example  when we examine how people want to fit in the world  in a recent Accor consumer study conducted across 7 countries  we see that 60% of travelers state that “I like to do what I want  when I want”*  putting their vision first. Yet  they also want to acknowledge the importance of quality relationship with others  listed as the N°1 factor for happiness and health in a study conducted by Harvard.**The good news is seemingly opposite viewpoints actually offer new routes for innovation in services and experiences and can be leveraged into exciting opportunities to innovate  collaborate  and successfully drive business.We invited educator and leading hospitality expert Dr. Lalia Rach  together with Tom Goodwin  author and specialist in innovation  to share their perspectives on people’s new mindsets and on how this could impact hospitality today. Read their full contribution here.Exploring 4 Key Trends For HospitalityWe have identified four key areas  substantially impacted through those mindset shifts  exploring how they translate into key trends directly connected to hospitality  with insights and potential for our industry.Source: AccorWe take a closer look at those 4 trends shaping opportunities in hospitalitySources:*Study conducted by Accor in 2022 among 15 000+ travelers in 7 countries**Harvard Study of Adult Development – conducted since 1938 and still going onAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

However  this demand for original content is meeting up with a VFX production capacity still impacted by an unprecedented level of attrition.The Group has identified and implemented significant actions since the summer to react. However  the anticipated improvements in recruitment  attrition and production efficiencies are not materializing at the expected pace  resulting in Technicolor Creative Studios to not deliver on time or at expected cost:Recently  a significant amount of high margin sales has been missed at The Mill  due to senior resource constraints;Some major MPC projects are being impacted by lower production efficiencies leading to late deliveries  extra spendings and margin decline.On top of significant actions already implemented since the summer  the Group is actively working on a larger transformation program  encompassing several new key senior hires  along with further optimization of processes and metrics  and moving a greater level of production to India; further details to be shared at the Q3 results call November 30th. Operational metrics are improving and will aim to exceed historical performance. However  the activity will still be affected in the fourth quarter of 2022 and probably throughout 2023.As a consequence of the above Technicolor Creative Studios is revising its Adjusted EBITDA after lease (new definition) 1 expectations as follows:For 2022: guidance is revised downwards from €120-130 million to €45-65 million at budget rate 2 or €50-70 million at actual rates 3 ;or €50-70 million at actual rates ; Preliminary view for 2023: flat or moderately up4 from expected 2022 landing  compared to €140-160 million previous estimates.An analyst audio webcast hosted by Christian Roberton  CEO and Laurent Carozzi  CFO will be held today  November 15  2022  at 6:30pm CET.Audio WebcastPlease find below the link to the webcast:Conf Call Nov 2022Conference call(Please use this option only if you wish to ask questions by phone)Dial the access number below 10mn before the call:France: +33 172727403 PIN: 22158323#United Kingdom: +442071943759 PIN: 22158323#United States: +1 6467224916 PIN: 22158323#Financial CalendarQ3 2022 business updateODDO Conference2022 Full Year Results November 30th  2022January 10  2023March 8  2023***Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

With careful design and innovative technologies  we have secured important partnerships  notably in the field of music  digital art and charitable organizations and caritative programs.

The Hub was first opened in September 2022 for a test phase  which generated a lot of positive and rewarding feedback. After an initial development phase during which priority was given to video games  music and the associative world  all of which are major fields with large international communities  the following universes are currently being developed:MetaCoaster: a blockchain-based theme park simulation game.

In particular  they include the activities of the operating companies Crypto Blockchain Industries  SA  OP Productions  LLC and Free Reign East  LLC from April 1  2022 to September 30  2022. The figures in the tables in this press release are rounded to thousands of euros.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTAnalysis of preliminary consolidated resultsAt September 30  2022  CBI recorded preliminary revenue of €2 395.5k  mainly from licenses and services concluded with partners Chain Games and Cornucopias.Over the 6 months of commercial activities  the revenue from the sale of NFTs and tokens is mainly derived from sales or pre-sales made for AlphaVerse  with Chain Games and Horyou AlphaVerse in particular.The pro forma gross margin was 98.64% of revenue for the period.Preliminary research and development costs of €538.9K are related to the operation and development of AlphaVerse. The Company mobilizes significant external resources  including 3 independent studios  specialized in the development of blockchain-based worlds and innovative video games. This allows to keep a flexible cost structure and to benefit from a pool of skills adapted to the pace of AlphaVerse’s development. Concerning the metaverse  the value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not given rise to amortization as of September 30  2022  as this amortization starts at the opening of the metaverse.Preliminary marketing and sales expenses of €667.0K include the promotion of AlphaVerse through the launch of online marketing campaigns. Expenses for the period are also related to the OP Productions game.Preliminary general and administrative expenses for the period mainly reflect the salaries of the management and holding staff (6 full-time equivalents)  as well as general expenses related to the listing of the Company’s shares on the Euronext Growth market.The preliminary operating profit from ordinary activities for the first half of the year  at €587.8K  or 24.5% of revenue  reflects the increased development of the activities  particularly AlphaVerse.Other income and expenses in the amount of €(1 243.0) K consist of the depreciation of crypto-currency inventories and tokens valued at the closing price of September 30  2022  in connection with the change in the value of its assets over the period. After taking this impairment into account  preliminary operating income was €(655.2)K  compared to €134.9 K for the same period last year.Preliminary consolidated financial expenses reflect interest on the Ker Ventures loan at the legal rate and IFRS 16 restatements relating to rents. Preliminary consolidated financial income mainly reflects capital gains realized by the investment services provider TSAF in the context of the CBI share liquidity contract. Preliminary consolidated minority interests represent the amount attributable to the 23% owners of OP Productions  LLC and Free Reign East  LLC and amounted to €2.1k for the period.The preliminary consolidated net result (Group share) for the period amounts to a net loss of (694.7) K€  compared to a profit of 96.3 K€ for the same period of the previous financial year  in a phase of increasing activity and projects  which will strengthen the commercial activity as they progress.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETASSETS (in €’000) September 30  2022 March 31  2022 Intangible assets 11 540 7 11 014 5 Tangible assets 13 3 11 8 IFRS 16 restatement (leases) 2 104 7 2 236 2 Financial assets 8 144 9 8 144 9 LONG-TERM ASSETS 21 803 6 21 407 4 Inventory of cryptocurrencies and NFTs 2 615 6 2 828 5 Accounts receivable 250 2 440 4 Other current assets 449 8 - Cash and liquidity 582 8 2 647 2 SHORT-TERM ASSETS 3 898 4 5 916 1 TOTAL ASSETS 25 702 0 27 323 5 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES (in €’000) September 30  2022 March 31  2022 Share capital 24 458 8 24 258 8 Premium and consolidated reserves (7 040 3) (10 446 8) Net Income  Group share ( 694 7) 3 807 0 CONSOLIDATED EQUITY  GROUPE SHARE 16 723 8 17 619 0 Minority interests 241 1 206 6 TOTAL CONSOLIDATED EQUITY 16 964 9 17 825 6 Shareholders’ loan 4 767 6 4 573 4 Restatement IFRS 16 (leases) 1 894 6 2 015 6 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 6 662 2 6 589 0 Short term lease liabilities 240 1 236 5 Accounts payable 1 598 6 2 559 2 Other liabilities 236 2 113 2 SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES 2 074 9 2 908 9 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 25 702 0 27 323 5Analysis of the preliminary consolidated balance sheetAmounts invested in the development of the games and the metaverse are capitalized and then amortized from the time they are brought into use. The value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not been amortized as at September 30  2022. This amortization will start at the opening of the metaverse after the test phase. Thus  as at September 30  2022  preliminary consolidated intangible assets amounted to €11.5m  compared with €11.0m as at March 31  2022.The portfolio of shares and financial instruments is unlisted and valued on the basis of the contribution value  i.e. €8.1m for this first half.The inventory of cryptocurrencies is initially recognized on the basis of the acquisition price. At the accounting year end  each cryptocurrency is then valued based on the volume weighted average price at that date to reflect the value of each cryptocurrency and the overall portfolio. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is less than its market value  no unrealized gain is recognized. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is higher than its market value  an impairment is recognized in the income statement. It is reflected in this first half-year in the category of operating ""Other income and expenses"".The Company has not deposited its assets on any trading platform. They are retained in the Company's own wallets.Preliminary consolidated equity  Group Share  amounts to €16.7m as at September 30  2022. The change is due to the profit for the year 2021-2022  the asset contributions made by Ker Ventures  EURL during the period  the October 2021 private placement of shares  all reduced by the redemption price of the warrant issued to the Atari Group  as part of the agreement of March 30  2022.Preliminary consolidated net cash / financial liabilitiesAt September 30  2022  the Group had €582.7k in cash and cash equivalents.IFRS 16 (restatement of leases) has been applied and has resulted in the recognition of assets of €2 104.7k and liabilities of €2 134.7k (of which €1 894.6k is long term and the balance short term).Outlook for the year 2022-2023 (ending March 31  2023)CBI intends to continue to develop AlphaVerse to become one of the leading Web3.0 players worldwide.For the 2022-2023 financial year  CBI's objective is to achieve significant growth in its community  which will ensure the growth of its future activities. Revenue and profit levels for 2022-2023 will depend on the pace at which the universes are opened and the progress of pre-sales of NFTs linked to these universes. In a highly volatile market  these levels are difficult to predict at this stage. All employees are focused on the development of AlphaVerse  both technologically and in the implementation of new partnerships  particularly in the field of football.Disclaimer:The realisation of projects  as well as their operational budget and financing plan  remain fundamentally subject to uncertainties  and the non-realisation of the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of assets and liabilities.About CBICRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (“CBI”) is a French company that develops  operates and invests in video games  business applications and selected projects relating to the blockchain  non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and cryptocurrencies.

(OTC: HYSR)  the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and water  today announced that it has invested $10M in TECO 2030 ASA (Oslo Stock Exchange: TECO  OTCQX: TECFF).A Norway-based company  TECO 2030 is the developer of zero-emission technology for the maritime and heavy industry sectors. TECO 2030 is currently accelerating the transition to renewable fuels by developing and building Europe’s first gigafactory of hydrogen PEM fuel cell stacks for medium to heavy-duty trucks and PEM fuel cell modules for maritime applications.Most recently  TECO 2030  Shell   and additional partners received €5 million in funding from Horizon Europe to realize the HyEkoTank  a hydrogen powered tanker that will look to lead the maritime shipping sector in achieving climate targets set by the European Union.Additionally  earlier this year TECO 2030 announced a new collaboration with their longtime development partner AVL in which TECO 2030 will provide fuel cell stacks with energy capacities above 300kW for AVL’s HyTruck fuel cell system.“Over the past year  we have considered many companies in the hydrogen space for strategic investment ” said SunHydrogen’s CEO Tim Young. “We believe TECO 2030’s fuel cell technology  designed with their development partner AVL   has shown incredible potential to become a key player in the fuel cell market.”“In addition to our commitment to developing our nanoparticle technology  SunHydrogen is in parallel committed to enabling the green hydrogen economy ” Mr. Young continued. “Through our cooperation with TECO 2030  we believe our companies can make a significant impact in a fast-growing market that Goldman Sachs estimates to be worth $12 trillion by 2050.”SunHydrogen’s $10M total strategic investment is in two parts. The first is a $7M direct investment for shares equal to 9.3% of TECO 2030. The second is a $3M convertible note at 8% interest that will be convertible into 6.1 million shares at 5.08 Norwegian Krone per share.Following the investment  SunHydrogen shall designate a director to serve on TECO 2030’s board of directors. As part of the investment  the two parties agree to pursue a potential business combination and an up-listing onto a US stock exchange will be explored.“This strategic investment by SunHydrogen will give us more visibility and a strong strategic partner in the US which has very ambitious hydrogen plans ” said TECO 2030’s CEO Tore Enger. “I am looking forward to cooperating with SunHydrogen on our mission toward zero emission fuel cell projects.”About SunHydrogen  Inc.SunHydrogen is developing a breakthrough  low-cost technology to make renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water  including seawater and wastewater. The only byproduct of hydrogen fuel is pure water  unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil  coal and natural gas that release carbon dioxide and other contaminants into the atmosphere when used. By optimizing the science of water electrolysis at the nano-level  our low-cost nanoparticles mimic photosynthesis to efficiently use sunlight to separate hydrogen from water  ultimately producing environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen. Using our low-cost method to produce renewable hydrogen  we intend to enable a world of distributed hydrogen production for renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

13261,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558065-why-im-bullish-on-intercontinental-exchange,Why I'm Bullish On Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE),Intercontinental Exchange continues to do extremely well despite macroeconomic headwinds. Find out our view and recommendation of ICE stock.,FrankvandenBerghIntroductionBear markets aren't fun. Like most people  I prefer it when my net worth goes up in an almost uninterrupted straight line. However  that's not how markets work  and that's a good thing. If it weren't for sell-offs  we wouldn't be able to buy great stocks at attractive valuations. One of the stocks I've been bullish on throughout the 2022 bear market is Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE). The company behind the ICE ticker is a well-diversified player in the exchange industry  offering an increasing number of fast-growing financial products  it increases recurring revenues  and it is rapidly expanding its mortgage business. While a rapidly slowing housing market is pressuring its existing mortgage business  I believe it's a blessing instead of a curse. The valuation has dropped to attractive levels. I believe that ICE shares make for a fantastic investment the moment the market presents us with another move lower.In this article  I will tell you why that is.Weakness Caused By HousingWhile I am writing this  ICE shares have lost a quarter of their value from their all-time high. This includes a 17% rally from the October lows  fueled by expectations that the Fed may take its foot off the brake sooner than expected.There are essentially two major reasons why ICE shares are down. The first one is the most obvious  which is that market weakness has caused investors to de-risk their portfolios. This is hurting every company that isn't benefiting from strong demand in other areas (like oil and gas companies).The second reason is a bit more specific. ICE has  in addition to its transaction-based business  a lot of housing (mortgage) exposure.On a full-year basis  the company generates roughly 15% of its money in its mortgage technology segment. This segment has roughly 50% recurring revenues.MarketScreenerIf we exclude the pending acquisition of Black Night (expected to close in the first half of 2023)  we're dealing with a company that has significant exposure in consumer engagement suites (the early stages of the mortgage loan supply chain)  processing and underwriting of loans  and everything related to closing  funding  and compliance.In other words  ICE doesn't lend money  but it supports the entire process with its technology.Intercontinental ExchangeIn its third quarter  mortgage technology did very poorly  which makes sense as buying conditions for homes have reached the lowest level since the 1980s. On a side note  guess what happened in the early 1980s? Back then  conditions were terrible as central banks were forced to hike into economic weakness due to high inflation. That sounds very familiar.BloombergAnyway  in the third quarter  total mortgage technology revenue came in at $276 million  a decline of 25%  driven by a steep decline in pagination tech and closing solutions. Yet  the good news is that recurring revenue improved by 14%  bringing total recurring revenue to 60% of total segment revenue. After the Knight acquisition  total recurring mortgage revenue is expected to be 55% (based on a recovery of non-recurring revenue).Moreover  while the company does see customer weakness  it is mainly focused on the fact that it is outperforming the industry thanks to the solutions it brings to the table:In the third quarter  our Mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry driven by strong recurring revenues. The strength and resiliency that we've seen in recurring revenues has been driven by our new customers continuing to adopt our digital solutions  increased demand for our data and analytics tools and continued strong retention. Our customers remain focused on automation and efficiencies. This focus has led to increased interest in our data and analytics products  contributing to a 22% growth year-to-date in our data and analytics business.Strength In Exchanges & Fixed IncomeThe good news is that the company's core business continues to do well. After all  ICE is not known for its mortgage business  but for its operations in exchanges where the company owns the NYSE  major energy  agriculture  and financial futures  as well as fixed-income services.These segments helped the company to generate $1.8 billion in third-quarter revenue  which was in line with expectations.Intercontinental ExchangeIn its exchange segment  the company reported 4% higher revenues - 8% higher on a constant currency basis. Growth was reported in every single segment  except for energy  which saw 16% lower revenues. In this segment  the company generated $266 million in revenue  which is more than a quarter of segment revenues. This is caused by major energy contracts like ICE Brent and volatile contracts like Dutch TTF Natural Gas. This decline is mainly caused by volatile trading in the prior year  which makes it hard to beat those numbers.Operating expenses in this segment were down 8%  allowing the company to boost operating income by 10%  which shows what its asset-light business model can achieve in this environment.In fixed income and data services  the company reported 12% revenue growth (14% when adjusted for currency fluctuations).According to the company:Transaction revenues increased by 84%  including 122% growth in ICE bonds and 75% growth in our CDS clearing business. Similar to last quarter  this strong growth was driven by market volatility and rising interest rates  customers allocating additional capital to CDS trading and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenues  excluding the Euronext migration  grew by 4% in the quarter driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network as well as double-digit growth in both our consolidated feeds business and our derivative analytics.One issue was lower bond issuance  which reduces the number of bonds available for pricing. However  if the macro environment doesn't see a major deterioration  fourth-quarter results are likely to be in line with third-quarter results  which is overall very satisfying news.Year-to-date  the company saw a record recurring revenue growth of 7%. Total recurring revenues account for more than 50% of total revenues. Excluding the pending Black Knight acquisition  I expect that number to drop below 50% again as the company saw some weakness in non-recurring revenues this year.Continental ExchangeMoreover  operating income was up 10% as the company did not witness higher expenses  which is truly unique. Adjusted free cash flow rose by 7%  allowing the company to more than double capital returns for its shareholders. On a side note  if you want my view on ICE as a dividend stock  feel free to read this article.The good news is that this is likely going to continue:Despite dramatically different macroeconomic environments  over a 3-year period  you will see a similar story of compounding growth with ICE revenues increasing at a CAGR of 8%  operating income at 11% and EPS of 12%  again  a testament to the resilience and durability of our platform and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to the balance of this year -- of the year  we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us and remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.Intercontinental ExchangeNow  the good news continues as ICE is attractively valued and expected to continue high growth.ValuationIntercontinental Exchange is expected to maintain adjusted EBITDA margins of 65% going forward. Next year  the company is expected to boost EBITDA to $5.0 billion. These expectations have been unchanged in the past few months despite the further deterioration in economic growth expectations.ICE is currently trading at 14.2x 2023E EBITDA of $5.0 billion. This is based on a $71.2 billion enterprise value  consisting of its $58.5 billion market cap and $12.7 billion in enterprise value.Moreover  the implied free cash flow yield for 2023 is 6.2%  which is a terrific deal and a clear sign that ICE is trading well below what I consider fair value.Data by YChartsOver the past 10 years  ICE shares have consistently outperformed the market. I expect that to continue.That's also one of the reasons why I wrote this article. Investors looking to buy the market on weakness might like to dip their toes in this financial giant.TakeawayIntercontinental Exchange confirmed my bull case. While mortgage technology is struggling in this environment  there is no reason to believe that there's trouble on the horizon. Recurring revenues were strong - even in mortgage technologies. Transaction volumes improved  and fixed-income-related services did well despite very weak global bond transactions.Even more important is that ICE was able to manage high inflation. Its asset-light business model is expected to maintain high margins.Unfortunately  the company was not able to discuss the Black Knight deal in greater detail due to an ongoing FTC review. This deal is expected to close in the first half of 2023. I do not expect any obstacles.With regard to the valuation  I have to say that ICE remains a great bargain.However  macroeconomic conditions are terrible. My strategy is to refrain from buying large positions until the market offers us a new opportunity. That strategy is risky as it could mean I miss some upside if I'm wrong and there's no double-dip.To avoid this  investors can start buying a small position and add on a regular basis. If the stock sells off  investors can average down. If the stock takes off  investors have a foot in the door.(Dis)agree?

On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.Story continuesIn this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.” says Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company’s growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company’s presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the “New Shares”)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company’s shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022.

The Group’s target of 2.6 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  which it had planned to achieve by the end of 2023  will be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule. As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately €475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of €156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of €137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between €2.5 billion and €3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company’s securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group’s activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group’s main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group’s requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia’s activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia’s growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 – Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the “New Shares”) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the “Capital Increase”) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company’s existing shares (the Existing Shares).

Furthermore  as a result of its subscription commitment  Voltalia Investissement could see its stake in the Company’s share capital increase;the issue of the New Shares is not subject to an underwriting agreement. The Capital Increase would be cancelled if the amount of subscriptions that the Company receives represents less than three-quarters of the decided issue.Section 4 – Key information on the offering of securities to the public and/or admitting them for trading on a regulated market4.1 Under what conditions and what schedule can I invest in this security?Structure of the issue – Capital increase with preferential subscription rights: the New Shares are issued by way of a share capital increase with preferential subscription rights in accordance with the twentieth resolution adopted by the combined shareholders’ meeting of 19 May 2021.Number of New Shares to be issued: 35 765 712 New Shares.Amount of the issue: the total amount of the issue  including the issue premium  is €489 990 254.40 (of which €203 864 558.40 par value and €286 125 696.00 issue premium)New Shares subscription price: €13.70 per New Share (i.e. €5.70 par value and €8.00 issue premium)  to be fully paid up at the time of subscription  by payment in cash.Based on the Voltalia share closing price on the trading day preceding the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF  i.e. €18.96: (i) the New Shares issue price of €13.70 shows a face-value discount of 27 74%  (ii) the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right amounts to €1.435  (iii) the theoretical value of the ex-rights share is €17.525  and (iv) the New Shares issue price shows a discount of 21.83% on the theoretical value of the ex-rights share.

This capital increase has subscription commitments of 72.95% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs from:Voltalia Investissement  Voltalia’s reference shareholder which is part of the companies’ portfolio held by the members of the Mulliez family  has undertaken to participate in the Rights Issue for a total amount of 345 million euros  representing 70.45% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRsProparco for a total amount of 12 million euros  representing 2.50% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs“After achieving an average annual growth of +48% in revenue and of +49% of its EBITDA between 2014  the year of its IPO  and 30th June 2022  Voltalia is on track to achieve all of its 2023 objectives – and should even reach a year in advance  at the end of 2022  its objective of capacity in operation and under construction of 2.6 gigawatts. The new roadmap unveiled on 20 October 2022 is based on continued strong growth in our performance indicators  both operationally  as well as financially and environmentally.Thus  by the end of 2027  we aim  on average  to triple these indicators compared to 2021 with more than 5 gigawatts of owned capacity (in operation and under construction)  more than 8 gigawatts of operating capacity on behalf of third parties and expected normalised EBITDA2 of around 475 million. euros. On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.In this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.” says Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company’s growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company’s presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the “New Shares”)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company’s shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022. Eight (8) PSRs will entitle their holders to subscribe for three (3) New Shares on an irreducible basis.Requests may be made on a redubicle basis to subscribe for additional shares. New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their reducible requests but are subject to reduction  in the event of oversubscription.On the basis of the closing price of the Voltalia share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on 14 November 2022  i.e. 18.96 euros  the theoretical value of one (1) PSR is 1.43 euros and the theoretical value of one share ex-rights is 17.53 euros.The subscription price per New Share represents a nominal discount of 27.74% to Voltalia’s closing price on the trading day before the date of the prospectus  i.e. 18.96 euros on the 14 November 2022  and a discount of 21.83% to the theoretical value of the Voltalia share ex-rights.These values do not necessarily reflect the value of the PSRs during their trading period  the value of Voltalia shares ex-rights or the implicit discounts  which will be determined by the market.The Capital Increase with PSRs will be open to the public only in France and outside the U.S. in the context of offshore transactions under Regulation S.Indicative timetable for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe subscription period for the Capital Increase with PSRs will start on 21 November 2022 and end at market close on 30 November 2022. The PSRs will be detached and tradeable from 17 November 2022 until 28 November 2022 included on the regulated market of Euronext Paris under the ISIN code FR001400DV53. Unexercised PSRs will automatically lapse at the end of the subscription period  i.e. 30 November 2022 at market close.The issue  settlement-delivery and admission to trading of the New Shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris are scheduled for 7 December 2022.

The Group’s target of 2.6 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  which it had planned to achieve by the end of 2023  will be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule. As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately €475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of €156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of €137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;of approximately €475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of €156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of €137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021; a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between €2.5 billion and €3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company’s securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group’s activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group’s main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group’s requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia’s activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia’s growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 – Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the “New Shares”) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the “Capital Increase”) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company’s existing shares (the Existing Shares).

The Capital Increase would be cancelled if the amount of subscriptions that the Company receives represents less than three-quarters of the decided issue.Section 4 – Key information on the offering of securities to the public and/or admitting them for trading on a regulated market4.1 Under what conditions and what schedule can I invest in this security?Structure of the issue – Capital increase with preferential subscription rights: the New Shares are issued by way of a share capital increase with preferential subscription rights in accordance with the twentieth resolution adopted by the combined shareholders’ meeting of 19 May 2021.Number of New Shares to be issued: 35 765 712 New Shares.Amount of the issue: the total amount of the issue  including the issue premium  is €489 990 254.40 (of which €203 864 558.40 par value and €286 125 696.00 issue premium)New Shares subscription price: €13.70 per New Share (i.e. €5.70 par value and €8.00 issue premium)  to be fully paid up at the time of subscription  by payment in cash.Based on the Voltalia share closing price on the trading day preceding the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF  i.e. €18.96: (i) the New Shares issue price of €13.70 shows a face-value discount of 27 74%  (ii) the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right amounts to €1.435  (iii) the theoretical value of the ex-rights share is €17.525  and (iv) the New Shares issue price shows a discount of 21.83% on the theoretical value of the ex-rights share.

URW has also formed a Green Financing Committee that will rule on the use of proceeds and support future green financing allocation.The Framework is aligned with best market practices  including the most recent updates of the ICMA Green Bond Principles as well as the LMA Green Loan Principles  while taking into account the EU Taxonomy Technical Screening Criteria. ISS ESG has issued a second party opinion (SPO) on the new Framework confirming this alignment.Commenting on the Framework  Fabrice Mouchel  Chief Financial Officer  URW  said: “Sustainability is embedded within our business strategy and these updates to our Green Financing Framework demonstrate our commitment to continue being a leader in this area. Our efforts are supported by our wide-ranging Better Places 2030 sustainability program  which also addresses priorities like climate change  biodiversity loss and social inclusion.”More information on the Framework can be found on URW’s website:https://www.urw.com/en/investors/financing-activity/Sustainable-financingStory continuesFor more information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39audrey.arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf – Finelk+44 7387 108 998cornelia.schnepf@finelk.euFrance:Nathalie Feld – Image7+33 6 30 47 18 37nfeld@image7.frUnited States:Molly Morse – Kekst CNC+1 212 521 4826molly.morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 80 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

We can build on strong operational performance  as we announced in our recent Q3 business update: we demonstrated continued strong growth of revenues in our core oncology business  coupled with the significant improvement of the gross margins of our Idylla™ products and a gradually reducing cash burn. From a financing point of view  the recapitalization as announced on 1 September 2022 will fundamentally improve our financial position. Having successfully executed the restructuring of our convertible debt in the past weeks  I am very pleased to now enter into the last stage of the refinancing with the launch of this EUR 25.1 million rights offering. Together with the new convertible term loan and the new convertible bond  this will provide for approximately EUR 66 million of gross proceeds  necessary to continue and execute our growth strategy towards profitability.""OfferingRationale of the OfferingThe Offering is part of the comprehensive recapitalization transactions that were announced by the Company on 1 September 2022 (the ""Recapitalization Transactions"")  and which were aimed at providing the Company with an opportunity to strengthen its cash position by approximately EUR 66 million (which would be the gross proceeds from the Recapitalization Transactions  including the Offering) and fundamentally improve its financial structure by extending the maturity of its bond debt from May 2024 to November 2026 (when the Company's new second lien secured convertible bonds (the ""New Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid) or November 2027 (when the Company's amended convertible bonds initially due 2024 (the ""Existing Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid)  subject to certain conditions.

This allows the Company to meet its undertaking towards the Lenders to raise new capital for an amount of not less than EUR 25 million.The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to fund operating losses resulting from operating expenses and investments required (i) to fund research and development for product menu expansion and further development of the Idylla™ technology  (ii) to further bolster commercial infrastructure  and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company.The OfferingSubject to applicable securities laws and on the terms set out in the Prospectus  each shareholder holding Shares of the Company at closing of Euronext Brussels on 16 November 2022 will be granted one Preferential Right per existing share in the Company held at that time.

If the Net Scrips Proceeds are less than EUR 0.01 per unexercised Preferential Right  the holders of Preferential Rights who have not exercised them are not entitled to receive any payment and  instead  the Net Scrips Proceeds will be transferred to the Company.

Biocartis may be unable to manage its growth effectively  and may not be successful in further growing its commercialization infrastructure.The molecular diagnostics (MDx) industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes  and Biocartis may be unable to keep pace with its competitors.The commercial success of Biocartis will depend on the continued growth in market acceptance of the Idylla™ platform  the menu of Idylla™ and partner tests it offers and the relevance thereof.Biocartis has entered into  and relies upon  a number of partnerships and alliances  including joint ventures  and the termination of such partnerships or alliances or disagreements with these partners  may have negative effects on Biocartis.Operational risksBiocartis may not be able to manufacture or outsource manufacturing of its products in sufficient quantities  in a timely manner or at a cost that is economically attractive.Delays in the development of tests may occur and cause a slower availability of a broad and clinically relevant menu of tests  which may result in increased costs and/or jeopardize Biocartis' ability to obtain market acceptance and/or relevant marketing authorizations in line with its strategy. Biocartis may not be able to launch new tests as quickly as it anticipates.Biocartis relies on multiple suppliers to produce the individual components required for its Idylla™ platform and Idylla™ tests  some of whom are single source suppliers  and any issues with suppliers may impact the ability of Biocartis to continue to supply its customers  lead to additional costs  or require additional managerial resources.Legal and intellectual property related risksBiocartis faces an inherent risk of product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance coverage.If Biocartis fails to obtain patent protection for the products it develops or otherwise fails to maintain and adequately protect its intellectual property rights  Biocartis' business could suffer.Regulatory risksBiocartis' business could be significantly and negatively affected by substantial changes to government regulations  particularly in the European Union  the United Kingdom and the United States.Financial risksBiocartis does not have sufficient working capital to fund its operations and development activities.Biocartis has incurred operating losses  negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit since inception and may never become profitable.Biocartis might require substantial additional funding to respond to business challenges  take advantage of new business opportunities or repay or refinance its outstanding convertible bonds  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all.Risks relating to the Offered Shares  the New Shares  the Preferential Rights  the Scrips  and the OfferingAny future capital increases by the Company (as the case may be  in the context of the Recapitalization Transactions) could have a negative impact on the price of the Shares and could dilute the interests of Existing Shareholders.The market price of the Shares may fluctuate widely in response to various factors and may decline below the Issue Price.ProspectusFull details of the Offering will be included in the prospectus that has been prepared in connection with the Offering (the ""Prospectus"").

This capital increase has subscription commitments of 72.95% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs from:Voltalia Investissement  Voltalia’s reference shareholder which is part of the companies’ portfolio held by the members of the Mulliez family  has undertaken to participate in the Rights Issue for a total amount of 345 million euros  representing 70.45% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRsProparco for a total amount of 12 million euros  representing 2.50% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs“After achieving an average annual growth of +48% in revenue and of +49% of its EBITDA between 2014  the year of its IPO  and 30th June 2022  Voltalia is on track to achieve all of its 2023 objectives – and should even reach a year in advance  at the end of 2022  its objective of capacity in operation and under construction of 2.6 gigawatts. The new roadmap unveiled on 20 October 2022 is based on continued strong growth in our performance indicators  both operationally  as well as financially and environmentally.Thus  by the end of 2027  we aim  on average  to triple these indicators compared to 2021 with more than 5 gigawatts of owned capacity (in operation and under construction)  more than 8 gigawatts of operating capacity on behalf of third parties and expected normalised EBITDA2 of around 475 million. euros. On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.Story continuesIn this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.” says Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company’s growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company’s presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the “New Shares”)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company’s shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022. Eight (8) PSRs will entitle their holders to subscribe for three (3) New Shares on an irreducible basis.Requests may be made on a redubicle basis to subscribe for additional shares. New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their reducible requests but are subject to reduction  in the event of oversubscription.On the basis of the closing price of the Voltalia share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on 14 November 2022  i.e. 18.96 euros  the theoretical value of one (1) PSR is 1.43 euros and the theoretical value of one share ex-rights is 17.53 euros.The subscription price per New Share represents a nominal discount of 27.74% to Voltalia’s closing price on the trading day before the date of the prospectus  i.e. 18.96 euros on the 14 November 2022  and a discount of 21.83% to the theoretical value of the Voltalia share ex-rights.These values do not necessarily reflect the value of the PSRs during their trading period  the value of Voltalia shares ex-rights or the implicit discounts  which will be determined by the market.The Capital Increase with PSRs will be open to the public only in France and outside the U.S. in the context of offshore transactions under Regulation S.Indicative timetable for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe subscription period for the Capital Increase with PSRs will start on 21 November 2022 and end at market close on 30 November 2022.

In 2021  Voltalia thus sold 4.1 TWh of renewable electricity. Voltalia also provides services: the development of new power plants  engineering and construction  and operations & maintenance of commissioned power plants and management of assets. Voltalia does this on its own behalf and that of third parties (investors  power plant owners  etc.). Voltalia is thus present throughout the power plant life cycle. A pioneer in the market for services to service and manufacturing companies  Voltalia offers a comprehensive range of services  including the supply of green electricity (PPA) as well as energy efficiency services and on-site decentralized production through its subsidiary Helexia. As of 30 June 2022  Voltalia had a capacity in operation and under construction of more than 2.1 GW. The Group has a portfolio of projects under development representing a total capacity of 13.6 GW as of 30 September 2022  of which more than 0.9 GW is secured by long-term electricity sales contracts.Share ownership as of the date of the ProspectusAs of 31 October 2022  the Company’s share capital amounted to €543 638 822.40  divided into 95 375 232 fully subscribed and paid-up ordinary shares with a par value of €5.70.

The Group’s target of 2.6 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  which it had planned to achieve by the end of 2023  will be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule. As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately €475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of €156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of €137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between €2.5 billion and €3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company’s securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group’s activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group’s main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group’s requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia’s activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia’s growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 – Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the “New Shares”) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the “Capital Increase”) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company’s existing shares (the Existing Shares).

Furthermore  as a result of its subscription commitment  Voltalia Investissement could see its stake in the Company’s share capital increase;the issue of the New Shares is not subject to an underwriting agreement. The Capital Increase would be cancelled if the amount of subscriptions that the Company receives represents less than three-quarters of the decided issue.Section 4 – Key information on the offering of securities to the public and/or admitting them for trading on a regulated market4.1 Under what conditions and what schedule can I invest in this security?Structure of the issue – Capital increase with preferential subscription rights: the New Shares are issued by way of a share capital increase with preferential subscription rights in accordance with the twentieth resolution adopted by the combined shareholders’ meeting of 19 May 2021.Number of New Shares to be issued: 35 765 712 New Shares.Amount of the issue: the total amount of the issue  including the issue premium  is €489 990 254.40 (of which €203 864 558.40 par value and €286 125 696.00 issue premium)New Shares subscription price: €13.70 per New Share (i.e. €5.70 par value and €8.00 issue premium)  to be fully paid up at the time of subscription  by payment in cash.Based on the Voltalia share closing price on the trading day preceding the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF  i.e. €18.96: (i) the New Shares issue price of €13.70 shows a face-value discount of 27 74%  (ii) the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right amounts to €1.435  (iii) the theoretical value of the ex-rights share is €17.525  and (iv) the New Shares issue price shows a discount of 21.83% on the theoretical value of the ex-rights share.

In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least €450 million of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company’s growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company’s presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity of more than 5.0 GW in operation or under construction as of the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase is not completed  the Company will study other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.Underwriting and placement: the Capital Increase will not be the subject of an underwriting agreement or guarantee agreement.

13308,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558400-royal-dsm-q3-results-good-organic-sales-inflation-impacting-earnings,Royal DSM Q3 Results: Good Organic Sales Growth  But Inflation Is Impacting Earnings,Royal DSM delivered solid sales growth for the third quarter. See why we believe Royal DSM to be in the ‘wonderful business at a fair price’ category.,"recep-bg/E+ via Getty ImagesWe have mixed feelings about Royal DSM's (OTCQX:RDSMY) third quarter results. The company did deliver very strong organic sales growth despite the challenging environment  but the adjusted EBITDA margin deteriorated significantly. As can be seen in the table below  most of the organic growth came from price increases as can be seen in the price/mix column. Overall growth was even stronger  thanks to foreign exchange effects  and the 'Other' increase relates to a small acquisition. Unfortunately  volume growth was extremely weak  varying from 0% to 3% depending on the business segment. At least volume did not go negative due to the price increases.Royal DSM Earnings ReleaseThe company also confirmed that the divestment of DSM Engineering Materials is on track  and should be completed soon. This should leave a transformed Royal DSM ready to merge with Firmenich next year. We were a little bit disappointed that more details were not shared with respect to the merger with Firmenich other than to say that ""good progress has been made to close the forthcoming merger with Firmenich"". As a reminder  the company has previously said they expected the merger to complete in the first half of 2023.Q3 2022 ResultsAdjusted EBITDA was up +6%  despite the adjusted EBITDA coming in lower compared to the previous year quarter. Sales grew significantly  including organic growth. The company reported that market demand remained resilient despite the challenging macro-economic environment. Energy and input costs accelerated in the quarter  especially in Europe. As a result full-year outlook 2022 was lowered  with Adjusted EBITDA expected to increase only by low single digits. The company says they remain confident in the mid-term financial targets they have shared.DSM-FirmenichRoyal DSM is expected to become a new company  called DSM-Firmenich  which will be domiciled in Switzerland. As part of the merger there will be a public offer for Royal DSM shares in exchange for DSM-Firmenich shares. At inception  Royal DSM's shareholders are expected to own 65.5% of DSM-Firmenich. Firmenich shareholders will also receive shares in DSM-Firmenich in exchange for their Firmenich shares  and also €3.5bn in cash. It is therefore expected that at inception the various shareholders of Firmenich will own in aggregate 34.5% of DSM-Firmenich. The new company is expected to have a Euronext Amsterdam listing  and completion of the merger is expected in the first half of 2023. There is an expected benefit of recurring run-rate pre-tax synergies of approximately €350m in Adj. EBITDA per year by 2026.So what is Royal DSM getting by merging with Firmenich? This is a family owned company with ~10 000 employees. It is one of the global leaders in perfumery and ingredients  with revenue of ~4.5 billion CHF growing at a CAGR of ~5%. It has roughly a 20% adjusted EBITDA margin despite investing heavily in R&D. It's R&D spend is about 9.3% of revenues.Royal DSM Investor PresentationAlthough perfumery and ingredients is the main business segment for Firmenich  it also has a significant business in food and taste. The slide below shows some of the applications of their products  which include plant-based foods and sugar reduction solutions. The company is bringing to market some very interesting products  including an Eco-friendly long-lasting fragrance for laundry. In general it is also helping to create healthier  great-tasting  affordable food & beverages with more natural and sustainable ingredients.Royal DSM Investor PresentationMerged FinancialsThe combined company is expected to have a leadership position across nutrition  beauty  and well-being. Royal DSM is about twice the size of Firmenich  with ~18 000 employees compared to the ~10 000 that Firmenich has. Royal DSM has about 12 000 patents  nearly three times as many compared to the ~4 000 at Firmenich. Royal DSM has 2021 sales of ~€7.3 billion  which is significantly more than the ~€4.2 billion in sales Firmenich had in 2021. When combined  the merged company is expected to have sales of ~€11.4 billion  growing at a ~5% organic growth rate  and with a pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €2.2 billion. The new company will be nicely diversified across its four key businesses.Royal DSM Investor PresentationAt the outset the company is expected to have ~20%+ Adj. EBITDA margins  with a medium-term outlook of 22-23%  supported by synergies. The company is targeting a Debt/EBITDA of ratio 1.5-2.5x over the medium term  and is committed to a strong investment grade credit rating.When considering synergies  the combined company is expected to have a €500 million annual sales uplift  especially from combining Royal DSM's Food & Beverage and Firmenich's Taste & Beyond businesses. If synergies are successfully delivered  this would increase total sales to ~€11.9 billion  and adjusted EBITDA to ~€2.6 billion. The synergies implementation cost is expected to be ~€250m.Royal DSM Investor PresentationValuationIt is difficult to value the company as it is not yet completely clear how the company will look post the Firmenich merger and disposition of the Materials business. Currently Royal DSM's market cap is ~€23 billion and its enterprise value is ~€25 billion  that means that once shares are issued for Firmenich the enterprise value should increase to more than €35 billion. If we ignore synergies  that would result in an EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiple of over 16x. With synergies  the valuation multiple should go down to ~14x. These are very rough estimates  as it is very hard to tell how exactly the business will look after the disposition of the Materials business and the merger with Firmenich.Given the quality of the business and the growth prospects  we view this valuation as reasonable  but far from being a bargain. We would put it in the ""wonderful business at a fair price"" pile. The combined company is expected to have a dividend payout ratio of 40-60% of adjusted earnings. This could mean a higher dividend  as the current dividend yield for Royal DSM is only ~2%.Data by YChartsRisksThere are several risks to consider with Royal DSM including the integration risk with Firmenich  and the continued impact inflation can have on earnings. In particular  energy costs in Europe have had a significant impact on profit margins  and it could get worse before things get better. These risks are mitigated by the fact that Royal DSM operated in relatively stable industries with attractive economics.ConclusionWe have mixed feelings about Royal DSM's third quarter results  with inflation and energy costs impacting profit margins more than we expected. The merger with Firmenich appears to be on track  as well as the sale of the Materials business.

13311,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atos-iqm-partner-quantum-simulation-130000685.html,Atos and IQM partner up in quantum simulation,QLM-machine Atos Quantum Learning Machine QLM IQM-Quantum-computer-image-opened-4 IQM Quantum Computer Paris  France –November 16  2022 – Atos and IQM today ...,"Atos InternationalQLM-machineAtos Quantum Learning Machine QLMIQM-Quantum-computer-image-opened-4IQM Quantum ComputerParis  France –November 16  2022 – Atos and IQM today announce the signature of a partnership to deliver end-to-end quantum computing technologies and capabilities  as part of the Group’s hybrid computing strategy. As the market is shifting to real-world quantum computing applications  this partnership will see the integration of IQM’s Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) into Atos’ QLM and  more globally  into Atos’ quantum application development platform.This unique proposition on the market enables customers to seamlessly program their Quantum Computing applications and run them on the QLM framework perfectly emulating all attributes of the target quantum hardware (topology  gate set  noise model). By doing so  customers could then directly execute these applications on real-world IQM Quantum Computing hardware without any need to modify them.Atos’ exascale strategy will use Artificial Intelligence technologies and quantum computing as accelerators in traditional HPC workflows  in order to achieve lower time to solution and a reduced energy footprint. To that end  supercomputers will use the Atos QLM quantum application development platform as a gateway to Quantum Computing resources (emulated or real hardware) in hybrid computing workflows. With an emulation capacity of up to 41 Qubits  Atos’ QLM Application programming Environment will help its customers to develop hybrid applications  using the gate  annealing and analog quantum computing paradigms  together with IQM QPU  offering 20 Qubits today and up to 50 Qubits committed by 2023.In 2020  IQM was selected to be part of Scaler  the Atos Accelerator program  starting the cooperation between Atos’ Quantum Computing R&D team and IQM labs to tightly couple the Atos QLM and the IQM’s range of QPUs  in order to provide optimum results to their joint customers.This long-term relationship has also fostered several research programs in Europe  with the most recent one between IQM  Leibniz Rechenzentrum (LRZ) and Atos  with the aim to boost supercomputers using hybrid scalar/quantum computing technologies  as part of Q-Exa project.Story continues“We are glad to reinforce our relationship with IQM to empower our customers with best-in-class quantum computing technologies to prepare the future.” said Emmanuel Le Roux  Group SVP  Global Head of HPC  AI & Quantum at Atos “At Atos we believe that hybrid platforms are the foundation stone of all future digital simulation  especially with the acceleration of quantum. With this partnership Atos will become a trusted Value Added Integrator of IQM with the capacity to not only sell and install IQM QPU’s at customers’ premises  but to integrate them into a more complex Hybrid Computing environment  which is in line with our Hybrid Computing strategy for exascale announced in February 2022 with the unveiling of our new BullSequana XH3000 supercomputer.”Dr. Jan Goetz  CEO and Co-founder of IQM Quantum Computers  commented “We are excited to strengthen our partnership with Atos and create this unique offering for our customers globally. This partnership is an important next step towards quantum readiness for the industry and we’re glad that Atos has selected IQM for this product offering. This is also an important milestone for the commercialization of quantum accelerators for supercomputing centers  and for our quantum computers to be sold globally.""The first quantum simulator available on the market as early as 2016 and already used in many countries worldwide (including Austria  Brazil  Finland  France  Germany  India  Japan  UK  United States) the Atos QLM enables researchers and engineers to develop applications and experiment with quantum software. The QLM combines an ultra-compact  highly powerful large memory system with a universal programming language meaning that quantum applications can be developed without the need for quantum hardware. This new collaboration finally allows users to unleash the full potential of their quantum algorithms by seamlessly transitioning to actual quantum hardware provided by IQM.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 112 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

One of the aims of the GENOPTAIRE project is to identify and assess the impact of biosourced components mixed with conventional aviation fuels on engine performance in land vehicles used by the French Army.Representatives of the DGA and Military Staff involved in the project issued the following statement: “The batch delivered by Global Bioenergies will be tested first by the project participants (IFPEN  ONERA and SEO) in combination with fossil kerosene for physico-chemical analysis. Subsequently  the Military Staff’s operational energy department (EMA/SEO) plans to conduct engine trials.”Marc Delcourt  CEO of Global Bioenergies said: “Having our products assessed by the French Army is a major step forward in our trajectory. We imagine that converting local feedstocks into both civil and military transportation fuels could be of strategic interest for the country.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

We can build on strong operational performance  as we announced in our recent Q3 business update: we demonstrated continued strong growth of revenues in our core oncology business  coupled with the significant improvement of the gross margins of our Idylla™ products and a gradually reducing cash burn. From a financing point of view  the recapitalization as announced on 1 September 2022 will fundamentally improve our financial position. Having successfully executed the restructuring of our convertible debt in the past weeks  I am very pleased to now enter into the last stage of the refinancing with the launch of this EUR 25.1 million rights offering. Together with the new convertible term loan and the new convertible bond  this will provide for approximately EUR 66 million of gross proceeds  necessary to continue and execute our growth strategy towards profitability.""OfferingRationale of the OfferingThe Offering is part of the comprehensive recapitalization transactions that were announced by the Company on 1 September 2022 (the ""Recapitalization Transactions"")  and which were aimed at providing the Company with an opportunity to strengthen its cash position by approximately EUR 66 million (which would be the gross proceeds from the Recapitalization Transactions  including the Offering) and fundamentally improve its financial structure by extending the maturity of its bond debt from May 2024 to November 2026 (when the Company's new second lien secured convertible bonds (the ""New Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid) or November 2027 (when the Company's amended convertible bonds initially due 2024 (the ""Existing Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid)  subject to certain conditions.

This allows the Company to meet its undertaking towards the Lenders to raise new capital for an amount of not less than EUR 25 million.The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to fund operating losses resulting from operating expenses and investments required (i) to fund research and development for product menu expansion and further development of the Idylla™ technology  (ii) to further bolster commercial infrastructure  and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company.The OfferingSubject to applicable securities laws and on the terms set out in the Prospectus  each shareholder holding Shares of the Company at closing of Euronext Brussels on 16 November 2022 will be granted one Preferential Right per existing share in the Company held at that time.

The Scrips will be offered for sale through the Scrips Private Placement that is expected to start on or about 29 November 2022 and to end on the same date. Through such a procedure  a book of demand will be built to find a single market price for the Scrips. The net proceeds of the sale of the Scrips (the ""Net Scrips Proceeds"") (if any) will be divided proportionally between all holders of Preferential Rights who have not exercised them. If the Net Scrips Proceeds are less than EUR 0.01 per unexercised Preferential Right  the holders of Preferential Rights who have not exercised them are not entitled to receive any payment and  instead  the Net Scrips Proceeds will be transferred to the Company. If the Company announces that Net Scrips Proceeds are available for distribution to holders of unexercised Preferential Rights and such holders have not received payment thereof by 5 December 2022  such holders should contact their financial intermediaries (note: registered shareholders should contact the Company).Admission to trading and place of listing of the Offered Shares: expected on 2 December 2022 on Euronext Brussels.Announcement of the results: The results of the Rights Offering  including the subscriptions to the Offered Shares  will be made public by a press release before the market opening on or about 29 November 2022.

Biocartis may be unable to manage its growth effectively  and may not be successful in further growing its commercialization infrastructure.The molecular diagnostics (MDx) industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes  and Biocartis may be unable to keep pace with its competitors.The commercial success of Biocartis will depend on the continued growth in market acceptance of the Idylla™ platform  the menu of Idylla™ and partner tests it offers and the relevance thereof.Biocartis has entered into  and relies upon  a number of partnerships and alliances  including joint ventures  and the termination of such partnerships or alliances or disagreements with these partners  may have negative effects on Biocartis.Operational risksBiocartis may not be able to manufacture or outsource manufacturing of its products in sufficient quantities  in a timely manner or at a cost that is economically attractive.Delays in the development of tests may occur and cause a slower availability of a broad and clinically relevant menu of tests  which may result in increased costs and/or jeopardize Biocartis' ability to obtain market acceptance and/or relevant marketing authorizations in line with its strategy. Biocartis may not be able to launch new tests as quickly as it anticipates.Biocartis relies on multiple suppliers to produce the individual components required for its Idylla™ platform and Idylla™ tests  some of whom are single source suppliers  and any issues with suppliers may impact the ability of Biocartis to continue to supply its customers  lead to additional costs  or require additional managerial resources.Legal and intellectual property related risksBiocartis faces an inherent risk of product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance coverage.If Biocartis fails to obtain patent protection for the products it develops or otherwise fails to maintain and adequately protect its intellectual property rights  Biocartis' business could suffer.Regulatory risksBiocartis' business could be significantly and negatively affected by substantial changes to government regulations  particularly in the European Union  the United Kingdom and the United States.Financial risksBiocartis does not have sufficient working capital to fund its operations and development activities.Biocartis has incurred operating losses  negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit since inception and may never become profitable.Biocartis might require substantial additional funding to respond to business challenges  take advantage of new business opportunities or repay or refinance its outstanding convertible bonds  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all.Risks relating to the Offered Shares  the New Shares  the Preferential Rights  the Scrips  and the OfferingAny future capital increases by the Company (as the case may be  in the context of the Recapitalization Transactions) could have a negative impact on the price of the Shares and could dilute the interests of Existing Shareholders.The market price of the Shares may fluctuate widely in response to various factors and may decline below the Issue Price.ProspectusFull details of the Offering will be included in the prospectus that has been prepared in connection with the Offering (the ""Prospectus"").

This capital increase has subscription commitments of 72.95% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs from:Voltalia Investissement  Voltalia’s reference shareholder which is part of the companies’ portfolio held by the members of the Mulliez family  has undertaken to participate in the Rights Issue for a total amount of 345 million euros  representing 70.45% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRsProparco for a total amount of 12 million euros  representing 2.50% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs“After achieving an average annual growth of +48% in revenue and of +49% of its EBITDA between 2014  the year of its IPO  and 30th June 2022  Voltalia is on track to achieve all of its 2023 objectives – and should even reach a year in advance  at the end of 2022  its objective of capacity in operation and under construction of 2.6 gigawatts. The new roadmap unveiled on 20 October 2022 is based on continued strong growth in our performance indicators  both operationally  as well as financially and environmentally.Thus  by the end of 2027  we aim  on average  to triple these indicators compared to 2021 with more than 5 gigawatts of owned capacity (in operation and under construction)  more than 8 gigawatts of operating capacity on behalf of third parties and expected normalised EBITDA2 of around 475 million. euros. On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.In this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.” says Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company’s growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company’s presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the “New Shares”)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company’s shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022.

New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their reducible requests but are subject to reduction  in the event of oversubscription.On the basis of the closing price of the Voltalia share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on 14 November 2022  i.e. 18.96 euros  the theoretical value of one (1) PSR is 1.43 euros and the theoretical value of one share ex-rights is 17.53 euros.The subscription price per New Share represents a nominal discount of 27.74% to Voltalia’s closing price on the trading day before the date of the prospectus  i.e. 18.96 euros on the 14 November 2022  and a discount of 21.83% to the theoretical value of the Voltalia share ex-rights.These values do not necessarily reflect the value of the PSRs during their trading period  the value of Voltalia shares ex-rights or the implicit discounts  which will be determined by the market.The Capital Increase with PSRs will be open to the public only in France and outside the U.S. in the context of offshore transactions under Regulation S.Indicative timetable for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe subscription period for the Capital Increase with PSRs will start on 21 November 2022 and end at market close on 30 November 2022.

The Group’s target of 2.6 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  which it had planned to achieve by the end of 2023  will be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule. As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately €475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of €156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of €137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;of approximately €475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of €156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of €137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021; a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between €2.5 billion and €3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company’s securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group’s activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group’s main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group’s requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia’s activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia’s growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 – Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the “New Shares”) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the “Capital Increase”) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company’s existing shares (the Existing Shares).

These shifts …,The past few years triggered a significant reality check in society. People looked inward to decide what they really needed and why — questioning the relevancy of existing habits  beliefs  and behaviors regarding self  community  and the planet. These shifts and nuances in mindset and the diverging individual responses to these inquiries have created a collective transformative force which impacts society. We take a closer look at these changes and their intricacies and where we believe they create opportunities for the hospitality industry.#1 The Hybrid Way of LifeThe acceleration of digital over the past few years  transforming how people work and live  coupled with more time to reflect during the pandemic  has led people to reexamine their lifestyles. They want to live  play  work  socialize and buy on their own terms  with an increasing desire for flexibility and freedom to seamlessly connect all aspects in their life. The shift impacts where people want to live  the quest for a better work-life balance and a desire for more meaning overall. And it creates a change in how people want to work. As much as they love the ability to work from anywhere (73% of workers across 31 countries want flexible remote work options1)  they feel at the same time the irrepressible need to interact (47% of workers miss social interactions with colleagues and associates2). Those seemingly opposing ideas result in the growing desire for flexibility and multi-purpose in all domains.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?REIMAGINING HOSPITALITY SPACESAs living shifts  the concept of one place equals one usage needs to evolve. We simply cannot see spaces from the same lens. Offices  malls  hotels  meeting venues  etc. — all potential spaces where we spend time — can be flexible and multi-purpose.Residential spaces : the desire for more flexibility and freedom increases the demand for private spaces  whether to adapt to longer stays or to specific needs and moments. We see residential offerings rising (branded residences  villas  apartments…) combined with the valued traditional services and shared moments of hospitality (F&B  spas  events…).: the desire for more flexibility and freedom increases the demand for private spaces  whether to adapt to longer stays or to specific needs and moments. We see residential offerings rising (branded residences  villas  apartments…) combined with the valued traditional services and shared moments of hospitality (F&B  spas  events…). Spaces as multi-purpose living hubs: whether for family members needing a large space to gather together or surrounding communities to meet  greet  and work  spaces need to seamlessly adapt to versatile needs.REIMAGINING HOSPITALITY LIVINGAs they move and change ideas rapidly  people demand flexibility in hotel living. This is why the previous thinking in hospitality that one stay equals only one need is over. It can become multiple stays with multiple purposes.

As individuals have become more aware of the notion  they have come to the realization that well-being is more of a holistic process entailing body  mind  and living habits (77% of all consumers take steps in daily life to stay healthy  such as eating with moderation  getting exercise  managing stress….4). But the notion has moved even beyond the perimeter of personal health to encompass social life  working conditions  home characteristics  and urban way of living. Everything in society contributes to creating a culture of well-being  from entrepreneurship and organization to finance and technology. And individuals ask companies  governments  and institutions to help them incorporate well-being holistically into every moment in their life to satisfy these new interests and needs.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?ADDRESSING HOLISTIC WELL-BEINGWhile spas and fitness centers have long been part of hospitality  they catered mainly to physical wellness. Growing expectations for holistic well-being throughout the guest journey compels us to enhance guest experiences with a wider spectrum of possibilities  encompassing emotional well-being  nutrition  mental health  and more.Becoming mindful : much less explored territory  mental well-being can be a new area to explore  as it gains attention from guests. Whether through activities or with retreat concepts  adding mindfulness  meditation  creative expression  and personal education to local culture can nourish mental health.: much less explored territory  mental well-being can be a new area to explore  as it gains attention from guests. Whether through activities or with retreat concepts  adding mindfulness  meditation  creative expression  and personal education to local culture can nourish mental health. Holistic stays: with well-being becoming holistic and not restricted to specific hospitality functions  it can reach throughout the entire stay. From contact with preserved natural surroundings to the mastering of air and noise pollution  from the services which simplify daily burdens to the quality of food and attention to nutrition  the task is huge yet exhilarating  and will be very rewarding for brands and hotels which address well-being holistically.EXPANDING THE WAY WE MANAGEEverything from job satisfaction to economic independence is becoming part of well-being  including the way to run a business and to engage with team members  creating opportunities such as:Well-being at work : being well-being natives  new generations are looking for companies which share their values and support their commitment in well-being through all means possible  from working conditions on and off-site and the respect of work-life balance  to career paths and entrepreneurship opportunities.: being well-being natives  new generations are looking for companies which share their values and support their commitment in well-being through all means possible  from working conditions on and off-site and the respect of work-life balance  to career paths and entrepreneurship opportunities. Beyond traditional management: the next step in holistic well-being at work is to give purpose to everyone’s daily contributions. Acting responsibly  respecting individuals  connecting people  and giving back defines how hospitality can create  step by step  a well-being society.Discover some of Accor’s latest initiatives on well-being:#3 The New Community BoundariesWith people staying closer to home  the local community has gained even more prominence in everyone’s mindset. People want to act more to protect  interact with  and support their community. For example  a study in the UK has shown that 45% of individuals state they want to focus more on supporting each other and good neighborliness5. For them  taking care of their local community is as important in a sustainable perspective as it is for economic impact. This could have led to a decline in travel — particularly internationally — however  a different result is taking place. While people are incredibly committed to their local community  they still want to travel. Hence the rising appeal of trips abroad to Europeans and Americans (an increase of 13 pts and 11 pts respectively – as compared to 20196). But they seek to immerse themselves in the destination to have more deeply authentic experiences when they travel. What we see is that care for local communities is expanding from your own to the ones at the other end of the world. This is promising for hospitality provided the industry pivots to seize the prospects offered by this new mindset.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?BELONGING TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITYWhile hotels have traditionally been seen as primarily for out-of-town guests  this increased focus on local community and care presents the opportunity for properties to build greater connection to place where they do business:A second home for the local community : as people’s lives are more centered around their immediate community  the need for locals-dedicated spaces and services increase. Hotels can adapt to a variety of community-based needs such as community activities or family and friends gatherings while ensuring the usual hospitality services such as food and beverage also appeal to locals. As travelers seek connection to destinations  becoming the hub of local community life could ensure the double satisfaction of locals and visitors alike.: as people’s lives are more centered around their immediate community  the need for locals-dedicated spaces and services increase. Hotels can adapt to a variety of community-based needs such as community activities or family and friends gatherings while ensuring the usual hospitality services such as food and beverage also appeal to locals. As travelers seek connection to destinations  becoming the hub of local community life could ensure the double satisfaction of locals and visitors alike. Supporting the community economy: hospitality is one of the most powerful multipliers of the local economic life (on average  one job in a hotel supports four jobs in the local economy). Hotels have the opportunity to reinforce their role as an active local force  creating community outreach programs for Talent  developing neighborhood suppliers sourcing…and advertising it to guests interested in discovering the hotel’s close network.ENVISIONING COMMUNITY-CENTRIC TOURISMFeeding into people’s desire to support and be a part of the local community — no matter where they roam — travel has the potential to promote community-centric tourism and sustainability efforts to preserve what originally made that destination something people from around the world want to see.Protecting local communities : COVID opened people’s eyes to the impact of over-tourism and under-tourism. Contributing to the protection of destinations and enhancing new destinations in a controlled way helps preserve while developing. Along with guests  hospitality has a role to play in participating in neighborhood sustainability actions  from replanting coral and conserving natural resources and engaging with inhabitants who stand up for their culture.: COVID opened people’s eyes to the impact of over-tourism and under-tourism. Contributing to the protection of destinations and enhancing new destinations in a controlled way helps preserve while developing. Along with guests  hospitality has a role to play in participating in neighborhood sustainability actions  from replanting coral and conserving natural resources and engaging with inhabitants who stand up for their culture. Discovering the people behind the destinations: guests want to discover destinations where they can see and learn about local culture  habits  and ways of living. Through tailored activities and encounters with local artisans  hospitality can become the ambassador of its local communities.Accor has explored some of these opportunities through several initiatives. Discover three below:#4 The Consumption ParadoxConsumers are still consuming  but there has been a shift in the whys  hows  and ways in which they buy. An exclusive Accor research identified that for 48% of respondents ethics matters in their interactions  but at the same time  55% admit they would compromise if it is more convenient7. Where do these seemingly opposed viewpoints lead us? More aware of the impact of their consumption  people are  in fact  more aware when they buy. They spend more time thinking about how and why they will make a purchase  disrupting their daily routine with more meaningful actions in a smarter way. But their conscious consumption doesn’t always guarantee a sustainable or ethical choice. They work hard to find a balance between needs and desires and between values and convenience. The needle is indeed moving with regard to the manner of consumption  and the hospitality industry has opportunities to bring smarter and meaningful ways to purchase.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?INVENTING SMARTER SELLING TOOLS WHICH ARE ALSO MORE RESPONSIBLEAs individuals continue to put their wants and desires front and center  brands can set themselves apart by feeding the need for more flexible purchase options  allowing consumers at the same time to control their consumption.Alternative buying systems: airlines are leading the way in testing alternative smarter buying tools  in tune with today’s consumption practices  such as pre-purchase and monthly subscriptions  enabling individuals to buy what they want  when they want  and how they want. This favors more responsible and mindful purchases  avoiding waste and compulsive consumption.INTEGRATING CONSCIOUS CONSUMPTIONThe growing concern for people and planet has caused an increase in conscious consumption. In fact  85% of people indicate they are prepared to rethink the way they live and spend to tackle climate change8. As a result  we are seeing greater shifts toward conscious consumption and making it easier to do so  including:Sustainable travel options : Following the consumer’s desire to consciously act  search and booking engines can make it easier for clients to make sustainable travel choices  with structured sustainability criteria  certifications  and labels in online reservations as well as even carbon calculators. Demonstrating participation in sustainability and making it convenient for clients becomes a must-have in hospitality which will directly impact consumer choice and business.: Following the consumer’s desire to consciously act  search and booking engines can make it easier for clients to make sustainable travel choices  with structured sustainability criteria  certifications  and labels in online reservations as well as even carbon calculators. Demonstrating participation in sustainability and making it convenient for clients becomes a must-have in hospitality which will directly impact consumer choice and business. Sustainable sourcing: as consumers are questioning all aspects in their purchase  sourcing becomes even more central for hotels  especially food and beverage sourcing. Numerous food and beverage industry professionals have put in place a more sustainable approach and are making it easier for all stakeholders to make sustainable choices  as is evidenced by labels for responsible fishing  transparency on supply chains (from production to preparation)  sea to table networks…). This is the basis of a responsible approach to food: smarter  more responsible  and healthier.Discover some of Accor’s initiatives in this area below:Sources:1 The World Trade Index conducted by Edelman Data x Intelligence for Microsoft  among 31.092 full-time employed or self-employed workers across 31 markets - January 20212 Foresight Factory3 Accor study conducted in 2021 among 5 000 people in 7 countries in the employed population that could work fully or partially remotely4 Foresight Factory in WBWP5 The National Lottery Community Fund – UK research January 2021 - survey of over 7 000 UK adults across the UK 6 IPSOS holiday barometer 2022 https://www.ipsos.com/en/holiday-barometer-2022 7 Study conducted by Accor in 2022 among 15 000+ travelers in 7 countries8 Trend Report 2021 – Regeneration Rising - Wunderman Thompson IntelligenceAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Nov. 16  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ossia Inc.  the company behind FCC-approved Cota® Real Wireless Power™ — the patented technology that delivers power over-the-air  at a distance  and without the need for line-of-sight — today announced that the company  in partnership with ARCHOS  has won their 6th CES Innovation Award. The ARCHOS home security camera Powered by Cota was honored with the 2023 CES Award in Smart Home category.The ARCHOS Cota Wireless Power Security Camera is the world's first wirelessly powered security system. The partnership between ARCHOS and Ossia began in 2021  when both companies announced working together to bring wirelessly powered products to consumers in the next couple of years.Ossia is leading the way in radio frequency (RF)-based wireless power. Its patented wireless power transfer system  Cota  is the only technology authorized by the U.S. FCC and more than 60 other countries to deliver wireless power over-the-air  without limitations on distance or the need for line-of-sight.ARCHOS is dedicated to innovating and revolutionizing the portable consumer electronics market. Adding wireless power technology to their consumer products is part of their strategic business plans.The ARCHOS Cota Camera uses ARCHOS video camera technology and pairs it with Ossia's Cota Real Wireless Power to enable a reliable security system that does not require battery replacement or wiring. Equipped with human-detecting AI  night vision  audio recording  and an auto-alarm  the ARCHOS Cota camera can be mounted anywhere—no wiring or battery swaps are needed. It comes with a Cota transmitter that plugs into a wall outlet and continuously charges up to five cameras within a 30-foot range of the Ossia transmitter. Homeowners can monitor power levels and camera footage from a mobile app. This is a seamless user experience that requires no management. An event captured on the security camera can trigger the camera app with nothing extra to download.""The ARCHOS Cota Wireless Power Security Camera is a first for consumers. It's not only the first wirelessly powered home security camera  but it's also the first commercially available wirelessly powered product "" said Doug Stovall  CEO of Ossia. ""Previously  Cota-enabled products have been leveraged by enterprises  like big box retail stores. The ARCHOS Cota Camera is designed to be the world's easiest security system for homeowners to install  maintain  and use. In ten years  we believe it will be remembered for leading the Internet of Things (IoT) space toward sustainability.""""We have dreamed to have our IoT devices at home seamlessly powered. This is going to be true innovation in the market. Thanks to Ossia and the Cota Technology  we are excited to launch a truly wireless camera that will always be charged."" said Loïc Poirier  CEO of ARCHOS.Current home security cameras have several challenges  including:Requiring expensive wiring or unsightly long cord that fixes cameras in specific locationsNeeding frequent battery changes or taken down for wired charging  often at great expense and inopportune times  like while on vacationNot being easily accessible once installed  making it difficult to change the batteriesIf the cameras are accessible  then they can be easily tampered withThe ARCHOS Cota security camera solves all of these challenges. Once installed  homeowners no longer need to worry about whether or not the cameras have sufficient power. Because they are Cota-enabled  they will have continuous wireless power delivered when they need it  and the whole system can be managed remotely.Just like Wi-Fi  Cota transmits power through glass  sheet rock  and wood (though not brick or cement). This product is meant to be an indoor security system.Cota's engineering qualities make the ARCHOS Cota camera convenient and secure while eliminating the cost of wiring and waste of battery-only systems. The wirelessly powered security cameras are scheduled to begin shipping in April 2023.About OssiaOssia Inc. is leading the world on what is possible with wireless power.
