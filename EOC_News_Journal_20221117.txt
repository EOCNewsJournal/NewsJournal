This capital increase has subscription commitments of 72.95% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs from:Voltalia Investissement  Voltalia‚Äôs reference shareholder which is part of the companies‚Äô portfolio held by the members of the Mulliez family  has undertaken to participate in the Rights Issue for a total amount of 345 million euros  representing 70.45% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRsProparco for a total amount of 12 million euros  representing 2.50% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs‚ÄúAfter achieving an average annual growth of +48% in revenue and of +49% of its EBITDA between 2014  the year of its IPO  and 30th June 2022  Voltalia is on track to achieve all of its 2023 objectives ‚Äì and should even reach a year in advance  at the end of 2022  its objective of capacity in operation and under construction of 2.6 gigawatts. The new roadmap unveiled on 20 October 2022 is based on continued strong growth in our performance indicators  both operationally  as well as financially and environmentally.Thus  by the end of 2027  we aim  on average  to triple these indicators compared to 2021 with more than 5 gigawatts of owned capacity (in operation and under construction)  more than 8 gigawatts of operating capacity on behalf of third parties and expected normalised EBITDA2 of around 475 million. euros. On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.Story continuesIn this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.‚Äù says S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company‚Äôs growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company‚Äôs presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company‚Äôs shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022.

New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their reducible requests but are subject to reduction  in the event of oversubscription.On the basis of the closing price of the Voltalia share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on 14 November 2022  i.e. 18.96 euros  the theoretical value of one (1) PSR is 1.43 euros and the theoretical value of one share ex-rights is 17.53 euros.The subscription price per New Share represents a nominal discount of 27.74% to Voltalia‚Äôs closing price on the trading day before the date of the prospectus  i.e. 18.96 euros on the 14 November 2022  and a discount of 21.83% to the theoretical value of the Voltalia share ex-rights.These values do not necessarily reflect the value of the PSRs during their trading period  the value of Voltalia shares ex-rights or the implicit discounts  which will be determined by the market.The Capital Increase with PSRs will be open to the public only in France and outside the U.S. in the context of offshore transactions under Regulation S.Indicative timetable for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe subscription period for the Capital Increase with PSRs will start on 21 November 2022 and end at market close on 30 November 2022.

The Group‚Äôs target of 2.6 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  which it had planned to achieve by the end of 2023  will be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule. As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between ‚Ç¨2.5 billion and ‚Ç¨3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company‚Äôs securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group‚Äôs activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group‚Äôs main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group‚Äôs requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia‚Äôs activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia‚Äôs growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 ‚Äì Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the ‚ÄúCapital Increase‚Äù) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (‚ÄúEuronext Paris‚Äù) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company‚Äôs existing shares (the Existing Shares).

Furthermore  as a result of its subscription commitment  Voltalia Investissement could see its stake in the Company‚Äôs share capital increase;the issue of the New Shares is not subject to an underwriting agreement. The Capital Increase would be cancelled if the amount of subscriptions that the Company receives represents less than three-quarters of the decided issue.Section 4 ‚Äì Key information on the offering of securities to the public and/or admitting them for trading on a regulated market4.1 Under what conditions and what schedule can I invest in this security?Structure of the issue ‚Äì Capital increase with preferential subscription rights: the New Shares are issued by way of a share capital increase with preferential subscription rights in accordance with the twentieth resolution adopted by the combined shareholders‚Äô meeting of 19 May 2021.Number of New Shares to be issued: 35 765 712 New Shares.Amount of the issue: the total amount of the issue  including the issue premium  is ‚Ç¨489 990 254.40 (of which ‚Ç¨203 864 558.40 par value and ‚Ç¨286 125 696.00 issue premium)New Shares subscription price: ‚Ç¨13.70 per New Share (i.e. ‚Ç¨5.70 par value and ‚Ç¨8.00 issue premium)  to be fully paid up at the time of subscription  by payment in cash.Based on the Voltalia share closing price on the trading day preceding the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF  i.e. ‚Ç¨18.96: (i) the New Shares issue price of ‚Ç¨13.70 shows a face-value discount of 27 74%  (ii) the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right amounts to ‚Ç¨1.435  (iii) the theoretical value of the ex-rights share is ‚Ç¨17.525  and (iv) the New Shares issue price shows a discount of 21.83% on the theoretical value of the ex-rights share.

The new roadmap unveiled on 20 October 2022 is based on continued strong growth in our performance indicators  both operationally  as well as financially and environmentally.Thus  by the end of 2027  we aim  on average  to triple these indicators compared to 2021 with more than 5 gigawatts of owned capacity (in operation and under construction)  more than 8 gigawatts of operating capacity on behalf of third parties and expected normalised EBITDA2 of around 475 million. euros. On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.In this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.‚Äù says S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company‚Äôs growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company‚Äôs presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company‚Äôs shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022. Eight (8) PSRs will entitle their holders to subscribe for three (3) New Shares on an irreducible basis.Requests may be made on a redubicle basis to subscribe for additional shares. New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their reducible requests but are subject to reduction  in the event of oversubscription.On the basis of the closing price of the Voltalia share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on 14 November 2022  i.e. 18.96 euros  the theoretical value of one (1) PSR is 1.43 euros and the theoretical value of one share ex-rights is 17.53 euros.The subscription price per New Share represents a nominal discount of 27.74% to Voltalia‚Äôs closing price on the trading day before the date of the prospectus  i.e. 18.96 euros on the 14 November 2022  and a discount of 21.83% to the theoretical value of the Voltalia share ex-rights.These values do not necessarily reflect the value of the PSRs during their trading period  the value of Voltalia shares ex-rights or the implicit discounts  which will be determined by the market.The Capital Increase with PSRs will be open to the public only in France and outside the U.S. in the context of offshore transactions under Regulation S.Indicative timetable for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe subscription period for the Capital Increase with PSRs will start on 21 November 2022 and end at market close on 30 November 2022.

They give you priority to subscribe for New Shares on an irreducible basis in accordance with the ratio of 3 New Shares for 8 PSRs (1 existing share giving right to 1 PSR).Either you have an exact and sufficient number of existing shares to be able to subscribe via your PSRs for a round number of New Shares (for example  if you have 8 Voltalia shares  you have the right to make a priority subscription for 3 New Shares) Or you do not have enough existing shares to obtain a round number of New Shares  in which case you can buy or sell the number of PSRs needed to reach the ratio giving you the right to subscribe for a round number of New Shares (3 New Shares for 8 PSR).You may also subscribe on a reducible basis for the number of New Shares you wish to purchase  in addition to the number of New Shares resulting from the exercise of your PSRs on an irreducible basis. Any New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their requests. Subscription orders on a reducible basis will be granted within the limit of requests and in proportion to the number of PSRs used for subscription on an irreducible basis  without the possibility of an allocation of fractions of New Shares.

As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;of approximately ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021; a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between ‚Ç¨2.5 billion and ‚Ç¨3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company‚Äôs securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group‚Äôs activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group‚Äôs main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group‚Äôs requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia‚Äôs activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia‚Äôs growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 ‚Äì Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the ‚ÄúCapital Increase‚Äù) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (‚ÄúEuronext Paris‚Äù) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company‚Äôs existing shares (the Existing Shares).

The Capital Increase would be cancelled if the amount of subscriptions that the Company receives represents less than three-quarters of the decided issue.Section 4 ‚Äì Key information on the offering of securities to the public and/or admitting them for trading on a regulated market4.1 Under what conditions and what schedule can I invest in this security?Structure of the issue ‚Äì Capital increase with preferential subscription rights: the New Shares are issued by way of a share capital increase with preferential subscription rights in accordance with the twentieth resolution adopted by the combined shareholders‚Äô meeting of 19 May 2021.Number of New Shares to be issued: 35 765 712 New Shares.Amount of the issue: the total amount of the issue  including the issue premium  is ‚Ç¨489 990 254.40 (of which ‚Ç¨203 864 558.40 par value and ‚Ç¨286 125 696.00 issue premium)New Shares subscription price: ‚Ç¨13.70 per New Share (i.e. ‚Ç¨5.70 par value and ‚Ç¨8.00 issue premium)  to be fully paid up at the time of subscription  by payment in cash.Based on the Voltalia share closing price on the trading day preceding the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF  i.e. ‚Ç¨18.96: (i) the New Shares issue price of ‚Ç¨13.70 shows a face-value discount of 27 74%  (ii) the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right amounts to ‚Ç¨1.435  (iii) the theoretical value of the ex-rights share is ‚Ç¨17.525  and (iv) the New Shares issue price shows a discount of 21.83% on the theoretical value of the ex-rights share.

URW has also formed a Green Financing Committee that will rule on the use of proceeds and support future green financing allocation.The Framework is aligned with best market practices  including the most recent updates of the ICMA Green Bond Principles as well as the LMA Green Loan Principles  while taking into account the EU Taxonomy Technical Screening Criteria. ISS ESG has issued a second party opinion (SPO) on the new Framework confirming this alignment.Commenting on the Framework  Fabrice Mouchel  Chief Financial Officer  URW  said: ‚ÄúSustainability is embedded within our business strategy and these updates to our Green Financing Framework demonstrate our commitment to continue being a leader in this area. Our efforts are supported by our wide-ranging Better Places 2030 sustainability program  which also addresses priorities like climate change  biodiversity loss and social inclusion.‚ÄùMore information on the Framework can be found on URW‚Äôs website:https://www.urw.com/en/investors/financing-activity/Sustainable-financingStory continuesFor more information  please contact:Investor RelationsAudrey Arnoux+33 6 61 27 07 39audrey.arnoux@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf ‚Äì Finelk+44 7387 108 998cornelia.schnepf@finelk.euFrance:Nathalie Feld ‚Äì Image7+33 6 30 47 18 37nfeld@image7.frUnited States:Molly Morse ‚Äì Kekst CNC+1 212 521 4826molly.morse@kekstcnc.comAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 80 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

Preferential Rights that are not exercised during the rights subscription period (the ""Rights Subscription Period"") will be converted into an equal number of scrips (the ""Scrips"") and will be offered up for sale through a private placement to institutional investors (the ""Scrips Private Placement"" and together with the Rights Offering  the ""Offering"").Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ""The launch of a rights offering today is a next important step in Biocartis' journey. We can build on strong operational performance  as we announced in our recent Q3 business update: we demonstrated continued strong growth of revenues in our core oncology business  coupled with the significant improvement of the gross margins of our Idylla‚Ñ¢ products and a gradually reducing cash burn. From a financing point of view  the recapitalization as announced on 1 September 2022 will fundamentally improve our financial position. Having successfully executed the restructuring of our convertible debt in the past weeks  I am very pleased to now enter into the last stage of the refinancing with the launch of this EUR 25.1 million rights offering. Together with the new convertible term loan and the new convertible bond  this will provide for approximately EUR 66 million of gross proceeds  necessary to continue and execute our growth strategy towards profitability.""OfferingRationale of the OfferingThe Offering is part of the comprehensive recapitalization transactions that were announced by the Company on 1 September 2022 (the ""Recapitalization Transactions"")  and which were aimed at providing the Company with an opportunity to strengthen its cash position by approximately EUR 66 million (which would be the gross proceeds from the Recapitalization Transactions  including the Offering) and fundamentally improve its financial structure by extending the maturity of its bond debt from May 2024 to November 2026 (when the Company's new second lien secured convertible bonds (the ""New Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid) or November 2027 (when the Company's amended convertible bonds initially due 2024 (the ""Existing Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid)  subject to certain conditions. The Offering was specifically requested by certain funds and accounts managed or advised by Highbridge Capital Management LLC (""Highbridge"")  and certain funds managed or advised by Whitebox Advisors LLC (collectively  ""Whitebox""  and together with Highbridge  the ""Lenders"") (who held existing convertible bonds) as a condition for the renegotiation of the terms of the existing convertible bonds and the entering into the new secured loan agreement that was announced on 1 September 2022 (the ""First Lien Loan Agreement""). This allows the Company to meet its undertaking towards the Lenders to raise new capital for an amount of not less than EUR 25 million.The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to fund operating losses resulting from operating expenses and investments required (i) to fund research and development for product menu expansion and further development of the Idylla‚Ñ¢ technology  (ii) to further bolster commercial infrastructure  and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company.The OfferingSubject to applicable securities laws and on the terms set out in the Prospectus  each shareholder holding Shares of the Company at closing of Euronext Brussels on 16 November 2022 will be granted one Preferential Right per existing share in the Company held at that time.

The Scrips will be offered for sale in the Scrips Private Placement that is expected to start on or about 29 November 2022 and to end on the same dateThe Company reserves the right to revoke or suspend the Offering  following consultation with the Underwriter (as defined below) if it determines that market conditions would make the Offering more difficult in a material way.In connection with the Offering  the Company has obtained undertakings (the ""Backstop Commitments"") from certain new investors  pursuant to which these new investors have committed to subscribe for Offered Shares in the event that the Offering is not fully subscribed during the Rights Subscription Period or in the context of the Scrips Private Placement  and this for an amount of up to EUR 10.6 million  corresponding to approximately 42.22% of the Offering  subject to the terms and conditions set out in the relevant commitment letters.

The net proceeds of the sale of the Scrips (the ""Net Scrips Proceeds"") (if any) will be divided proportionally between all holders of Preferential Rights who have not exercised them. If the Net Scrips Proceeds are less than EUR 0.01 per unexercised Preferential Right  the holders of Preferential Rights who have not exercised them are not entitled to receive any payment and  instead  the Net Scrips Proceeds will be transferred to the Company.

This capital increase has subscription commitments of 72.95% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs from:Voltalia Investissement  Voltalia‚Äôs reference shareholder which is part of the companies‚Äô portfolio held by the members of the Mulliez family  has undertaken to participate in the Rights Issue for a total amount of 345 million euros  representing 70.45% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRsProparco for a total amount of 12 million euros  representing 2.50% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs‚ÄúAfter achieving an average annual growth of +48% in revenue and of +49% of its EBITDA between 2014  the year of its IPO  and 30th June 2022  Voltalia is on track to achieve all of its 2023 objectives ‚Äì and should even reach a year in advance  at the end of 2022  its objective of capacity in operation and under construction of 2.6 gigawatts. The new roadmap unveiled on 20 October 2022 is based on continued strong growth in our performance indicators  both operationally  as well as financially and environmentally.Thus  by the end of 2027  we aim  on average  to triple these indicators compared to 2021 with more than 5 gigawatts of owned capacity (in operation and under construction)  more than 8 gigawatts of operating capacity on behalf of third parties and expected normalised EBITDA2 of around 475 million. euros. On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.Story continuesIn this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.‚Äù says S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company‚Äôs growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company‚Äôs presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company‚Äôs shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022. Eight (8) PSRs will entitle their holders to subscribe for three (3) New Shares on an irreducible basis.Requests may be made on a redubicle basis to subscribe for additional shares. New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their reducible requests but are subject to reduction  in the event of oversubscription.On the basis of the closing price of the Voltalia share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on 14 November 2022  i.e. 18.96 euros  the theoretical value of one (1) PSR is 1.43 euros and the theoretical value of one share ex-rights is 17.53 euros.The subscription price per New Share represents a nominal discount of 27.74% to Voltalia‚Äôs closing price on the trading day before the date of the prospectus  i.e. 18.96 euros on the 14 November 2022  and a discount of 21.83% to the theoretical value of the Voltalia share ex-rights.These values do not necessarily reflect the value of the PSRs during their trading period  the value of Voltalia shares ex-rights or the implicit discounts  which will be determined by the market.The Capital Increase with PSRs will be open to the public only in France and outside the U.S. in the context of offshore transactions under Regulation S.Indicative timetable for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe subscription period for the Capital Increase with PSRs will start on 21 November 2022 and end at market close on 30 November 2022. The PSRs will be detached and tradeable from 17 November 2022 until 28 November 2022 included on the regulated market of Euronext Paris under the ISIN code FR001400DV53. Unexercised PSRs will automatically lapse at the end of the subscription period  i.e. 30 November 2022 at market close.The issue  settlement-delivery and admission to trading of the New Shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris are scheduled for 7 December 2022.

Any New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their requests.

As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between ‚Ç¨2.5 billion and ‚Ç¨3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company‚Äôs securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group‚Äôs activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group‚Äôs main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group‚Äôs requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia‚Äôs activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia‚Äôs growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 ‚Äì Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the ‚ÄúCapital Increase‚Äù) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (‚ÄúEuronext Paris‚Äù) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company‚Äôs existing shares (the Existing Shares).

The Capital Increase would be cancelled if the amount of subscriptions that the Company receives represents less than three-quarters of the decided issue.Section 4 ‚Äì Key information on the offering of securities to the public and/or admitting them for trading on a regulated market4.1 Under what conditions and what schedule can I invest in this security?Structure of the issue ‚Äì Capital increase with preferential subscription rights: the New Shares are issued by way of a share capital increase with preferential subscription rights in accordance with the twentieth resolution adopted by the combined shareholders‚Äô meeting of 19 May 2021.Number of New Shares to be issued: 35 765 712 New Shares.Amount of the issue: the total amount of the issue  including the issue premium  is ‚Ç¨489 990 254.40 (of which ‚Ç¨203 864 558.40 par value and ‚Ç¨286 125 696.00 issue premium)New Shares subscription price: ‚Ç¨13.70 per New Share (i.e. ‚Ç¨5.70 par value and ‚Ç¨8.00 issue premium)  to be fully paid up at the time of subscription  by payment in cash.Based on the Voltalia share closing price on the trading day preceding the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF  i.e. ‚Ç¨18.96: (i) the New Shares issue price of ‚Ç¨13.70 shows a face-value discount of 27 74%  (ii) the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right amounts to ‚Ç¨1.435  (iii) the theoretical value of the ex-rights share is ‚Ç¨17.525  and (iv) the New Shares issue price shows a discount of 21.83% on the theoretical value of the ex-rights share.

13308,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558400-royal-dsm-q3-results-good-organic-sales-inflation-impacting-earnings,Royal DSM Q3 Results: Good Organic Sales Growth  But Inflation Is Impacting Earnings,Royal DSM delivered solid sales growth for the third quarter. See why we believe Royal DSM to be in the ‚Äòwonderful business at a fair price‚Äô category.,"recep-bg/E+ via Getty ImagesWe have mixed feelings about Royal DSM's (OTCQX:RDSMY) third quarter results. The company did deliver very strong organic sales growth despite the challenging environment  but the adjusted EBITDA margin deteriorated significantly. As can be seen in the table below  most of the organic growth came from price increases as can be seen in the price/mix column. Overall growth was even stronger  thanks to foreign exchange effects  and the 'Other' increase relates to a small acquisition. Unfortunately  volume growth was extremely weak  varying from 0% to 3% depending on the business segment. At least volume did not go negative due to the price increases.Royal DSM Earnings ReleaseThe company also confirmed that the divestment of DSM Engineering Materials is on track  and should be completed soon. This should leave a transformed Royal DSM ready to merge with Firmenich next year. We were a little bit disappointed that more details were not shared with respect to the merger with Firmenich other than to say that ""good progress has been made to close the forthcoming merger with Firmenich"". As a reminder  the company has previously said they expected the merger to complete in the first half of 2023.Q3 2022 ResultsAdjusted EBITDA was up +6%  despite the adjusted EBITDA coming in lower compared to the previous year quarter. Sales grew significantly  including organic growth. The company reported that market demand remained resilient despite the challenging macro-economic environment. Energy and input costs accelerated in the quarter  especially in Europe. As a result full-year outlook 2022 was lowered  with Adjusted EBITDA expected to increase only by low single digits. The company says they remain confident in the mid-term financial targets they have shared.DSM-FirmenichRoyal DSM is expected to become a new company  called DSM-Firmenich  which will be domiciled in Switzerland. As part of the merger there will be a public offer for Royal DSM shares in exchange for DSM-Firmenich shares. At inception  Royal DSM's shareholders are expected to own 65.5% of DSM-Firmenich. Firmenich shareholders will also receive shares in DSM-Firmenich in exchange for their Firmenich shares  and also ‚Ç¨3.5bn in cash. It is therefore expected that at inception the various shareholders of Firmenich will own in aggregate 34.5% of DSM-Firmenich. The new company is expected to have a Euronext Amsterdam listing  and completion of the merger is expected in the first half of 2023. There is an expected benefit of recurring run-rate pre-tax synergies of approximately ‚Ç¨350m in Adj. EBITDA per year by 2026.So what is Royal DSM getting by merging with Firmenich? This is a family owned company with ~10 000 employees. It is one of the global leaders in perfumery and ingredients  with revenue of ~4.5 billion CHF growing at a CAGR of ~5%. It has roughly a 20% adjusted EBITDA margin despite investing heavily in R&D. It's R&D spend is about 9.3% of revenues.Royal DSM Investor PresentationAlthough perfumery and ingredients is the main business segment for Firmenich  it also has a significant business in food and taste. The slide below shows some of the applications of their products  which include plant-based foods and sugar reduction solutions. The company is bringing to market some very interesting products  including an Eco-friendly long-lasting fragrance for laundry. In general it is also helping to create healthier  great-tasting  affordable food & beverages with more natural and sustainable ingredients.Royal DSM Investor PresentationMerged FinancialsThe combined company is expected to have a leadership position across nutrition  beauty  and well-being. Royal DSM is about twice the size of Firmenich  with ~18 000 employees compared to the ~10 000 that Firmenich has. Royal DSM has about 12 000 patents  nearly three times as many compared to the ~4 000 at Firmenich. Royal DSM has 2021 sales of ~‚Ç¨7.3 billion  which is significantly more than the ~‚Ç¨4.2 billion in sales Firmenich had in 2021. When combined  the merged company is expected to have sales of ~‚Ç¨11.4 billion  growing at a ~5% organic growth rate  and with a pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA of approximately ‚Ç¨2.2 billion. The new company will be nicely diversified across its four key businesses.Royal DSM Investor PresentationAt the outset the company is expected to have ~20%+ Adj. EBITDA margins  with a medium-term outlook of 22-23%  supported by synergies. The company is targeting a Debt/EBITDA of ratio 1.5-2.5x over the medium term  and is committed to a strong investment grade credit rating.When considering synergies  the combined company is expected to have a ‚Ç¨500 million annual sales uplift  especially from combining Royal DSM's Food & Beverage and Firmenich's Taste & Beyond businesses. If synergies are successfully delivered  this would increase total sales to ~‚Ç¨11.9 billion  and adjusted EBITDA to ~‚Ç¨2.6 billion. The synergies implementation cost is expected to be ~‚Ç¨250m.Royal DSM Investor PresentationValuationIt is difficult to value the company as it is not yet completely clear how the company will look post the Firmenich merger and disposition of the Materials business. Currently Royal DSM's market cap is ~‚Ç¨23 billion and its enterprise value is ~‚Ç¨25 billion  that means that once shares are issued for Firmenich the enterprise value should increase to more than ‚Ç¨35 billion. If we ignore synergies  that would result in an EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiple of over 16x. With synergies  the valuation multiple should go down to ~14x. These are very rough estimates  as it is very hard to tell how exactly the business will look after the disposition of the Materials business and the merger with Firmenich.Given the quality of the business and the growth prospects  we view this valuation as reasonable  but far from being a bargain. We would put it in the ""wonderful business at a fair price"" pile. The combined company is expected to have a dividend payout ratio of 40-60% of adjusted earnings. This could mean a higher dividend  as the current dividend yield for Royal DSM is only ~2%.Data by YChartsRisksThere are several risks to consider with Royal DSM including the integration risk with Firmenich  and the continued impact inflation can have on earnings. In particular  energy costs in Europe have had a significant impact on profit margins  and it could get worse before things get better. These risks are mitigated by the fact that Royal DSM operated in relatively stable industries with attractive economics.ConclusionWe have mixed feelings about Royal DSM's third quarter results  with inflation and energy costs impacting profit margins more than we expected. The merger with Firmenich appears to be on track  as well as the sale of the Materials business. Royal DSM is close to completing its transformation into a business focused on health  nutrition  and well-being. Given all of the moving parts it is difficult to value the company precisely  but shares appear to be reasonably valued  and we believe this puts the company in the ""wonderful business at a fair price"" investment category.",positive,0.78,0.22,0.01,mixed,0.43,0.14,0.43,True,English,"['Royal DSM Q3 Results', 'Good Organic Sales Growth', 'Inflation', 'Earnings', 'Royal DSM Investor Presentation Merged Financials', 'strong investment grade credit rating', 'recurring run-rate pre-tax synergies', 'healthier, great-tasting, affordable food', '‚Ç¨500 million annual sales uplift', 'Royal DSM Earnings Release', '~20%+ Adj.

Air Liquide‚Äôs support of NASA‚Äôs Artemis program drove an expansion of the capabilities of the Group‚Äôs Merritt Island  Florida  site and a renewed ten-year contract with NASA.Artemis 1 is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions as NASA conducts integrated tests of their deep space exploration systems. The expansion of Air Liquide‚Äôs Merritt Island capabilities played a critical role in the launch‚Äôs success  as the Artemis launch required nearly double the amount of high-pressure nitrogen than any previous launch. Air Liquide‚Äôs flexible and reliable supply of high-pressure nitrogen will help NASA meet its commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond.In the U.S.  for over 50 years  dating back to the Apollo era missions in 1968  Air Liquide has played a valuable role in NASA‚Äôs advancement of the U.S. space program through the supply of high pressure nitrogen. The continuous supply of nitrogen has been integral to the lunar missions of the 1970‚Äôs  the thirty year Space Shuttle program  the construction of the International Space Station  and most recently the first commercial launches of crew and cargo to orbit from U.S. soil since the shuttle program ended in 2011.Mike Graff  Chairman & CEO  American Air Liquide Holdings  Inc.  said: ‚ÄúAir Liquide is committed to the innovation and advancement of the space program not only in the United States but across the globe.

As the market is shifting to real-world quantum computing applications  this partnership will see the integration of IQM‚Äôs Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) into Atos‚Äô QLM and  more globally  into Atos‚Äô quantum application development platform.This unique proposition on the market enables customers to seamlessly program their Quantum Computing applications and run them on the QLM framework perfectly emulating all attributes of the target quantum hardware (topology  gate set  noise model). By doing so  customers could then directly execute these applications on real-world IQM Quantum Computing hardware without any need to modify them.Atos‚Äô exascale strategy will use Artificial Intelligence technologies and quantum computing as accelerators in traditional HPC workflows  in order to achieve lower time to solution and a reduced energy footprint. To that end  supercomputers will use the Atos QLM quantum application development platform as a gateway to Quantum Computing resources (emulated or real hardware) in hybrid computing workflows. With an emulation capacity of up to 41 Qubits  Atos‚Äô QLM Application programming Environment will help its customers to develop hybrid applications  using the gate  annealing and analog quantum computing paradigms  together with IQM QPU  offering 20 Qubits today and up to 50 Qubits committed by 2023.In 2020  IQM was selected to be part of Scaler  the Atos Accelerator program  starting the cooperation between Atos‚Äô Quantum Computing R&D team and IQM labs to tightly couple the Atos QLM and the IQM‚Äôs range of QPUs  in order to provide optimum results to their joint customers.This long-term relationship has also fostered several research programs in Europe  with the most recent one between IQM  Leibniz Rechenzentrum (LRZ) and Atos  with the aim to boost supercomputers using hybrid scalar/quantum computing technologies  as part of Q-Exa project.Story continues‚ÄúWe are glad to reinforce our relationship with IQM to empower our customers with best-in-class quantum computing technologies to prepare the future.‚Äù said Emmanuel Le Roux  Group SVP  Global Head of HPC  AI & Quantum at Atos ‚ÄúAt Atos we believe that hybrid platforms are the foundation stone of all future digital simulation  especially with the acceleration of quantum. With this partnership Atos will become a trusted Value Added Integrator of IQM with the capacity to not only sell and install IQM QPU‚Äôs at customers‚Äô premises  but to integrate them into a more complex Hybrid Computing environment  which is in line with our Hybrid Computing strategy for exascale announced in February 2022 with the unveiling of our new BullSequana XH3000 supercomputer.‚ÄùDr. Jan Goetz  CEO and Co-founder of IQM Quantum Computers  commented ‚ÄúWe are excited to strengthen our partnership with Atos and create this unique offering for our customers globally. This partnership is an important next step towards quantum readiness for the industry and we‚Äôre glad that Atos has selected IQM for this product offering. This is also an important milestone for the commercialization of quantum accelerators for supercomputing centers  and for our quantum computers to be sold globally.""The first quantum simulator available on the market as early as 2016 and already used in many countries worldwide (including Austria  Brazil  Finland  France  Germany  India  Japan  UK  United States) the Atos QLM enables researchers and engineers to develop applications and experiment with quantum software. The QLM combines an ultra-compact  highly powerful large memory system with a universal programming language meaning that quantum applications can be developed without the need for quantum hardware. This new collaboration finally allows users to unleash the full potential of their quantum algorithms by seamlessly transitioning to actual quantum hardware provided by IQM.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 112 000 employees and annual revenue of c. ‚Ç¨ 11 billion.

One of the aims of the GENOPTAIRE project is to identify and assess the impact of biosourced components mixed with conventional aviation fuels on engine performance in land vehicles used by the French Army.Representatives of the DGA and Military Staff involved in the project issued the following statement: ‚ÄúThe batch delivered by Global Bioenergies will be tested first by the project participants (IFPEN  ONERA and SEO) in combination with fossil kerosene for physico-chemical analysis. Subsequently  the Military Staff‚Äôs operational energy department (EMA/SEO) plans to conduct engine trials.‚ÄùMarc Delcourt  CEO of Global Bioenergies said: ‚ÄúHaving our products assessed by the French Army is a major step forward in our trajectory.

Preferential Rights that are not exercised during the rights subscription period (the ""Rights Subscription Period"") will be converted into an equal number of scrips (the ""Scrips"") and will be offered up for sale through a private placement to institutional investors (the ""Scrips Private Placement"" and together with the Rights Offering  the ""Offering"").Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ""The launch of a rights offering today is a next important step in Biocartis' journey. We can build on strong operational performance  as we announced in our recent Q3 business update: we demonstrated continued strong growth of revenues in our core oncology business  coupled with the significant improvement of the gross margins of our Idylla‚Ñ¢ products and a gradually reducing cash burn. From a financing point of view  the recapitalization as announced on 1 September 2022 will fundamentally improve our financial position. Having successfully executed the restructuring of our convertible debt in the past weeks  I am very pleased to now enter into the last stage of the refinancing with the launch of this EUR 25.1 million rights offering. Together with the new convertible term loan and the new convertible bond  this will provide for approximately EUR 66 million of gross proceeds  necessary to continue and execute our growth strategy towards profitability.""OfferingRationale of the OfferingThe Offering is part of the comprehensive recapitalization transactions that were announced by the Company on 1 September 2022 (the ""Recapitalization Transactions"")  and which were aimed at providing the Company with an opportunity to strengthen its cash position by approximately EUR 66 million (which would be the gross proceeds from the Recapitalization Transactions  including the Offering) and fundamentally improve its financial structure by extending the maturity of its bond debt from May 2024 to November 2026 (when the Company's new second lien secured convertible bonds (the ""New Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid) or November 2027 (when the Company's amended convertible bonds initially due 2024 (the ""Existing Convertible Bonds"") must be repaid)  subject to certain conditions. The Offering was specifically requested by certain funds and accounts managed or advised by Highbridge Capital Management LLC (""Highbridge"")  and certain funds managed or advised by Whitebox Advisors LLC (collectively  ""Whitebox""  and together with Highbridge  the ""Lenders"") (who held existing convertible bonds) as a condition for the renegotiation of the terms of the existing convertible bonds and the entering into the new secured loan agreement that was announced on 1 September 2022 (the ""First Lien Loan Agreement""). This allows the Company to meet its undertaking towards the Lenders to raise new capital for an amount of not less than EUR 25 million.The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to fund operating losses resulting from operating expenses and investments required (i) to fund research and development for product menu expansion and further development of the Idylla‚Ñ¢ technology  (ii) to further bolster commercial infrastructure  and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company.The OfferingSubject to applicable securities laws and on the terms set out in the Prospectus  each shareholder holding Shares of the Company at closing of Euronext Brussels on 16 November 2022 will be granted one Preferential Right per existing share in the Company held at that time.

The subscription period for the Offered Shares will be from 17 November 2022 up to and including 28 November 2022  at 4 p.m. CET (the ""Rights Subscription Period"").Any Preferential Rights that are not exercised during the Rights Subscription Period will be converted into an equal number of Scrips. The Scrips will be offered for sale in the Scrips Private Placement that is expected to start on or about 29 November 2022 and to end on the same dateThe Company reserves the right to revoke or suspend the Offering  following consultation with the Underwriter (as defined below) if it determines that market conditions would make the Offering more difficult in a material way.In connection with the Offering  the Company has obtained undertakings (the ""Backstop Commitments"") from certain new investors  pursuant to which these new investors have committed to subscribe for Offered Shares in the event that the Offering is not fully subscribed during the Rights Subscription Period or in the context of the Scrips Private Placement  and this for an amount of up to EUR 10.6 million  corresponding to approximately 42.22% of the Offering  subject to the terms and conditions set out in the relevant commitment letters.

The Issue Price represents a discount to the closing price of 15 November 2022  (which amounted to EUR 1.39)  of 46.04%.

The net proceeds of the sale of the Scrips (the ""Net Scrips Proceeds"") (if any) will be divided proportionally between all holders of Preferential Rights who have not exercised them. If the Net Scrips Proceeds are less than EUR 0.01 per unexercised Preferential Right  the holders of Preferential Rights who have not exercised them are not entitled to receive any payment and  instead  the Net Scrips Proceeds will be transferred to the Company.

Biocartis may be unable to manage its growth effectively  and may not be successful in further growing its commercialization infrastructure.The molecular diagnostics (MDx) industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes  and Biocartis may be unable to keep pace with its competitors.The commercial success of Biocartis will depend on the continued growth in market acceptance of the Idylla‚Ñ¢ platform  the menu of Idylla‚Ñ¢ and partner tests it offers and the relevance thereof.Biocartis has entered into  and relies upon  a number of partnerships and alliances  including joint ventures  and the termination of such partnerships or alliances or disagreements with these partners  may have negative effects on Biocartis.Operational risksBiocartis may not be able to manufacture or outsource manufacturing of its products in sufficient quantities  in a timely manner or at a cost that is economically attractive.Delays in the development of tests may occur and cause a slower availability of a broad and clinically relevant menu of tests  which may result in increased costs and/or jeopardize Biocartis' ability to obtain market acceptance and/or relevant marketing authorizations in line with its strategy. Biocartis may not be able to launch new tests as quickly as it anticipates.Biocartis relies on multiple suppliers to produce the individual components required for its Idylla‚Ñ¢ platform and Idylla‚Ñ¢ tests  some of whom are single source suppliers  and any issues with suppliers may impact the ability of Biocartis to continue to supply its customers  lead to additional costs  or require additional managerial resources.Legal and intellectual property related risksBiocartis faces an inherent risk of product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance coverage.If Biocartis fails to obtain patent protection for the products it develops or otherwise fails to maintain and adequately protect its intellectual property rights  Biocartis' business could suffer.Regulatory risksBiocartis' business could be significantly and negatively affected by substantial changes to government regulations  particularly in the European Union  the United Kingdom and the United States.Financial risksBiocartis does not have sufficient working capital to fund its operations and development activities.Biocartis has incurred operating losses  negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit since inception and may never become profitable.Biocartis might require substantial additional funding to respond to business challenges  take advantage of new business opportunities or repay or refinance its outstanding convertible bonds  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all.Risks relating to the Offered Shares  the New Shares  the Preferential Rights  the Scrips  and the OfferingAny future capital increases by the Company (as the case may be  in the context of the Recapitalization Transactions) could have a negative impact on the price of the Shares and could dilute the interests of Existing Shareholders.The market price of the Shares may fluctuate widely in response to various factors and may decline below the Issue Price.ProspectusFull details of the Offering will be included in the prospectus that has been prepared in connection with the Offering (the ""Prospectus"").

This capital increase has subscription commitments of 72.95% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs from:Voltalia Investissement  Voltalia‚Äôs reference shareholder which is part of the companies‚Äô portfolio held by the members of the Mulliez family  has undertaken to participate in the Rights Issue for a total amount of 345 million euros  representing 70.45% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRsProparco for a total amount of 12 million euros  representing 2.50% of the total amount of the Capital Increase with PSRs‚ÄúAfter achieving an average annual growth of +48% in revenue and of +49% of its EBITDA between 2014  the year of its IPO  and 30th June 2022  Voltalia is on track to achieve all of its 2023 objectives ‚Äì and should even reach a year in advance  at the end of 2022  its objective of capacity in operation and under construction of 2.6 gigawatts. The new roadmap unveiled on 20 October 2022 is based on continued strong growth in our performance indicators  both operationally  as well as financially and environmentally.Thus  by the end of 2027  we aim  on average  to triple these indicators compared to 2021 with more than 5 gigawatts of owned capacity (in operation and under construction)  more than 8 gigawatts of operating capacity on behalf of third parties and expected normalised EBITDA2 of around 475 million. euros. On the other hand  on this same horizon  Voltalia has set itself a new environmental objective  in accordance with our Mission-driven Company status: tripling the number of tonnes of carbon avoided thanks to the production of our power plants  to more than 4 million tons of CO2 equivalent.In this context  we are launching today a capital increase to involve all investors in our strategic acceleration and together write this new chapter of Voltalia's story.‚Äù says S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.***Reasons for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe issue of the New Shares (as defined below) is intended to provide the Company with additional means to finance its target of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of at least 5.0 GW by 2027  for which the Company considers that the amount of investement required is between 2.5 and 3 billion euros. In this respect  the Company plans to allocate at least 450 million euros of the funds raised to the construction of its new production capacity by 2027.The balance of the funds raised will be used to finance (i) the Company‚Äôs growth in services in order to reach its objective of operating and maintaining more than 8 GW of power plants on behalf of third parties and (ii) possible targeted acquisitions  in particular to strengthen the Company‚Äôs presence in its new geographical areas in Africa  Latin America or Europe.If the Capital Increase with PSRs is at least 75% completed  the Company considers that it will have access to additional sources of financing that will enable it to pursue its development and especially to maintain its objective of a consolidated capacity in operation or under construction of over 5.0 GW by the end of 2027. If the Capital Increase with PSRs is not completed  the Company will consider other equity and/or debt financing options to finance its 2027 ambitions  it being specified that its 2023 operational objectives have already been financed.The net proceeds from the Capital Increase with PSRs  if it is carried out at 100%  is estimated at approximately 485.3 million euros.Main terms of the Capital Increase with PSRsThe Capital Increase with PSRs will be carried out with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of 19 May 2021  and will result in the issue of 35 765 712 new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù)  at a subscription price of 13.70 euros per New Share (i.e. a nominal value of 5.70 euros and an issue premium of 8.00 euros)  to be fully paid at the time of subscription by payment in cash  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of up to 490 million euros.On 17 November 2022  each of the Company‚Äôs shareholders will receive one (1) PSR per share  recorded in his or her securities account at the end of the accounting entry day of 16 November 2022.

New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be divided up and allocated to subscribers as per their reducible requests but are subject to reduction  in the event of oversubscription.On the basis of the closing price of the Voltalia share on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on 14 November 2022  i.e. 18.96 euros  the theoretical value of one (1) PSR is 1.43 euros and the theoretical value of one share ex-rights is 17.53 euros.The subscription price per New Share represents a nominal discount of 27.74% to Voltalia‚Äôs closing price on the trading day before the date of the prospectus  i.e. 18.96 euros on the 14 November 2022  and a discount of 21.83% to the theoretical value of the Voltalia share ex-rights.These values do not necessarily reflect the value of the PSRs during their trading period  the value of Voltalia shares ex-rights or the implicit discounts  which will be determined by the market.The Capital Increase with PSRs will be open to the public only in France and outside the U.S. in the context of offshore transactions under Regulation S.Indicative timetable for the Capital Increase with PSRsThe subscription period for the Capital Increase with PSRs will start on 21 November 2022 and end at market close on 30 November 2022.

The Group‚Äôs target of 2.6 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  which it had planned to achieve by the end of 2023  will be reached by the end of 2022  one year ahead of schedule. As of 28 September 2022  Voltalia has 2.4 GW of installed capacity in operation and under construction  with a further capacity of around 0.2 GW to be launched by the end of 2022.2027 objectivesBy 2027  the Group aims to have:more than 5 GW of owned capacity in operation and under construction by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 2.9-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;more than 8 GW capacity operated on behalf of third-party customers by the end of 2027  i.e. a more than 3.3-fold increase compared to the end of 2021;a normalised EBITDA 9 of approximately ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021;of approximately ‚Ç¨475 million in 2027 (compared to a normalised EBITDA of ‚Ç¨156.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2021)  i.e. a more than 3-fold increase compared to an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨137.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2021; a level of CO 2 equivalent avoided amounting to more than 4 million tonnes in 2027  i.e. a more than 2.8-fold increase compared to the end of 2021.The amount of investments required in order to achieve its new ambitions set for 2027 should be between ‚Ç¨2.5 billion and ‚Ç¨3 billion.2.3 What are the risks specific to the issuer?An investment in the Company‚Äôs securities entails many risks and uncertainties related to the Group‚Äôs activities that may result in the investors losing some or all of their investment  including the risks described below. The net risk level shown is assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 after control measures have been taken into account (4 being the highest).risks associated with the business activity and the energy sector: Risks related to the Construction business (level 3). The construction of projects covers an average period of 12 to 24 months and is conditional upon obtaining operating licences and construction permits. Consequently  these Construction activities can be subject to varying delays. The Group can also be exposed to external risks: (i) regulatory changes  (ii) weather during the construction phase; (iii) price increases for essential equipment (notably turbines  solar panels or others) mainly due to raw material price increases  (iv) any delays by the Group‚Äôs main suppliers or contractors or non-compliance of these components and equipment with the Group‚Äôs requirements in terms of quality and social and environmental responsibility. Risks related to project development (level 2). The development business involves some uncertainty as to the viability of the projects developed  whether for the Group or on behalf of a customer. The time required to develop a power plant project is between two and eight years. Voltalia may incur significant expenses with respect to these elements prior to the commencement of construction and/or the industrial commissioning of the power plants. The success of the development phase relies on meeting a number of conditions. If the latter are not met  the viability of the project  and therefore its capacity to generate future revenues  are threatened. Risks related to growth and expansion into new regions (level 2). The Group may experience difficulties in penetrating new markets or may misjudge the potential of a region considered by the Group.Environmental  social and governance risks: Risks related to natural hazards (level 2). Due to the different geographical locations of its sites  the Group is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis  extreme droughts or decreasing wind strength. Voltalia may temporarily not be able to implement its services in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Risk of breach of business ethics and CSR commitments (level 2). Voltalia‚Äôs activities and locations expose it to non-financial risks with regard to: (i) breach of business ethics  corruption and fraud  (ii) non-preservation of the environment and natural resources  (iii) non-attraction or non-retention of talent  (iv) social unacceptability of projects.Legal and regulatory risks: Country risk and risks related to regulatory changes (level 2). Voltalia operates in a highly regulated environment in 20 countries around the world. This diversity exposes it to risks related to the macroeconomic  political and regulatory conditions in each of these countries.Financial risks: Risk of access to financing (level 1). Voltalia‚Äôs growth model consists of developing power plant projects financed by successive capital increases and project financing (bridge loans and long-term debt) and corporate debt and  progressively  by a part of the cash flow generated by the power plants in operation and the service activities. Although the Group does not anticipate any particular difficulties at this stage  it cannot rule out the possibility that economic difficulties may make it more difficult to access this financing.Section 3 ‚Äì Key securities information3.1 What are the main characteristics of the securities?Nature and class of securities issuedThe new shares (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù) to be issued as part of the capital increase with shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights described in the Prospectus (the ‚ÄúCapital Increase‚Äù) and for which admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (‚ÄúEuronext Paris‚Äù) is requested are ordinary shares of the same class as the Company‚Äôs existing shares (the Existing Shares).

Furthermore  as a result of its subscription commitment  Voltalia Investissement could see its stake in the Company‚Äôs share capital increase;the issue of the New Shares is not subject to an underwriting agreement. The Capital Increase would be cancelled if the amount of subscriptions that the Company receives represents less than three-quarters of the decided issue.Section 4 ‚Äì Key information on the offering of securities to the public and/or admitting them for trading on a regulated market4.1 Under what conditions and what schedule can I invest in this security?Structure of the issue ‚Äì Capital increase with preferential subscription rights: the New Shares are issued by way of a share capital increase with preferential subscription rights in accordance with the twentieth resolution adopted by the combined shareholders‚Äô meeting of 19 May 2021.Number of New Shares to be issued: 35 765 712 New Shares.Amount of the issue: the total amount of the issue  including the issue premium  is ‚Ç¨489 990 254.40 (of which ‚Ç¨203 864 558.40 par value and ‚Ç¨286 125 696.00 issue premium)New Shares subscription price: ‚Ç¨13.70 per New Share (i.e. ‚Ç¨5.70 par value and ‚Ç¨8.00 issue premium)  to be fully paid up at the time of subscription  by payment in cash.Based on the Voltalia share closing price on the trading day preceding the date of approval of the Prospectus by the AMF  i.e. ‚Ç¨18.96: (i) the New Shares issue price of ‚Ç¨13.70 shows a face-value discount of 27 74%  (ii) the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right amounts to ‚Ç¨1.435  (iii) the theoretical value of the ex-rights share is ‚Ç¨17.525  and (iv) the New Shares issue price shows a discount of 21.83% on the theoretical value of the ex-rights share.

These shifts ‚Ä¶,The past few years triggered a significant reality check in society. People looked inward to decide what they really needed and why ‚Äî questioning the relevancy of existing habits  beliefs  and behaviors regarding self  community  and the planet. These shifts and nuances in mindset and the diverging individual responses to these inquiries have created a collective transformative force which impacts society. We take a closer look at these changes and their intricacies and where we believe they create opportunities for the hospitality industry.#1 The Hybrid Way of LifeThe acceleration of digital over the past few years  transforming how people work and live  coupled with more time to reflect during the pandemic  has led people to reexamine their lifestyles. They want to live  play  work  socialize and buy on their own terms  with an increasing desire for flexibility and freedom to seamlessly connect all aspects in their life. The shift impacts where people want to live  the quest for a better work-life balance and a desire for more meaning overall. And it creates a change in how people want to work. As much as they love the ability to work from anywhere (73% of workers across 31 countries want flexible remote work options1)  they feel at the same time the irrepressible need to interact (47% of workers miss social interactions with colleagues and associates2). Those seemingly opposing ideas result in the growing desire for flexibility and multi-purpose in all domains.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?REIMAGINING HOSPITALITY SPACESAs living shifts  the concept of one place equals one usage needs to evolve. We simply cannot see spaces from the same lens. Offices  malls  hotels  meeting venues  etc. ‚Äî all potential spaces where we spend time ‚Äî can be flexible and multi-purpose.Residential spaces : the desire for more flexibility and freedom increases the demand for private spaces  whether to adapt to longer stays or to specific needs and moments. We see residential offerings rising (branded residences  villas  apartments‚Ä¶) combined with the valued traditional services and shared moments of hospitality (F&B  spas  events‚Ä¶).: the desire for more flexibility and freedom increases the demand for private spaces  whether to adapt to longer stays or to specific needs and moments. We see residential offerings rising (branded residences  villas  apartments‚Ä¶) combined with the valued traditional services and shared moments of hospitality (F&B  spas  events‚Ä¶). Spaces as multi-purpose living hubs: whether for family members needing a large space to gather together or surrounding communities to meet  greet  and work  spaces need to seamlessly adapt to versatile needs.REIMAGINING HOSPITALITY LIVINGAs they move and change ideas rapidly  people demand flexibility in hotel living. This is why the previous thinking in hospitality that one stay equals only one need is over. It can become multiple stays with multiple purposes. Being agile and highly flexible are the new hallmarks of hotel services.Blending work and leisure : as people continue to seek the ability to merge moments of pleasure and relaxation within work constraints  ‚ÄúBleisure‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlended Travel‚Äù becomes the new normal  the well-known trend has turned into a solid business reality for hotels which can offer family-friendly or longer stay options. For example  56% of people worldwide have or are considering staying in places a few extra days to work remotely during weekends or holidays away from home  according to an Accor research among workers in 7 countries 3 .: as people continue to seek the ability to merge moments of pleasure and relaxation within work constraints  ‚ÄúBleisure‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlended Travel‚Äù becomes the new normal  the well-known trend has turned into a solid business reality for hotels which can offer family-friendly or longer stay options. For example  56% of people worldwide have or are considering staying in places a few extra days to work remotely during weekends or holidays away from home  according to an Accor research among workers in 7 countries . Sociable Meetings: as remote working continues to expand  in-person meetings may be less about business and more about socialization  team building  and creative moments  thereby offering opportunities to integrate social activities and team building within meeting offers.Explore some of Accor‚Äôs initiatives reflecting The Hybrid Way of Life:#2 The Well-Being ImperativeThe concept of well-being has blossomed in human consciousness for a few years now. As individuals have become more aware of the notion  they have come to the realization that well-being is more of a holistic process entailing body  mind  and living habits (77% of all consumers take steps in daily life to stay healthy  such as eating with moderation  getting exercise  managing stress‚Ä¶.4). But the notion has moved even beyond the perimeter of personal health to encompass social life  working conditions  home characteristics  and urban way of living. Everything in society contributes to creating a culture of well-being  from entrepreneurship and organization to finance and technology. And individuals ask companies  governments  and institutions to help them incorporate well-being holistically into every moment in their life to satisfy these new interests and needs.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?ADDRESSING HOLISTIC WELL-BEINGWhile spas and fitness centers have long been part of hospitality  they catered mainly to physical wellness. Growing expectations for holistic well-being throughout the guest journey compels us to enhance guest experiences with a wider spectrum of possibilities  encompassing emotional well-being  nutrition  mental health  and more.Becoming mindful : much less explored territory  mental well-being can be a new area to explore  as it gains attention from guests. Whether through activities or with retreat concepts  adding mindfulness  meditation  creative expression  and personal education to local culture can nourish mental health.: much less explored territory  mental well-being can be a new area to explore  as it gains attention from guests. Whether through activities or with retreat concepts  adding mindfulness  meditation  creative expression  and personal education to local culture can nourish mental health. Holistic stays: with well-being becoming holistic and not restricted to specific hospitality functions  it can reach throughout the entire stay. From contact with preserved natural surroundings to the mastering of air and noise pollution  from the services which simplify daily burdens to the quality of food and attention to nutrition  the task is huge yet exhilarating  and will be very rewarding for brands and hotels which address well-being holistically.EXPANDING THE WAY WE MANAGEEverything from job satisfaction to economic independence is becoming part of well-being  including the way to run a business and to engage with team members  creating opportunities such as:Well-being at work : being well-being natives  new generations are looking for companies which share their values and support their commitment in well-being through all means possible  from working conditions on and off-site and the respect of work-life balance  to career paths and entrepreneurship opportunities.: being well-being natives  new generations are looking for companies which share their values and support their commitment in well-being through all means possible  from working conditions on and off-site and the respect of work-life balance  to career paths and entrepreneurship opportunities. Beyond traditional management: the next step in holistic well-being at work is to give purpose to everyone‚Äôs daily contributions. Acting responsibly  respecting individuals  connecting people  and giving back defines how hospitality can create  step by step  a well-being society.Discover some of Accor‚Äôs latest initiatives on well-being:#3 The New Community BoundariesWith people staying closer to home  the local community has gained even more prominence in everyone‚Äôs mindset. People want to act more to protect  interact with  and support their community. For example  a study in the UK has shown that 45% of individuals state they want to focus more on supporting each other and good neighborliness5. For them  taking care of their local community is as important in a sustainable perspective as it is for economic impact. This could have led to a decline in travel ‚Äî particularly internationally ‚Äî however  a different result is taking place. While people are incredibly committed to their local community  they still want to travel. Hence the rising appeal of trips abroad to Europeans and Americans (an increase of 13 pts and 11 pts respectively ‚Äì as compared to 20196). But they seek to immerse themselves in the destination to have more deeply authentic experiences when they travel. What we see is that care for local communities is expanding from your own to the ones at the other end of the world. This is promising for hospitality provided the industry pivots to seize the prospects offered by this new mindset.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?BELONGING TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITYWhile hotels have traditionally been seen as primarily for out-of-town guests  this increased focus on local community and care presents the opportunity for properties to build greater connection to place where they do business:A second home for the local community : as people‚Äôs lives are more centered around their immediate community  the need for locals-dedicated spaces and services increase. Hotels can adapt to a variety of community-based needs such as community activities or family and friends gatherings while ensuring the usual hospitality services such as food and beverage also appeal to locals. As travelers seek connection to destinations  becoming the hub of local community life could ensure the double satisfaction of locals and visitors alike.: as people‚Äôs lives are more centered around their immediate community  the need for locals-dedicated spaces and services increase. Hotels can adapt to a variety of community-based needs such as community activities or family and friends gatherings while ensuring the usual hospitality services such as food and beverage also appeal to locals. As travelers seek connection to destinations  becoming the hub of local community life could ensure the double satisfaction of locals and visitors alike. Supporting the community economy: hospitality is one of the most powerful multipliers of the local economic life (on average  one job in a hotel supports four jobs in the local economy). Hotels have the opportunity to reinforce their role as an active local force  creating community outreach programs for Talent  developing neighborhood suppliers sourcing‚Ä¶and advertising it to guests interested in discovering the hotel‚Äôs close network.ENVISIONING COMMUNITY-CENTRIC TOURISMFeeding into people‚Äôs desire to support and be a part of the local community ‚Äî no matter where they roam ‚Äî travel has the potential to promote community-centric tourism and sustainability efforts to preserve what originally made that destination something people from around the world want to see.Protecting local communities : COVID opened people‚Äôs eyes to the impact of over-tourism and under-tourism. Contributing to the protection of destinations and enhancing new destinations in a controlled way helps preserve while developing. Along with guests  hospitality has a role to play in participating in neighborhood sustainability actions  from replanting coral and conserving natural resources and engaging with inhabitants who stand up for their culture.: COVID opened people‚Äôs eyes to the impact of over-tourism and under-tourism. Contributing to the protection of destinations and enhancing new destinations in a controlled way helps preserve while developing. Along with guests  hospitality has a role to play in participating in neighborhood sustainability actions  from replanting coral and conserving natural resources and engaging with inhabitants who stand up for their culture. Discovering the people behind the destinations: guests want to discover destinations where they can see and learn about local culture  habits  and ways of living. Through tailored activities and encounters with local artisans  hospitality can become the ambassador of its local communities.Accor has explored some of these opportunities through several initiatives. Discover three below:#4 The Consumption ParadoxConsumers are still consuming  but there has been a shift in the whys  hows  and ways in which they buy. An exclusive Accor research identified that for 48% of respondents ethics matters in their interactions  but at the same time  55% admit they would compromise if it is more convenient7. Where do these seemingly opposed viewpoints lead us? More aware of the impact of their consumption  people are  in fact  more aware when they buy. They spend more time thinking about how and why they will make a purchase  disrupting their daily routine with more meaningful actions in a smarter way. But their conscious consumption doesn‚Äôt always guarantee a sustainable or ethical choice. They work hard to find a balance between needs and desires and between values and convenience. The needle is indeed moving with regard to the manner of consumption  and the hospitality industry has opportunities to bring smarter and meaningful ways to purchase.WHAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALITY?INVENTING SMARTER SELLING TOOLS WHICH ARE ALSO MORE RESPONSIBLEAs individuals continue to put their wants and desires front and center  brands can set themselves apart by feeding the need for more flexible purchase options  allowing consumers at the same time to control their consumption.Alternative buying systems: airlines are leading the way in testing alternative smarter buying tools  in tune with today‚Äôs consumption practices  such as pre-purchase and monthly subscriptions  enabling individuals to buy what they want  when they want  and how they want. This favors more responsible and mindful purchases  avoiding waste and compulsive consumption.INTEGRATING CONSCIOUS CONSUMPTIONThe growing concern for people and planet has caused an increase in conscious consumption. In fact  85% of people indicate they are prepared to rethink the way they live and spend to tackle climate change8. As a result  we are seeing greater shifts toward conscious consumption and making it easier to do so  including:Sustainable travel options : Following the consumer‚Äôs desire to consciously act  search and booking engines can make it easier for clients to make sustainable travel choices  with structured sustainability criteria  certifications  and labels in online reservations as well as even carbon calculators. Demonstrating participation in sustainability and making it convenient for clients becomes a must-have in hospitality which will directly impact consumer choice and business.: Following the consumer‚Äôs desire to consciously act  search and booking engines can make it easier for clients to make sustainable travel choices  with structured sustainability criteria  certifications  and labels in online reservations as well as even carbon calculators. Demonstrating participation in sustainability and making it convenient for clients becomes a must-have in hospitality which will directly impact consumer choice and business. Sustainable sourcing: as consumers are questioning all aspects in their purchase  sourcing becomes even more central for hotels  especially food and beverage sourcing. Numerous food and beverage industry professionals have put in place a more sustainable approach and are making it easier for all stakeholders to make sustainable choices  as is evidenced by labels for responsible fishing  transparency on supply chains (from production to preparation)  sea to table networks‚Ä¶). This is the basis of a responsible approach to food: smarter  more responsible  and healthier.Discover some of Accor‚Äôs initiatives in this area below:Sources:1 The World Trade Index conducted by Edelman Data x Intelligence for Microsoft  among 31.092 full-time employed or self-employed workers across 31 markets - January 20212 Foresight Factory3 Accor study conducted in 2021 among 5 000 people in 7 countries in the employed population that could work fully or partially remotely4 Foresight Factory in WBWP5 The National Lottery Community Fund ‚Äì UK research January 2021 - survey of over 7 000 UK adults across the UK 6 IPSOS holiday barometer 2022 https://www.ipsos.com/en/holiday-barometer-2022 7 Study conducted by Accor in 2022 among 15 000+ travelers in 7 countries8 Trend Report 2021 ‚Äì Regeneration Rising - Wunderman Thompson IntelligenceAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Nov. 16  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ossia Inc.  the company behind FCC-approved Cota¬Æ Real Wireless Power‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî the patented technology that delivers power over-the-air  at a distance  and without the need for line-of-sight ‚Äî today announced that the company  in partnership with ARCHOS  has won their 6th CES Innovation Award. The ARCHOS home security camera Powered by Cota was honored with the 2023 CES Award in Smart Home category.The ARCHOS Cota Wireless Power Security Camera is the world's first wirelessly powered security system. The partnership between ARCHOS and Ossia began in 2021  when both companies announced working together to bring wirelessly powered products to consumers in the next couple of years.Ossia is leading the way in radio frequency (RF)-based wireless power. Its patented wireless power transfer system  Cota  is the only technology authorized by the U.S. FCC and more than 60 other countries to deliver wireless power over-the-air  without limitations on distance or the need for line-of-sight.ARCHOS is dedicated to innovating and revolutionizing the portable consumer electronics market. Adding wireless power technology to their consumer products is part of their strategic business plans.The ARCHOS Cota Camera uses ARCHOS video camera technology and pairs it with Ossia's Cota Real Wireless Power to enable a reliable security system that does not require battery replacement or wiring. Equipped with human-detecting AI  night vision  audio recording  and an auto-alarm  the ARCHOS Cota camera can be mounted anywhere‚Äîno wiring or battery swaps are needed. It comes with a Cota transmitter that plugs into a wall outlet and continuously charges up to five cameras within a 30-foot range of the Ossia transmitter. Homeowners can monitor power levels and camera footage from a mobile app. This is a seamless user experience that requires no management. An event captured on the security camera can trigger the camera app with nothing extra to download.""The ARCHOS Cota Wireless Power Security Camera is a first for consumers. It's not only the first wirelessly powered home security camera  but it's also the first commercially available wirelessly powered product "" said Doug Stovall  CEO of Ossia. ""Previously  Cota-enabled products have been leveraged by enterprises  like big box retail stores. The ARCHOS Cota Camera is designed to be the world's easiest security system for homeowners to install  maintain  and use. In ten years  we believe it will be remembered for leading the Internet of Things (IoT) space toward sustainability.""""We have dreamed to have our IoT devices at home seamlessly powered. This is going to be true innovation in the market. Thanks to Ossia and the Cota Technology  we are excited to launch a truly wireless camera that will always be charged."" said Lo√Øc Poirier  CEO of ARCHOS.Current home security cameras have several challenges  including:Requiring expensive wiring or unsightly long cord that fixes cameras in specific locationsNeeding frequent battery changes or taken down for wired charging  often at great expense and inopportune times  like while on vacationNot being easily accessible once installed  making it difficult to change the batteriesIf the cameras are accessible  then they can be easily tampered withThe ARCHOS Cota security camera solves all of these challenges. Once installed  homeowners no longer need to worry about whether or not the cameras have sufficient power. Because they are Cota-enabled  they will have continuous wireless power delivered when they need it  and the whole system can be managed remotely.Just like Wi-Fi  Cota transmits power through glass  sheet rock  and wood (though not brick or cement). This product is meant to be an indoor security system.Cota's engineering qualities make the ARCHOS Cota camera convenient and secure while eliminating the cost of wiring and waste of battery-only systems. The wirelessly powered security cameras are scheduled to begin shipping in April 2023.About OssiaOssia Inc. is leading the world on what is possible with wireless power.

Even excluding the Big Tech 2022 contract  the growth is of +39 0% (BER not taken into account). In addition  the order intake for 2022 is strong across all regions.Big Tech contract 2022  a landmark in the history of EVS  signed in August 2022.Our secured revenue* allows us to upgrade our revenue guidance for 2022 to a range of EUR 145 million to EUR 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million.The OPEX guidance remains unchanged  with a growth projected between 12-15%*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2022CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:‚Äú I‚Äôm happy to say our Q3 achievements are confirming our revenue growth expectations for the full year 2022. As we have been able to further increase our order intake and solve most of our supply chain challenges this year  I‚Äôm confident to upgrade our revenue guidance to a range of EUR 145 million to EUR 150 million. This will represent a new record figure for EVS.With the signature of our largest contract ever  we are proud to say that we have added a new milestone in the history of EVS. This ‚ÄúBig Tech Contract 2022‚Äù covers a 10-year contract worth over $50 million with a major US-based broadcast and media production company. This agreement includes the delivery of EVS‚Äô live production  replays and highlights solution LiveCeption¬Æ  combined with a long-term service level agreement (SLA). It also provides our customer with multiple benefits including access to our latest technology innovations and upgrades for its installed base  a predictable operational spend  with a spread of capital expenditures over time  an easy way to plan for further expansion and a premium SLA. The agreement comes as big tech companies intensify the competition with linear networks to secure live sports content by spending billions of dollars to acquire media rights of the most prestigious pro sports leagues in North America.Story continuesThe positive and encouraging feedback we received from our customers and channel partners during our IBC trade show participation in Amsterdam earlier in September  provides us additional confidence that we are providing them with the right solutions and services to continue solving their current and future live video production needs. Our EVS Balanced Computing approach (a balanced combination strategy of ‚Äúon premises‚Äù and ‚Äúin the cloud services‚Äù) is clearly answering the specific needs and expectations of many LSP (Live Service Providers) and LAB (Live Audience Business) customers around the world.I‚Äôm particularly proud to say that our CSR efforts have translated into a first important recognition. EVS has been awarded a Silver medal for its sustainability performance from EcoVadis  one of the world‚Äôs largest providers of business sustainability ratings  placing EVS in the 88th percentile. Their methodology covers seven management indicators  across 21 sustainability criteria  in four themes (environment  labour & human rights  ethics and sustainable procurement). It is based on leading standards  such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  and ISO 26000  and is overseen by an international scientific committee. The rating is based on our EVS policies  our actions and results  as well as inputs from third-party professionals and external stakeholders.Overall  I continue to feel cautiously optimistic about our future. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  supply chain challenges and with the war in Ukraine  I feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services. This represents a sound basis for our future growth.‚ÄùCommenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:‚ÄúWe continue our growth path  with strong order intake and revenue results  both being major drivers supporting our future potential. Our secured revenue position reinforces our ability to realize growth in 2022. As a consequence  we upgrade our revenue guidance for 2022 to a range of EUR 145 - 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. The production planning for the final quarter of the year is heavily loaded  but almost all the components have been sourced.In October 2022  we went live with a new ERP system. This new ERP will allow more flexibility in our end-to-end processes and will be a cornerstone to support our growth ambitions (including future acquisitions). The go live was successful  without any major business interruption. We are currently still operating in a hyper-care modus to ensure issues are addressed. Our priority in 4Q22 is on production and delivery of our client commitments.Operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  demonstrating an increase compared to last year following the inflation and cost of energy. As such  we do reiterate our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.‚ÄùEVS Market Dynamics and customer winsThe same trends still apply for 3Q22 in general as for the first semester for what concerns the market pillars with continuous modernization of LAB and upgrade of Live Service Providers equipment. The appetite for LiveCeption  MediaCeption and MediaInfra solutions continues  feeding the order book.The Big Tech contract 22 is obviously a major achievement as a proof point of confidence in the sustainability of EVS innovation. It‚Äôs also an important evolution showing that Live Service Providers are willing to engage in long term service level agreements. It finally brings higher predictability in terms of EVS revenues.After a successful NAB in April  EVS had the pleasure to present the new range of solutions ‚Äúin real life‚Äù at IBC in September with a strong presence of key customers from EMEA and APAC.EVS has also been preparing the major sport event in Middle-East scheduled for end of this year.The frictions between the electronic supply chain and the delivery of products are under control for the rest of the year.OutlookThe 2022 secured revenue on September 30th reaches EUR 143 8 million with the following split:Secured revenue excluding Big Event Rental of EUR 127 4 million versus EUR 111 9 million at the same date last year  a growth of +13 9%.Secured revenue for the Big Tech 2022 contract of EUR 6 6 million.Secured revenue for Big Event Rental of EUR 9 2 million  including a major international sport event happening in 4Q22.Thanks to the strong secured revenue  we are able to upgrade our full year revenue guidance to a range of EUR 145 ‚Äì 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. Due to the current delivery terms  we expect that only a limited number of orders that will be closed in 4Q22 will still generate a revenue impact within this fiscal year 2022.The order book for 2023 and beyond is demonstrating a substantial growth of +216%  also boosted by our Big Tech 2022 contract of over USD 50 million.The gross margin evolution is demonstrating a decline as a result of a change in the solution mix. Any impact of rising costs of components are reflected in the price increases modeled and announced in 2022.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored: inflation and increasing energy prices require us to be vigilant. We reconfirm our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.Interim dividendThe Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0 50 EUR per share. The ex-date will be November 23th  2022 (coupon #33) and the payment date will be November 25th  2022.This interim dividend fits in the overall dividend policy for 2022.

Even excluding the Big Tech 2022 contract  the growth is of +39 0% (BER not taken into account). In addition  the order intake for 2022 is strong across all regions.Big Tech contract 2022  a landmark in the history of EVS  signed in August 2022.Our secured revenue* allows us to upgrade our revenue guidance for 2022 to a range of EUR 145 million to EUR 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million.The OPEX guidance remains unchanged  with a growth projected between 12-15%*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2022CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:‚Äú I‚Äôm happy to say our Q3 achievements are confirming our revenue growth expectations for the full year 2022. As we have been able to further increase our order intake and solve most of our supply chain challenges this year  I‚Äôm confident to upgrade our revenue guidance to a range of EUR 145 million to EUR 150 million. This will represent a new record figure for EVS.With the signature of our largest contract ever  we are proud to say that we have added a new milestone in the history of EVS. This ‚ÄúBig Tech Contract 2022‚Äù covers a 10-year contract worth over $50 million with a major US-based broadcast and media production company. This agreement includes the delivery of EVS‚Äô live production  replays and highlights solution LiveCeption¬Æ  combined with a long-term service level agreement (SLA). It also provides our customer with multiple benefits including access to our latest technology innovations and upgrades for its installed base  a predictable operational spend  with a spread of capital expenditures over time  an easy way to plan for further expansion and a premium SLA. The agreement comes as big tech companies intensify the competition with linear networks to secure live sports content by spending billions of dollars to acquire media rights of the most prestigious pro sports leagues in North America.The positive and encouraging feedback we received from our customers and channel partners during our IBC trade show participation in Amsterdam earlier in September  provides us additional confidence that we are providing them with the right solutions and services to continue solving their current and future live video production needs. Our EVS Balanced Computing approach (a balanced combination strategy of ‚Äúon premises‚Äù and ‚Äúin the cloud services‚Äù) is clearly answering the specific needs and expectations of many LSP (Live Service Providers) and LAB (Live Audience Business) customers around the world.I‚Äôm particularly proud to say that our CSR efforts have translated into a first important recognition. EVS has been awarded a Silver medal for its sustainability performance from EcoVadis  one of the world‚Äôs largest providers of business sustainability ratings  placing EVS in the 88th percentile. Their methodology covers seven management indicators  across 21 sustainability criteria  in four themes (environment  labour & human rights  ethics and sustainable procurement). It is based on leading standards  such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  and ISO 26000  and is overseen by an international scientific committee. The rating is based on our EVS policies  our actions and results  as well as inputs from third-party professionals and external stakeholders.Overall  I continue to feel cautiously optimistic about our future. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  supply chain challenges and with the war in Ukraine  I feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services. This represents a sound basis for our future growth.‚ÄùCommenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:‚ÄúWe continue our growth path  with strong order intake and revenue results  both being major drivers supporting our future potential. Our secured revenue position reinforces our ability to realize growth in 2022. As a consequence  we upgrade our revenue guidance for 2022 to a range of EUR 145 - 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. The production planning for the final quarter of the year is heavily loaded  but almost all the components have been sourced.In October 2022  we went live with a new ERP system. This new ERP will allow more flexibility in our end-to-end processes and will be a cornerstone to support our growth ambitions (including future acquisitions). The go live was successful  without any major business interruption. We are currently still operating in a hyper-care modus to ensure issues are addressed. Our priority in 4Q22 is on production and delivery of our client commitments.Operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  demonstrating an increase compared to last year following the inflation and cost of energy. As such  we do reiterate our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.‚ÄùEVS Market Dynamics and customer winsThe same trends still apply for 3Q22 in general as for the first semester for what concerns the market pillars with continuous modernization of LAB and upgrade of Live Service Providers equipment. The appetite for LiveCeption  MediaCeption and MediaInfra solutions continues  feeding the order book.The Big Tech contract 22 is obviously a major achievement as a proof point of confidence in the sustainability of EVS innovation. It‚Äôs also an important evolution showing that Live Service Providers are willing to engage in long term service level agreements. It finally brings higher predictability in terms of EVS revenues.After a successful NAB in April  EVS had the pleasure to present the new range of solutions ‚Äúin real life‚Äù at IBC in September with a strong presence of key customers from EMEA and APAC.EVS has also been preparing the major sport event in Middle-East scheduled for end of this year.The frictions between the electronic supply chain and the delivery of products are under control for the rest of the year.OutlookThe 2022 secured revenue on September 30th reaches EUR 143 8 million with the following split:Secured revenue excluding Big Event Rental of EUR 127 4 million versus EUR 111 9 million at the same date last year  a growth of +13 9%.Secured revenue for the Big Tech 2022 contract of EUR 6 6 million.Secured revenue for Big Event Rental of EUR 9 2 million  including a major international sport event happening in 4Q22.Thanks to the strong secured revenue  we are able to upgrade our full year revenue guidance to a range of EUR 145 ‚Äì 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. Due to the current delivery terms  we expect that only a limited number of orders that will be closed in 4Q22 will still generate a revenue impact within this fiscal year 2022.The order book for 2023 and beyond is demonstrating a substantial growth of +216%  also boosted by our Big Tech 2022 contract of over USD 50 million.The gross margin evolution is demonstrating a decline as a result of a change in the solution mix. Any impact of rising costs of components are reflected in the price increases modeled and announced in 2022.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored: inflation and increasing energy prices require us to be vigilant. We reconfirm our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.Interim dividendThe Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0 50 EUR per share. The ex-date will be November 23th  2022 (coupon #33) and the payment date will be November 25th  2022.This interim dividend fits in the overall dividend policy for 2022.

Topline data are expected in the next few months.GENFIT then strengthened  diversified and expanded our Research and Development pipeline with the goal to capitalize on our expertise in bringing early stage assets up to pre-commercialization stages in liver diseases. Its new R&D strategy now focuses exclusively on liver diseases with high unmet medical need and significant market potential  with the in-licensing of the rights for a novel asset initially developed by Genoscience Pharma in CCA in December 2021  followed by the acquisition of the Swiss-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Versantis in September 2022  adding three additional assets positioned in ACLF  in HE and in UCD/OAD.Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT commented: ‚ÄùGENFIT‚Äôs perspectives have dramatically evolved over the last two years. Although the outcome was not what we had hoped for  GENFIT has greatly benefited from its work in NASH. We have acquired great know-how in liver disease specific research  from target identification to proprietary models. We also developed expertise in clinical development and regulatory affairs in emerging diseases. We have built solid networks with experts  academic institutions  patient associations  etc. It is this accumulated experience and established infrastructure that we are able to leverage now. The clinical development of elafibranor in PBC is nearing completion with high level results expected in Q2 next year. We see the signature of the related strategic partnership with Ipsen at the end of 2021 as further reason to be optimistic about elafibranor‚Äôs commercial outlook. The deal with Ipsen also gave us the financial means to make significant progress on our pipeline over the past nine months  as we executed two other deals with Genoscience and Versantis  continuing to execute our strategic roadmap. During our Pipeline Day  we were excited to host a deep dive into the new programs recently integrated into our pipeline and hear from leading experts  who provided valuable insights into the unmet medical needs of patients  as well as potential market opportunities. These presentations also outlined what we believe has been a transformative year for GENFIT  as we work with increased momentum to diversify our pipeline with innovative therapeutic opportunities for rare liver diseases.‚ÄùKey Expert Speakers included:Jennifer C.

This study was based on an extensive review of published literature as well as in-depth discussions with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) managing ACLF patients  with hospital pharmacists  hospital administrators  and managed care organizations (payers) in the US.Pipeline Program HighlightsNTZ and VS-01-ACLF for acute on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)ACLF is a syndrome that is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a pre-existing advanced chronic liver disease resulting in acute liver decompensation  liver failure and extrahepatic organ failure (brain  kidneys  cardiovascular and respiratory). ACLF is an underserved medical condition associated with short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days  depending on severity grade) and a significant cost of care for healthcare systems. No drugs have been approved in this indication so far. Conservative estimates lead to a current total addressable population of ~215 000 patients with ACLF across the US and EU5  a number expected to grow up to ~300 000 patients by 2036. The ACLF market size is estimated to be as high as $6bn (US and EU) by 2030 2 .. GENFIT is currently developing two programs in ACLF. The first one aims at evaluating the potential of the molecule nitazoxanide (NTZ). Preclinical data generated via several disease models highlighted the potential of NTZ with regards to inflammation  liver and kidney function  brain edema and survival in sepsis  and as such supported further clinical development. Phase 1 results in patients with hepatic impairment as well as patients with renal impairment will be disclosed in the coming months. The second program aims at evaluating VS-01-ACLF  a first-in-class innovative liposomal-based therapeutic product candidate for potential first-line therapy. A Phase 1 trial highlighted the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VS-01 and provided encouraging preliminary efficacy results  with >80% of treated patients improving or stabilizing their disease (Child-Pugh Score assessment). A Phase 2 Proof-of-concept study is expected to launch as early as 4Q22 (a 60-patient  randomized and controlled trial). VS-01-ACLF has been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in ACLF by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).VS-02-HE for hepatic encephalopathy (HE)HE is a nervous system disorder brought on by advanced chronic liver disease. It is one of the major complications of advanced liver disease and portal hypertension. 30%-40% of patients with cirrhosis will experience at least one episode of HE. The hepatic failure leads to the accumulation of the neurotoxin ammonia in the blood stream  ultimately leading to abnormally functioning neurons  and often coma. HE is associated with increased hospitalizations  recurrences  healthcare costs and mortality. It is a largely underdiagnosed and undertreated condition and is associated with poor quality of life. In the US only  2 million patients are believed to be at risk of developing HE and 200 000 patients are hospitalized yearly 3 . In Europe  incidence is close to 1 million patients. Standard of care with current treatments is associated with side effects and moderate efficacy. The estimated annual economic burden associated with HE in the US was $7.2bn in 2009 and around $12bn in 2014 4 . Estimates for global market size are as high as $4.1bn in 2026 5 ..

GENFIT is developing VS-02  a urease inhibitor currently in preclinical stage. It will be developed as a unique oral and colon-active formulation designed to minimize systemic absorption of ammonia and to act where ammonia is primarily produced  while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. The treatment goal is to reduce/stabilize the accumulation of ammonia in the blood and prevent rehospitalization. Investigational New Drug-enabling6 nonclinical studies are targeted for completion in 2025.GNS561 for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)CCA is a type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts that carry the digestive fluid bile and is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy accounting for approximately 15% of all primary liver tumors. Cases of CCA are usually asymptomatic in early stages and are therefore often diagnosed when the disease is already in advanced stages. The silent presentation of these tumors combined with their highly aggressive nature and being refractory to chemotherapy contribute to poor prognosis and high mortality  representing ~2% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide yearly. Although CCA is a rare cancer  its incidence (0.3‚Äì6 per 100 000 inhabitants per year) and mortality (1‚Äì6 per 100 000 inhabitants per year)  have been increasing in the past few decades worldwide  representing a global health problem. Although surgery is a potential curative option for CCA  most patients are diagnosed at late stages due to lack of specific symptoms. The majority of patients with CCA have metastatic or locally advanced (i.e. unresectable) disease at presentation  and only ‚àº25% are eligible for resection. When disease is unresectable  the current first-line treatment is chemotherapy. After progression on first-line chemotherapy  second-line treatments exist but despite the options presently available  the unmet need remains high due to limited benefits on survival. 9 000 new patients are diagnosed every year in the US  and 10 000 in EU5 7 . Based on available data  the global market size is evaluated at $1.2bn in 2021 and  with the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) at 12.5%  it is expected to reach $3.2bn in 2030 8 .. Based on available data  the global market size is evaluated at $1.2bn in 2021 and  with the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) at 12.5%  it is expected to reach $3.2bn in 2030 . GENFIT is developing GNS561  a small molecule PPT1 inhibitor that blocks cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting late stage autophagy leading to cell death9. It received ODD from the FDA in September 2022  confirming its potential in this disease area. First-In-Human effects of PPT1 inhibition following GNS561 administration in patients with primary and secondary liver cancers have been observed. The safety profile  exposure  and preliminary signal of activity support the investigation of GNS561 in combination. A Phase 1b/2 study is expected to be launched with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor in the near future in patients with KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutated cholangiocarcinoma who have failed treatment with first line treatment and who do not have an actionable mutation.VS-01-UCD for urea cycle disorder (UCD)/organic acidemia disorder (OAD)Patients suffering from UCD and OAD  which are two different groups of congenital metabolic diseases  have difficulties to metabolize ammonia. This is due to a deficiency in one of the six enzymes involved in the urea cycle  creating a situation where ammonia is not eliminated in the urine  ultimately leading to hyperammonemia attacks. Patients are usually diagnosed after they are born  via universal newborn screening tests. While these conditions are ultra-rare with 1 900 acute hyperammonemic crises in the US and EU5 per year 10   the mortality is very high as 75% will die after 5 years  and survivors will often have severe brain injuries. There is no acute treatment available for early onset crises  and neonatal hemodialysis is risky  highly invasive and widely unavailable. 45% of UCD patients remain untreated and no drug is currently approved for treatment of OAD. Based on available data  global market size in UCD and OAD is evaluated at $1.5bn in 2021  based on two drugs that have been approved in UCD but not in acute hyperammonemia 11 .  the mortality is very high as 75% will die after 5 years  and survivors will often have severe brain injuries. There is no acute treatment available for early onset crises  and neonatal hemodialysis is risky  highly invasive and widely unavailable. 45% of UCD patients remain untreated and no drug is currently approved for treatment of OAD. Based on available data  global market size in UCD and OAD is evaluated at $1.5bn in 2021  based on two drugs that have been approved in UCD but not in acute hyperammonemia . GENFIT is developing VS-01-UCD  a potential first-line lifesaving treatment for acute hyperammonemic crises. As the peritoneal route of administration is well adapted to pediatric patients  this treatment should be feasible in all hospitals and should be quickly implemented. This is a tremendous improvement over neonatal hemodialysis  which is only possible in specialized centers and is a long and complex procedure. ODD and Rare Pediatric Disease designation (RPDD) have been granted to VS-01 by the FDA for this indication. GENFIT is also potentially eligible to a Priority Review Voucher upon approval.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

13392,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forfarmers-n-v-forfarmers-announces-060000502.html,ForFarmers N.V.: ForFarmers announces revised Strategy 2025,Lochem  17 November 2022 ForFarmers announces revised Strategy 2025 In order to be better able to respond to rapidly changing market conditions ForFarmers...,"ForFarmers N.V.Lochem  17 November 2022ForFarmers announces revised Strategy 2025In order to be better able to respond to rapidly changing market conditions ForFarmers has taken a fresh look at the basic principles of its Strategy 2025. This review has resulted in five more focused strategic principles whereby the emphasis is on an even more local market approach  differentiation and sustainability-focused innovation of feed concepts. ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025.Since the launch of the strategy in 2020 the emphasis on making the agricultural sector more sustainable has grown  partly due to the accelerated proposal and implementation of measures under the EU Green Deal. In addition  prices of raw materials and energy have increased and become even more volatile  also as a result of the war in Ukraine. This has made it more difficult to pass on fluctuations in raw material prices. At the same time the current market conditions call for more consolidation and cooperation in the supply chain  from feed manufacturer to retailer.Five more focused strategic principlesForFarmers has the knowledge  expertise and resources to strengthen its position amid the changing market conditions. Its mission  For the Future of Farming  continues to be the guiding principle through which the company is fully focused on a sustainable livestock farming industry  both ecologically and economically. In anticipation of the strategy review  ForFarmers last year adjusted the way it works  assigning more responsibility to the local management teams. This provides the foundation for meeting the first principle of the revised strategy: the local teams are leading  to enable ForFarmers to work even more closely to the customer. The teams are supported by the central departments and draw on the knowledge and experience that is present within the group  for example in the area of innovation. The organisation will be adapted to this way of working.Secondly  in the current market conditions ForFarmers is uniquely well placed to distinguish itself in each individual market and segment in providing a differentiated offering  driven by the local situation of each sector. The offering can range from total solutions to optimise returns  to supplying specific products that best meet the livestock farmer‚Äôs needs amid challenging market conditions.Thirdly  ForFarmers will focus more emphatically on sustainable solutions which address wider societal issues such as the use of alternative raw materials  circularity and further reducing nitrogen and other emissions. In this context ForFarmers will intensify its efforts aimed at cooperation between the supply chain parties in the various markets. This cooperation is important both ecologically and economically and constitutes the fourth principle.Finally  ForFarmers will remain true to the ‚Äì fifth ‚Äì principle  which is to supply good feed at competitive prices that contribute to business profitability for both ForFarmers and its customers. For this  ForFarmers continues to focus on optimally efficient and effective business processes.Story continuesMergers and acquisitions: strengthening and broadeningIn order to strengthen or broaden selective positions in home markets as well as to enter new markets with added growth potential  ForFarmers is looking for opportunities for mergers with or acquisitions of candidates that are a good cultural fit (in terms of both country and business).Transition to further sustainabilityThe livestock farming industry is faced with the challenge of feeding an ever-growing number of people while at the same time reducing the impact that the production of animal proteins has on the climate and on nature. In its Strategy 2025  reflected in the third and fourth principle  ForFarmers is therefore giving the Going Circular sustainability agenda an extra boost. Accordingly  in order to create even more focus  a new organisation is formed that includes the activities of Reudink (organic feed) and the co-products to develop and market concepts that address societal concerns regarding matters such as climate  animal welfare and former food stuffs. We will start with this in the Netherlands. Examples include concepts which use alternative raw materials or incorporate more moist co-products and residual flows from the food industry. Concepts such as these are an essential factor in establishing collaborative partnerships in the supply chain  from feed company to retailer. Such concepts are also crucial to livestock farmers and other stakeholders in pursuing the current trend towards net zero.#ProudtobeForFarmersAs part of the strategy review we have adjusted our core values. The success of the strategy is largely dependent on the attitude and efforts of employees and management. Our values Passionate  Responsible  Open-minded  United and Delivering are more than just words to ForFarmers; they provide a concrete guideline for our daily interactions with customers  chain partners  stakeholders ‚Äì and each other.Financial objectiveWith this revised strategy ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025  barring unforeseen events. The company will refrain from making statements about (annual) targets for the development of underlying EBITDA in view of the changing markets  in which important policy decisions are still forthcoming  as well as the continuing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.The dividend policy will remain unchanged and is aimed at distributing a cash dividend of between 40% and 60% of underlying net profit.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For further information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director of Investor RelationsT: 0031 573 288 000 M: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAdditional information on Strategy 2025ForFarmers will today provide additional information on its revised Strategy 2025 to those invited  including analysts.

It corresponds to the Parrot Group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  no revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.For several consecutive quarters  the Group has seen the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  focused on professional uses for equipment and solutions  and is ramping up its growth  supported by a favorable geopolitical context for the deployment of drone technologies. Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of the year climbed to ‚Ç¨52.4m  up 35%  with 115% growth based on the reference scope1.Story continuesDuring this third quarter  the Group‚Äôs activities were marked by:The 137% increase in micro-drone revenues (+131% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨13.9m reflects the strong sales growth for ANAFI USA professional micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai. The ANAFI USA is benefiting from new orders from NATO countries (including the United Kingdom  Spain and the United States) as well as the continued deliveries for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). To date  450 systems have already been delivered to the French armed forces  representing just over half of the total planned under the European call for tenders from February 2020  which is due to end in 2024. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its micro-drones  made possible by the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  further strengthened by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 38% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+23% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨8.1m for the third quarter of 2022. The business is being supported by the acceleration in sales for the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020  the international development of the sales and marketing strategy  and the continued increase in the number of users. Pix4D Mapper  the longstanding solution  is continuing to build on its growth  while new equipment  making it possible to further enhance the precision of the data used  is responding to increasingly advanced use cases.Outlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to move forward with confidence as it rolls out its strategy focused on professional micro-drones and solutions  while remaining vigilant concerning the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its micro-drones  Parrot has further strengthened its coordination between R&D  procurement and production tracking.

The European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for Enjaymo¬Æ (sutimlimab) for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD)  a rare  serious  and chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia  where the body‚Äôs immune system mistakenly attacks healthy red blood cells and causes their rupture  known as hemolysis.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDChief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi‚ÄúThis approval highlights our ambition to develop first- and best-in-class medicines that transform people‚Äôs lives. Up until now  patients in Europe had to rely on a combination of cold avoidance  blood transfusions and off-label treatments to manage their disease. The approval of Enjaymo by the European Commission provides patients  for the first time  with access to a therapy that can make a meaningful difference in the treatment and daily experience of living with CAD.‚ÄùEnjaymo is currently the only approved treatment for CAD and is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to selectively target and inhibit the classical complement pathway specific serine protease  C1s. It will be available as a 50mg/mL solution for infusion.Alexander R√∂th  MDDepartment of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation  University Hospital  University of Duisburg-Essen  Germany‚ÄúCoupled with diagnostic journeys that can last years  the impact of fatigue on quality of life in CAD is often debilitating and is comparable to conditions such as cancer-related anemia and other autoimmune disorders. Clinicians now have a much-needed therapeutic option to offer to their patients.‚ÄùAbout the CADENZA and CARDINAL Clinical TrialsThe EC approval is based on data from two Phase 3 clinical trials: CADENZA  a double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial of adults with CAD without a recent history of blood transfusion (within the past 6 months)  and CARDINAL  a 26-week open label  single-arm pivotal study in patients with CAD who have had a recent blood transfusion.Story continuesIn the CADENZA Part A trial  eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a fixed weight-based dose (6.5g or 7.5g) of Enjaymo or placebo via intravenous infusion on Day 0  Day 7  and then once every other week up to Week 26. The open-label Part B of the study assessed long-term safety as well as durability of response to Enjaymo in patients with CAD. In the CADENZA Part A study  Enjaymo met its primary composite endpoint and all secondary endpoints and demonstrated inhibition of hemolysis  increase in hemoglobin levels  and clinically meaningful improvement in The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scores. Enjaymo demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was generally well-tolerated. 96% of patients in the Enjaymo group and 100% of patients in the placebo group experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). Headache (22.7% vs 10.0%)  hypertension (22.7% vs 0%)  rhinitis (18.2% vs 0%)  Raynaud phenomenon (18.2% vs 0%)  and acrocyanosis (13.6% vs 0%) were reported more frequently in Enajymo-treated patients compared with placebo.In the CARDINAL Part A trial  patients received a fixed weight-based dose (6.5g or 7.5g) of Enjaymo via intravenous infusion on Day 0  Day 7  and then once every other week up to Week 26. Part B of the study evaluated the long-term safety as well as durability of response to Enjaymo in patients with CAD over a 2-year follow up. In the CARDINAL Part A study  the efficacy of Enjaymo was assessed based on the achievement of a primary composite endpoint (Hb‚â•12 g/dL or an increase of at least 2 g/dL; no blood transfusion or prohibited medications from Weeks 5 through 26) and different secondary endpoints  including improvements in hemoglobin  normalization of bilirubin  and FACIT-fatigue score. The most common adverse reactions occurring in 10% or more of patients were respiratory tract infection  viral infection  diarrhea  dyspepsia  cough  arthralgia  arthritis  and peripheral edema. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 13% (3/24) of patients who received Enjaymo. These serious adverse reactions were streptococcal sepsis and staphylococcal wound infection (n=1)  arthralgia (n=1)  and respiratory tract infection (n=1).About Enjaymo¬Æ (sutimlimab)Enjaymo is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to selectively target and inhibit C1s in the classical complement pathway  which is part of the innate immune system. By blocking C1s  Enjaymo inhibits the activation of the complement cascade in the immune system and inhibits C1-activated hemolysis in CAD to prevent the abnormal destruction of healthy red blood cells. Enjaymo does not inhibit the lectin and alternative pathways. Enjaymo was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2022 as the first and only treatment indicated to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion due to hemolysis in adults with CAD. The Japanese Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare approved Enjaymo in June 2022. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also made the decision to maintain orphan designation.About cold agglutinin diseaseCold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia  where part of the body‚Äôs immune system mistakenly destroys healthy red blood cells (hemolysis). CAD impacts the lives of an estimated 12 000 people in the US  Europe  and Japan and is associated with profound fatigue and increased risk of thromboembolic events and mortality.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people‚Äôs lives.

As our world continues to evolve  we believe in engaging the hospitality industry with knowledge  insights  and strategies to collectively forge a successful path forward. Change never happens without relative impact  and there are indeed times when so much is happening  it becomes difficult to decipher a passing fad from a genuine shift. We closely examine the shifts taking place  provide insights on the nuances and conflicting developments  and highlight potential opportunities for growth and innovation. We invite you to become part of the conversation.Change is here to stay. And just when you get used to things  change happens again. And again. And again. There‚Äôs simply no escaping it. Rather than trying to ignore change  what if we embraced and welcomed it for the new possibilities it presents?

An initial target to cut total direct emissions from 2016 levels by 30% by 2030 was confirmed in 2019. This was updated to 50% in 2021 and again to 59% in August this year following considerable action and a continuous assessment of DSM's plans to achieve net-zero by 2050 if not sooner. This new target is now validated alongside the plans to achieve it by the SBTi. As part of this ambition  DSM is already aiming to source 100% of its electricity worldwide from renewable sources by 2030.Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEOs of DSM  said: ""It is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C but the latest climate science warns we are dangerously close to exceeding that threshold. The urgency for action has been repeated throughout the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 so aligning with the science is the responsibility of all businesses everywhere. As a long-term leader in climate advocacy  we routinely evaluate what DSM can do to go further and faster towards net-zero and this independent validation by the Science Based Targets initiative gives us confidence that we are on the right track.""The SBTi is a collaboration between the United Nations Global Compact  World Resources Institute (WRI)  the CDP and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to drive ambitious corporate climate action.DSM was one of the first companies to align its efforts with the science presented in the IPCC Special Report 'Global Warming of 1.5¬∞C' of 2019 and immediately set a pathway to reach net-zero GHG emissions across its operations and value chains by 2050. DSM's science-based targets are the foundation to achieve this goal  supported by ambitions on renewable electricity and energy efficiency  as well as intense work with key suppliers and customers.DSMRoyal DSM is a global  purpose-led company in Health  Nutrition & Bioscience  applying science to improve the health of people  animals and the planet.

This review has resulted in five more focused strategic principles whereby the emphasis is on an even more local market approach  differentiation and sustainability-focused innovation of feed concepts. ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025.Since the launch of the strategy in 2020 the emphasis on making the agricultural sector more sustainable has grown  partly due to the accelerated proposal and implementation of measures under the EU Green Deal. In addition  prices of raw materials and energy have increased and become even more volatile  also as a result of the war in Ukraine. This has made it more difficult to pass on fluctuations in raw material prices. At the same time the current market conditions call for more consolidation and cooperation in the supply chain  from feed manufacturer to retailer.Five more focused strategic principlesForFarmers has the knowledge  expertise and resources to strengthen its position amid the changing market conditions. Its mission  For the Future of Farming  continues to be the guiding principle through which the company is fully focused on a sustainable livestock farming industry  both ecologically and economically. In anticipation of the strategy review  ForFarmers last year adjusted the way it works  assigning more responsibility to the local management teams. This provides the foundation for meeting the first principle of the revised strategy: the local teams are leading  to enable ForFarmers to work even more closely to the customer. The teams are supported by the central departments and draw on the knowledge and experience that is present within the group  for example in the area of innovation. The organisation will be adapted to this way of working.Secondly  in the current market conditions ForFarmers is uniquely well placed to distinguish itself in each individual market and segment in providing a differentiated offering  driven by the local situation of each sector. The offering can range from total solutions to optimise returns  to supplying specific products that best meet the livestock farmer‚Äôs needs amid challenging market conditions.Thirdly  ForFarmers will focus more emphatically on sustainable solutions which address wider societal issues such as the use of alternative raw materials  circularity and further reducing nitrogen and other emissions. In this context ForFarmers will intensify its efforts aimed at cooperation between the supply chain parties in the various markets. This cooperation is important both ecologically and economically and constitutes the fourth principle.Finally  ForFarmers will remain true to the ‚Äì fifth ‚Äì principle  which is to supply good feed at competitive prices that contribute to business profitability for both ForFarmers and its customers. For this  ForFarmers continues to focus on optimally efficient and effective business processes.Mergers and acquisitions: strengthening and broadeningIn order to strengthen or broaden selective positions in home markets as well as to enter new markets with added growth potential  ForFarmers is looking for opportunities for mergers with or acquisitions of candidates that are a good cultural fit (in terms of both country and business).Transition to further sustainabilityThe livestock farming industry is faced with the challenge of feeding an ever-growing number of people while at the same time reducing the impact that the production of animal proteins has on the climate and on nature. In its Strategy 2025  reflected in the third and fourth principle  ForFarmers is therefore giving the Going Circular sustainability agenda an extra boost. Accordingly  in order to create even more focus  a new organisation is formed that includes the activities of Reudink (organic feed) and the co-products to develop and market concepts that address societal concerns regarding matters such as climate  animal welfare and former food stuffs. We will start with this in the Netherlands. Examples include concepts which use alternative raw materials or incorporate more moist co-products and residual flows from the food industry. Concepts such as these are an essential factor in establishing collaborative partnerships in the supply chain  from feed company to retailer. Such concepts are also crucial to livestock farmers and other stakeholders in pursuing the current trend towards net zero.#ProudtobeForFarmersAs part of the strategy review we have adjusted our core values. The success of the strategy is largely dependent on the attitude and efforts of employees and management. Our values Passionate  Responsible  Open-minded  United and Delivering are more than just words to ForFarmers; they provide a concrete guideline for our daily interactions with customers  chain partners  stakeholders ‚Äì and each other.Financial objectiveWith this revised strategy ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025  barring unforeseen events. The company will refrain from making statements about (annual) targets for the development of underlying EBITDA in view of the changing markets  in which important policy decisions are still forthcoming  as well as the continuing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.The dividend policy will remain unchanged and is aimed at distributing a cash dividend of between 40% and 60% of underlying net profit.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For further information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director of Investor RelationsT: 0031 573 288 000 M: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAdditional information on Strategy 2025ForFarmers will today provide additional information on its revised Strategy 2025 to those invited  including analysts.

It corresponds to the Parrot Group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  no revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.For several consecutive quarters  the Group has seen the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  focused on professional uses for equipment and solutions  and is ramping up its growth  supported by a favorable geopolitical context for the deployment of drone technologies. Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of the year climbed to ‚Ç¨52.4m  up 35%  with 115% growth based on the reference scope1.During this third quarter  the Group‚Äôs activities were marked by:The 137% increase in micro-drone revenues (+131% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨13.9m reflects the strong sales growth for ANAFI USA professional micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai. The ANAFI USA is benefiting from new orders from NATO countries (including the United Kingdom  Spain and the United States) as well as the continued deliveries for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). To date  450 systems have already been delivered to the French armed forces  representing just over half of the total planned under the European call for tenders from February 2020  which is due to end in 2024. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its micro-drones  made possible by the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  further strengthened by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 38% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+23% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨8.1m for the third quarter of 2022. The business is being supported by the acceleration in sales for the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020  the international development of the sales and marketing strategy  and the continued increase in the number of users. Pix4D Mapper  the longstanding solution  is continuing to build on its growth  while new equipment  making it possible to further enhance the precision of the data used  is responding to increasingly advanced use cases.Outlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to move forward with confidence as it rolls out its strategy focused on professional micro-drones and solutions  while remaining vigilant concerning the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its micro-drones  Parrot has further strengthened its coordination between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations is being combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives could limit the company‚Äôs performance.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its ‚Äúnew scope‚Äù and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Change in revenues over nine monthsRevenues (‚Ç¨m and % of revenues) 20229 months 20219 months Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 29.2 56% 14.1 36% 108% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 1.0 2% 7.1 18% -87% 6.2 11% C Pix4D 23.2 44% 17.5 45% 32% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.5 1% 0.3 1% 102% 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations (0.5) -1% -0.8 -2% -32% -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - 0% 7.7 20% -100% 7.7 14% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 52.4 100% 38.8 100% 35% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 51.5 98% 24.0 62% 115% 40.4 74%Next financial date2022 full-year earnings: Thursday March 16  2023ABOUT PARROTParrot is Europe's leading commercial UAV group.

BirdLife International has identified threats to familiar bird species  such as industrial farming  logging  invasive species  hunting & trapping  and climate change. They partner with solution-based organisations to help reverse the effects that humans have had on these species that are under threat.BirdLife and its partners work in multiple ways to keep common birds common. One important way is by monitoring the conservation status of all birds for the IUCN's Red List of Species. (LINK https://www.birdlife.org/projects/red-list/)Only by immediately flagging when common birds begin to decline can they then initiate the conservation actions necessary to keep the population thriving. Around the globe they also work to protect the habitats where birds can thrive  whether that's forests  grasslands  the seas or wetlands. Like humans  birds need safe shelter from life's threats and hardships. And they work hard to protect those habitats in networks as birds know no borders - so each of the planet's eight major flyways are of critical importance as nature's necklaces. Finally  they work to reform and tackle those aspects of society's systems which threaten birds - this can range from making buildings bird-collision proof  to reforming industrial agriculture or deforestation  or siting energy infrastructure  both renewable and conventional  so birds are not placed in peril.What will the donation from Redbreast fans lead to? In the words of BirdLife International:""Project Wingman is part of our broad and critical efforts to raise public awareness of the importance of birds and nature in general. Without public engagement supporting and caring about the diverse work we do  we cannot be as effective as we need to be. Campaigning on behalf of birds and biodiversity is considerably strengthened by Project Wingman and Redbreast Whiskey.""Take a deeper look at BirdLife International here .About Redbreast Irish WhiskeyFor more than a century  Redbreast has stayed true to the single pot still whiskey making tradition and today is considered to be the definitive expression of this quintessential style of Irish whiskey.
