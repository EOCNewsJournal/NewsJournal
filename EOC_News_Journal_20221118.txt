Even excluding the Big Tech 2022 contract  the growth is of +39 0% (BER not taken into account). In addition  the order intake for 2022 is strong across all regions.Big Tech contract 2022  a landmark in the history of EVS  signed in August 2022.Our secured revenue* allows us to upgrade our revenue guidance for 2022 to a range of EUR 145 million to EUR 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million.The OPEX guidance remains unchanged  with a growth projected between 12-15%*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2022CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:‚Äú I‚Äôm happy to say our Q3 achievements are confirming our revenue growth expectations for the full year 2022. As we have been able to further increase our order intake and solve most of our supply chain challenges this year  I‚Äôm confident to upgrade our revenue guidance to a range of EUR 145 million to EUR 150 million. This will represent a new record figure for EVS.With the signature of our largest contract ever  we are proud to say that we have added a new milestone in the history of EVS. This ‚ÄúBig Tech Contract 2022‚Äù covers a 10-year contract worth over $50 million with a major US-based broadcast and media production company. This agreement includes the delivery of EVS‚Äô live production  replays and highlights solution LiveCeption¬Æ  combined with a long-term service level agreement (SLA). It also provides our customer with multiple benefits including access to our latest technology innovations and upgrades for its installed base  a predictable operational spend  with a spread of capital expenditures over time  an easy way to plan for further expansion and a premium SLA. The agreement comes as big tech companies intensify the competition with linear networks to secure live sports content by spending billions of dollars to acquire media rights of the most prestigious pro sports leagues in North America.Story continuesThe positive and encouraging feedback we received from our customers and channel partners during our IBC trade show participation in Amsterdam earlier in September  provides us additional confidence that we are providing them with the right solutions and services to continue solving their current and future live video production needs. Our EVS Balanced Computing approach (a balanced combination strategy of ‚Äúon premises‚Äù and ‚Äúin the cloud services‚Äù) is clearly answering the specific needs and expectations of many LSP (Live Service Providers) and LAB (Live Audience Business) customers around the world.I‚Äôm particularly proud to say that our CSR efforts have translated into a first important recognition. EVS has been awarded a Silver medal for its sustainability performance from EcoVadis  one of the world‚Äôs largest providers of business sustainability ratings  placing EVS in the 88th percentile. Their methodology covers seven management indicators  across 21 sustainability criteria  in four themes (environment  labour & human rights  ethics and sustainable procurement). It is based on leading standards  such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  and ISO 26000  and is overseen by an international scientific committee. The rating is based on our EVS policies  our actions and results  as well as inputs from third-party professionals and external stakeholders.Overall  I continue to feel cautiously optimistic about our future. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  supply chain challenges and with the war in Ukraine  I feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services. This represents a sound basis for our future growth.‚ÄùCommenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:‚ÄúWe continue our growth path  with strong order intake and revenue results  both being major drivers supporting our future potential. Our secured revenue position reinforces our ability to realize growth in 2022. As a consequence  we upgrade our revenue guidance for 2022 to a range of EUR 145 - 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. The production planning for the final quarter of the year is heavily loaded  but almost all the components have been sourced.In October 2022  we went live with a new ERP system. This new ERP will allow more flexibility in our end-to-end processes and will be a cornerstone to support our growth ambitions (including future acquisitions). The go live was successful  without any major business interruption. We are currently still operating in a hyper-care modus to ensure issues are addressed. Our priority in 4Q22 is on production and delivery of our client commitments.Operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  demonstrating an increase compared to last year following the inflation and cost of energy. As such  we do reiterate our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.‚ÄùEVS Market Dynamics and customer winsThe same trends still apply for 3Q22 in general as for the first semester for what concerns the market pillars with continuous modernization of LAB and upgrade of Live Service Providers equipment. The appetite for LiveCeption  MediaCeption and MediaInfra solutions continues  feeding the order book.The Big Tech contract 22 is obviously a major achievement as a proof point of confidence in the sustainability of EVS innovation. It‚Äôs also an important evolution showing that Live Service Providers are willing to engage in long term service level agreements. It finally brings higher predictability in terms of EVS revenues.After a successful NAB in April  EVS had the pleasure to present the new range of solutions ‚Äúin real life‚Äù at IBC in September with a strong presence of key customers from EMEA and APAC.EVS has also been preparing the major sport event in Middle-East scheduled for end of this year.The frictions between the electronic supply chain and the delivery of products are under control for the rest of the year.OutlookThe 2022 secured revenue on September 30th reaches EUR 143 8 million with the following split:Secured revenue excluding Big Event Rental of EUR 127 4 million versus EUR 111 9 million at the same date last year  a growth of +13 9%.Secured revenue for the Big Tech 2022 contract of EUR 6 6 million.Secured revenue for Big Event Rental of EUR 9 2 million  including a major international sport event happening in 4Q22.Thanks to the strong secured revenue  we are able to upgrade our full year revenue guidance to a range of EUR 145 ‚Äì 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. Due to the current delivery terms  we expect that only a limited number of orders that will be closed in 4Q22 will still generate a revenue impact within this fiscal year 2022.The order book for 2023 and beyond is demonstrating a substantial growth of +216%  also boosted by our Big Tech 2022 contract of over USD 50 million.The gross margin evolution is demonstrating a decline as a result of a change in the solution mix. Any impact of rising costs of components are reflected in the price increases modeled and announced in 2022.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored: inflation and increasing energy prices require us to be vigilant. We reconfirm our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.Interim dividendThe Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0 50 EUR per share. The ex-date will be November 23th  2022 (coupon #33) and the payment date will be November 25th  2022.This interim dividend fits in the overall dividend policy for 2022.

The fact that the government is effectively fixing electricity [and] gas unit prices below wholesale costs until next April means this is probably as high as it will get  though admittedly we expect headline rates to stay in double-digits until at least February next year.‚Äù ‚Äì James Smith  economist at INGOther European indexes including France‚Äôs CAC 40 and Germany‚Äôs DAX are down over 0.5% and 1%  respectively.

Our EVS Balanced Computing approach (a balanced combination strategy of ‚Äúon premises‚Äù and ‚Äúin the cloud services‚Äù) is clearly answering the specific needs and expectations of many LSP (Live Service Providers) and LAB (Live Audience Business) customers around the world.I‚Äôm particularly proud to say that our CSR efforts have translated into a first important recognition. EVS has been awarded a Silver medal for its sustainability performance from EcoVadis  one of the world‚Äôs largest providers of business sustainability ratings  placing EVS in the 88th percentile. Their methodology covers seven management indicators  across 21 sustainability criteria  in four themes (environment  labour & human rights  ethics and sustainable procurement). It is based on leading standards  such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  and ISO 26000  and is overseen by an international scientific committee. The rating is based on our EVS policies  our actions and results  as well as inputs from third-party professionals and external stakeholders.Overall  I continue to feel cautiously optimistic about our future. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  supply chain challenges and with the war in Ukraine  I feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services. This represents a sound basis for our future growth.‚ÄùCommenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:‚ÄúWe continue our growth path  with strong order intake and revenue results  both being major drivers supporting our future potential. Our secured revenue position reinforces our ability to realize growth in 2022. As a consequence  we upgrade our revenue guidance for 2022 to a range of EUR 145 - 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. The production planning for the final quarter of the year is heavily loaded  but almost all the components have been sourced.In October 2022  we went live with a new ERP system. This new ERP will allow more flexibility in our end-to-end processes and will be a cornerstone to support our growth ambitions (including future acquisitions). The go live was successful  without any major business interruption. We are currently still operating in a hyper-care modus to ensure issues are addressed. Our priority in 4Q22 is on production and delivery of our client commitments.Operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  demonstrating an increase compared to last year following the inflation and cost of energy. As such  we do reiterate our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.‚ÄùEVS Market Dynamics and customer winsThe same trends still apply for 3Q22 in general as for the first semester for what concerns the market pillars with continuous modernization of LAB and upgrade of Live Service Providers equipment. The appetite for LiveCeption  MediaCeption and MediaInfra solutions continues  feeding the order book.The Big Tech contract 22 is obviously a major achievement as a proof point of confidence in the sustainability of EVS innovation. It‚Äôs also an important evolution showing that Live Service Providers are willing to engage in long term service level agreements. It finally brings higher predictability in terms of EVS revenues.After a successful NAB in April  EVS had the pleasure to present the new range of solutions ‚Äúin real life‚Äù at IBC in September with a strong presence of key customers from EMEA and APAC.EVS has also been preparing the major sport event in Middle-East scheduled for end of this year.The frictions between the electronic supply chain and the delivery of products are under control for the rest of the year.OutlookThe 2022 secured revenue on September 30th reaches EUR 143 8 million with the following split:Secured revenue excluding Big Event Rental of EUR 127 4 million versus EUR 111 9 million at the same date last year  a growth of +13 9%.Secured revenue for the Big Tech 2022 contract of EUR 6 6 million.Secured revenue for Big Event Rental of EUR 9 2 million  including a major international sport event happening in 4Q22.Thanks to the strong secured revenue  we are able to upgrade our full year revenue guidance to a range of EUR 145 ‚Äì 150 million  representing the high-end of the guidance previously communicated of EUR 140 ‚Äì 150 million. Due to the current delivery terms  we expect that only a limited number of orders that will be closed in 4Q22 will still generate a revenue impact within this fiscal year 2022.The order book for 2023 and beyond is demonstrating a substantial growth of +216%  also boosted by our Big Tech 2022 contract of over USD 50 million.The gross margin evolution is demonstrating a decline as a result of a change in the solution mix. Any impact of rising costs of components are reflected in the price increases modeled and announced in 2022.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored: inflation and increasing energy prices require us to be vigilant. We reconfirm our guidance of full year OPEX growth in a range of 12-15%.Interim dividendThe Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0 50 EUR per share. The ex-date will be November 23th  2022 (coupon #33) and the payment date will be November 25th  2022.This interim dividend fits in the overall dividend policy for 2022.

Topline data are expected in the next few months.GENFIT then strengthened  diversified and expanded our Research and Development pipeline with the goal to capitalize on our expertise in bringing early stage assets up to pre-commercialization stages in liver diseases. Its new R&D strategy now focuses exclusively on liver diseases with high unmet medical need and significant market potential  with the in-licensing of the rights for a novel asset initially developed by Genoscience Pharma in CCA in December 2021  followed by the acquisition of the Swiss-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Versantis in September 2022  adding three additional assets positioned in ACLF  in HE and in UCD/OAD.Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT commented: ‚ÄùGENFIT‚Äôs perspectives have dramatically evolved over the last two years. Although the outcome was not what we had hoped for  GENFIT has greatly benefited from its work in NASH. We have acquired great know-how in liver disease specific research  from target identification to proprietary models. We also developed expertise in clinical development and regulatory affairs in emerging diseases. We have built solid networks with experts  academic institutions  patient associations  etc. It is this accumulated experience and established infrastructure that we are able to leverage now. The clinical development of elafibranor in PBC is nearing completion with high level results expected in Q2 next year. We see the signature of the related strategic partnership with Ipsen at the end of 2021 as further reason to be optimistic about elafibranor‚Äôs commercial outlook. The deal with Ipsen also gave us the financial means to make significant progress on our pipeline over the past nine months  as we executed two other deals with Genoscience and Versantis  continuing to execute our strategic roadmap. During our Pipeline Day  we were excited to host a deep dive into the new programs recently integrated into our pipeline and hear from leading experts  who provided valuable insights into the unmet medical needs of patients  as well as potential market opportunities. These presentations also outlined what we believe has been a transformative year for GENFIT  as we work with increased momentum to diversify our pipeline with innovative therapeutic opportunities for rare liver diseases.‚ÄùKey Expert Speakers included:Jennifer C.

This study was based on an extensive review of published literature as well as in-depth discussions with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) managing ACLF patients  with hospital pharmacists  hospital administrators  and managed care organizations (payers) in the US.Pipeline Program HighlightsNTZ and VS-01-ACLF for acute on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)ACLF is a syndrome that is characterized by an abrupt life-threatening worsening of a pre-existing advanced chronic liver disease resulting in acute liver decompensation  liver failure and extrahepatic organ failure (brain  kidneys  cardiovascular and respiratory). ACLF is an underserved medical condition associated with short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days  depending on severity grade) and a significant cost of care for healthcare systems. No drugs have been approved in this indication so far. Conservative estimates lead to a current total addressable population of ~215 000 patients with ACLF across the US and EU5  a number expected to grow up to ~300 000 patients by 2036. The ACLF market size is estimated to be as high as $6bn (US and EU) by 2030 2 .. GENFIT is currently developing two programs in ACLF. The first one aims at evaluating the potential of the molecule nitazoxanide (NTZ). Preclinical data generated via several disease models highlighted the potential of NTZ with regards to inflammation  liver and kidney function  brain edema and survival in sepsis  and as such supported further clinical development. Phase 1 results in patients with hepatic impairment as well as patients with renal impairment will be disclosed in the coming months. The second program aims at evaluating VS-01-ACLF  a first-in-class innovative liposomal-based therapeutic product candidate for potential first-line therapy. A Phase 1 trial highlighted the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VS-01 and provided encouraging preliminary efficacy results  with >80% of treated patients improving or stabilizing their disease (Child-Pugh Score assessment). A Phase 2 Proof-of-concept study is expected to launch as early as 4Q22 (a 60-patient  randomized and controlled trial). VS-01-ACLF has been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in ACLF by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).VS-02-HE for hepatic encephalopathy (HE)HE is a nervous system disorder brought on by advanced chronic liver disease. It is one of the major complications of advanced liver disease and portal hypertension. 30%-40% of patients with cirrhosis will experience at least one episode of HE. The hepatic failure leads to the accumulation of the neurotoxin ammonia in the blood stream  ultimately leading to abnormally functioning neurons  and often coma. HE is associated with increased hospitalizations  recurrences  healthcare costs and mortality. It is a largely underdiagnosed and undertreated condition and is associated with poor quality of life. In the US only  2 million patients are believed to be at risk of developing HE and 200 000 patients are hospitalized yearly 3 . In Europe  incidence is close to 1 million patients. Standard of care with current treatments is associated with side effects and moderate efficacy. The estimated annual economic burden associated with HE in the US was $7.2bn in 2009 and around $12bn in 2014 4 . Estimates for global market size are as high as $4.1bn in 2026 5 .. In Europe  incidence is close to 1 million patients. Standard of care with current treatments is associated with side effects and moderate efficacy. The estimated annual economic burden associated with HE in the US was $7.2bn in 2009 and around $12bn in 2014 . Estimates for global market size are as high as $4.1bn in 2026 . GENFIT is developing VS-02  a urease inhibitor currently in preclinical stage. It will be developed as a unique oral and colon-active formulation designed to minimize systemic absorption of ammonia and to act where ammonia is primarily produced  while reducing glutamine levels in the brain. The treatment goal is to reduce/stabilize the accumulation of ammonia in the blood and prevent rehospitalization. Investigational New Drug-enabling6 nonclinical studies are targeted for completion in 2025.GNS561 for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)CCA is a type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts that carry the digestive fluid bile and is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy accounting for approximately 15% of all primary liver tumors. Cases of CCA are usually asymptomatic in early stages and are therefore often diagnosed when the disease is already in advanced stages. The silent presentation of these tumors combined with their highly aggressive nature and being refractory to chemotherapy contribute to poor prognosis and high mortality  representing ~2% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide yearly. Although CCA is a rare cancer  its incidence (0.3‚Äì6 per 100 000 inhabitants per year) and mortality (1‚Äì6 per 100 000 inhabitants per year)  have been increasing in the past few decades worldwide  representing a global health problem. Although surgery is a potential curative option for CCA  most patients are diagnosed at late stages due to lack of specific symptoms. The majority of patients with CCA have metastatic or locally advanced (i.e. unresectable) disease at presentation  and only ‚àº25% are eligible for resection. When disease is unresectable  the current first-line treatment is chemotherapy. After progression on first-line chemotherapy  second-line treatments exist but despite the options presently available  the unmet need remains high due to limited benefits on survival. 9 000 new patients are diagnosed every year in the US  and 10 000 in EU5 7 . Based on available data  the global market size is evaluated at $1.2bn in 2021 and  with the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) at 12.5%  it is expected to reach $3.2bn in 2030 8 .. Based on available data  the global market size is evaluated at $1.2bn in 2021 and  with the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) at 12.5%  it is expected to reach $3.2bn in 2030 . GENFIT is developing GNS561  a small molecule PPT1 inhibitor that blocks cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting late stage autophagy leading to cell death9. It received ODD from the FDA in September 2022  confirming its potential in this disease area. First-In-Human effects of PPT1 inhibition following GNS561 administration in patients with primary and secondary liver cancers have been observed. The safety profile  exposure  and preliminary signal of activity support the investigation of GNS561 in combination. A Phase 1b/2 study is expected to be launched with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor in the near future in patients with KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutated cholangiocarcinoma who have failed treatment with first line treatment and who do not have an actionable mutation.VS-01-UCD for urea cycle disorder (UCD)/organic acidemia disorder (OAD)Patients suffering from UCD and OAD  which are two different groups of congenital metabolic diseases  have difficulties to metabolize ammonia. This is due to a deficiency in one of the six enzymes involved in the urea cycle  creating a situation where ammonia is not eliminated in the urine  ultimately leading to hyperammonemia attacks. Patients are usually diagnosed after they are born  via universal newborn screening tests. While these conditions are ultra-rare with 1 900 acute hyperammonemic crises in the US and EU5 per year 10   the mortality is very high as 75% will die after 5 years  and survivors will often have severe brain injuries. There is no acute treatment available for early onset crises  and neonatal hemodialysis is risky  highly invasive and widely unavailable. 45% of UCD patients remain untreated and no drug is currently approved for treatment of OAD. Based on available data  global market size in UCD and OAD is evaluated at $1.5bn in 2021  based on two drugs that have been approved in UCD but not in acute hyperammonemia 11 .  the mortality is very high as 75% will die after 5 years  and survivors will often have severe brain injuries. There is no acute treatment available for early onset crises  and neonatal hemodialysis is risky  highly invasive and widely unavailable. 45% of UCD patients remain untreated and no drug is currently approved for treatment of OAD. Based on available data  global market size in UCD and OAD is evaluated at $1.5bn in 2021  based on two drugs that have been approved in UCD but not in acute hyperammonemia . GENFIT is developing VS-01-UCD  a potential first-line lifesaving treatment for acute hyperammonemic crises. As the peritoneal route of administration is well adapted to pediatric patients  this treatment should be feasible in all hospitals and should be quickly implemented. This is a tremendous improvement over neonatal hemodialysis  which is only possible in specialized centers and is a long and complex procedure. ODD and Rare Pediatric Disease designation (RPDD) have been granted to VS-01 by the FDA for this indication. GENFIT is also potentially eligible to a Priority Review Voucher upon approval.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

Hyper-converged  or HCI  unites pixitmedia‚Äôs award-winning software  pixstor‚Ñ¢ with ngenea¬Æ  with Lenovo‚Äôs smart solutions into a single appliance  with guaranteed performance suitable for a multitude of Media and Entertainment workflows.Historically  studios have depended on storage products supplied by major data appliance vendors. Most vendors are either yet to evolve cloud-based solutions or offer very limited cloud capabilities. This is restrictive and limits the flexibility of media creation companies as their businesses grow and content delivery models change. Having a hyper-converged infrastructure gives studios the freedom to choose where to grow their capabilities  whether it be on-premise or in the cloud. Those working remotely should have the same experience as those who choose to work on-premises and vice versa. For companies operating virtual workstations  this is a vital part of the workflow  and it is where dynamic data management can bring huge benefits. A hyper-converged approach allows creative media businesses to stay agile and keep infrastructure costs low by virtualising key elements of conventional ‚Äúhardware-defined‚Äù systems.‚Äúpixitmedia and Lenovo liberate Media and Entertainment businesses from being locked into restrictive data environments.

13392,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forfarmers-n-v-forfarmers-announces-060000502.html,ForFarmers N.V.: ForFarmers announces revised Strategy 2025,Lochem  17 November 2022 ForFarmers announces revised Strategy 2025 In order to be better able to respond to rapidly changing market conditions ForFarmers...,"ForFarmers N.V.Lochem  17 November 2022ForFarmers announces revised Strategy 2025In order to be better able to respond to rapidly changing market conditions ForFarmers has taken a fresh look at the basic principles of its Strategy 2025. This review has resulted in five more focused strategic principles whereby the emphasis is on an even more local market approach  differentiation and sustainability-focused innovation of feed concepts. ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025.Since the launch of the strategy in 2020 the emphasis on making the agricultural sector more sustainable has grown  partly due to the accelerated proposal and implementation of measures under the EU Green Deal. In addition  prices of raw materials and energy have increased and become even more volatile  also as a result of the war in Ukraine. This has made it more difficult to pass on fluctuations in raw material prices. At the same time the current market conditions call for more consolidation and cooperation in the supply chain  from feed manufacturer to retailer.Five more focused strategic principlesForFarmers has the knowledge  expertise and resources to strengthen its position amid the changing market conditions. Its mission  For the Future of Farming  continues to be the guiding principle through which the company is fully focused on a sustainable livestock farming industry  both ecologically and economically. In anticipation of the strategy review  ForFarmers last year adjusted the way it works  assigning more responsibility to the local management teams. This provides the foundation for meeting the first principle of the revised strategy: the local teams are leading  to enable ForFarmers to work even more closely to the customer. The teams are supported by the central departments and draw on the knowledge and experience that is present within the group  for example in the area of innovation. The organisation will be adapted to this way of working.Secondly  in the current market conditions ForFarmers is uniquely well placed to distinguish itself in each individual market and segment in providing a differentiated offering  driven by the local situation of each sector. The offering can range from total solutions to optimise returns  to supplying specific products that best meet the livestock farmer‚Äôs needs amid challenging market conditions.Thirdly  ForFarmers will focus more emphatically on sustainable solutions which address wider societal issues such as the use of alternative raw materials  circularity and further reducing nitrogen and other emissions. In this context ForFarmers will intensify its efforts aimed at cooperation between the supply chain parties in the various markets. This cooperation is important both ecologically and economically and constitutes the fourth principle.Finally  ForFarmers will remain true to the ‚Äì fifth ‚Äì principle  which is to supply good feed at competitive prices that contribute to business profitability for both ForFarmers and its customers. For this  ForFarmers continues to focus on optimally efficient and effective business processes.Story continuesMergers and acquisitions: strengthening and broadeningIn order to strengthen or broaden selective positions in home markets as well as to enter new markets with added growth potential  ForFarmers is looking for opportunities for mergers with or acquisitions of candidates that are a good cultural fit (in terms of both country and business).Transition to further sustainabilityThe livestock farming industry is faced with the challenge of feeding an ever-growing number of people while at the same time reducing the impact that the production of animal proteins has on the climate and on nature. In its Strategy 2025  reflected in the third and fourth principle  ForFarmers is therefore giving the Going Circular sustainability agenda an extra boost. Accordingly  in order to create even more focus  a new organisation is formed that includes the activities of Reudink (organic feed) and the co-products to develop and market concepts that address societal concerns regarding matters such as climate  animal welfare and former food stuffs. We will start with this in the Netherlands. Examples include concepts which use alternative raw materials or incorporate more moist co-products and residual flows from the food industry. Concepts such as these are an essential factor in establishing collaborative partnerships in the supply chain  from feed company to retailer. Such concepts are also crucial to livestock farmers and other stakeholders in pursuing the current trend towards net zero.#ProudtobeForFarmersAs part of the strategy review we have adjusted our core values. The success of the strategy is largely dependent on the attitude and efforts of employees and management. Our values Passionate  Responsible  Open-minded  United and Delivering are more than just words to ForFarmers; they provide a concrete guideline for our daily interactions with customers  chain partners  stakeholders ‚Äì and each other.Financial objectiveWith this revised strategy ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025  barring unforeseen events. The company will refrain from making statements about (annual) targets for the development of underlying EBITDA in view of the changing markets  in which important policy decisions are still forthcoming  as well as the continuing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.The dividend policy will remain unchanged and is aimed at distributing a cash dividend of between 40% and 60% of underlying net profit.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For further information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director of Investor RelationsT: 0031 573 288 000 M: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAdditional information on Strategy 2025ForFarmers will today provide additional information on its revised Strategy 2025 to those invited  including analysts.

It corresponds to the Parrot Group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  no revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.For several consecutive quarters  the Group has seen the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  focused on professional uses for equipment and solutions  and is ramping up its growth  supported by a favorable geopolitical context for the deployment of drone technologies. Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of the year climbed to ‚Ç¨52.4m  up 35%  with 115% growth based on the reference scope1.Story continuesDuring this third quarter  the Group‚Äôs activities were marked by:The 137% increase in micro-drone revenues (+131% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨13.9m reflects the strong sales growth for ANAFI USA professional micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai. The ANAFI USA is benefiting from new orders from NATO countries (including the United Kingdom  Spain and the United States) as well as the continued deliveries for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). To date  450 systems have already been delivered to the French armed forces  representing just over half of the total planned under the European call for tenders from February 2020  which is due to end in 2024. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its micro-drones  made possible by the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  further strengthened by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 38% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+23% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨8.1m for the third quarter of 2022. The business is being supported by the acceleration in sales for the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020  the international development of the sales and marketing strategy  and the continued increase in the number of users. Pix4D Mapper  the longstanding solution  is continuing to build on its growth  while new equipment  making it possible to further enhance the precision of the data used  is responding to increasingly advanced use cases.Outlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to move forward with confidence as it rolls out its strategy focused on professional micro-drones and solutions  while remaining vigilant concerning the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its micro-drones  Parrot has further strengthened its coordination between R&D  procurement and production tracking.

The European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for Enjaymo¬Æ (sutimlimab) for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD)  a rare  serious  and chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia  where the body‚Äôs immune system mistakenly attacks healthy red blood cells and causes their rupture  known as hemolysis.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDChief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi‚ÄúThis approval highlights our ambition to develop first- and best-in-class medicines that transform people‚Äôs lives. Up until now  patients in Europe had to rely on a combination of cold avoidance  blood transfusions and off-label treatments to manage their disease. The approval of Enjaymo by the European Commission provides patients  for the first time  with access to a therapy that can make a meaningful difference in the treatment and daily experience of living with CAD.‚ÄùEnjaymo is currently the only approved treatment for CAD and is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to selectively target and inhibit the classical complement pathway specific serine protease  C1s. It will be available as a 50mg/mL solution for infusion.Alexander R√∂th  MDDepartment of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation  University Hospital  University of Duisburg-Essen  Germany‚ÄúCoupled with diagnostic journeys that can last years  the impact of fatigue on quality of life in CAD is often debilitating and is comparable to conditions such as cancer-related anemia and other autoimmune disorders. Clinicians now have a much-needed therapeutic option to offer to their patients.‚ÄùAbout the CADENZA and CARDINAL Clinical TrialsThe EC approval is based on data from two Phase 3 clinical trials: CADENZA  a double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial of adults with CAD without a recent history of blood transfusion (within the past 6 months)  and CARDINAL  a 26-week open label  single-arm pivotal study in patients with CAD who have had a recent blood transfusion.Story continuesIn the CADENZA Part A trial  eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a fixed weight-based dose (6.5g or 7.5g) of Enjaymo or placebo via intravenous infusion on Day 0  Day 7  and then once every other week up to Week 26. The open-label Part B of the study assessed long-term safety as well as durability of response to Enjaymo in patients with CAD. In the CADENZA Part A study  Enjaymo met its primary composite endpoint and all secondary endpoints and demonstrated inhibition of hemolysis  increase in hemoglobin levels  and clinically meaningful improvement in The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scores. Enjaymo demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was generally well-tolerated. 96% of patients in the Enjaymo group and 100% of patients in the placebo group experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). Headache (22.7% vs 10.0%)  hypertension (22.7% vs 0%)  rhinitis (18.2% vs 0%)  Raynaud phenomenon (18.2% vs 0%)  and acrocyanosis (13.6% vs 0%) were reported more frequently in Enajymo-treated patients compared with placebo.In the CARDINAL Part A trial  patients received a fixed weight-based dose (6.5g or 7.5g) of Enjaymo via intravenous infusion on Day 0  Day 7  and then once every other week up to Week 26. Part B of the study evaluated the long-term safety as well as durability of response to Enjaymo in patients with CAD over a 2-year follow up. In the CARDINAL Part A study  the efficacy of Enjaymo was assessed based on the achievement of a primary composite endpoint (Hb‚â•12 g/dL or an increase of at least 2 g/dL; no blood transfusion or prohibited medications from Weeks 5 through 26) and different secondary endpoints  including improvements in hemoglobin  normalization of bilirubin  and FACIT-fatigue score. The most common adverse reactions occurring in 10% or more of patients were respiratory tract infection  viral infection  diarrhea  dyspepsia  cough  arthralgia  arthritis  and peripheral edema. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 13% (3/24) of patients who received Enjaymo. These serious adverse reactions were streptococcal sepsis and staphylococcal wound infection (n=1)  arthralgia (n=1)  and respiratory tract infection (n=1).About Enjaymo¬Æ (sutimlimab)Enjaymo is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to selectively target and inhibit C1s in the classical complement pathway  which is part of the innate immune system. By blocking C1s  Enjaymo inhibits the activation of the complement cascade in the immune system and inhibits C1-activated hemolysis in CAD to prevent the abnormal destruction of healthy red blood cells. Enjaymo does not inhibit the lectin and alternative pathways. Enjaymo was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2022 as the first and only treatment indicated to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion due to hemolysis in adults with CAD. The Japanese Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare approved Enjaymo in June 2022. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also made the decision to maintain orphan designation.About cold agglutinin diseaseCold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia  where part of the body‚Äôs immune system mistakenly destroys healthy red blood cells (hemolysis). CAD impacts the lives of an estimated 12 000 people in the US  Europe  and Japan and is associated with profound fatigue and increased risk of thromboembolic events and mortality.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people‚Äôs lives.

Change never happens without relative impact  and there are indeed times when so much is happening  it becomes difficult to decipher a passing fad from a genuine shift. We closely examine the shifts taking place  provide insights on the nuances and conflicting developments  and highlight potential opportunities for growth and innovation. We invite you to become part of the conversation.Change is here to stay. And just when you get used to things  change happens again. And again. And again. There‚Äôs simply no escaping it. Rather than trying to ignore change  what if we embraced and welcomed it for the new possibilities it presents?

An initial target to cut total direct emissions from 2016 levels by 30% by 2030 was confirmed in 2019. This was updated to 50% in 2021 and again to 59% in August this year following considerable action and a continuous assessment of DSM's plans to achieve net-zero by 2050 if not sooner. This new target is now validated alongside the plans to achieve it by the SBTi. As part of this ambition  DSM is already aiming to source 100% of its electricity worldwide from renewable sources by 2030.Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEOs of DSM  said: ""It is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C but the latest climate science warns we are dangerously close to exceeding that threshold. The urgency for action has been repeated throughout the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 so aligning with the science is the responsibility of all businesses everywhere. As a long-term leader in climate advocacy  we routinely evaluate what DSM can do to go further and faster towards net-zero and this independent validation by the Science Based Targets initiative gives us confidence that we are on the right track.""The SBTi is a collaboration between the United Nations Global Compact  World Resources Institute (WRI)  the CDP and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to drive ambitious corporate climate action.DSM was one of the first companies to align its efforts with the science presented in the IPCC Special Report 'Global Warming of 1.5¬∞C' of 2019 and immediately set a pathway to reach net-zero GHG emissions across its operations and value chains by 2050. DSM's science-based targets are the foundation to achieve this goal  supported by ambitions on renewable electricity and energy efficiency  as well as intense work with key suppliers and customers.DSMRoyal DSM is a global  purpose-led company in Health  Nutrition & Bioscience  applying science to improve the health of people  animals and the planet.

This review has resulted in five more focused strategic principles whereby the emphasis is on an even more local market approach  differentiation and sustainability-focused innovation of feed concepts. ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025.Since the launch of the strategy in 2020 the emphasis on making the agricultural sector more sustainable has grown  partly due to the accelerated proposal and implementation of measures under the EU Green Deal. In addition  prices of raw materials and energy have increased and become even more volatile  also as a result of the war in Ukraine. This has made it more difficult to pass on fluctuations in raw material prices. At the same time the current market conditions call for more consolidation and cooperation in the supply chain  from feed manufacturer to retailer.Five more focused strategic principlesForFarmers has the knowledge  expertise and resources to strengthen its position amid the changing market conditions. Its mission  For the Future of Farming  continues to be the guiding principle through which the company is fully focused on a sustainable livestock farming industry  both ecologically and economically. In anticipation of the strategy review  ForFarmers last year adjusted the way it works  assigning more responsibility to the local management teams. This provides the foundation for meeting the first principle of the revised strategy: the local teams are leading  to enable ForFarmers to work even more closely to the customer. The teams are supported by the central departments and draw on the knowledge and experience that is present within the group  for example in the area of innovation. The organisation will be adapted to this way of working.Secondly  in the current market conditions ForFarmers is uniquely well placed to distinguish itself in each individual market and segment in providing a differentiated offering  driven by the local situation of each sector. The offering can range from total solutions to optimise returns  to supplying specific products that best meet the livestock farmer‚Äôs needs amid challenging market conditions.Thirdly  ForFarmers will focus more emphatically on sustainable solutions which address wider societal issues such as the use of alternative raw materials  circularity and further reducing nitrogen and other emissions. In this context ForFarmers will intensify its efforts aimed at cooperation between the supply chain parties in the various markets. This cooperation is important both ecologically and economically and constitutes the fourth principle.Finally  ForFarmers will remain true to the ‚Äì fifth ‚Äì principle  which is to supply good feed at competitive prices that contribute to business profitability for both ForFarmers and its customers. For this  ForFarmers continues to focus on optimally efficient and effective business processes.Mergers and acquisitions: strengthening and broadeningIn order to strengthen or broaden selective positions in home markets as well as to enter new markets with added growth potential  ForFarmers is looking for opportunities for mergers with or acquisitions of candidates that are a good cultural fit (in terms of both country and business).Transition to further sustainabilityThe livestock farming industry is faced with the challenge of feeding an ever-growing number of people while at the same time reducing the impact that the production of animal proteins has on the climate and on nature. In its Strategy 2025  reflected in the third and fourth principle  ForFarmers is therefore giving the Going Circular sustainability agenda an extra boost. Accordingly  in order to create even more focus  a new organisation is formed that includes the activities of Reudink (organic feed) and the co-products to develop and market concepts that address societal concerns regarding matters such as climate  animal welfare and former food stuffs. We will start with this in the Netherlands. Examples include concepts which use alternative raw materials or incorporate more moist co-products and residual flows from the food industry. Concepts such as these are an essential factor in establishing collaborative partnerships in the supply chain  from feed company to retailer. Such concepts are also crucial to livestock farmers and other stakeholders in pursuing the current trend towards net zero.#ProudtobeForFarmersAs part of the strategy review we have adjusted our core values. The success of the strategy is largely dependent on the attitude and efforts of employees and management. Our values Passionate  Responsible  Open-minded  United and Delivering are more than just words to ForFarmers; they provide a concrete guideline for our daily interactions with customers  chain partners  stakeholders ‚Äì and each other.Financial objectiveWith this revised strategy ForFarmers aims for a consolidated return on average capital employed (ROACE) of at least 10% based on underlying operating profit (EBIT) by 2025  barring unforeseen events. The company will refrain from making statements about (annual) targets for the development of underlying EBITDA in view of the changing markets  in which important policy decisions are still forthcoming  as well as the continuing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.The dividend policy will remain unchanged and is aimed at distributing a cash dividend of between 40% and 60% of underlying net profit.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For further information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director of Investor RelationsT: 0031 573 288 000 M: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAdditional information on Strategy 2025ForFarmers will today provide additional information on its revised Strategy 2025 to those invited  including analysts.

It corresponds to the Parrot Group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  no revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.For several consecutive quarters  the Group has seen the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  focused on professional uses for equipment and solutions  and is ramping up its growth  supported by a favorable geopolitical context for the deployment of drone technologies. Consolidated revenues for the first nine months of the year climbed to ‚Ç¨52.4m  up 35%  with 115% growth based on the reference scope1.During this third quarter  the Group‚Äôs activities were marked by:The 137% increase in micro-drone revenues (+131% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨13.9m reflects the strong sales growth for ANAFI USA professional micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai. The ANAFI USA is benefiting from new orders from NATO countries (including the United Kingdom  Spain and the United States) as well as the continued deliveries for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). To date  450 systems have already been delivered to the French armed forces  representing just over half of the total planned under the European call for tenders from February 2020  which is due to end in 2024. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its micro-drones  made possible by the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  further strengthened by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 38% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+23% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨8.1m for the third quarter of 2022. The business is being supported by the acceleration in sales for the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020  the international development of the sales and marketing strategy  and the continued increase in the number of users. Pix4D Mapper  the longstanding solution  is continuing to build on its growth  while new equipment  making it possible to further enhance the precision of the data used  is responding to increasingly advanced use cases.Outlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to move forward with confidence as it rolls out its strategy focused on professional micro-drones and solutions  while remaining vigilant concerning the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its micro-drones  Parrot has further strengthened its coordination between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations is being combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives could limit the company‚Äôs performance.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its ‚Äúnew scope‚Äù and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Change in revenues over nine monthsRevenues (‚Ç¨m and % of revenues) 20229 months 20219 months Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 29.2 56% 14.1 36% 108% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 1.0 2% 7.1 18% -87% 6.2 11% C Pix4D 23.2 44% 17.5 45% 32% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.5 1% 0.3 1% 102% 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations (0.5) -1% -0.8 -2% -32% -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - 0% 7.7 20% -100% 7.7 14% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 52.4 100% 38.8 100% 35% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 51.5 98% 24.0 62% 115% 40.4 74%Next financial date2022 full-year earnings: Thursday March 16  2023ABOUT PARROTParrot is Europe's leading commercial UAV group.

BirdLife International has identified threats to familiar bird species  such as industrial farming  logging  invasive species  hunting & trapping  and climate change. They partner with solution-based organisations to help reverse the effects that humans have had on these species that are under threat.BirdLife and its partners work in multiple ways to keep common birds common. One important way is by monitoring the conservation status of all birds for the IUCN's Red List of Species. (LINK https://www.birdlife.org/projects/red-list/)Only by immediately flagging when common birds begin to decline can they then initiate the conservation actions necessary to keep the population thriving. Around the globe they also work to protect the habitats where birds can thrive  whether that's forests  grasslands  the seas or wetlands. Like humans  birds need safe shelter from life's threats and hardships. And they work hard to protect those habitats in networks as birds know no borders - so each of the planet's eight major flyways are of critical importance as nature's necklaces. Finally  they work to reform and tackle those aspects of society's systems which threaten birds - this can range from making buildings bird-collision proof  to reforming industrial agriculture or deforestation  or siting energy infrastructure  both renewable and conventional  so birds are not placed in peril.What will the donation from Redbreast fans lead to? In the words of BirdLife International:""Project Wingman is part of our broad and critical efforts to raise public awareness of the importance of birds and nature in general. Without public engagement supporting and caring about the diverse work we do  we cannot be as effective as we need to be. Campaigning on behalf of birds and biodiversity is considerably strengthened by Project Wingman and Redbreast Whiskey.""Take a deeper look at BirdLife International here .About Redbreast Irish WhiskeyFor more than a century  Redbreast has stayed true to the single pot still whiskey making tradition and today is considered to be the definitive expression of this quintessential style of Irish whiskey.

On 15 December 2020  the Company lodged an appeal against the Original Judgment with the Antwerp Court of Appeals.On 4 February 2021  Trafigura PTE Ltd. and Trafigura Group PTE Ltd. filed a third-party application against the Original Judgment. The Company and the original claimant shareholders were also involved in these proceedings. In these third-party application proceedings  a first Judgment was issued on 2 July 2021  as stated in the Company's press release of 5 July 2021. Therein  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division) ordered the original claimant shareholders to produce to the court a full overview of their transactions in the Company‚Äôs shares. On 9 November 2021  as stated in the Company‚Äôs press release of 9 November 2021  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division) rendered a second Judgment in these third-party application proceedings. In this decision  the President declared the third-party application proceedings of Trafigura PTE Ltd. and Trafigura Group PTE Ltd. well-founded and revoked the Original Judgment vis-√†-vis Trafigura PTE Ltd  Trafigura Group PTE Ltd  the Company and the original claimant shareholders  thus revoking the appointment of the experts and halting the expert investigation. On 23 December 2021  the original claimant shareholders as well as certain newly intervening claimant shareholders lodged an appeal against the Judgments with the Antwerp Court of Appeals.Story continuesBoth appeals were dealt with at the court hearing of 6 October 2022.On 17 November 2022  the Antwerp Court of Appeals issued its judgment in these appeals. In this judgment  the Court of Appeals has declared the appeal proceedings lodged by the claimant shareholders ill-founded and has confirmed the Judgment of 9 November 2021  thus ordering that the appointment of the panel of corporate law experts be revoked and the expert investigation halted. The Court of Appeals found that there are no indications that the interests of the Company would be seriously threatened  hence an expert investigation is not justified. The Court of Appeals also joined the proceedings regarding the Company‚Äôs appeal against the Original Judgment and confirmed that such appeal no longer has any subject matter given its judgment. Finally  the Court of Appeals ordered the parties to pay their own costs  and ordered the claimant shareholders to repay 50% of the costs incurred by Nyrstar in the expert investigation.The Company is currently analysing this new judgment together with its legal advisors.A detailed overview of the current proceedings is available on the Company website at: https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings .About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

Results of the interim analysis are expected by year-end 2022 and full top-line data from the trial is now expected in the second half of 2023.The KALAHARI trial is evaluating Oxurion‚Äôs novel plasma kallikrein (PKal) candidate  THR-149  as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). The Phase 2 KALAHARI study is a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center study assessing multiple injections of THR-149 in DME patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy. Part B follows Part A of the study  in which three dose levels of THR-149 (0.005mg  0.022mg and 0.13mg)  were each administered in three monthly IVT injections  were evaluated in order to select the best dose for Part B of the study.High-level Month 3 data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021 and demonstrated that in the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint  was observed. A post-hoc analysis of an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment  was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022. The masked reading center identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3 that was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial. The six-month data also demonstrated THR-149‚Äôs attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended study design.

On 15 December 2020  the Company lodged an appeal against the Original Judgment with the Antwerp Court of Appeals.On 4 February 2021  Trafigura PTE Ltd. and Trafigura Group PTE Ltd. filed a third-party application against the Original Judgment. The Company and the original claimant shareholders were also involved in these proceedings. In these third-party application proceedings  a first Judgment was issued on 2 July 2021  as stated in the Company's press release of 5 July 2021. Therein  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division) ordered the original claimant shareholders to produce to the court a full overview of their transactions in the Company‚Äôs shares. On 9 November 2021  as stated in the Company‚Äôs press release of 9 November 2021  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division) rendered a second Judgment in these third-party application proceedings. In this decision  the President declared the third-party application proceedings of Trafigura PTE Ltd. and Trafigura Group PTE Ltd. well-founded and revoked the Original Judgment vis-√†-vis Trafigura PTE Ltd  Trafigura Group PTE Ltd  the Company and the original claimant shareholders  thus revoking the appointment of the experts and halting the expert investigation. On 23 December 2021  the original claimant shareholders as well as certain newly intervening claimant shareholders lodged an appeal against the Judgments with the Antwerp Court of Appeals.Both appeals were dealt with at the court hearing of 6 October 2022.On 17 November 2022  the Antwerp Court of Appeals issued its judgment in these appeals. In this judgment  the Court of Appeals has declared the appeal proceedings lodged by the claimant shareholders ill-founded and has confirmed the Judgment of 9 November 2021  thus ordering that the appointment of the panel of corporate law experts be revoked and the expert investigation halted. The Court of Appeals found that there are no indications that the interests of the Company would be seriously threatened  hence an expert investigation is not justified. The Court of Appeals also joined the proceedings regarding the Company‚Äôs appeal against the Original Judgment and confirmed that such appeal no longer has any subject matter given its judgment. Finally  the Court of Appeals ordered the parties to pay their own costs  and ordered the claimant shareholders to repay 50% of the costs incurred by Nyrstar in the expert investigation.The Company is currently analysing this new judgment together with its legal advisors.A detailed overview of the current proceedings is available on the Company website at: https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings .About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

As great observers of changes in society and hospitality  can you tell us how you see things in general?Tom Goodwin: First and foremost  change is amazing. When it comes to the progress that we make. It's energy  it's options  it's a sense of progress. So change is great. Uncertainty can be amazing if we use it the right way.Dr. Lalia Rach: If you're more aware of the opportunity that comes from changing  you can then perhaps become more comfortable with your discomfort in change. Because all change is personal. And all change impacts people differently. Sometimes we're barely aware of it  other times it's so much in the front of our minds we can't even let go of it.Times seem very disturbed and we see our society changing everyday. Do you think our society is really experiencing changes like never before?Tom Goodwin: I don't necessarily think we're moving in faster changing times. I just think that somehow the opening of our eyes is now so wide that we're so overwhelmed by information that's real time  that we have a greater understanding of how many things happen in a day.So  the amount of societal change that we have is extraordinary  but not unprecedented. In a way  though  many of the elements of technology that changed the world were about space and distance to the industrial world. And increasingly  the changes that we see are more about the mind.We can now reach more people than ever before  and that's having very strange effects on our psyche. We feel more connected than ever before  but more lonely. And what we're seeing is many of these tensions coming together at the same time.Dr. Lalia Rach: Do I think society is experiencing changes like never before? No. If you really think about what we're talking about with change  we are talking about the availability of information and the immediacy of connection. When you move from something that has been in place for so long to something utterly different  this can be felt as disruptive behavior.Tom Goodwin: A lot of expectations have changed. Perhaps we need to be a little bit more grounded in reality about what the role of these things are in our life. I actually think that work has become a lot more important to people in the last 20 or 30 years as we've lost a sense of meaning and purpose from other elements of our life.There are people saying we are becoming more individualistic and some other explaining we are more collective. What would be your perception?Tom Goodwin: The extraordinary thing is that the world tends to operate in a balance. The more we become individuals  the more we have this need to organize and come together. The more we come together  we have this reason to kind of rebel against that structure. What's different now is we're almost seeing an algorithmically created tribe. Information being propagated by algorithms means in some ways we are put in groups with people who are quite like us  which actually ironically means that our individualism tends to turn into collectivism without us realizing it.Dr. Lalia Rach: When you think about this  we are hardwired to be collective. In order for us to have survived as a species  we had to be collective. It is part of our brain function. I don't know if I can say it's part of our DNA  but I do know it's embedded in us. And so  we are all biased to find similarity. That's the first thing we see. This is all done subconsciously in microseconds. But we are a collective. We like being part of things.Everyone talks about hybrid living. What does the word hybrid relate to in your mind  and especially in our current changing society?Tom Goodwin: The word hybrid  when you used to describe society at the moment and the working world  in a way is about a state between two different paradigms. We've had the old paradigm where physicality and your situation and your presence were very much aligned with the value that you created. You were either there or you were not. When we talk about hybrid  we're really talking about trying to create a situation which combines the best of both of those paradigms. And that means that rather than thinking about working from home  it means we can think about working from anywhere. Rather than attending events in person or remotely  we can think about events that combine the best of both. We can create a future which is much more beneficial for everyone and allows freedom. But we should recognize some of the problems that this brings about. Hybrid comes with a sense of blurred lines. Everything that used to be compartmentalized is now somewhat gray. And that amount of ambiguity changes a lot of our lives. What we're seeing is slowly the physical world starts to adapt to the new behaviors and expectations of people.Dr. Lalia Rach: We have become more fluid because we move between things with much greater ease today. We don't even think about it. So when I talk about flexibility and I talk about the hybrid  I define it clearly for what we expect to be of use for the customer. We now have a variety of offerings in every part of our life  not just hotels  but that we can pick and choose from anytime we like. Think about how you would go to sleep  go to bed in the 80s  early 90s  and think about now  how you go to sleep and go to bed. And screens dominate our actions. Think about what is the last thing you do at night. Is it saying goodnight to another person? Or is the last thing you do is to look at your iPad? We so seldom disconnect  that our lives are constantly blended.The biggest hybrid change: we now have a variety of offerings in every part of our life  not just hotels  but that we can pick and choose sometimes. DR LALIA RACHThis hybrid living should be impacting hospitality and hotels. How do you see this happening?Dr. Lalia Rach: We now recognize that we want to live more of our lives in public - and so what a lobby is built for  what it's expected to allow for  how it changes from morning to afternoon to evening. Those aspects  now  that's flexibility. And the fact is  now that our hotels are more user friendly. That doesn't mean that they're not wonderful structures  but we want our customers to feel a sense of individual welcome.If you're the type of hotel or hospitality business designed for the individual  you must demonstrate that it is their individuality that matters  not yours. This type of thinking can be unusual and somewhat difficult aspect of change for the hotel industry as it down plays replication for reasons of economies of scale. If you must maintain the replication  consider where can you make it so that I  the individual  see myself reflected in the structure.Tom Goodwin: Are we in the business of providing people with a good night's sleep? Or are we in the business of making sure that that person's next day brings as much joy and as much education and as much inspiration and productivity as possible? Maybe you are in the hotel business and not in the business of self help  but everything that a hotel does is about creating an environment in which people can accomplish more and people can feel more attuned to who they are and so on. It's very interesting because the first stage of the Internet was effectively to take behaviors that we already had in the physical world and to integrate them by applying technology to make things easier. The second stage of the Internet and the digital revolution was to create new behaviors and new workflows in the digital domain. And the third step is to rethink the entire physical world around the new possibilities and the new behaviors that technology makes.Source: AccorAnother trend shared by analysts is the appeal of local connections and communities. Is this an important notion according to you?Dr. Lalia Rach: I would say yes.We've been talking about opportunity and I often think that is the forgotten opportunity that you do have a local clientele and in many ways they then become your best salesperson.In tandem with our buying of things is our buying of experiences. We want to touch and see and hear and taste that which the local does. Therein is a reality change. We used to travel to see the sites. Those sites could be cultural  they could be artistic  they could be built  or for recreation. Now because we are able to travel so much more  all those things come into play. We now have moved beyond the initial experience to expecting so much more. We want to know what it's like to live there. What does it mean to be local?I wonder if the hotel industry recognizes that their ability to extend the local community to tourists can also be provided to their citizens? The knowledge you have about your area should be used to draw locals to your restaurant  to your bar?Tom Goodwin: There's a weird movement from people away from local and towards global people who are perhaps more like you. But ironically  because that's how people tend to shift in their life  that actually raises the issue that these local connections are even more important.The more time you spend talking to people on Twitter who live in Paraguay but have very similar jobs to you  the more your need to have a beer with someone that lives next door to you but has a very different life  the more that need becomes apparent.Dr. Lalia Rach: And that's another way that I would make sure that our local people are engaged with us because that is a process that they should be in. The COVID shut-down globally demonstrated to many destinations how much they had lost because they ware overrun by tourists. Their community was no longer theirs. In the post-COVID world  destinations and tourists realize that expanding horizons should not result in harming or destroying a way of life. It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt have tourists but planning must be in place. Consider whether the destination or business is actually attracting the tourists that best fit. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs responsibility. Another way to engage local people in the planning process.Tom Goodwin: The need for community creates almost a perfect design brief for how companies can go about creating spaces and creating feelings that help assuage first.Well-being has been a topic related to individuals and seem to be now moving to another level. Do you see it expanding out of its original perimeter?Dr. Lalia Rach: Well-being is what you do in the environment in which you live.We should look at well-being as a global fact  not a benefit. It is not something some people should have and other people shouldn‚Äôt. It's just a very different way we look at our lives today: the concept of well-being is embedding itself  in our society  our business lives  as well as our personal lives. We now look at our planet  our cities  our environment  and think well-being should be everywhere.Tom Goodwin: We're seeing a huge shift in society  start to think much more in terms of a more general sense of our bodies  a more general sense of how everything works together and how interconnected things are.It's highly likely that for a chunk of society  the notion of well-being a core element of our life and something that we optimize against almost as the most important and characteristic  will absolutely take root quite soon. It's highly possible that for some people  gross national happiness or personal wellness scores or sleep scores or mindfulness quotient or some other number will almost become their goal in life.Yet  I don't think it's something that will be done by the mass market.We're seeing a huge shift in society  starting to think much more in terms of a more general sense of our bodies  a more general sense of how everything works together and how interconnected things are. TOM GOODWINLet‚Äôs talk now about consumption. Do you see major shifts in how consumers act today?Tom Goodwin: People have been talking a lot about changing consumption patterns for a long time. And famously  millennials were people that didn't buy things  they bought experiences.For a while there was this feeling that an amazingly curated Instagram feed showing you in Positano and Mykonos became the new handbag  and you almost demonstrated social status through experiences rather than owning things. But when you look at the numbers in how people spend their money is  it's very much unchanged over time. What is unknown  is how a movement towards more conscious consumption will develop.Dr. Lalia Rach: We have to begin with a current reality and that is the condition of the global supply chain. When we talk about consumption  we're just beginning to grapple with what a supply chain is and means to how our lives function. I'm not convinced that the customer is going to focus on this when traveling. But I do believe that with awareness of environmental issues and supply chain changes travelers will be more willing to try alternatives.So I do think you're going to see substitution. I do think you're going to see some changes in realities that we thought we could never do without  but we will adjust.Also  when we look at consumption today  the fact that we are far more educated  that we understand how connected we are  as a world  and that we understand clearly how much we want a better future for our children and our grandchildren all point to shift in our ethical approach to consumption. We have very certain beliefs  but there's always some gray edges that allow us to view consumption differently.When you're talking about consumption  what you know is valid for the past and today is likely to have very little meaning in the future. So be flexible.Tom Goodwin: It would be very easy to think that at a time where people are very conscious about their footprint and the environmental destruction they may cause  that actually it means that people will stay at home more and just not fly to Europe for their holidays. What it probably means is people will find better ways to do it.What is the role of provider of space in the future and what kind of new business models can be exploited? It's interesting to think what starts to happen when people use these spaces for longer days. It's interesting to think of how the use may change if people bring their families with them.Also the more the companies become helpful and help focus people on simple things in some ways  the future of all this is to have companies that make your life easier. And that doesn't mean doing your laundry for you  that means just telling you two things to do while you're in that city. It means saving you time  saving you mental space. People don't have enough time  people don't have enough money  you know it was always that way. Actually  clarity is almost a big scarcity these days.As a conclusion  could you share your advice on how to best react to change?Tom Goodwin: The best attitude towards change is probably to focus on things that you're in control of.Having an understanding of what you're really about  by finding your genuine sense of meaning  find your moral compass  find values and a sense of community  find a really honest sense of who you are and what you're about.Dr. Lalia Rach: If you want to see opportunity  you have to be willing to change.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Results of the interim analysis are expected by year-end 2022 and full top-line data from the trial is now expected in the second half of 2023.The KALAHARI trial is evaluating Oxurion‚Äôs novel plasma kallikrein (PKal) candidate  THR-149  as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). The Phase 2 KALAHARI study is a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center study assessing multiple injections of THR-149 in DME patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy. Part B follows Part A of the study  in which three dose levels of THR-149 (0.005mg  0.022mg and 0.13mg)  were each administered in three monthly IVT injections  were evaluated in order to select the best dose for Part B of the study.High-level Month 3 data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021 and demonstrated that in the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint  was observed. A post-hoc analysis of an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment  was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022.
