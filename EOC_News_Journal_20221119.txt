On 15 December 2020  the Company lodged an appeal against the Original Judgment with the Antwerp Court of Appeals.On 4 February 2021  Trafigura PTE Ltd. and Trafigura Group PTE Ltd. filed a third-party application against the Original Judgment. The Company and the original claimant shareholders were also involved in these proceedings. In these third-party application proceedings  a first Judgment was issued on 2 July 2021  as stated in the Company's press release of 5 July 2021. Therein  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division) ordered the original claimant shareholders to produce to the court a full overview of their transactions in the Company‚Äôs shares. On 9 November 2021  as stated in the Company‚Äôs press release of 9 November 2021  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division) rendered a second Judgment in these third-party application proceedings. In this decision  the President declared the third-party application proceedings of Trafigura PTE Ltd. and Trafigura Group PTE Ltd. well-founded and revoked the Original Judgment vis-√†-vis Trafigura PTE Ltd  Trafigura Group PTE Ltd  the Company and the original claimant shareholders  thus revoking the appointment of the experts and halting the expert investigation.

In this judgment  the Court of Appeals has declared the appeal proceedings lodged by the claimant shareholders ill-founded and has confirmed the Judgment of 9 November 2021  thus ordering that the appointment of the panel of corporate law experts be revoked and the expert investigation halted. The Court of Appeals found that there are no indications that the interests of the Company would be seriously threatened  hence an expert investigation is not justified. The Court of Appeals also joined the proceedings regarding the Company‚Äôs appeal against the Original Judgment and confirmed that such appeal no longer has any subject matter given its judgment. Finally  the Court of Appeals ordered the parties to pay their own costs  and ordered the claimant shareholders to repay 50% of the costs incurred by Nyrstar in the expert investigation.The Company is currently analysing this new judgment together with its legal advisors.A detailed overview of the current proceedings is available on the Company website at: https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings .About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

As great observers of changes in society and hospitality  can you tell us how you see things in general?Tom Goodwin: First and foremost  change is amazing. When it comes to the progress that we make. It's energy  it's options  it's a sense of progress. So change is great. Uncertainty can be amazing if we use it the right way.Dr. Lalia Rach: If you're more aware of the opportunity that comes from changing  you can then perhaps become more comfortable with your discomfort in change. Because all change is personal. And all change impacts people differently. Sometimes we're barely aware of it  other times it's so much in the front of our minds we can't even let go of it.Times seem very disturbed and we see our society changing everyday. Do you think our society is really experiencing changes like never before?Tom Goodwin: I don't necessarily think we're moving in faster changing times. I just think that somehow the opening of our eyes is now so wide that we're so overwhelmed by information that's real time  that we have a greater understanding of how many things happen in a day.So  the amount of societal change that we have is extraordinary  but not unprecedented. In a way  though  many of the elements of technology that changed the world were about space and distance to the industrial world. And increasingly  the changes that we see are more about the mind.We can now reach more people than ever before  and that's having very strange effects on our psyche. We feel more connected than ever before  but more lonely. And what we're seeing is many of these tensions coming together at the same time.Dr. Lalia Rach: Do I think society is experiencing changes like never before? No. If you really think about what we're talking about with change  we are talking about the availability of information and the immediacy of connection. When you move from something that has been in place for so long to something utterly different  this can be felt as disruptive behavior.Tom Goodwin: A lot of expectations have changed. Perhaps we need to be a little bit more grounded in reality about what the role of these things are in our life. I actually think that work has become a lot more important to people in the last 20 or 30 years as we've lost a sense of meaning and purpose from other elements of our life.There are people saying we are becoming more individualistic and some other explaining we are more collective. What would be your perception?Tom Goodwin: The extraordinary thing is that the world tends to operate in a balance. The more we become individuals  the more we have this need to organize and come together. The more we come together  we have this reason to kind of rebel against that structure. What's different now is we're almost seeing an algorithmically created tribe. Information being propagated by algorithms means in some ways we are put in groups with people who are quite like us  which actually ironically means that our individualism tends to turn into collectivism without us realizing it.Dr. Lalia Rach: When you think about this  we are hardwired to be collective. In order for us to have survived as a species  we had to be collective. It is part of our brain function. I don't know if I can say it's part of our DNA  but I do know it's embedded in us. And so  we are all biased to find similarity. That's the first thing we see. This is all done subconsciously in microseconds. But we are a collective. We like being part of things.Everyone talks about hybrid living. What does the word hybrid relate to in your mind  and especially in our current changing society?Tom Goodwin: The word hybrid  when you used to describe society at the moment and the working world  in a way is about a state between two different paradigms. We've had the old paradigm where physicality and your situation and your presence were very much aligned with the value that you created. You were either there or you were not. When we talk about hybrid  we're really talking about trying to create a situation which combines the best of both of those paradigms. And that means that rather than thinking about working from home  it means we can think about working from anywhere. Rather than attending events in person or remotely  we can think about events that combine the best of both. We can create a future which is much more beneficial for everyone and allows freedom. But we should recognize some of the problems that this brings about. Hybrid comes with a sense of blurred lines. Everything that used to be compartmentalized is now somewhat gray. And that amount of ambiguity changes a lot of our lives. What we're seeing is slowly the physical world starts to adapt to the new behaviors and expectations of people.Dr. Lalia Rach: We have become more fluid because we move between things with much greater ease today. We don't even think about it. So when I talk about flexibility and I talk about the hybrid  I define it clearly for what we expect to be of use for the customer. We now have a variety of offerings in every part of our life  not just hotels  but that we can pick and choose from anytime we like. Think about how you would go to sleep  go to bed in the 80s  early 90s  and think about now  how you go to sleep and go to bed. And screens dominate our actions. Think about what is the last thing you do at night. Is it saying goodnight to another person? Or is the last thing you do is to look at your iPad? We so seldom disconnect  that our lives are constantly blended.The biggest hybrid change: we now have a variety of offerings in every part of our life  not just hotels  but that we can pick and choose sometimes. DR LALIA RACHThis hybrid living should be impacting hospitality and hotels. How do you see this happening?Dr. Lalia Rach: We now recognize that we want to live more of our lives in public - and so what a lobby is built for  what it's expected to allow for  how it changes from morning to afternoon to evening. Those aspects  now  that's flexibility. And the fact is  now that our hotels are more user friendly. That doesn't mean that they're not wonderful structures  but we want our customers to feel a sense of individual welcome.If you're the type of hotel or hospitality business designed for the individual  you must demonstrate that it is their individuality that matters  not yours. This type of thinking can be unusual and somewhat difficult aspect of change for the hotel industry as it down plays replication for reasons of economies of scale. If you must maintain the replication  consider where can you make it so that I  the individual  see myself reflected in the structure.Tom Goodwin: Are we in the business of providing people with a good night's sleep? Or are we in the business of making sure that that person's next day brings as much joy and as much education and as much inspiration and productivity as possible? Maybe you are in the hotel business and not in the business of self help  but everything that a hotel does is about creating an environment in which people can accomplish more and people can feel more attuned to who they are and so on. It's very interesting because the first stage of the Internet was effectively to take behaviors that we already had in the physical world and to integrate them by applying technology to make things easier. The second stage of the Internet and the digital revolution was to create new behaviors and new workflows in the digital domain. And the third step is to rethink the entire physical world around the new possibilities and the new behaviors that technology makes.Source: AccorAnother trend shared by analysts is the appeal of local connections and communities. Is this an important notion according to you?Dr. Lalia Rach: I would say yes.We've been talking about opportunity and I often think that is the forgotten opportunity that you do have a local clientele and in many ways they then become your best salesperson.In tandem with our buying of things is our buying of experiences. We want to touch and see and hear and taste that which the local does. Therein is a reality change. We used to travel to see the sites. Those sites could be cultural  they could be artistic  they could be built  or for recreation. Now because we are able to travel so much more  all those things come into play. We now have moved beyond the initial experience to expecting so much more. We want to know what it's like to live there. What does it mean to be local?I wonder if the hotel industry recognizes that their ability to extend the local community to tourists can also be provided to their citizens? The knowledge you have about your area should be used to draw locals to your restaurant  to your bar?Tom Goodwin: There's a weird movement from people away from local and towards global people who are perhaps more like you. But ironically  because that's how people tend to shift in their life  that actually raises the issue that these local connections are even more important.The more time you spend talking to people on Twitter who live in Paraguay but have very similar jobs to you  the more your need to have a beer with someone that lives next door to you but has a very different life  the more that need becomes apparent.Dr. Lalia Rach: And that's another way that I would make sure that our local people are engaged with us because that is a process that they should be in. The COVID shut-down globally demonstrated to many destinations how much they had lost because they ware overrun by tourists. Their community was no longer theirs. In the post-COVID world  destinations and tourists realize that expanding horizons should not result in harming or destroying a way of life. It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt have tourists but planning must be in place. Consider whether the destination or business is actually attracting the tourists that best fit. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs responsibility. Another way to engage local people in the planning process.Tom Goodwin: The need for community creates almost a perfect design brief for how companies can go about creating spaces and creating feelings that help assuage first.Well-being has been a topic related to individuals and seem to be now moving to another level. Do you see it expanding out of its original perimeter?Dr. Lalia Rach: Well-being is what you do in the environment in which you live.We should look at well-being as a global fact  not a benefit. It is not something some people should have and other people shouldn‚Äôt. It's just a very different way we look at our lives today: the concept of well-being is embedding itself  in our society  our business lives  as well as our personal lives. We now look at our planet  our cities  our environment  and think well-being should be everywhere.Tom Goodwin: We're seeing a huge shift in society  start to think much more in terms of a more general sense of our bodies  a more general sense of how everything works together and how interconnected things are.It's highly likely that for a chunk of society  the notion of well-being a core element of our life and something that we optimize against almost as the most important and characteristic  will absolutely take root quite soon. It's highly possible that for some people  gross national happiness or personal wellness scores or sleep scores or mindfulness quotient or some other number will almost become their goal in life.Yet  I don't think it's something that will be done by the mass market.We're seeing a huge shift in society  starting to think much more in terms of a more general sense of our bodies  a more general sense of how everything works together and how interconnected things are. TOM GOODWINLet‚Äôs talk now about consumption. Do you see major shifts in how consumers act today?Tom Goodwin: People have been talking a lot about changing consumption patterns for a long time. And famously  millennials were people that didn't buy things  they bought experiences.For a while there was this feeling that an amazingly curated Instagram feed showing you in Positano and Mykonos became the new handbag  and you almost demonstrated social status through experiences rather than owning things. But when you look at the numbers in how people spend their money is  it's very much unchanged over time. What is unknown  is how a movement towards more conscious consumption will develop.Dr. Lalia Rach: We have to begin with a current reality and that is the condition of the global supply chain. When we talk about consumption  we're just beginning to grapple with what a supply chain is and means to how our lives function. I'm not convinced that the customer is going to focus on this when traveling. But I do believe that with awareness of environmental issues and supply chain changes travelers will be more willing to try alternatives.So I do think you're going to see substitution. I do think you're going to see some changes in realities that we thought we could never do without  but we will adjust.Also  when we look at consumption today  the fact that we are far more educated  that we understand how connected we are  as a world  and that we understand clearly how much we want a better future for our children and our grandchildren all point to shift in our ethical approach to consumption. We have very certain beliefs  but there's always some gray edges that allow us to view consumption differently.When you're talking about consumption  what you know is valid for the past and today is likely to have very little meaning in the future. So be flexible.Tom Goodwin: It would be very easy to think that at a time where people are very conscious about their footprint and the environmental destruction they may cause  that actually it means that people will stay at home more and just not fly to Europe for their holidays. What it probably means is people will find better ways to do it.What is the role of provider of space in the future and what kind of new business models can be exploited? It's interesting to think what starts to happen when people use these spaces for longer days. It's interesting to think of how the use may change if people bring their families with them.Also the more the companies become helpful and help focus people on simple things in some ways  the future of all this is to have companies that make your life easier. And that doesn't mean doing your laundry for you  that means just telling you two things to do while you're in that city. It means saving you time  saving you mental space. People don't have enough time  people don't have enough money  you know it was always that way. Actually  clarity is almost a big scarcity these days.As a conclusion  could you share your advice on how to best react to change?Tom Goodwin: The best attitude towards change is probably to focus on things that you're in control of.Having an understanding of what you're really about  by finding your genuine sense of meaning  find your moral compass  find values and a sense of community  find a really honest sense of who you are and what you're about.Dr. Lalia Rach: If you want to see opportunity  you have to be willing to change.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Results of the interim analysis are expected by year-end 2022 and full top-line data from the trial is now expected in the second half of 2023.The KALAHARI trial is evaluating Oxurion‚Äôs novel plasma kallikrein (PKal) candidate  THR-149  as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). The Phase 2 KALAHARI study is a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center study assessing multiple injections of THR-149 in DME patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy. Part B follows Part A of the study  in which three dose levels of THR-149 (0.005mg  0.022mg and 0.13mg)  were each administered in three monthly IVT injections  were evaluated in order to select the best dose for Part B of the study.High-level Month 3 data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021 and demonstrated that in the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint  was observed. A post-hoc analysis of an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment  was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022. The masked reading center identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3 that was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial. The six-month data also demonstrated THR-149‚Äôs attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended study design.
