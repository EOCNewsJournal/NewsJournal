Read why our Buy rating target is confirmed for EXXRF.,mgallar/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAs already mentioned  starting from the 27th of September  Exor (OTCPK:EXXRF) left Euronext Milan and moved to the Amsterdam stock exchange. So today  we are looking back at the thirteen years of Exor's history in Piazza Affari. Indeed  the company was completely transformed  and the Agnelli family empire was completely reshaped. So  after more than a decade  for those who chose to invest  the holding company represented an excellent proposition. In detail  John Elkann usually mentioned that for every €1 invested  shareholders received €10 (excluding dividends that combined add an additional extra performance - sum of the total dividend received is approximately €5 per share).Exor dividend per share developmentSource: Exor Dividend History (download from Corporate Website)After all  these are the numbers. The company was born in March 2009 with a stock price of €6 per share and left Piazza Affari with a price of around €60 per share. In 2009  Exor's NAV was €3.1 billion  the last half-year shows the same figure at €25.5 billion. In terms of composition ten years ago  62% of the portfolio was concentrated in four large companies: Fiat Group (29%)  SGS (19%)  C&W (9%)  and Intesa Sanpaolo (5%). Today  only one of these 4 companies is still in Exor's portfolio  Fiat  today is known as Stellantis. There are other three important holdings: Ferrari  CNH Industrial  and Iveco (all covered by Mare Evidence Lab). In the meantime  the US reinsurance group Partner Re  which until the last half-year was the second investment behind Ferrari in terms of weight on the holding's portfolio  was sold to the French Covea. An operation that was closed with a maxi capital gain for the Agnelli family's Exor with a net gain of $3.2 billion which brings the holding's liquid assets to €9 billion.Here at the Lab  we already commented on the half-year results  today we would like to emphasize the following:,positive,0.78,0.21,0.01,positive,0.79,0.2,0.01,True,English,"['Supportive Track Record', 'Exor', 'US reinsurance group Partner Re', 'other three important holdings', 'additional extra performance', 'Amsterdam stock exchange', 'maxi capital gain', 'Agnelli family empire', 'four large companies', 'Mare Evidence Lab', 'share development Source', 'Exor Dividend History', 'Fiat Group', 'net gain', 'total dividend', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:EXXRF', 'Euronext Milan', 'thirteen years', 'Piazza Affari', 'a decade', 'excellent proposition', 'John Elkann', 'Corporate Website', 'stock price', 'last half-year', 'same figure', 'C&W', 'Intesa Sanpaolo', 'CNH Industrial', 'second investment', 'French Covea', 'liquid assets', 'half-year results', 'holding company', '4 companies', 'mgallar', 'Editorial', '27th', 'September', 'detail', 'shareholders', 'dividends', 'sum', 'numbers', 'March', 'NAV', 'terms', 'composition', 'portfolio', 'SGS', 'Stellantis', 'Ferrari', 'Iveco', 'meantime', 'weight', 'operation']",2022-11-20,2022-11-20,seekingalpha.com
