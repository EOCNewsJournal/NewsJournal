After 13 years  today Exor's jewel is Ferrari. Read why our Buy rating target is confirmed for EXXRF.,mgallar/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAs already mentioned  starting from the 27th of September  Exor (OTCPK:EXXRF) left Euronext Milan and moved to the Amsterdam stock exchange. So today  we are looking back at the thirteen years of Exor's history in Piazza Affari. Indeed  the company was completely transformed  and the Agnelli family empire was completely reshaped. So  after more than a decade  for those who chose to invest  the holding company represented an excellent proposition. In detail  John Elkann usually mentioned that for every €1 invested  shareholders received €10 (excluding dividends that combined add an additional extra performance - sum of the total dividend received is approximately €5 per share).Exor dividend per share developmentSource: Exor Dividend History (download from Corporate Website)After all  these are the numbers. The company was born in March 2009 with a stock price of €6 per share and left Piazza Affari with a price of around €60 per share. In 2009  Exor's NAV was €3.1 billion  the last half-year shows the same figure at €25.5 billion. In terms of composition ten years ago  62% of the portfolio was concentrated in four large companies: Fiat Group (29%)  SGS (19%)  C&W (9%)  and Intesa Sanpaolo (5%). Today  only one of these 4 companies is still in Exor's portfolio  Fiat  today is known as Stellantis. There are other three important holdings: Ferrari  CNH Industrial  and Iveco (all covered by Mare Evidence Lab). In the meantime  the US reinsurance group Partner Re  which until the last half-year was the second investment behind Ferrari in terms of weight on the holding's portfolio  was sold to the French Covea. An operation that was closed with a maxi capital gain for the Agnelli family's Exor with a net gain of $3.2 billion which brings the holding's liquid assets to €9 billion.Here at the Lab  we already commented on the half-year results  today we would like to emphasize the following:,positive,0.78,0.21,0.01,positive,0.79,0.2,0.01,True,English,"['Supportive Track Record', 'Exor', 'US reinsurance group Partner Re', 'other three important holdings', 'additional extra performance', 'Amsterdam stock exchange', 'maxi capital gain', 'Agnelli family empire', 'four large companies', 'Mare Evidence Lab', 'share development Source', 'Exor Dividend History', 'Fiat Group', 'net gain', 'total dividend', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:EXXRF', 'Euronext Milan', 'thirteen years', 'Piazza Affari', 'a decade', 'excellent proposition', 'John Elkann', 'Corporate Website', 'stock price', 'last half-year', 'same figure', 'C&W', 'Intesa Sanpaolo', 'CNH Industrial', 'second investment', 'French Covea', 'liquid assets', 'half-year results', 'holding company', '4 companies', 'mgallar', 'Editorial', '27th', 'September', 'detail', 'shareholders', 'dividends', 'sum', 'numbers', 'March', 'NAV', 'terms', 'composition', 'portfolio', 'SGS', 'Stellantis', 'Ferrari', 'Iveco', 'meantime', 'weight', 'operation']",2022-11-20,2022-11-21,seekingalpha.com

Logo (CNW Group/ASEP Medical Holdings Inc.)The FSE listing represents a strategic milestone for the Company  as it provides exposure to the European retail and institutional investment community and highlights its potential as a global biotechnology enterprise. This listing is expected to provide the Company with added liquidity and a diversified investor base within a large and globally recognized exchange. Recently  Asep Inc.'s patent application for its sepsis diagnostic technology was approved by 13 European countries  and the listing on the FSE will certainly provide the Company with exposure to the European investment community.Founder  chairman and CEO Dr. Robert E. W. Hancock stated  ""Asep is addressing globally critical issues causing the failure of antibiotics. Trading in Germany (Europe) enables us to maintain a global investor base to support the advanced development of our breakthrough sepsis diagnostics and anti-biofilm therapeutics.""ABOUT THE FRANKFURT STOCK EXCHANGEThe FSE is one of the world's largest international trading centres for securities.

(boerse-frankfurt.de/en)ABOUT ASEP MEDICAL HOLDINGS INC.Asep Medical Inc. (asepmedical.com) is dedicated to addressing antibiotic failure by developing novel solutions for significant unmet medical needs. The Company is a consolidation of two existing private companies (Sepset Biosciences Inc. (Sepset Inc.) and ABT Innovations Inc. (ABT Inc.)  that are both in the advanced development of both proprietary diagnostic tools  enabling the early and timely identification of severe sepsis as well as broad-spectrum therapeutic agents to address multidrug-resistant biofilm infections.Story continuesSepset Inc. (sepset.ca) is developing a diagnostic technology that involves a patient gene expression signature that predicts severe sepsis  one of the significant diseases leading to antibiotic failure since antibiotics are the primary treatment for sepsis. Despite this  sepsis is responsible for nearly 20% of all deaths on the planet. The SepsetER test is a blood-based gene expression assay that is straightforward to implement  and results are obtained in about an hour in the emergency room or intensive care unit. This proprietary diagnostic technology differs from current diagnostic tests in enabling diagnosis of severe sepsis within 1-2 hours of first clinical presentation (i.e.  in the emergency room)  while other diagnostics only provide diagnosis after 24-36 hours. Asep Inc. believes this will enable critical early decisions to be made by physicians regarding appropriate therapies and reduce overall morbidity and mortality due to sepsis.ABT Inc.'s (abtinnovations.ca) peptide technology covers a broad range of therapeutic applications  including bacterial biofilm infections (medical device infections  chronic infections  lung  bladder  wound  dental  skin  ear-nose and throat  sinusitis  orthopaedic  etc.)  anti-inflammatories  anti-infective immune-modulators and vaccine adjuvants. The company is in the pre-clinical development phase with promising data.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS —This news release contains certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of such statements under applicable securities law.

These statements include but are not limited to the successful clinical testing of our Sepsis diagnostic test and its intended filing for regulatory approval; and the undertaking of pre-clinical studies on our lead therapeutic  with the expectation that this will lead to fast-track clinical trials.

(""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") announces that its subsidiary  AMG LIVA  has put its first battery Hybrid Energy Storage System (“HESS”) into fully automatic operation mode in Hauzenberg  Germany. The HESS battery system is an ecosystem combining Lithium-Ion and Vanadium Redox Flow batteries with artificial intelligence routines and self-learning algorithms to maximize efficiency  safety and lifetime of the batteries  integrating the HESS with the facility’s power system  renewable energy sources  and the electrical grid.The HESS system is being used at AMG Graphite’s Hauzenberg facility to flatten production-driven spikes in electricity demand  known as “Peak Shaving.” This industrial application reduces CO 2 emissions and energy costs. The system is also used for emergency power supply and has black-start capabilities in case of full power failure. AMG LIVA intends to expand the HESS system at Hauzenberg to include a large-scale solar power plant integration to further reduce facility energy costs. Further development will include utilizing the HESS for service with the electrical grid (“Frequency Containment Reserve”).LIVA hybrid energy storage systems are important elements of AMG’s strategy to enable energy efficiency and CO 2 reduction for its customers in industrial operations.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announced that the Company has been awarded a second grant from the European Innovation Council (EIC) to support the enhancement of an innovative Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology for restoring mobility and upper limb function in people with spinal cord injury.Under the EIC Pathfinder funding program  a grant of EUR 3.7 million has been awarded to ONWARD and its research partners  including EPFL and CEA-Clinatec.The project is entitled  “Auto-Adaptive Neuromorphic Brain Machine Interface (NEMO BMI): Toward Fully Embedded Neuroprosthetics.” Under the terms of the grant  ONWARD will receive EUR 1.0 million.The NEMO-BMI project will support usability improvements that enable the use of a BCI to support upper and lower limb movement. Auto-adaptive algorithms will be developed for brain decoding and brain-guided spinal cord stimulation patterns and will then be embedded in miniaturized hardware. The goal of the program is to further enhance the BCI technology to make it reliable  small  and easy to implant  as well as to improve the BCI’s usability and manufacturability.The NEMO-BMI project has started and will complement the ongoing work of the Reverse Paralysis project  for which ONWARD and its research partners received an EIC grant of EUR 3.6 million in June 2022. These proceeds are being used to fund integration between ONWARD’s implanted ARC-IM system  which delivers targeted  programmed stimulation of the spinal cord  and Clinatec’s WIMAGINE  a fully implantable device approved for chronic use in clinical trials in two European countries  which records and decodes the brain's cortical signal to predict a person's desired movement intentions. While NEMO-BMI is a separate project from Reverse Paralysis  its goal is to build on the Reverse Paralysis framework and incorporate any improvements into the joint ONWARD-Clinatec BCI technology platform. The technology improvements developed in the NEMO-BMI project will be evaluated independently and then used in clinical trials as part of the Reverse Paralysis project.ONWARD and Research Partners Win First Place in the 2022 Brain-Computer Interface AwardSeparately  ONWARD announced that it was the First Place Winner of the 2022 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Award. The award was granted to ONWARD and several research partners for their submission  “Walking naturally after spinal cord injury using a brain-spine interface.” This application focused on the work being done under the Reverse Paralysis project to develop a fully implantable brain-computer interface to help people walk more naturally after spinal cord injury with the benefit of ONWARD’s ARC Therapy.The International BCI Award is one of the top accolades in BCI research and was created to recognize outstanding and innovative research in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces. The award is given by the BCI Award Foundation. This year  more than 100 projects were submitted  and the jury selected 12 finalists  including teams from Stanford University and the University of California San Francisco.“The additional funding from EIC as well as the First Place in the 2022 Brain-Computer Interface Awards provide strong validation of the important work ONWARD and our partners are doing to advance the use of BCI to improve mobility ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. ""We are collaborating with the best in the field to develop and eventually commercialize a BCI platform that we hope will optimize the effectiveness of our therapies to restore movement for people living with paralysis.”About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for paraplegia (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for tetraplegia (paralysis of all four limbs). Treatments are urgently needed to restore movement and improve quality of life.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries. ONWARD’s work builds on more than a decade of basic science and preclinical research conducted at the world’s leading neuroscience laboratories. ONWARD’s ARC Therapy  which can be delivered by implantable (ARC-IM) or external (ARC-EX) systems  is designed to deliver targeted  programmed spinal cord stimulation to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury  ultimately improving their quality of life.ONWARD has received five Breakthrough Device Designations from the U.S. FDA encompassing both ARC-IM and ARC-EX. ARC-EX is an external  non-invasive platform consisting of a wearable stimulator and wireless programmer. Positive top-line data were reported in September 2022 from the company’s first pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  evaluating the ability of ARC-EX Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. The company is now preparing marketing approval submissions for the U.S. and Europe. ARC-IM consists of an implantable pulse generator and lead that is placed near the spinal cord. The company completed its first-in-human use of the ARC-IM neurostimulator in May 2022.ONWARD is headquartered in Eindhoven  the Netherlands. It maintains a Science and Engineering Center in Lausanne  Switzerland  and has a growing U.S. presence in Boston  Massachusetts. The company has an academic partnership with.NeuroRestore  a collaboration between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV).

For advertisers  every second counts  therefore there is more demand than ever to understand the creative levers linking attention to brand performance. This announcement follows Azerion’s contribution to IAB Australia’s ‘Ad Attention Measurement Landscape Report 2022.’The survey reveals that Azerion formats generate up to 20x more attention than standard display. Results also showed that Azerion’s desktop and smartphone high-impact formats deliver more attention than any alternative display advertising solution on the web. Researchers looked at the performance of campaigns with similar formats and discovered that in all instances  Azerion’s formats drove significantly more attention than its competitors' formats  highlighting the power that creative has on viewability.Sebastiaan Moesman  CRO at Azerion  comments: “We are excited to take part in this fascinating survey  allowing us to contextualise how the right targeting and decisioning can drive attention  and subsequently client outcomes. We have been assessing the performance of our campaigns for years and are resolute in continuously improving our products  therefore we are pleased to give an update on the key factors we have found to be crucial in driving an effective campaign. Digital advertising can only work if it captures attention  so we at Azerion are keen to integrate and ensure that brand  performance  and value are at the heart of every campaign.”Azerion conducted the survey with longtime partner Lumen Research  a specialist eye-tracking research agency  to help brands and publishers move beyond viewability and enhance their knowledge in respect to media quality. Lumen measures visual attention across media and applies the same standard of visibility and display to everything  enabling users to provide objective  third-party attention metrics for all of their client campaigns by using industry-leading eye tracking data. This consistent approach can estimate various measures of attention across desktop and smartphone  delivering accurate and predictive data about campaign performance.The ability to measure ad attention is highly desirable and a valuable tool to demonstrate that ads are not only seen  but more importantly  that there is a direct relationship between the time spent looking at the ad and brand recall  and in turn  consumer action. One of the most important metrics used to measure attention is ‘attention seconds per 1000 impressions.’ Using this metric as the main expression of attention generated by an ad  researchers are able to measure the true capability of each ad format's ability to direct gaze.With over 200 visual engagement studies  Azerion has been able to understand which elements of the creative drive more attention  helping propel impactful creatives to deliver higher attention and brand performance. For this study  three campaigns were compared. Campaign One and Two had strong digitally specific layered assets that were used to help animate and enhance page content. Campaign Three had basic assets (i.e.  flat press imagery and a TVC file) which limited creative flexibility. Results revealed that Campaign One and Two had a significant impact on visual engagement time compared to Campaign Three. In a more recent study  it was found that sidebars drive more attention than headers  assets on the left hand side drive more attention than non-video creative  video creative drives more attention than non-video creative  and vertical video drives more attention than horizontal.Recent technological developments and innovations have opened doors to new opportunities to target audiences efficiently and effectively through an exciting combination of engaging creatives  ad messaging  ad placement  and quality of environment. Digital advertising sits at the core of the Azerion platform  providing brands and publishers with a wide range of opportunities to capture the attention of diverse audiences worldwide. As this technology develops further  Azerion continues to look for new and creative ways to drive campaign engagement and achieve even higher performance. By pairing a vast range of high-impact ad formats with strategic  data-driven research  Azerion has been able to push the limits of media sales and continuously deliver better value for the brands they work with. In order to help empower more creative best practice  Azerion will be looking to extend these studies across their wider advertising portfolio.- Ends -About AzerionAzerion is a high-growth digital entertainment and media platform.

Q3 results are positively impacted by the new Company-wide pricing strategies implemented since Q2 and strong volume dynamics related to new or existing contracts. In addition  we have made significant progress towards restoring normal operations at our Pau Branco mine. We have received permission to continue to use alternative waste piles until the beginning of Q2 2023. In parallel  we have finalized civil works related to the restoration of the minimum safety factor of the core Cachoeirinha waste pile and registered the request for its release.Story continuesWithin our businesses  Q4 mine production will be above our previous assumptions  at lower prices. Our tube business continues to perform strongly across the global platform  even though we are seeing higher energy costs in the to be closed German operations. In addition  as part of our focus on inventory management  we have scrapped unallocated materials and inventories with low resale value potential  leading to one-off expenses in 2022.Overall  we confirm our full year 2022 EBITDA objective of €650 million to €750 million  and we are on track to deliver positive Free Cash Flow in the second half  driven by an expected strong Q4 performance.At the same time  we are making steady progress in the implementation of our New Vallourec plan: in recent weeks we have secured firm social agreements in France  Germany  and the UK  substantially de-risking our plan and allowing our teams to focus on execution. In addition  we will expand the scope of the transformation of our business and implement New Vallourec plan initiatives in other geographies  starting with Brazil. Our strategic targets remain unchanged: to become cycle proof and to increase our margins towards best-in class levels. The New Vallourec plan is fully on track to generate €230 million of recurring EBITDA uplift with full impact starting in Q2 2024.”KEY DATA9 Months 2022 9 Months 2021 Change In € million Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change 1 290 1 130 14.2% Production shipped (k tons) 462 391 18.2% 3 342 2 378 40.5% Revenue 1 281 834 53.6% 403 356 €47m EBITDA 198 128 €70m 12.1% 15.0% (2.9)p.p.

For the First Nine Months 2022  revenues totaled €100 million  up 3% year-on-year and down by 7% at constant exchange rates.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS ANALYSISQ3 2022 consolidated results analysisIn Q3 2022  EBITDA amounted to €198 million compared with €128 million in Q3 2021; the EBITDA margin stood at 15.4% of revenues versus 15.3% in Q3 2021  reflecting:An industrial margin of €278 million  or 21.7% of revenues  versus €207 million or 24.8% of revenues in Q3 2021. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was partially offset by the negative impact of the lower mine activity.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) stood at €77 million or 6% of revenue versus 9% in Q3 2021.Operating income was positive at €89 million  compared to €72 million in Q3 2021. In Q3 2022  the Group booked €51 million mainly related to adaptation measures in Germany and the accelerated amortization of ceased activities.Financial income was negative at €(30) million  compared with €(36) million in Q3 2021; net interest expenses in Q3 2022 stood at €(25) million reflecting the new balance sheet structure.Income tax amounted to €(53) million compared to €(41) million in Q3 2021  reflecting both corporate tax as well as changes in deferred taxes.This resulted in positive net income  Group share  of €6 million  compared to negative €(7) million in Q3 2021.First nine months 2022 consolidated results analysisOver the first nine months 2022  EBITDA amounted to €403 million  a €47 million increase year-on-year  to stand at 12.1% of revenues  reflecting:An industrial margin of €661 million or 19.8% of revenues  up €43 million compared with 9M 2021. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) of €260 million  or 7.8% of revenues  versus €233 million and 9.8% of revenues in 9M 2021.Operating income was negative at €(286) million compared with a positive €299 million in 9M 2021  resulting mainly from provisions related to the adaptation measures (European social plans and associated fees) and  to a lesser extent  from provisions for non-recurring costs in respect of the mine incident.Financial income was negative at €(51) million  compared with €(221) million in 9M 2021; net interest expenses in 9M 2022 of €(70) million reflecting the new balance sheet structure  were partially offset by other financial income.Income tax amounted to €(104) million mainly related to North America and Brazil.As a result  net income  Group share  amounted to €(444) million  compared to €(49) million in 9M 2021.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITIONCash flow from operating activitiesIn Q3 2022  cash flow from operating activities improved to €108 million  compared to €18 million in Q3 2021; mainly driven by a higher EBITDA and lower income tax cash-out.Over the first nine months  cash flow from operating activities was positive at €169 million compared to €16 million in 9M 2021. The improvement was mainly related to lower income tax.Operating working capital requirementIn Q3 2022  the operating working capital requirement increased by €(135) million  versus a rise of €(93) million in Q3 2021  reflecting higher forward volume expectations and raw-material price increases. The net working capital requirement stood at 118 days of sales  compared to 111 days in Q3 2021.For the first nine months 2022  the operating working capital requirement increased by €(538) million versus an increase of €(232) million in 9M 2021.CapexCapital expenditure was €(54) million in Q3 2022  compared with €(28) million in Q3 2021  and €(113) million in 9M 2022 compared to €(84) million in 9M 2021.For the full year it is expected to be around €200 million  including €120 million of capital expenditures equally spread over FY 2022 and FY 2023 related to the transfer of the German Oil & Gas activities to Brazil.Free cash flowAs a result  in Q3 2022  free cash flow was negative at €(81) million versus €(103) million in Q3 2021.Free cash flow for 9M 2022 was negative at €(482) million  compared with €(300) million in 9M 2021  after €538 million working capital build over the first nine months.Free Cash Flow will be positive in H2  driven by an expected strong performance in Q4.Asset disposals and other itemsIn Q3 2022  asset disposals and other items amounted to €(24) million compared with €(171) million in Q3 2021.Over the first nine months of 2022  they amounted to €(54) million.Net debt and liquidityAs of September 30  2022  net debt stood at €1 493 million  compared with €1 389 million at June 30  2022. Gross debt amounted to €1 784 million including €76 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to €1 375 million and short-term debt totaled €409 million.Net debt at year-end 2022 is projected below September levels thanks to an expected strong free cash flow performance in Q4.As of September 30  2022  lease debt stood at €78 million following the application of IFRS 16 standards  compared with €61 million on June 30  2022.As of September 30  2022  the liquidity position was strong at €703 million  with cash amounting to €291 million and an undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of €412 million.As of November 21  2022  Vallourec has fully repaid the utilized Revolving Credit Facility. The Group also closed a $210 million asset-backed loan with a 5-year tenor provided by a group of four top ranked international banks.The Group has no repayments scheduled before June 2026.UPDATE ON PAU BRANCO MINEOperations at Vallourec’s Pau Branco iron ore mine were temporarily suspended in January 2022 following flooding which caused damage to its Cachoeirinha waste pile. Operations were partially restarted in May using an alternative waste pile  albeit at lower-than-normal capacity levels. Volumes extracted in first nine months 2022 amounted to c.2.6 million tons.Permissions from authorities have been obtained to continue to use alternative waste piles until the beginning of Q2 2023. In parallel  the Group has finalized civil works related to the restoration of the minimum safety factor of the core Cachoeirinha waste pile and registered the request for full release.For 2022 as a whole  Vallourec estimates production of around 3.8 million tons  which is embedded in our FY 2022 EBITDA outlook.MARKET TRENDSOil & GasIn North America  the highly favorable market conditions should continue through year-end and into 2023. The OCTG market remains very tight in terms of available supply.In EA-MEA  ongoing volume recovery is expected in the coming quarters especially in the dynamic Middle East markets  with a progressive recovery in pricing power.In Europe  higher energy costs are set to impact GDP growth.In South America  prices and volumes are expected to increase.Industry & OtherIn Brazil  the outlook for volumes is neutral  with price increases fully offsetting cost inflation.OUTLOOKWe confirm our EBITDA objective for FY 2022 in a range of €650 to €750 million.Capex is expected to be around €200 million  including approximately €60 million for the preparation of the transfer of Oil & Gas volumes from Germany to Brazil.Free Cash Flow will be positive in H2  driven by an expected strong Q4 performance.NEW VALLOUREC PLAN ON TRACK WITH NEW INITIATIVES ADDEDThe New Vallourec plan  announced in May 2022  remains fully on track. The plan aims to generate €230 million of recurring EBITDA uplift and around €20 million CAPEX reduction with full impact starting in Q2 2024  contributing to making the Group cycle-proof and generating positive free cash flow2 even at the bottom of the cycle.In recent weeks we have secured firm social agreements in France  Germany  and the UK  substantially de-risking our plan and allowing our teams to focus on execution. Moreover  we will implement New Vallourec plan initiatives in other geographies starting with Brazil  as well as production increases in the US and Saudi Arabia.In addition  a value-over-volume strategy incorporates portfolio rationalization to drive profitable growth. Vallourec aims to achieve best-in-class profitability levels and close the margin gap with peers.Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may include forward-looking statements.

Cucinelli said choosing EssilorLuxottica is “a token of mutual affection and respect between two realities that are inspired by a passion for beauty and for things done well.”Speaking of the “special relationship” with Del Vecchio  he said: “I will never forget his words to me: ‘Look  Brunello  I don’t know if my eyewear is beautiful; what I can vouch for is that it is made in the best possible way.’ It is a statement that I feel is very close to the way I myself view work. Then I still fondly remember when  in the last days of his life  he spoke of the ‘beautiful factory’ in Agordo: for me he was a true source of inspiration and it is not a coincidence that our constant commitment is directed precisely to increasingly beautify our factory in Solomeo.
