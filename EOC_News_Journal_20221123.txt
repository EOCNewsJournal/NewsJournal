13563,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/hong-kongs-crypto-push-sets-up-race-bottom-2022-11-22/,Hong Kong's crypto push sets up race to bottom,Few cities in the world have expressed a desire to throw open cryptocurrency trading to retail investors since the devastating collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange. That puts Hong Kong in a league of its own.,HONG KONG  Nov 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Few cities in the world have expressed a desire to throw open cryptocurrency trading to retail investors since the devastating collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange. That puts Hong Kong in a league of its own.Its financial secretary  Paul Chan  effectively committed to pressing ahead with a plan to develop the Asian financial centre into a virtual assets hub in his official blog last week. It is also eye-catching because it follows Beijing’s sweeping ban in 2021 on all cryptocurrency transactions in mainland China. And while many big global crypto companies got their start in Hong Kong  regulatory ambiguity and strict rules limiting trading to institutional investors prompted some to move  including FTX  which left for the Bahamas.Its vision is not groundbreaking. Under a policy shift last month  Hong Kong officials said the Securities and Futures Commission will conduct a public consultation on how retail investors can be given a “suitable degree of access” with a new licensing regime  and the SFC also said it was looking at allowing ETFs exposed to Bitcoin and Ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Germany’s Deutsche Boerse(DB1Gn.DE) has offered investors access to exchange-traded notes tracking cryptocurrencies since June 2020.Yet the big U-turn feeds into a growing rivalry with Singapore to lure capital and wealthy technology entrepreneurs. The Lion City has had some form of cryptocurrency regulation since 2020 and its biggest bank  DBS Group (DBSM.SI)  has championed a digital exchange for its clients gradually expanding access to the mass affluent. While Singapore’s central bank reminded the public on Monday that cryptocurrencies can lose all their value  it also re-upped its recent proposals on basic investor protections on companies licensed to operate in the city state.Both hubs are trying to tap demand in the region. According to Chainalysis  cryptocurrency values received by internet addresses in Singapore reached $100 billion in the year to June 2022  with Hong Kong not too far behind at around $70 billion. It builds on an outsized enthusiasm for digital assets across the region – an aspired-to catchment area for both cities. The blockchain analysis firm lists Asian countries in six of the top 10 globally for cryptocurrency adoption in 2022 including India and China.The competitive tension between Hong Kong and Singapore is greater than ever. The danger is that Hong Kong’s new embrace of virtual assets will set up a regulatory race to the bottom  even if FTX’s collapse means it might happen at a slower pace.Follow @t__shum and @PranavKiranBV on Twitter(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own. Refiles to add coding.)loadingloadingCONTEXT NEWSHong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan reiterated the city’s commitment to becoming a virtual asset hub in a blog post on Nov. 13  two days after cryptocurrency exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States.The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau on Oct. 31 said the Securities and Futures Commission will conduct a public consultation on how retail investors may be given “a suitable degree of access” to virtual assets under a planned new licensing framework for the industry. The policy statement notes that retail investors in other markets have been granted exposure to virtual assets including through exchange-traded products.Separately  the Monetary Authority of Singapore on Nov. 21 said “the most important lesson from the FTX debacle is that dealing in any cryptocurrency  on any platform  is hazardous”. It added that FTX was not licensed in the city state and there was no evidence it was specifically soliciting Singapore users.

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO  Globocan data)  the incidence of this cancer was about 202 000 new cases in 2020 in Europe and North America  increasing by 2.5% per year on average. In France  this cancer affected about 15 000 patients in 2020  of which nearly 45% would be at the metastatic stage. Diagnosis is generally made by imaging and biological tests on biopsy.Pancreatic cancer is particularly insidious because it is a ""silent"" disease that causes no symptoms in its early stages. Often diagnosed at a late stage  this cancer has a poor prognosis. Few treatments are available: surgery and/or chemotherapy. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis  chemotherapy remains the only treatment option  whether it is based on gemcitabine or 5-FU  alone or in combination.GemciTest®  an in-vitro diagnostic developed by Acobiom  is a predictive PCR test for response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment. This CE-marked molecular diagnostic identifies patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC  a form of pancreatic cancer) whose transcriptomic profile is not favorable for the prescription of a first-line gemcitabine-based therapy (alone or in combination). This test will thus make it possible to guide patients towards another more suitable or more effective therapy  to avoid unnecessary side effects or toxicities  and thus to risk a ""loss of chance"" for these patients.Story continuesA new test based on the latest technologiesGemciTest has been developed with Acobiom's technology platform  which combines genomic and transcriptomic techniques (NGS sequencing  real-time PCR) with bioinformatics  biostatistics and artificial intelligence (machine learning) tools and programs for data processing and analysis.Developed and validated using real-world data and samples  this molecular diagnostics is based on a proprietary combination of RNA markers present in blood. The test was evaluated in a confirmatory study to measure its sensitivity in predicting the response of PDAC patients to a gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment.This confirmatory study demonstrated the value of using GemciTest® in clinics and also reveals the potential of RNA marker combinations in blood in the development of precision medicine and personalized therapy for patients with pancreatic cancer.“The signature of this commercial agreement with Eurobio Scientific is the recognition of the quality of the developments made by the Acobiom team by a key-player of the in-vitro diagnostic industry in France""  says Didier Ritter  President of Acobiom. ""It is also a first step for our company  as other predictive diagnostics in precision medicine are currently in development  notably to predict the response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of pancreatic cancer.”Jean-Michel Carle  CEO of Eurobio Scientific  added: ""The importance of a predictive response test for a disease as difficult as pancreatic cancer will be a major asset for physicians by allowing their patients to avoid losing chances due to inappropriate treatments. The strength of the new technologies used and the quality of the work done by Acobiom  as demonstrated by the results of their real-world clinical tests  have convinced us of the immediate relevance of this new test"".About GemciTest®GemciTest® is a predictive molecular diagnostic for response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment. This CE-marked PCR test is intended for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This in-vitro diagnostic has been developed from Acobiom's technology platform  which combines genomic and transcriptomic techniques (NGS sequencing  real-time PCR) on the one hand  and bioinformatics  biostatistics and machine learning tools and programs for data processing and analysis on the other.Developed and validated using real world data and samples  GemciTest® is based on a patented combination of RNA markers present in blood and has been evaluated in a confirmatory study. The clinical validation of this PCR test was performed on 336 patients (mean age 68.7; 37-88). Patients with a clinical benefit (OS > 8.7 months; PFS ≥3.5 months) identified by GemciTest® (29.7%) had significantly a longer PFS (5.3 vs. 2.8 months) and a longer OS (10.4 vs. 4.8 months). GemciTest® -positive patients had significantly longer PFS (HR=0.53 (95% CI: 0.31-0.92); p=0.023) and OS (HR=0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.85); p=0.0091).About Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a major player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

Capital repayments will therefore recommence from February 1  2024. This extension was conditional upon NCX 470 meeting the primary objective of non-inferiority to latanoprost in the recently reported Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial.The Company was previously financed to mid-November 2023. Proceeds from this equity financing  together with the extension of the period of interest-only payment of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the cash runway to mid-May 2024. This cash runway is based exclusively on the development of NCX 470. The calculation does not include any potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants included in the private placement (the exercise of which are not under the Company’s control)  which could provide an additional €11.6 million in proceeds if they were to be fully exercised.Cash PositionThe Nicox Group had cash and cash equivalents of €25.6 million (excluding the proceeds of this financing) as of September 30  2022 and outstanding debt of €21.4 million (including €18.6 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos signed in January 2019  a €2.0 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in August 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  and financial lease agreements for €0.8 million). The Nicox Group's cash position after this private placement would amount to approximately €31 million.Story continuesAll of the figures related to the cash and debt position of the Nicox Group as of September 30  2022 are unaudited.Nicox has carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that the Company has sufficient net working capital to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and is financed until mid-May 2024  based exclusively on the development of NCX 470.Upcoming milestones on key development programsDenali Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: Topline results currently expected in 2025Initiation of two new Phase 3b clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action (nitric oxide and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470: planned in H1 2023Portfolio and PipelineThe pipeline of product candidates and products is available on the Company’s website.NCX 470 is a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The first Phase 3 clinical trial  Mont Blanc  has been completed and results were announced on October 31  2022. A second Phase 3 clinical trial  Denali  is ongoing  with results currently expected in 2025. This is beyond the estimated cash runway (May 2024)  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. Two new Phase 3b clinical trials evaluating the dual mechanism of action (NO and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and the potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are planned to start in H1 2023. These new clinical trials will evaluate (i) the effect of NCX 470 on Episcleral Venous Pressure (EVP) and outflow through the trabecular meshwork and (ii) ocular perfusion via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) angiography on retinal vessels. Together  these trials are designed to validate NCX 470’s dual mechanism of action in humans and potentially demonstrate some of the beneficial effects on the retina that have been observed in nonclinical models. The Company is actively looking for commercial partners in the U.S. and Japan  to maximize the potential future value of NCX 470. In the Chinese market  NCX 470 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics  who are also jointly and equally funding the Denali clinical trial.NCX 1728 is an NO-donating phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor under evaluation for development in certain retinal conditions. It is currently in nonclinical development. Progression in the nonclinical evaluation of NCX 1728 has established it as a potential candidate for indications in the area of retinal conditions  and therefore the Company will not conduct further evaluation of NCX 1728 for the lowering of IOP.NCX 4251 is a novel  patented  ophthalmic suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals  in development for dry eye disease. NCX 4251 has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial  Mississippi  in blepharitis (announced September 23  2021)  which did not meet the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Post hoc results  announced November 30  2021  showed a statistically and clinically significant reduction in dry eye disease symptoms versus placebo in patients who scored more highly for a key sign of dry eye disease (fluorescein staining) and following a subsequent meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  the future development of NCX 4251 is focused on dry eye disease. No development activities are currently ongoing outside China pending the Company entering into a partnership for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 in the U.S. Nicox is seeking a partner for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 outside of the Chinese market where it is exclusively licensed to Ocumension.VYZULTA® (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution)  0.024%  indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  is exclusively licensed worldwide to Bausch + Lomb  a leading global eye health company. VYZULTA is commercialized in multiple countries including the U.S.  with other approvals and launches ongoing.ZERVIATE® (cetirizine ophthalmic solution)  0.24%  indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  has been exclusively licensed in the U.S. to Eyevance Pharmaceuticals and is commercialized there since March 2020. ZERVIATE has also been exclusively licensed to Ocumension for development and commercialization in the Chinese and the majority of the South East Asian markets. An additional Phase 3 clinical trial has been completed in China and a New Drug Application is in preparation. ZERVIATE is also the subject of exclusive licensing agreements with Samil Pharmaceutical in South Korea and Vietnam  with ITROM Pharmaceutical Group in the Gulf Arab States and with Laboratorios Grin in Mexico.The clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are expected to be fully financed with the proceeds of this equity financing. Results from the Denali trial for NCX 470 are currently expected in 2025  outside of the estimated cash runway  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. The planned costs of nonclinical activities associated with NCX 1728 are not significant. The costs of development and potential commercialization of Nicox’s product candidate and products NCX 4251  VYZULTA® and ZERVIATE® are  or would be  the responsibility of Nicox’s partners. The net book value of NCX 4251 was decreased to zero (reduction of €15.1 million in 2021 and €11.0 million in H1 2022) in the U.S. due to the additional costs and timings associated with the change in indication  and the subsequent decision to out-license the product. The net book value of ZERVIATE (€26.0 million) corresponds mainly to the value of the asset allocated to the Chinese territory where rights are granted to Ocumension. This follows an impairment (€12.7 million) to the value in the U.S. taking into consideration changes in the U.S. market for topical anti-allergics.Principal terms of the equity financingThe share capital increase without preferential rights  by issuance of 6 849 316 new ordinary shareswith attached warrants to acquire 6 849 316 additional new ordinary shares (the warrants  and together with the new shares  the units) was reserved for subscription by (i) one or more French or foreign companies or mutual funds investing in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (une ou plusieurs sociétés ou fonds gestionnaires d’épargne collective de droit français ou de droit étranger investissant dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique)  (ii) natural persons who regularly invest in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (des personnes physiques investissant à titre habituel dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique) or (iii) one or more credit institutions or any authorized investment services provider undertaking to acquire them for resale to the persons mentioned in (i) and (ii) above (un ou plusieurs établissements de crédit ou tout prestataire de services d’investissement habilité s’engageant à les acquérir pour les revendre aux personnes visées au (i) et (ii) ci-dessus)  pursuant to the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of Nicox dated July 28  2022. There is only one investor participating in this financing.The Board of Directors set the issue price of the units at €1.46 (€1 nominal value and €0.46 issue premium) and the exercise price of the warrants at €1.70 on November 21  2022. In accordance with the methods for determination of the subscription price set in the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of July 28  2022  the issue price shows (i) a discount of 14.54% compared to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price  i.e. €1.7084 and (ii) a discount of 52.6% compared to this average including the theoretical value of a warrant (i.e. €0.65  the theoretical value of the warrant having been obtained using the method Black Scholes and assuming volatility of 40%). The subscription price of each share resulting from the exercise of the warrants will be €1.70  which shows a discount of 0.49% to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price. Following the completion of the capital increase  the new shares will represent 15.8% of the Company’s issued share capital before the capital increase and 13.7% after the capital increase. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.If at any time whilst the warrants from this private placement are outstanding  the Company undergoes a merger by acquisition (fusion par absorption)  merger (fusion par création d’une nouvelle société)  division (scission)  or a change of control within the meaning assigned in article L.233-3 I of the French commercial code (Code de commerce)  and where the consideration for such transaction is securities at a per share value below the exercise price of the warrants  the warrant holder shall have the option to request the Company to repurchase the warrants and pay an amount determined on the basis of a Black Scholes formula. The warrant holder may only request such payment after closing of the transaction concerned. The assumptions to be used in the Black Scholes calculation  including a minimum level of volatility  have been set out in the warrant agreement  and are not the same as those for the valuation of the warrants as set out in the paragraph above. Based on the assumptions included in the warrant agreement  and todays interest rates  together with other market assumptions  if the Company was to be acquired today in a stock transaction  at a price of €1.69  and the warrant holder requested to the Company that they wished to receive the payment  the payment would be €7.2 million. This amount would be less if the price of the transaction was lower  it will decrease over time and is also subject to changes in the other assumptions used in the Black Scholes calculation. This amount would be paid after any amount due to Kreos Capital  should they decide to ask for repayment of the debt held by the company as a result of the transaction. In the case of transfer of the warrants to another warrant holder  the right to the option to request the repurchase of the warrants does not transfer to the new holder.If the warrants associated with this private placement were exercised in their entirety  the total gross proceeds would be approximately €11.6 million.The impact of this share capital increase  and of the warrants  should they be exercised  on (i) the stake held in the Company’s share capital by a shareholder holding 1%  and (ii) the share of equity (on a consolidated and per-share basis) as on September 30  2022  in each case calculated on a non-diluted and fully-diluted basis  i.e. taking into account the issuance of a maximum of 10 927 648 new shares upon (x) exercise of all outstanding previously issued warrants and stock options  and (y) the definitive acquisition of all free shares outstanding and (z) the conversion into shares of the Kreos convertible bonds is as follows:SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST (%) SHARE OF EQUITY PER SHARE BASIS (IN €) Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis * Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis*Before issue of new shares 1% of the share capital 0.80% 1.398 1.704 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares 0.86% 0.71% 1.386 1.660 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares and 6 849 316 shares resulting from warrants resulting from the exercise of all the warrants (according to the exercise parity of 1 warrants giving the right to subscribe to 1 share of the Company) 0.76% 0.64% 1.424 1.664* The calculations are based on the assumption that 6 622 848 warrants and 3 278 450 stock options will be exercised and that 1 026 350 free shares granted will be vested and that all Kreos convertible bonds will be converted into 900 000 shares.Directors and Executive Committee members of Nicox  including the Chief Executive Officer  have agreed to certain customary lock-up arrangements with the Placement Agents (as defined below) on the shares they hold in Nicox for a 90-day period from the settlement date (subject to certain customary exemptions).The Company has agreed to customary arrangements not to issue new shares or instruments giving rights to shares for a 90-day period from the settlement date  and has also agreed not to undertake any equity issue which involves a variable rate transaction for a 180-day period from the settlement date (in both cases subject to certain customary exceptions).Use of proceedsThe proceeds of the private placement will be exclusively allocated to the development of NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of warrants granted in the context of this financing are not taken into account in this analysis. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the private placement  by order of priority  (i) to complete the final activities in the Mont Blanc trial on NCX 470 (approximately 34%)  (ii) continue to progress the Denali trial on NCX 470 (approximately 49%)  (iii) finance stability studies on the finished product and manufacture a validation batch of the active ingredient to generate information for the preparation of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. FDA (approximately 15%) and (iv) to complete clinical trials aiming to demonstrate the dual mechanism of action and the potential beneficial effects of NCX 470 on the retina (2%). It is estimated that the cash available  before the proceeds of the private placement  is sufficient to cover the fixed costs of the Company for two years. Therefore  the proceeds of the private placement will not be used to cover these costs. The proceeds from the issue  together with the extension of the interest-only period of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the liquidity horizon until mid-May 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of the warrants (which are not in the control of the Company)  if any  are not taken into account in this analysis.Proceeds from this financing are not intended to be used to repay  in whole or in part  neither capital or interest  the debt from Kreos nor the loan agreement guaranteed by the French State  which are financed by the revenues generated by the license contracts.The potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants  if any  would extend the cash runway up to the last quarter of 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. As an indication  the estimate of the net proceeds from the issue of the new shares is approximately €8.9 million. In the event that all of the warrants are exercised  the proceeds from the issuance of shares resulting from the warrants are estimated at approximately €11.6 million  or a maximum total net income of €20.5 million.The potential proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued in the context of a prior financing in December 2021  estimated at approximately €16.3 million  could extend the cash runway beyond 2024 and allow the completion of the Denali trial and finance the submission of an NDA for NCX 470 with the FDA.Listing of new sharesAn application will be made for the admission to listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.The Company will submit to the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) for approval a listing prospectus (the ""Listing Prospectus"")  composed of (i) the “Document d’Enregistrement Universel  rapport financier annuel et rapport de gestion 2021” filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on April 29  2022 under number D.22-0392  and its first amendment filed on May 19  2022 under the number D. 22-0392-A01  available on Nicox SA’s website (www.nicox.com) (""Universal Registration Document"") with (ii) its second amendment and (iii) a Note d’Opération in connection with the admission to trading and listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris and which will include a summary of the Prospectus.Risks factors that are likely to have a material effect on Nicox’s business are presented in the 3rd chapter of the Universal Registration Document 2021  as may be amended or supplemented from time to time.H.C.

Capital repayments will therefore recommence from February 1  2024. This extension was conditional upon NCX 470 meeting the primary objective of non-inferiority to latanoprost in the recently reported Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial.The Company was previously financed to mid-November 2023. Proceeds from this equity financing  together with the extension of the period of interest-only payment of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the cash runway to mid-May 2024. This cash runway is based exclusively on the development of NCX 470. The calculation does not include any potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants included in the private placement (the exercise of which are not under the Company’s control)  which could provide an additional €11.6 million in proceeds if they were to be fully exercised.Cash PositionThe Nicox Group had cash and cash equivalents of €25.6 million (excluding the proceeds of this financing) as of September 30  2022 and outstanding debt of €21.4 million (including €18.6 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos signed in January 2019  a €2.0 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in August 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  and financial lease agreements for €0.8 million). The Nicox Group's cash position after this private placement would amount to approximately €31 million.Story continuesAll of the figures related to the cash and debt position of the Nicox Group as of September 30  2022 are unaudited.Nicox has carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that the Company has sufficient net working capital to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and is financed until mid-May 2024  based exclusively on the development of NCX 470.Upcoming milestones on key development programsDenali Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: Topline results currently expected in 2025Initiation of two new Phase 3b clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action (nitric oxide and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470: planned in H1 2023Portfolio and PipelineThe pipeline of product candidates and products is available on the Company’s website.NCX 470 is a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The first Phase 3 clinical trial  Mont Blanc  has been completed and results were announced on October 31  2022. A second Phase 3 clinical trial  Denali  is ongoing  with results currently expected in 2025. This is beyond the estimated cash runway (May 2024)  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. Two new Phase 3b clinical trials evaluating the dual mechanism of action (NO and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and the potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are planned to start in H1 2023. These new clinical trials will evaluate (i) the effect of NCX 470 on Episcleral Venous Pressure (EVP) and outflow through the trabecular meshwork and (ii) ocular perfusion via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) angiography on retinal vessels. Together  these trials are designed to validate NCX 470’s dual mechanism of action in humans and potentially demonstrate some of the beneficial effects on the retina that have been observed in nonclinical models. The Company is actively looking for commercial partners in the U.S. and Japan  to maximize the potential future value of NCX 470. In the Chinese market  NCX 470 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics  who are also jointly and equally funding the Denali clinical trial.NCX 1728 is an NO-donating phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor under evaluation for development in certain retinal conditions. It is currently in nonclinical development. Progression in the nonclinical evaluation of NCX 1728 has established it as a potential candidate for indications in the area of retinal conditions  and therefore the Company will not conduct further evaluation of NCX 1728 for the lowering of IOP.NCX 4251 is a novel  patented  ophthalmic suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals  in development for dry eye disease. NCX 4251 has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial  Mississippi  in blepharitis (announced September 23  2021)  which did not meet the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Post hoc results  announced November 30  2021  showed a statistically and clinically significant reduction in dry eye disease symptoms versus placebo in patients who scored more highly for a key sign of dry eye disease (fluorescein staining) and following a subsequent meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  the future development of NCX 4251 is focused on dry eye disease. No development activities are currently ongoing outside China pending the Company entering into a partnership for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 in the U.S. Nicox is seeking a partner for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 outside of the Chinese market where it is exclusively licensed to Ocumension.VYZULTA® (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution)  0.024%  indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  is exclusively licensed worldwide to Bausch + Lomb  a leading global eye health company. VYZULTA is commercialized in multiple countries including the U.S.  with other approvals and launches ongoing.ZERVIATE® (cetirizine ophthalmic solution)  0.24%  indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  has been exclusively licensed in the U.S. to Eyevance Pharmaceuticals and is commercialized there since March 2020. ZERVIATE has also been exclusively licensed to Ocumension for development and commercialization in the Chinese and the majority of the South East Asian markets. An additional Phase 3 clinical trial has been completed in China and a New Drug Application is in preparation. ZERVIATE is also the subject of exclusive licensing agreements with Samil Pharmaceutical in South Korea and Vietnam  with ITROM Pharmaceutical Group in the Gulf Arab States and with Laboratorios Grin in Mexico.The clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are expected to be fully financed with the proceeds of this equity financing. Results from the Denali trial for NCX 470 are currently expected in 2025  outside of the estimated cash runway  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. The planned costs of nonclinical activities associated with NCX 1728 are not significant. The costs of development and potential commercialization of Nicox’s product candidate and products NCX 4251  VYZULTA® and ZERVIATE® are  or would be  the responsibility of Nicox’s partners. The net book value of NCX 4251 was decreased to zero (reduction of €15.1 million in 2021 and €11.0 million in H1 2022) in the U.S. due to the additional costs and timings associated with the change in indication  and the subsequent decision to out-license the product. The net book value of ZERVIATE (€26.0 million) corresponds mainly to the value of the asset allocated to the Chinese territory where rights are granted to Ocumension. This follows an impairment (€12.7 million) to the value in the U.S. taking into consideration changes in the U.S. market for topical anti-allergics.Principal terms of the equity financingThe share capital increase without preferential rights  by issuance of 6 849 316 new ordinary shareswith attached warrants to acquire 6 849 316 additional new ordinary shares (the warrants  and together with the new shares  the units) was reserved for subscription by (i) one or more French or foreign companies or mutual funds investing in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (une ou plusieurs sociétés ou fonds gestionnaires d’épargne collective de droit français ou de droit étranger investissant dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique)  (ii) natural persons who regularly invest in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (des personnes physiques investissant à titre habituel dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique) or (iii) one or more credit institutions or any authorized investment services provider undertaking to acquire them for resale to the persons mentioned in (i) and (ii) above (un ou plusieurs établissements de crédit ou tout prestataire de services d’investissement habilité s’engageant à les acquérir pour les revendre aux personnes visées au (i) et (ii) ci-dessus)  pursuant to the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of Nicox dated July 28  2022. There is only one investor participating in this financing.The Board of Directors set the issue price of the units at €1.46 (€1 nominal value and €0.46 issue premium) and the exercise price of the warrants at €1.70 on November 21  2022. In accordance with the methods for determination of the subscription price set in the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of July 28  2022  the issue price shows (i) a discount of 14.54% compared to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price  i.e. €1.7084 and (ii) a discount of 52.6% compared to this average including the theoretical value of a warrant (i.e. €0.65  the theoretical value of the warrant having been obtained using the method Black Scholes and assuming volatility of 40%). The subscription price of each share resulting from the exercise of the warrants will be €1.70  which shows a discount of 0.49% to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price. Following the completion of the capital increase  the new shares will represent 15.8% of the Company’s issued share capital before the capital increase and 13.7% after the capital increase. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.If at any time whilst the warrants from this private placement are outstanding  the Company undergoes a merger by acquisition (fusion par absorption)  merger (fusion par création d’une nouvelle société)  division (scission)  or a change of control within the meaning assigned in article L.233-3 I of the French commercial code (Code de commerce)  and where the consideration for such transaction is securities at a per share value below the exercise price of the warrants  the warrant holder shall have the option to request the Company to repurchase the warrants and pay an amount determined on the basis of a Black Scholes formula. The warrant holder may only request such payment after closing of the transaction concerned. The assumptions to be used in the Black Scholes calculation  including a minimum level of volatility  have been set out in the warrant agreement  and are not the same as those for the valuation of the warrants as set out in the paragraph above. Based on the assumptions included in the warrant agreement  and todays interest rates  together with other market assumptions  if the Company was to be acquired today in a stock transaction  at a price of €1.69  and the warrant holder requested to the Company that they wished to receive the payment  the payment would be €7.2 million. This amount would be less if the price of the transaction was lower  it will decrease over time and is also subject to changes in the other assumptions used in the Black Scholes calculation. This amount would be paid after any amount due to Kreos Capital  should they decide to ask for repayment of the debt held by the company as a result of the transaction. In the case of transfer of the warrants to another warrant holder  the right to the option to request the repurchase of the warrants does not transfer to the new holder.If the warrants associated with this private placement were exercised in their entirety  the total gross proceeds would be approximately €11.6 million.The impact of this share capital increase  and of the warrants  should they be exercised  on (i) the stake held in the Company’s share capital by a shareholder holding 1%  and (ii) the share of equity (on a consolidated and per-share basis) as on September 30  2022  in each case calculated on a non-diluted and fully-diluted basis  i.e. taking into account the issuance of a maximum of 10 927 648 new shares upon (x) exercise of all outstanding previously issued warrants and stock options  and (y) the definitive acquisition of all free shares outstanding and (z) the conversion into shares of the Kreos convertible bonds is as follows:SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST (%) SHARE OF EQUITY PER SHARE BASIS (IN €) Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis * Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis*Before issue of new shares 1% of the share capital 0.80% 1.398 1.704 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares 0.86% 0.71% 1.386 1.660 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares and 6 849 316 shares resulting from warrants resulting from the exercise of all the warrants (according to the exercise parity of 1 warrants giving the right to subscribe to 1 share of the Company) 0.76% 0.64% 1.424 1.664* The calculations are based on the assumption that 6 622 848 warrants and 3 278 450 stock options will be exercised and that 1 026 350 free shares granted will be vested and that all Kreos convertible bonds will be converted into 900 000 shares.Directors and Executive Committee members of Nicox  including the Chief Executive Officer  have agreed to certain customary lock-up arrangements with the Placement Agents (as defined below) on the shares they hold in Nicox for a 90-day period from the settlement date (subject to certain customary exemptions).The Company has agreed to customary arrangements not to issue new shares or instruments giving rights to shares for a 90-day period from the settlement date  and has also agreed not to undertake any equity issue which involves a variable rate transaction for a 180-day period from the settlement date (in both cases subject to certain customary exceptions).Use of proceedsThe proceeds of the private placement will be exclusively allocated to the development of NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of warrants granted in the context of this financing are not taken into account in this analysis. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the private placement  by order of priority  (i) to complete the final activities in the Mont Blanc trial on NCX 470 (approximately 34%)  (ii) continue to progress the Denali trial on NCX 470 (approximately 49%)  (iii) finance stability studies on the finished product and manufacture a validation batch of the active ingredient to generate information for the preparation of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. FDA (approximately 15%) and (iv) to complete clinical trials aiming to demonstrate the dual mechanism of action and the potential beneficial effects of NCX 470 on the retina (2%). It is estimated that the cash available  before the proceeds of the private placement  is sufficient to cover the fixed costs of the Company for two years. Therefore  the proceeds of the private placement will not be used to cover these costs. The proceeds from the issue  together with the extension of the interest-only period of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the liquidity horizon until mid-May 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of the warrants (which are not in the control of the Company)  if any  are not taken into account in this analysis.Proceeds from this financing are not intended to be used to repay  in whole or in part  neither capital or interest  the debt from Kreos nor the loan agreement guaranteed by the French State  which are financed by the revenues generated by the license contracts.The potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants  if any  would extend the cash runway up to the last quarter of 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. As an indication  the estimate of the net proceeds from the issue of the new shares is approximately €8.9 million. In the event that all of the warrants are exercised  the proceeds from the issuance of shares resulting from the warrants are estimated at approximately €11.6 million  or a maximum total net income of €20.5 million.The potential proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued in the context of a prior financing in December 2021  estimated at approximately €16.3 million  could extend the cash runway beyond 2024 and allow the completion of the Denali trial and finance the submission of an NDA for NCX 470 with the FDA.Listing of new sharesAn application will be made for the admission to listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.The Company will submit to the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) for approval a listing prospectus (the ""Listing Prospectus"")  composed of (i) the “Document d’Enregistrement Universel  rapport financier annuel et rapport de gestion 2021” filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on April 29  2022 under number D.22-0392  and its first amendment filed on May 19  2022 under the number D. 22-0392-A01  available on Nicox SA’s website (www.nicox.com) (""Universal Registration Document"") with (ii) its second amendment and (iii) a Note d’Opération in connection with the admission to trading and listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris and which will include a summary of the Prospectus.Risks factors that are likely to have a material effect on Nicox’s business are presented in the 3rd chapter of the Universal Registration Document 2021  as may be amended or supplemented from time to time.H.C.

13581,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invibes-advertising-announces-ambitious-sustainability-164600306.html,Invibes Advertising announces ambitious sustainability targets,Press release Invibes Advertising announces ambitious sustainability targets London  22 November 2022 – Invibes Advertising  an advanced technology company...,Press releaseInvibes Advertising announces ambitioussustainability targetsLondon  22 November 2022 – Invibes Advertising  an advanced technology company specialising in digital advertising  publishes the results of an assessment of its energy performance and announces a set of ambitious sustainability targets for the coming years.In order to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the advertising sector  Invibes Advertising has launched an internal programme to assess and improve its energy performance  notably the impact of its digital ad campaigns.Invibes Advertising’s virtuous energy mixThe most significant part of the Group’s energy consumption is related to its outsourced servers. They are housed by two main service providers that represent 99% of its servers’ average load. One of them is operating on 100% green electricity and the other one on 78% renewable energy.In addition  Invibes Advertising runs some of its applications using carbon neutral cloud services.Impact of Invibes Advertising’s campaignsThe Company made an assessmenti of the average carbon footprint of its advertising campaigns in September 2022:The first step was to calculate the carbon footprint of Invibes Advertising’s technology platform for each ad impression  using the energy consumption of the Company’s servers  the type of energy used by the service providers housing those servers  and the number of ad impressions they powered in September 2022.The second step was to estimate the carbon footprint of an ad impression on the end-user side  based on the number of ad impressions for each type of device used to view our ads in September 2022  statistical data about energy consumption of devices used  as well as information about the carbon footprint of electricity in the country where end-users are located.Finally  we estimated the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the network between our servers and the end-user  based on data about the energy intensity of the internet in kWh/GB  as well as the carbon footprint of electricity in the countries where end-users are viewing our ads.Story continuesThis overall calculation resulted in an average energy consumption of 0.22kWh per 1 000 ad impressions in September 2022  corresponding to an average of 26.1 grams CO2 emissions per 1 000 ad impressions. In comparison  an average Display campaign has been estimated to emit 15% more CO2 (30 grams CO2 per 1 000 ad impressionsii).To a large extent  the lower carbon footprint of Invibes’ campaigns results from the fully integrated nature of its technology platform that allows for efficient processes  as well as the low carbon footprint of the Company’s servers. In addition  Invibes Advertising’s smart targeting allows its campaigns to achieve great effectiveness with an optimised number of impressions  thus further minimising their carbon impact.Benefits of technological independenceInvibes Advertising’s proprietary technology platform has been designed with process optimisation in mind  improving technical performance  reducing associated costs  and bringing benefits in terms of energy efficiency.As it has full control over its technology platform  Invibes Advertising is able to constantly evolve and improve. A large part of the Company’s R&D effort aims to achieve higher efficiency to ensure scalability  which also has advantages in terms of energy consumption.Invibes Advertising’s ambitious sustainability targetsIn line with its core value of always innovating in all aspects of its activity  Invibes Advertising has launched several initiatives to lower the carbon footprint of its campaigns:Actions to reduce the carbon footprint of processes directly within Invibes’ control  by decreasing the platform’s energy consumption and prioritising green sources of electricity.Actions to reduce its campaigns’ energy consumption outside Invibes’ realm  at the network and end-user level  bearing in mind that the carbon footprint of the electricity used there is not within the Company’s control.The Company has defined a series of goals it aims to achieve:Half-yearly tracking and publication of the carbon footprint of Invibes ’ ad campaigns .99 % green energy for outsourced serv ers by the end of 2023 .10% annual reduction of the energy consumption associated with Invibes’ ad campaigns for the next 3 years.This will allow Invibes Advertising to deliver Excellence to its clients in the ever more important aspect of reducing their advertising activities’ carbon impact.About Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising is an international technology company specializing in digital advertising innovation.

Idiopathic rhinitis features an overexpression of TRPV1 in the nasal mucosa giving rise to nasal obstruction  rhinorrhoea (colloquially: a runny nose)  and/or sneezing.Hyloris’ treatment approach is to activate and depolarize TRPV1 receptors leading to restoration of a normal function of the nasal mucosa. Current treatment options for idiopathic rhinitis are not consistently successful. This leads to unnecessary and often ineffective surgery for severe cases  such as nasal septal corrections and/or inferior turbinate reductions.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “We are pleased to announce another value-added product candidate to add to our portfolio of programs. This proprietary intranasal product candidate with a well-known mechanism of action should solve a large unmet medical need and offer patients rapid and sustainable relief.”Story continues“Our focused strategy to acquire new value-added product candidates has brought us closer to our goal of reaching 30 assets in our portfolio before 2025. This has solidified our positioning to be a market leader in the development of value-added product candidates utilizing the expedited and cost-effective 505(b)2 regulatory strategy in the U.S. We aim to develop a low-dose application that can be administered locally via a nasal spray first in Europe before pursing global roll-out.”Peter Hellings  Full Professor at the University of Leuven  Belgium  and Chair of EUFOREA (European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airways diseases)  commented: ”Idiopathic rhinitis is a burdensome condition of the nasal mucosa with no satisfactory medical or surgical treatment  where attempted symptom management fails in nearly all cases. It is a chronic condition associated with interrupted sleep  irritability and poor concentration. Hence  it can be a severe detriment to quality of life and capacity to work.”“Current treatment tries to combine an antihistamine and an intranasal corticosteroid used in other rhinitis types which has yielded only poor results. For severe cases  patients often turn to surgery which is not a cure either. Our strategy is to defunctionalize the overactivated sensory nerve fibres by a targeted  local acting medicinal product and present clinical evidence of efficacy and safety.”CONFERENCE CALLHyloris will host a conference call on Wednesday November 23rd at 4PM CET/10AM EST  in attendance of Prof. Dr. Peter Hellings.

For allergic and /infectious rhinitis  current medicinal products are available such as decongestant spray/tablets  antihistamines or corticosteroids.Idiopathic rhinitis is the largest group within the non-allergic/non-infectious rhinitis group. It occurs in around 7% of the total population  representing an estimated 19 million people in the US alone. 13% of them have moderate to severe idiopathic rhinitis  leading them to actively seek specialist treatment and  who can not provide consistent treatment with the currently available therapy options.These patients typically live through several years of failed treatment options  adding frustration and wasted expenses to the medical symptoms impacting their quality of life. Rapid relief through a nasal spray should reduce overall treatment costs  improve quality of life and make potentially unsuccessful surgical procedures redundant.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

Bringing together experience in running multi-site clinical trials from the Clinical Trial Units (CTU) and expertise in heart diseases  the team will see whether glenzocimab will reduce the amount of dead heart tissue in patients following an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  the most serious type of heart attack.Professor Jon Townend  Consultant Cardiologist at University Hospitals Birmingham  Honorary Professor of Cardiology in the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences at the University of Birmingham  and Chief Investigator of the trial said: “We look forward to starting this exciting trial of a new drug for heart attacks which are still only too common. Although immediate opening of the blocked coronary artery by angioplasty in cases of heart attack is now routine  significant heart damage still occurs. Glenzocimab reduces clot formation and laboratory findings have been impressive. There are strong reasons to believe that this new drug may improve outcomes and this randomized blinded trial is the right way to test this theory.”Dr Mark Thomas  Associate Professor of Cardiology at the University of Birmingham and Honorary Consultant Cardiologist  who designed the trial and led its development  said: “This trial will help us establish whether glenzocimab is a safe and effective drug for preventing the kind of clotting that can lead to serious damage to the heart following a heart attack. We’re delighted to work with Acticor to see whether this new class of drug has the potential to improve the outcomes of our patients with heart attacks. While the immediate care provided for a heart attack is effective for improving patient survival  there is more we can do to prevent long-term damage to the heart.”Glenzocimab  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against the platelet Glycoprotein VI (GPVI)  was developed by Acticor Biotech for the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies  including stroke. This new drug  currently being trialled for strokes  stops the functioning of platelets that cause abnormal clotting of blood. While platelet function is normally important to stop bleeding  this drug specifically targets only dangerous clotting inside damaged blood vessels called thrombosis that can cause strokes and heart attacks.Gilles Avenard  Chief Executive Officer  and founder of Acticor Biotech said: “Glenzocimab has already delivered very promising results in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and we hope to confirm its therapeutics potential in another severe indication. We are proud of this Phase 2b study launch  which allows glenzocimab development programme extension to myocardial infarction. We would like to congratulate all the teams involved  the University of Birmingham particularly  sponsor of this study.”ENDSNotes to editor:The University of Birmingham is ranked amongst the world’s top 100 institutions. Its work brings people from across the world to Birmingham  including researchers  teachers and more than 6 500 international students from over 150 countries.The University of Birmingham is a member of Birmingham Health Partners (BHP)  a strategic alliance which transcends organisational boundaries to rapidly translate healthcare research findings into new diagnostics  drugs and devices for patients. Birmingham Health Partners is a strategic alliance between five organisations who collaborate to bring healthcare innovations through to clinical application: University of Birmingham University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust West Midlands Academic Health Science NetworkAbout ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients. In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

The application has been granted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of March 20  2023.SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology. ENHANZE facilitates the SC injection delivery of biologics that are typically administered via IV infusion.“The FDA’s acceptance of our BLA is an exciting step toward fulfilling our vision of delivering the broadest gMG treatment offering that reflects the unique disease experience for each patient as they navigate life with this debilitating disease. We’re excited about the potential of SC efgartigimod to offer patients multiple ways to receive treatment through various administrations and an individualized dosing schedule ” said Keith Woods  Chief Operating Officer of argenx. “With an established PDUFA date  we are preparing for our second commercial product launch and look forward to potentially bringing forth another first-in-class option for gMG patients.”The BLA submission is supported by data from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod as compared with IV administered VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The majority of enrolled patients were positive for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies  but the trial also included patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Story continuesADAPT-SC met its primary endpoint (p< 0.0001) of total IgG reduction from baseline at day 29 demonstrating noninferiority of SC efgartigimod to VYVGART. Patients treated with SC efgartigimod achieved mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% reduction with VYVGART. Results were consistent across the overall population  including those with AChR antibodies and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected. Further  69.1% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Responders are defined as having at least a two-point improvement on the MG-ADL score for at least four consecutive weeks. 65.5% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score. Responders are defined as having at least a three-point improvement on the QMG score for at least four consecutive weeks. Minimal symptom expression (MSE)  a measure of symptom-free status  was achieved in 37% of SC efgartigimod-treated patients after one treatment cycle. Onset of effect was also consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT study.The safety profile for SC efgartigimod was consistent with the ADAPT study. It was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time. After completing ADAPT-SC  95% of participants entered ADAPT-SC+  a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of SC efgartigimod.Phase 3 ADAPT-SC Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) as compared with VYVGART (10mg/kg) in patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect as measured by percent change from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29  one week after the last dose of IV or SC efgartigimod  served as the primary endpoint in the ADAPT-SC trial. The correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG was demonstrated in a Phase 2 trial and the Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which served as the basis for approval of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and Europe. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed.A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial and were treated. Inclusion criteria of the trial were the same as the Phase 3 ADAPT trial of VYVGART; enrolled patients had a confirmed gMG diagnosis and an MG-ADL total score of at least 5 with greater than 50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms  at screening and baseline. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  and were required to remain on that stable dose throughout the primary trial. Patients were eligible to enroll in ADAPT-SC regardless of antibody status  including patients with AChR antibodies (AChR-Ab+) and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod or IV efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO  Globocan data)  the incidence of this cancer was about 202 000 new cases in 2020 in Europe and North America  increasing by 2.5% per year on average. In France  this cancer affected about 15 000 patients in 2020  of which nearly 45% would be at the metastatic stage. Diagnosis is generally made by imaging and biological tests on biopsy.Pancreatic cancer is particularly insidious because it is a ""silent"" disease that causes no symptoms in its early stages. Often diagnosed at a late stage  this cancer has a poor prognosis. Few treatments are available: surgery and/or chemotherapy. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis  chemotherapy remains the only treatment option  whether it is based on gemcitabine or 5-FU  alone or in combination.GemciTest®  an in-vitro diagnostic developed by Acobiom  is a predictive PCR test for response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment. This CE-marked molecular diagnostic identifies patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC  a form of pancreatic cancer) whose transcriptomic profile is not favorable for the prescription of a first-line gemcitabine-based therapy (alone or in combination). This test will thus make it possible to guide patients towards another more suitable or more effective therapy  to avoid unnecessary side effects or toxicities  and thus to risk a ""loss of chance"" for these patients.A new test based on the latest technologiesGemciTest has been developed with Acobiom's technology platform  which combines genomic and transcriptomic techniques (NGS sequencing  real-time PCR) with bioinformatics  biostatistics and artificial intelligence (machine learning) tools and programs for data processing and analysis.Developed and validated using real-world data and samples  this molecular diagnostics is based on a proprietary combination of RNA markers present in blood. The test was evaluated in a confirmatory study to measure its sensitivity in predicting the response of PDAC patients to a gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment.This confirmatory study demonstrated the value of using GemciTest® in clinics and also reveals the potential of RNA marker combinations in blood in the development of precision medicine and personalized therapy for patients with pancreatic cancer.“The signature of this commercial agreement with Eurobio Scientific is the recognition of the quality of the developments made by the Acobiom team by a key-player of the in-vitro diagnostic industry in France""  says Didier Ritter  President of Acobiom. ""It is also a first step for our company  as other predictive diagnostics in precision medicine are currently in development  notably to predict the response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of pancreatic cancer.”Jean-Michel Carle  CEO of Eurobio Scientific  added: ""The importance of a predictive response test for a disease as difficult as pancreatic cancer will be a major asset for physicians by allowing their patients to avoid losing chances due to inappropriate treatments. The strength of the new technologies used and the quality of the work done by Acobiom  as demonstrated by the results of their real-world clinical tests  have convinced us of the immediate relevance of this new test"".About GemciTest®GemciTest® is a predictive molecular diagnostic for response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment. This CE-marked PCR test is intended for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This in-vitro diagnostic has been developed from Acobiom's technology platform  which combines genomic and transcriptomic techniques (NGS sequencing  real-time PCR) on the one hand  and bioinformatics  biostatistics and machine learning tools and programs for data processing and analysis on the other.Developed and validated using real world data and samples  GemciTest® is based on a patented combination of RNA markers present in blood and has been evaluated in a confirmatory study. The clinical validation of this PCR test was performed on 336 patients (mean age 68.7; 37-88). Patients with a clinical benefit (OS > 8.7 months; PFS ≥3.5 months) identified by GemciTest® (29.7%) had significantly a longer PFS (5.3 vs. 2.8 months) and a longer OS (10.4 vs. 4.8 months). GemciTest® -positive patients had significantly longer PFS (HR=0.53 (95% CI: 0.31-0.92); p=0.023) and OS (HR=0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.85); p=0.0091).About Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a major player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

Capital repayments will therefore recommence from February 1  2024. This extension was conditional upon NCX 470 meeting the primary objective of non-inferiority to latanoprost in the recently reported Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial.The Company was previously financed to mid-November 2023. Proceeds from this equity financing  together with the extension of the period of interest-only payment of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the cash runway to mid-May 2024. This cash runway is based exclusively on the development of NCX 470. The calculation does not include any potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants included in the private placement (the exercise of which are not under the Company’s control)  which could provide an additional €11.6 million in proceeds if they were to be fully exercised.Cash PositionThe Nicox Group had cash and cash equivalents of €25.6 million (excluding the proceeds of this financing) as of September 30  2022 and outstanding debt of €21.4 million (including €18.6 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos signed in January 2019  a €2.0 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in August 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  and financial lease agreements for €0.8 million). The Nicox Group's cash position after this private placement would amount to approximately €31 million.All of the figures related to the cash and debt position of the Nicox Group as of September 30  2022 are unaudited.Nicox has carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that the Company has sufficient net working capital to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and is financed until mid-May 2024  based exclusively on the development of NCX 470.Upcoming milestones on key development programsDenali Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: Topline results currently expected in 2025Topline results currently expected in 2025 Initiation of two new Phase 3b clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action (nitric oxide and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470: planned in H1 2023Portfolio and PipelineThe pipeline of product candidates and products is available on the Company’s website.NCX 470 is a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The first Phase 3 clinical trial  Mont Blanc  has been completed and results were announced on October 31  2022. A second Phase 3 clinical trial  Denali  is ongoing  with results currently expected in 2025. This is beyond the estimated cash runway (May 2024)  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. Two new Phase 3b clinical trials evaluating the dual mechanism of action (NO and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and the potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are planned to start in H1 2023. These new clinical trials will evaluate (i) the effect of NCX 470 on Episcleral Venous Pressure (EVP) and outflow through the trabecular meshwork and (ii) ocular perfusion via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) angiography on retinal vessels. Together  these trials are designed to validate NCX 470’s dual mechanism of action in humans and potentially demonstrate some of the beneficial effects on the retina that have been observed in nonclinical models. The Company is actively looking for commercial partners in the U.S. and Japan  to maximize the potential future value of NCX 470. In the Chinese market  NCX 470 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics  who are also jointly and equally funding the Denali clinical trial.NCX 1728 is an NO-donating phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor under evaluation for development in certain retinal conditions. It is currently in nonclinical development. Progression in the nonclinical evaluation of NCX 1728 has established it as a potential candidate for indications in the area of retinal conditions  and therefore the Company will not conduct further evaluation of NCX 1728 for the lowering of IOP.NCX 4251 is a novel  patented  ophthalmic suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals  in development for dry eye disease. NCX 4251 has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial  Mississippi  in blepharitis (announced September 23  2021)  which did not meet the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Post hoc results  announced November 30  2021  showed a statistically and clinically significant reduction in dry eye disease symptoms versus placebo in patients who scored more highly for a key sign of dry eye disease (fluorescein staining) and following a subsequent meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  the future development of NCX 4251 is focused on dry eye disease. No development activities are currently ongoing outside China pending the Company entering into a partnership for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 in the U.S. Nicox is seeking a partner for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 outside of the Chinese market where it is exclusively licensed to Ocumension.VYZULTA® (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution)  0.024%  indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  is exclusively licensed worldwide to Bausch + Lomb  a leading global eye health company. VYZULTA is commercialized in multiple countries including the U.S.  with other approvals and launches ongoing.ZERVIATE® (cetirizine ophthalmic solution)  0.24%  indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  has been exclusively licensed in the U.S. to Eyevance Pharmaceuticals and is commercialized there since March 2020. ZERVIATE has also been exclusively licensed to Ocumension for development and commercialization in the Chinese and the majority of the South East Asian markets. An additional Phase 3 clinical trial has been completed in China and a New Drug Application is in preparation. ZERVIATE is also the subject of exclusive licensing agreements with Samil Pharmaceutical in South Korea and Vietnam  with ITROM Pharmaceutical Group in the Gulf Arab States and with Laboratorios Grin in Mexico.The clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are expected to be fully financed with the proceeds of this equity financing. Results from the Denali trial for NCX 470 are currently expected in 2025  outside of the estimated cash runway  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. The planned costs of nonclinical activities associated with NCX 1728 are not significant. The costs of development and potential commercialization of Nicox’s product candidate and products NCX 4251  VYZULTA® and ZERVIATE® are  or would be  the responsibility of Nicox’s partners. The net book value of NCX 4251 was decreased to zero (reduction of €15.1 million in 2021 and €11.0 million in H1 2022) in the U.S. due to the additional costs and timings associated with the change in indication  and the subsequent decision to out-license the product. The net book value of ZERVIATE (€26.0 million) corresponds mainly to the value of the asset allocated to the Chinese territory where rights are granted to Ocumension. This follows an impairment (€12.7 million) to the value in the U.S. taking into consideration changes in the U.S. market for topical anti-allergics.Principal terms of the equity financingThe share capital increase without preferential rights  by issuance of 6 849 316 new ordinary shareswith attached warrants to acquire 6 849 316 additional new ordinary shares (the warrants  and together with the new shares  the units) was reserved for subscription by (i) one or more French or foreign companies or mutual funds investing in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (une ou plusieurs sociétés ou fonds gestionnaires d’épargne collective de droit français ou de droit étranger investissant dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique)  (ii) natural persons who regularly invest in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (des personnes physiques investissant à titre habituel dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique) or (iii) one or more credit institutions or any authorized investment services provider undertaking to acquire them for resale to the persons mentioned in (i) and (ii) above (un ou plusieurs établissements de crédit ou tout prestataire de services d’investissement habilité s’engageant à les acquérir pour les revendre aux personnes visées au (i) et (ii) ci-dessus)  pursuant to the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of Nicox dated July 28  2022. There is only one investor participating in this financing.The Board of Directors set the issue price of the units at €1.46 (€1 nominal value and €0.46 issue premium) and the exercise price of the warrants at €1.70 on November 21  2022. In accordance with the methods for determination of the subscription price set in the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of July 28  2022  the issue price shows (i) a discount of 14.54% compared to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price  i.e. €1.7084 and (ii) a discount of 52.6% compared to this average including the theoretical value of a warrant (i.e. €0.65  the theoretical value of the warrant having been obtained using the method Black Scholes and assuming volatility of 40%). The subscription price of each share resulting from the exercise of the warrants will be €1.70  which shows a discount of 0.49% to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price. Following the completion of the capital increase  the new shares will represent 15.8% of the Company’s issued share capital before the capital increase and 13.7% after the capital increase. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.If at any time whilst the warrants from this private placement are outstanding  the Company undergoes a merger by acquisition (fusion par absorption)  merger (fusion par création d’une nouvelle société)  division (scission)  or a change of control within the meaning assigned in article L.233-3 I of the French commercial code (Code de commerce)  and where the consideration for such transaction is securities at a per share value below the exercise price of the warrants  the warrant holder shall have the option to request the Company to repurchase the warrants and pay an amount determined on the basis of a Black Scholes formula. The warrant holder may only request such payment after closing of the transaction concerned. The assumptions to be used in the Black Scholes calculation  including a minimum level of volatility  have been set out in the warrant agreement  and are not the same as those for the valuation of the warrants as set out in the paragraph above. Based on the assumptions included in the warrant agreement  and todays interest rates  together with other market assumptions  if the Company was to be acquired today in a stock transaction  at a price of €1.69  and the warrant holder requested to the Company that they wished to receive the payment  the payment would be €7.2 million. This amount would be less if the price of the transaction was lower  it will decrease over time and is also subject to changes in the other assumptions used in the Black Scholes calculation. This amount would be paid after any amount due to Kreos Capital  should they decide to ask for repayment of the debt held by the company as a result of the transaction. In the case of transfer of the warrants to another warrant holder  the right to the option to request the repurchase of the warrants does not transfer to the new holder.If the warrants associated with this private placement were exercised in their entirety  the total gross proceeds would be approximately €11.6 million.The impact of this share capital increase  and of the warrants  should they be exercised  on (i) the stake held in the Company’s share capital by a shareholder holding 1%  and (ii) the share of equity (on a consolidated and per-share basis) as on September 30  2022  in each case calculated on a non-diluted and fully-diluted basis  i.e. taking into account the issuance of a maximum of 10 927 648 new shares upon (x) exercise of all outstanding previously issued warrants and stock options  and (y) the definitive acquisition of all free shares outstanding and (z) the conversion into shares of the Kreos convertible bonds is as follows:SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST (%) SHARE OF EQUITY PER SHARE BASIS (IN €) Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis * Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis*Before issue of new shares 1% of the share capital 0.80% 1.398 1.704 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares 0.86% 0.71% 1.386 1.660 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares and 6 849 316 shares resulting from warrants resulting from the exercise of all the warrants (according to the exercise parity of 1 warrants giving the right to subscribe to 1 share of the Company) 0.76% 0.64% 1.424 1.664* The calculations are based on the assumption that 6 622 848 warrants and 3 278 450 stock options will be exercised and that 1 026 350 free shares granted will be vested and that all Kreos convertible bonds will be converted into 900 000 shares.Directors and Executive Committee members of Nicox  including the Chief Executive Officer  have agreed to certain customary lock-up arrangements with the Placement Agents (as defined below) on the shares they hold in Nicox for a 90-day period from the settlement date (subject to certain customary exemptions).The Company has agreed to customary arrangements not to issue new shares or instruments giving rights to shares for a 90-day period from the settlement date  and has also agreed not to undertake any equity issue which involves a variable rate transaction for a 180-day period from the settlement date (in both cases subject to certain customary exceptions).Use of proceedsThe proceeds of the private placement will be exclusively allocated to the development of NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of warrants granted in the context of this financing are not taken into account in this analysis. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the private placement  by order of priority  (i) to complete the final activities in the Mont Blanc trial on NCX 470 (approximately 34%)  (ii) continue to progress the Denali trial on NCX 470 (approximately 49%)  (iii) finance stability studies on the finished product and manufacture a validation batch of the active ingredient to generate information for the preparation of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. FDA (approximately 15%) and (iv) to complete clinical trials aiming to demonstrate the dual mechanism of action and the potential beneficial effects of NCX 470 on the retina (2%). It is estimated that the cash available  before the proceeds of the private placement  is sufficient to cover the fixed costs of the Company for two years. Therefore  the proceeds of the private placement will not be used to cover these costs. The proceeds from the issue  together with the extension of the interest-only period of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the liquidity horizon until mid-May 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of the warrants (which are not in the control of the Company)  if any  are not taken into account in this analysis.Proceeds from this financing are not intended to be used to repay  in whole or in part  neither capital or interest  the debt from Kreos nor the loan agreement guaranteed by the French State  which are financed by the revenues generated by the license contracts.The potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants  if any  would extend the cash runway up to the last quarter of 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. As an indication  the estimate of the net proceeds from the issue of the new shares is approximately €8.9 million. In the event that all of the warrants are exercised  the proceeds from the issuance of shares resulting from the warrants are estimated at approximately €11.6 million  or a maximum total net income of €20.5 million.The potential proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued in the context of a prior financing in December 2021  estimated at approximately €16.3 million  could extend the cash runway beyond 2024 and allow the completion of the Denali trial and finance the submission of an NDA for NCX 470 with the FDA.Listing of new sharesAn application will be made for the admission to listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.The Company will submit to the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) for approval a listing prospectus (the ""Listing Prospectus"")  composed of (i) the “Document d’Enregistrement Universel  rapport financier annuel et rapport de gestion 2021” filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on April 29  2022 under number D.22-0392  and its first amendment filed on May 19  2022 under the number D. 22-0392-A01  available on Nicox SA’s website (www.nicox.com) (""Universal Registration Document"") with (ii) its second amendment and (iii) a Note d’Opération in connection with the admission to trading and listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris and which will include a summary of the Prospectus.Risks factors that are likely to have a material effect on Nicox’s business are presented in the 3rd chapter of the Universal Registration Document 2021  as may be amended or supplemented from time to time.H.C.

Capital repayments will therefore recommence from February 1  2024. This extension was conditional upon NCX 470 meeting the primary objective of non-inferiority to latanoprost in the recently reported Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial.The Company was previously financed to mid-November 2023. Proceeds from this equity financing  together with the extension of the period of interest-only payment of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the cash runway to mid-May 2024. This cash runway is based exclusively on the development of NCX 470. The calculation does not include any potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants included in the private placement (the exercise of which are not under the Company’s control)  which could provide an additional €11.6 million in proceeds if they were to be fully exercised.Cash PositionThe Nicox Group had cash and cash equivalents of €25.6 million (excluding the proceeds of this financing) as of September 30  2022 and outstanding debt of €21.4 million (including €18.6 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos signed in January 2019  a €2.0 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in August 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  and financial lease agreements for €0.8 million). The Nicox Group's cash position after this private placement would amount to approximately €31 million.All of the figures related to the cash and debt position of the Nicox Group as of September 30  2022 are unaudited.Nicox has carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that the Company has sufficient net working capital to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months and is financed until mid-May 2024  based exclusively on the development of NCX 470.Upcoming milestones on key development programsDenali Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: Topline results currently expected in 2025Topline results currently expected in 2025 Initiation of two new Phase 3b clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action (nitric oxide and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470: planned in H1 2023Portfolio and PipelineThe pipeline of product candidates and products is available on the Company’s website.NCX 470 is a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop  currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The first Phase 3 clinical trial  Mont Blanc  has been completed and results were announced on October 31  2022. A second Phase 3 clinical trial  Denali  is ongoing  with results currently expected in 2025. This is beyond the estimated cash runway (May 2024)  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. Two new Phase 3b clinical trials evaluating the dual mechanism of action (NO and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and the potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are planned to start in H1 2023. These new clinical trials will evaluate (i) the effect of NCX 470 on Episcleral Venous Pressure (EVP) and outflow through the trabecular meshwork and (ii) ocular perfusion via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) angiography on retinal vessels. Together  these trials are designed to validate NCX 470’s dual mechanism of action in humans and potentially demonstrate some of the beneficial effects on the retina that have been observed in nonclinical models. The Company is actively looking for commercial partners in the U.S. and Japan  to maximize the potential future value of NCX 470. In the Chinese market  NCX 470 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics  who are also jointly and equally funding the Denali clinical trial.NCX 1728 is an NO-donating phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor under evaluation for development in certain retinal conditions. It is currently in nonclinical development. Progression in the nonclinical evaluation of NCX 1728 has established it as a potential candidate for indications in the area of retinal conditions  and therefore the Company will not conduct further evaluation of NCX 1728 for the lowering of IOP.NCX 4251 is a novel  patented  ophthalmic suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals  in development for dry eye disease. NCX 4251 has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial  Mississippi  in blepharitis (announced September 23  2021)  which did not meet the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Post hoc results  announced November 30  2021  showed a statistically and clinically significant reduction in dry eye disease symptoms versus placebo in patients who scored more highly for a key sign of dry eye disease (fluorescein staining) and following a subsequent meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  the future development of NCX 4251 is focused on dry eye disease. No development activities are currently ongoing outside China pending the Company entering into a partnership for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 in the U.S. Nicox is seeking a partner for the development and commercialization of NCX 4251 outside of the Chinese market where it is exclusively licensed to Ocumension.VYZULTA® (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution)  0.024%  indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  is exclusively licensed worldwide to Bausch + Lomb  a leading global eye health company. VYZULTA is commercialized in multiple countries including the U.S.  with other approvals and launches ongoing.ZERVIATE® (cetirizine ophthalmic solution)  0.24%  indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  has been exclusively licensed in the U.S. to Eyevance Pharmaceuticals and is commercialized there since March 2020. ZERVIATE has also been exclusively licensed to Ocumension for development and commercialization in the Chinese and the majority of the South East Asian markets. An additional Phase 3 clinical trial has been completed in China and a New Drug Application is in preparation. ZERVIATE is also the subject of exclusive licensing agreements with Samil Pharmaceutical in South Korea and Vietnam  with ITROM Pharmaceutical Group in the Gulf Arab States and with Laboratorios Grin in Mexico.The clinical trials investigating the dual mechanism of action and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 are expected to be fully financed with the proceeds of this equity financing. Results from the Denali trial for NCX 470 are currently expected in 2025  outside of the estimated cash runway  and therefore additional financing would be required to complete that trial. The planned costs of nonclinical activities associated with NCX 1728 are not significant. The costs of development and potential commercialization of Nicox’s product candidate and products NCX 4251  VYZULTA® and ZERVIATE® are  or would be  the responsibility of Nicox’s partners. The net book value of NCX 4251 was decreased to zero (reduction of €15.1 million in 2021 and €11.0 million in H1 2022) in the U.S. due to the additional costs and timings associated with the change in indication  and the subsequent decision to out-license the product. The net book value of ZERVIATE (€26.0 million) corresponds mainly to the value of the asset allocated to the Chinese territory where rights are granted to Ocumension. This follows an impairment (€12.7 million) to the value in the U.S. taking into consideration changes in the U.S. market for topical anti-allergics.Principal terms of the equity financingThe share capital increase without preferential rights  by issuance of 6 849 316 new ordinary shareswith attached warrants to acquire 6 849 316 additional new ordinary shares (the warrants  and together with the new shares  the units) was reserved for subscription by (i) one or more French or foreign companies or mutual funds investing in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (une ou plusieurs sociétés ou fonds gestionnaires d’épargne collective de droit français ou de droit étranger investissant dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique)  (ii) natural persons who regularly invest in the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector (des personnes physiques investissant à titre habituel dans le secteur pharmaceutique/biotechnologique) or (iii) one or more credit institutions or any authorized investment services provider undertaking to acquire them for resale to the persons mentioned in (i) and (ii) above (un ou plusieurs établissements de crédit ou tout prestataire de services d’investissement habilité s’engageant à les acquérir pour les revendre aux personnes visées au (i) et (ii) ci-dessus)  pursuant to the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of Nicox dated July 28  2022. There is only one investor participating in this financing.The Board of Directors set the issue price of the units at €1.46 (€1 nominal value and €0.46 issue premium) and the exercise price of the warrants at €1.70 on November 21  2022. In accordance with the methods for determination of the subscription price set in the 8th resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of July 28  2022  the issue price shows (i) a discount of 14.54% compared to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price  i.e. €1.7084 and (ii) a discount of 52.6% compared to this average including the theoretical value of a warrant (i.e. €0.65  the theoretical value of the warrant having been obtained using the method Black Scholes and assuming volatility of 40%). The subscription price of each share resulting from the exercise of the warrants will be €1.70  which shows a discount of 0.49% to the Volume Weighted Average Share Price of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris during the last three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price. Following the completion of the capital increase  the new shares will represent 15.8% of the Company’s issued share capital before the capital increase and 13.7% after the capital increase. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.If at any time whilst the warrants from this private placement are outstanding  the Company undergoes a merger by acquisition (fusion par absorption)  merger (fusion par création d’une nouvelle société)  division (scission)  or a change of control within the meaning assigned in article L.233-3 I of the French commercial code (Code de commerce)  and where the consideration for such transaction is securities at a per share value below the exercise price of the warrants  the warrant holder shall have the option to request the Company to repurchase the warrants and pay an amount determined on the basis of a Black Scholes formula. The warrant holder may only request such payment after closing of the transaction concerned. The assumptions to be used in the Black Scholes calculation  including a minimum level of volatility  have been set out in the warrant agreement  and are not the same as those for the valuation of the warrants as set out in the paragraph above. Based on the assumptions included in the warrant agreement  and todays interest rates  together with other market assumptions  if the Company was to be acquired today in a stock transaction  at a price of €1.69  and the warrant holder requested to the Company that they wished to receive the payment  the payment would be €7.2 million. This amount would be less if the price of the transaction was lower  it will decrease over time and is also subject to changes in the other assumptions used in the Black Scholes calculation. This amount would be paid after any amount due to Kreos Capital  should they decide to ask for repayment of the debt held by the company as a result of the transaction. In the case of transfer of the warrants to another warrant holder  the right to the option to request the repurchase of the warrants does not transfer to the new holder.If the warrants associated with this private placement were exercised in their entirety  the total gross proceeds would be approximately €11.6 million.The impact of this share capital increase  and of the warrants  should they be exercised  on (i) the stake held in the Company’s share capital by a shareholder holding 1%  and (ii) the share of equity (on a consolidated and per-share basis) as on September 30  2022  in each case calculated on a non-diluted and fully-diluted basis  i.e. taking into account the issuance of a maximum of 10 927 648 new shares upon (x) exercise of all outstanding previously issued warrants and stock options  and (y) the definitive acquisition of all free shares outstanding and (z) the conversion into shares of the Kreos convertible bonds is as follows:SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST (%) SHARE OF EQUITY PER SHARE BASIS (IN €) Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis * Non-diluted basis Fully-diluted basis*Before issue of new shares 1% of the share capital 0.80% 1.398 1.704 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares 0.86% 0.71% 1.386 1.660 After issue of 6 849 316 new shares and 6 849 316 shares resulting from warrants resulting from the exercise of all the warrants (according to the exercise parity of 1 warrants giving the right to subscribe to 1 share of the Company) 0.76% 0.64% 1.424 1.664* The calculations are based on the assumption that 6 622 848 warrants and 3 278 450 stock options will be exercised and that 1 026 350 free shares granted will be vested and that all Kreos convertible bonds will be converted into 900 000 shares.Directors and Executive Committee members of Nicox  including the Chief Executive Officer  have agreed to certain customary lock-up arrangements with the Placement Agents (as defined below) on the shares they hold in Nicox for a 90-day period from the settlement date (subject to certain customary exemptions).The Company has agreed to customary arrangements not to issue new shares or instruments giving rights to shares for a 90-day period from the settlement date  and has also agreed not to undertake any equity issue which involves a variable rate transaction for a 180-day period from the settlement date (in both cases subject to certain customary exceptions).Use of proceedsThe proceeds of the private placement will be exclusively allocated to the development of NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of warrants granted in the context of this financing are not taken into account in this analysis. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the private placement  by order of priority  (i) to complete the final activities in the Mont Blanc trial on NCX 470 (approximately 34%)  (ii) continue to progress the Denali trial on NCX 470 (approximately 49%)  (iii) finance stability studies on the finished product and manufacture a validation batch of the active ingredient to generate information for the preparation of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. FDA (approximately 15%) and (iv) to complete clinical trials aiming to demonstrate the dual mechanism of action and the potential beneficial effects of NCX 470 on the retina (2%). It is estimated that the cash available  before the proceeds of the private placement  is sufficient to cover the fixed costs of the Company for two years. Therefore  the proceeds of the private placement will not be used to cover these costs. The proceeds from the issue  together with the extension of the interest-only period of the Kreos debt  are expected to extend the liquidity horizon until mid-May 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. The potential gross proceeds related to the exercise of the warrants (which are not in the control of the Company)  if any  are not taken into account in this analysis.Proceeds from this financing are not intended to be used to repay  in whole or in part  neither capital or interest  the debt from Kreos nor the loan agreement guaranteed by the French State  which are financed by the revenues generated by the license contracts.The potential proceeds from the exercise of the warrants  if any  would extend the cash runway up to the last quarter of 2024 on the basis of development activities dedicated exclusively to NCX 470. As an indication  the estimate of the net proceeds from the issue of the new shares is approximately €8.9 million. In the event that all of the warrants are exercised  the proceeds from the issuance of shares resulting from the warrants are estimated at approximately €11.6 million  or a maximum total net income of €20.5 million.The potential proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued in the context of a prior financing in December 2021  estimated at approximately €16.3 million  could extend the cash runway beyond 2024 and allow the completion of the Denali trial and finance the submission of an NDA for NCX 470 with the FDA.Listing of new sharesAn application will be made for the admission to listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris. The settlement of the new shares is expected to occur on or about November 25  2022  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.The Company will submit to the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) for approval a listing prospectus (the ""Listing Prospectus"")  composed of (i) the “Document d’Enregistrement Universel  rapport financier annuel et rapport de gestion 2021” filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on April 29  2022 under number D.22-0392  and its first amendment filed on May 19  2022 under the number D. 22-0392-A01  available on Nicox SA’s website (www.nicox.com) (""Universal Registration Document"") with (ii) its second amendment and (iii) a Note d’Opération in connection with the admission to trading and listing of the new shares on Euronext Paris and which will include a summary of the Prospectus.Risks factors that are likely to have a material effect on Nicox’s business are presented in the 3rd chapter of the Universal Registration Document 2021  as may be amended or supplemented from time to time.H.C.

Now in its fourth year  this initiative was launched in Birmingham (UK) to enable anyone to kick start a technology career in West Midlands  regardless of their previous programming experience. The programme welcomes a wide variety of levels  including total beginners.Interested participants are invited to apply to the programme by Wednesday 14th December. An assessment day will take place in Birmingham on Friday 6th January 2023  and successful applicants will start the four-week course on Monday 16th January 2023  with one in-person day a week and four days remotely.Since its inception  Sidetrade Code Academy has empowered over 50 students to unlock their potential through coding and offered 12 full-time tech skills-based jobs at Sidetrade UK.Emily Lamidieu  co-founder of local community group  Women in Tech Birmingham   said: ""One of the things we notice a lot when working in tech is the lack of diversity. Sidetrade Code Academy is a fantastic initiative for giving anyone of any background the tools they need to start building an incredibly successful career in technology.""During the four-week course  participants are coached by Sidetrade’s senior engineers  who provide a mix of fundamental and practical knowledge on top of mentorship. The programme culminates in a presentation day for trainees to showcase what they’ve learned.Mark Sheldon  Chief Technology Officer of Sidetrade  commented: “At Sidetrade  we are always looking to hire talented people  and as a CTO of a rapidly growing company  I am all too familiar with the challenges of the digital skills shortage. The tech sector is currently hindered by the misconception that programmers must have years of technical or academic training before launching their careers. Sidetrade Code Academy is proof that this isn’t the case  and I’m convinced that we will attract great talents. A career in tech is within anyone’s reach  even if they’ve never coded a day in their life and even if you were not a rock-star student! We are so proud to help people succeed in tech careers.”With Sidetrade Code Academy  the AI firm has developed a proactive and unique approach to the nation-wide coding skills gap which. The programme has seen continued growth in popularity with a 53% increase in applications each year  as well as widespread support from leaders within Birmingham’s local technology and business communities including Women in Tech Birmingham   a local community networking group.Luke Hennerley  Principal Engineer at Sidetrade who spearheaded the idea for Sidetrade Code Academy  commented: “With the Sidetrade Code Academy  we offer participants the opportunity to work on real-world projects. I think it’s important to be really grounded in the professional world from the beginning. We  enable them to apply what they’ve learned into practice  and grow in confidence in tech. Moreover  the atmosphere at the Siderade Code Academy is really positive  and gives participants early insight into what it’s like to work with the team here at Sidetrade and the tech world in general!”Learn more about Sidetrade Code Academy or apply hereMedia relationsRebecca Parlby +44 7824 505 584 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

They are housed by two main service providers that represent 99% of its servers’ average load. One of them is operating on 100% green electricity and the other one on 78% renewable energy.In addition  Invibes Advertising runs some of its applications using carbon neutral cloud services.Impact of Invibes Advertising’s campaignsThe Company made an assessmenti of the average carbon footprint of its advertising campaigns in September 2022:The first step was to calculate the carbon footprint of Invibes Advertising’s technology platform for each ad impression  using the energy consumption of the Company’s servers  the type of energy used by the service providers housing those servers  and the number of ad impressions they powered in September 2022.The second step was to estimate the carbon footprint of an ad impression on the end-user side  based on the number of ad impressions for each type of device used to view our ads in September 2022  statistical data about energy consumption of devices used  as well as information about the carbon footprint of electricity in the country where end-users are located.Finally  we estimated the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the network between our servers and the end-user  based on data about the energy intensity of the internet in kWh/GB  as well as the carbon footprint of electricity in the countries where end-users are viewing our ads.This overall calculation resulted in an average energy consumption of 0.22kWh per 1 000 ad impressions in September 2022  corresponding to an average of 26.1 grams CO2 emissions per 1 000 ad impressions. In comparison  an average Display campaign has been estimated to emit 15% more CO2 (30 grams CO2 per 1 000 ad impressionsii).To a large extent  the lower carbon footprint of Invibes’ campaigns results from the fully integrated nature of its technology platform that allows for efficient processes  as well as the low carbon footprint of the Company’s servers. In addition  Invibes Advertising’s smart targeting allows its campaigns to achieve great effectiveness with an optimised number of impressions  thus further minimising their carbon impact.Benefits of technological independenceInvibes Advertising’s proprietary technology platform has been designed with process optimisation in mind  improving technical performance  reducing associated costs  and bringing benefits in terms of energy efficiency.As it has full control over its technology platform  Invibes Advertising is able to constantly evolve and improve. A large part of the Company’s R&D effort aims to achieve higher efficiency to ensure scalability  which also has advantages in terms of energy consumption.Invibes Advertising’s ambitious sustainability targetsIn line with its core value of always innovating in all aspects of its activity  Invibes Advertising has launched several initiatives to lower the carbon footprint of its campaigns:Actions to reduce the carbon footprint of processes directly within Invibes’ control  by decreasing the platform’s energy consumption and prioritising green sources of electricity.Actions to reduce its campaigns’ energy consumption outside Invibes’ realm  at the network and end-user level  bearing in mind that the carbon footprint of the electricity used there is not within the Company’s control.The Company has defined a series of goals it aims to achieve:Half-yearly tracking and publication of the carbon footprint of Invibes ’ ad campaigns .99 % green energy for outsourced serv ers by the end of 2023 .10% annual reduction of the energy consumption associated with Invibes’ ad campaigns for the next 3 years.This will allow Invibes Advertising to deliver Excellence to its clients in the ever more important aspect of reducing their advertising activities’ carbon impact.About Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising is an international technology company specializing in digital advertising innovation.

Idiopathic rhinitis features an overexpression of TRPV1 in the nasal mucosa giving rise to nasal obstruction  rhinorrhoea (colloquially: a runny nose)  and/or sneezing.Hyloris’ treatment approach is to activate and depolarize TRPV1 receptors leading to restoration of a normal function of the nasal mucosa. Current treatment options for idiopathic rhinitis are not consistently successful. This leads to unnecessary and often ineffective surgery for severe cases  such as nasal septal corrections and/or inferior turbinate reductions.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “We are pleased to announce another value-added product candidate to add to our portfolio of programs. This proprietary intranasal product candidate with a well-known mechanism of action should solve a large unmet medical need and offer patients rapid and sustainable relief.”“Our focused strategy to acquire new value-added product candidates has brought us closer to our goal of reaching 30 assets in our portfolio before 2025. This has solidified our positioning to be a market leader in the development of value-added product candidates utilizing the expedited and cost-effective 505(b)2 regulatory strategy in the U.S. We aim to develop a low-dose application that can be administered locally via a nasal spray first in Europe before pursing global roll-out.”Peter Hellings  Full Professor at the University of Leuven  Belgium  and Chair of EUFOREA (European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airways diseases)  commented: ”Idiopathic rhinitis is a burdensome condition of the nasal mucosa with no satisfactory medical or surgical treatment  where attempted symptom management fails in nearly all cases. It is a chronic condition associated with interrupted sleep  irritability and poor concentration. Hence  it can be a severe detriment to quality of life and capacity to work.”“Current treatment tries to combine an antihistamine and an intranasal corticosteroid used in other rhinitis types which has yielded only poor results. For severe cases  patients often turn to surgery which is not a cure either. Our strategy is to defunctionalize the overactivated sensory nerve fibres by a targeted  local acting medicinal product and present clinical evidence of efficacy and safety.”CONFERENCE CALLHyloris will host a conference call on Wednesday November 23rd at 4PM CET/10AM EST  in attendance of Prof. Dr. Peter Hellings.

For allergic and /infectious rhinitis  current medicinal products are available such as decongestant spray/tablets  antihistamines or corticosteroids.Idiopathic rhinitis is the largest group within the non-allergic/non-infectious rhinitis group. It occurs in around 7% of the total population  representing an estimated 19 million people in the US alone. 13% of them have moderate to severe idiopathic rhinitis  leading them to actively seek specialist treatment and  who can not provide consistent treatment with the currently available therapy options.These patients typically live through several years of failed treatment options  adding frustration and wasted expenses to the medical symptoms impacting their quality of life. Rapid relief through a nasal spray should reduce overall treatment costs  improve quality of life and make potentially unsuccessful surgical procedures redundant.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

The application has been granted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of March 20  2023.SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology. ENHANZE facilitates the SC injection delivery of biologics that are typically administered via IV infusion.“The FDA’s acceptance of our BLA is an exciting step toward fulfilling our vision of delivering the broadest gMG treatment offering that reflects the unique disease experience for each patient as they navigate life with this debilitating disease. We’re excited about the potential of SC efgartigimod to offer patients multiple ways to receive treatment through various administrations and an individualized dosing schedule ” said Keith Woods  Chief Operating Officer of argenx. “With an established PDUFA date  we are preparing for our second commercial product launch and look forward to potentially bringing forth another first-in-class option for gMG patients.”The BLA submission is supported by data from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod as compared with IV administered VYVGART in adult patients with gMG. The majority of enrolled patients were positive for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies  but the trial also included patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.ADAPT-SC met its primary endpoint (p< 0.0001) of total IgG reduction from baseline at day 29 demonstrating noninferiority of SC efgartigimod to VYVGART. Patients treated with SC efgartigimod achieved mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% reduction with VYVGART. Results were consistent across the overall population  including those with AChR antibodies and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected. Further  69.1% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Responders are defined as having at least a two-point improvement on the MG-ADL score for at least four consecutive weeks. 65.5% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score. Responders are defined as having at least a three-point improvement on the QMG score for at least four consecutive weeks. Minimal symptom expression (MSE)  a measure of symptom-free status  was achieved in 37% of SC efgartigimod-treated patients after one treatment cycle. Onset of effect was also consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT study.The safety profile for SC efgartigimod was consistent with the ADAPT study. It was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time. After completing ADAPT-SC  95% of participants entered ADAPT-SC+  a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of SC efgartigimod.Phase 3 ADAPT-SC Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a multicenter  randomized  open-label  parallel-group study evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) as compared with VYVGART (10mg/kg) in patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect as measured by percent change from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29  one week after the last dose of IV or SC efgartigimod  served as the primary endpoint in the ADAPT-SC trial. The correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG was demonstrated in a Phase 2 trial and the Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which served as the basis for approval of VYVGART in the U.S.  Japan and Europe. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed.A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial and were treated. Inclusion criteria of the trial were the same as the Phase 3 ADAPT trial of VYVGART; enrolled patients had a confirmed gMG diagnosis and an MG-ADL total score of at least 5 with greater than 50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms  at screening and baseline. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  and were required to remain on that stable dose throughout the primary trial. Patients were eligible to enroll in ADAPT-SC regardless of antibody status  including patients with AChR antibodies (AChR-Ab+) and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod or IV efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information. For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath.

Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology.About VYVGARTVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Photograph: Michael Santiago/Getty ImagesGlobal equities rose on Tuesday while US Treasury yields fell as investors awaited release of the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes for clues on US interest rates and as China’s Covid restrictions weighed on sentiment.DublinEuronext Dublin was up 34 basis points  largely in line with its international peers. In the travel and leisure sector  the best performer was Irish Continental Group  which operates Irish Ferries. It finished up 3.8 per cent on the day.Elsewhere  Ryanair was down 1.5 per cent at close of business  outperforming peers Wizz Air and EasyJet  which were down 9.5 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively. “For Ryanair to be only down 1.5 per cent was a significant outperformance ” said one trader.In the finance sector  Bank of Ireland was up 0.8 per cent  while AIB was down 0.4 per cent. In the gaming sector  Paddy Power Betfair parent Flutter Entertainment was up 2 per cent at the close of trading.READ MORECRH  which reported earlier in the day that it is sticking to its $5.5 billion (€5.4bn) full-year earnings forecast even it grapples with higher energy prices  finished down 1 per cent.LondonThe FTSE 100 jumped to a more than two-month high despite a new OECD report casting an unmissable shadow over the UK’s economic prosperity.Energy giants moved to the top of London’s blue-chip index with the likes of Shell  BP and Harbour Energy all seeing their shares rise by more than 4 per cent.The boost comes despite the OECD predicting the UK’s economy will contract more than any other of the world’s seven most advanced nations next year. It is expected to shrink by 0.4 per cent in 2023 and grow by just 0.2 per cent in 2024. Nevertheless  investors flocked to the London Stock Exchange as oil prices saw a rebound  helping to push up the index. The FTSE 100 closed 1 per cent higher.Shares in AO World surged by more than 16 per cent despite revealing its half-year losses had widened after sales fell.Water company Severn Trent said its underlying pre-tax profits hit more than £260 million (€300m) in its half-year earnings  as it reported it is ramping up support efforts for vulnerable customers and investing in its regions.

A batch of upbeat earnings also buoyed sentiment.Top indices were in the green when European markets closed. The S&P 500 was up by 0.75 per cent and Dow Jones was 0.81 per cent higher.Analog Devices climbed after giving a bullish forecast for the current period. Best Buy jumped after raising its profit forecast. Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters also rose after reporting results that beat estimates. Retailers clearing out their inventories with a series of sales could help reduce inflation  which could ultimately make the Fed turn dovish.Despite the rally  China’s Covid control restrictions are still weighing on investors. Shutdowns can have a negative impact on supply-chain dynamics and possibly exacerbate inflation issues across economies. Chinese stocks listed in the US fell on the day.

It is estimated that this project will reduce[2] emissions by 10'000 tons of CO 2 equivalent per year  in the long term  i.e. the reduction of 90% of its current emissions. This is the equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 30'000 round trips from Paris <> Nice by car[3].hydrogen fuel cell solution - Design not contractual for illustration purposes (©Alstom Advanced & Creative Design) Sébastien Arbola  Executive Vice President of ENGIE in charge of Thermal Generation  Hydrogen & Energy Supply activities. Sophie Dubois  Chief Executive Officer of Nestlé Waters in France. Marc Granger  Chief Strategy Officer of Alstom.As a significant innovation  the new hydrogen solution will be developed from a high-powered fuel cell system that can power electric locomotives in non-electrified areas. This solution will be able to transport goods over long distances  on a national and European scale.From 2025  this freight train powered by electricity from the rail network and from hydrogen in non-electrified sectors will aim to progressively ensure the transport of VITTEL® natural mineral water between the factory located in the Vosges and its various distribution centers in France (i.e Vittel/Arles 600 kms and Vittel/Montreuil-Bellay 760 kms). The dual-mode solution will be composed by a generator wagon incorporating a high-power fuel cell system powered by renewable hydrogen and a line-electric locomotive  all connected by an electrical power cable. The generating wagon will be able to supply the locomotive with electricity in the without the need for any catenary.""At Nestlé Waters  we favour rail freight whenever possible. We are constantly looking for efficient solutions to reduce the carbon impact of our supply chain "" said Sophie Dubois  Chief Executive Officer of Nestlé Waters in France.""We are very proud of this project as it represents a significant investment by our railway team to find innovative solutions to answer to climate and environmental challenge. This collaboration with Alstom and ENGIE will accelerate the development of a decarbonized/carbon-free supply chain""  concluded Sophie Dubois.An innovative decarbonization system developed by Alstom and ENGIENestlé Waters will be the first company to benefit from the hydrogen fuel cell solution for rail freight  including renewable hydrogen supply  developed by Alstom and ENGIE under a partnership announced in April 2022.This solution aims to replace the diesel-powered locomotives  currently used on most lines in France and most European countries.The high-power hydrogen fuel cell system developed by Alstom will power electric locomotives in non-electrified areas and offer a 100% electric solution for rail freight  end-to-end  including to the first and last kilometers  which are rarely electrified.This innovative solution will make it possible to carry out all freight journeys with the same electric locomotive  powered by the catenary on electrified main lines and by the hydrogen generator wagon in non-electrified areas.In terms of performance  the solution will provide all the power of a catenary-based mainline electric locomotive and enough power with hydrogen energy to pull a freight train over non-electrified line segments.ENGIE will supply the renewable hydrogen for this solution through the deployment of an innovative supply chain.""Alstom has been a pioneer in hydrogen trains by developing the first hydrogen train in commercial operation worldwide."" said Marc Granger  Chief Strategy Officer of Alstom.""Our ambition is to accelerate the adoption of hydrogen in the rail industry and to develop innovative solutions for the greening of mass mobility  including rail freight. Therefore  we are looking forward to the first circulation of a freight locomotive powered by renewable hydrogen in 2025. To go further  this solution  which is more environmentally friendly and generates less noise than diesel  will make it possible to develop the modal share of rail freight by offering an end-to-end electric solution  a real alternative to freight transport.""""Following the announcement of our partnership with Alstom to supply hydrogen to this new European rail decarbonization solution  Nestlé Waters becomes the first prime contractors for our offer  and the first future user of our solution. This is a key step in the development of this project. Hydrogen plays an essential role in the transition of industrial companies towards reducing their emissions  a dynamic in which ENGIE is fully involved. »Sébastien Arbola  Executive Vice President of ENGIE in charge of Thermal Generation  Hydrogen & Energy Supply activities.Nestlé Waters puts rail as a strategic part of its carbon reduction roadmapThis project with Alstom and ENGIE is the latest for Nestlé Waters  which has long favored rail in its logistical approaches to minimize the environmental impact of transport  equivalent to a quarter of its carbon footprint[4]. While for French industry  the share of rail freight represents on average [5]8% to 10% of the volumes transported  for Nestlé Waters in France  it represents nearly 45% of the volumes of the Vosges factory.In 2018  Nestlé Waters joined the FRET21 approach and signed an agreement with the French Agency for Ecological Transition (Agence de la Transition Ecologique - ADEME) to take action to reduce the carbon footprint of its product transport flows in France. In 2020  the group set a further target of reducing its transport-related CO 2 emissions in France by 13% by the end of 2022. This ambition is based on the following concrete actions:In 2018  the opening of a railway line between its PERRIER® plant and the port of Fos-sur-Mer  reducing the passage of 27 000 trucks per year.In 2019  the introduction of the EURODUAL hybrid locomotive  which has saved 1 920 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year compared to a diesel locomotive.In 2021  the Glass Train project  which promotes the transport of VITTEL® and S.PELLEGRINO® returnable glass bottles by train  reduces the passage of 1 000 trucks per year.The initiatives led by Nestlé Waters since 2020 have already made it possible to reduce almost 11% of the carbon emissions from transport  or about 5'900 tons of CO 2 equivalent by the end of 2021.All these actions contribute to the Nestlé Group's ambition of zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the global level.About Nestlé WatersFounded in 1992  Nestlé Waters  a subsidiary of the Nestlé Group  is a natural mineral water business. It is the national leader in the bottled water market in France with 8 brands such as VITTEL® HEPAR® and CONTREX®.

To abstain from voting in a certain matter  leave both boxes empty. Shareholders may request in the advance voting form that a resolution on one or several of the matters on the proposed agenda below should be deferred to a so-called continued general meeting  which cannot be conducted solely by way of advance voting. Such general meeting shall take place if the EGM so resolves or if shareholders with at least one tenth of all shares in the Company so requests.Information on the resolutions passed at the EGM will be published on 15 December 2022 as soon as the result of the advance voting has been finally confirmed.Further information and instructions are available in the Notice of EGM and the Form for Postal Voting  both of which are available on the Company's webpage (www.ferronordic.com).Proposed agendaMatters:1. Election of chairman2. Verification of voting list3. Approval of the agenda4. Election of controllers5. Determination whether the meeting has been duly convened6. Resolution on a long-term incentive program based on warrants to be issued by the CompanyMotionsPoint 1: The Board of Directors proposes Staffan Jufors as chairman of the meeting.Point 2: The voting list proposed for approval under this point on the agenda is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company based on the EGM's share register and advance votes received  as verified and approved by the persons approving the minutes of the EGM.Point 4: Peter Zonabend (Per Arwidsson) and Gustaf Lindskog  or if one or both of them would be prevented  the person or persons instead appointed by the Board of Directors  are proposed to be elected to approve the minutes of the EGM together with the Chairman. The task of approving the minutes of the EGM also includes verifying the voting list and that the advance votes received are correctly stated in the minutes of the EGM.Point 6: To further align the long-term interests between the Company and its shareholders with those of the senior management and also to be able to offer competitive terms to attract and retain senior management in for the Company turbulent times  the Board proposes a long-term incentive program under which the Company would issue a maximum of 1 178 000 warrants to be distributed between approximately 19 people forming the senior management of the Company and its subsidiaries. Each warrant entitles the participant to subscribe for one share of the Company at the earliest three-years after the warrant was issued.When preparing the LTI-program  the board has taken into consideration that the outstanding series of warrants have been issued at terms that given the current price level of the Company's shares represent a minimal value and no longer fulfil their intended purpose as incentive programs.The market value of the warrant at the time of transfer to the participants will be determined by an independent financial advisor on the basis of Black and Scholes option pricing model. As an indication  on the proposed terms and a share price between SEK 40 - 55 would give an estimated market value of each Warrant  calculated by the Company's independent financial advisor  of SEK 4 - 10. Each participant will purchase his or her warrants at a price equal to the estimated fair market value but in order to diminish the risk that the total financial outcome would be negative for the participants  each participant will receive a compensation that net of tax covers the cost for acquiring the warrants under the program.Subscription of shares is to be done against cash payment to the Company of a strike price equal to SEK65. Assuming full allotment and subsequent subscription  the Company's equity would increase with approximately MSEK 76 570 000. Participation in the program and subsequent subscription requires that a participant remains an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries.The maximum dilution as a result of full subscription of shares under this proposed program is 7.5%. The program is expected to have only a marginal effect on the company's important key ratios.The major costs for the Company including its subsidiaries consists of the tax and social fees connected to paying compensation to the participants covering the purchase price to be paid by the participants for the warrants. This compensation is to be paid by the employing entity of each participant and will subsequently be paid to the Company when the warrants are purchased. The total cost for the Group for paying this compensation is estimated to MSEK 2 - 5 depending on the final valuation of the Warrants. In addition  transaction costs for external advisors are estimated at SEK 100000.This LTI-program has been prepared by the Board in consultation with external advisors. In addition  the proposal has been prepared by the Board's remuneration committee and has been reviewed at meetings of the Board during 2022.The full proposal will be available on the Company's webpage (www.ferronordic.com).Resolution according to this item must be supported by shareholders with at least nine tenths of the votes cast as well the shares represented at the EGM.The full notice is attached hereto and available on the Company's website www.ferronordic.com.-------------------------------------------------------About FerronordicFerronordic is a service and sales company in the areas of construction equipment and trucks.

sustainability goals for annual prize,YK Center  which advocates for UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals  jointly announces awards for top SDG performers among banks  insurance companies  stock exchanges,An Israeli organization has linked up with three international bodies to launch an award that will be given to banks  insurance companies and stock exchanges that have performed best in relation to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.The award  to be given at the UN’s annual COP climate conferences  will eventually also be extended to companies.The world agreed in 2015 to implement 17 Sustainable Development Goals  or SDGs  by 2030.The goals  which are made up of 169 targets  include climate action  but also improving society in areas such as health  education  increased equality  the eradication of poverty  and access to clean natural resources.Israel’s YK Center  a think tank and incubator which promotes the SDGs  is working on the award together with the United Nations Global Sustainability Index Institute  the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network  and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up  you agree to the terms“The world can see how the finance sector is working hard to regain trust while becoming reliable partners for SDG implementation ” said YK Center CEO Tal Ronen.The center is named for Israeli insurance and risk management expert Prof. Yehuda Kahane  who campaigns for the SDGs.The top three winners in each category were announced earlier this month at the UN COP27 climate conference in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh  which ended early Sunday morning.AdvertisementB3 from Brazil won the stock exchange section  followed by Japan Exchange Group and Deutsche Boerse.Among the banks  Banco Bradesco from Brazil came first  with the French BNP Paribas taking second place and Mexico’s Banorte the third.The French company Axa took top place in the insurance sector  followed by Zurich Insurance and the London-based Aviva.This year’s awards will be presented to the companies in February at an SDG Lab in Davos  Switzerland.In the future  they will be given annually at COP conferences  starting with next year’s COP28 in the UAE.Roland Schatz  founder and CEO of the UN Global Sustainability Index Institute  added that the research would be broadened to include small and medium-sized companies and that Israeli companies would be included as well going forward.AdvertisementTo arrive at its analysis of 30 banks  30 insurance companies and 10 stock exchanges  the UN Global Sustainability Index Institute examined the legally binding annual reports published in the last five years by the world’s top 500 listed companies  with a combined market capitalization of more than $25 trillion.Researchers compared how each one of the 500 companies spent its budget and its plans for the future  judging it against the rubric of the 17 SDGs and 169 targets.Its findings were buttressed with reports in the financial media  as well as comments by financial analysts  on the companies’ statements and claims  which were then used to rank the companies on sustainability.“The SDG Commitment Report Awards provide transparency on how the lighthouses in the banking  insurance  and stock exchange industries are increasingly committed to accepting the SDGs as their additional compass in business ” said Schatz.Prof. Phoebe Koundouri  co-chair of UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network  said it was important to ensure that those providing funding to companies  cities  hospitals  and other institutions across the world understood that they also had to disclose their guidelines for investment decisions.“We are looking forward to seeing all the experts joining our UNFCCC Innovation Hub next year at COP in Dubai” said Massamba Thioye  head

Long-term efficacy and safety findings showed that FINTEPLA  when added to a patient's current anti-epileptic treatment regimen for seizures associated with LGS  was effective in reducing the frequency of multiple seizure types and was generally well tolerated during a median treatment duration of 364 days.1 Study participants experienced a sustained reduction in the frequency of motor seizures including those that resulted in a drop or fall like generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS)  secondary GTCS  focal to bilateral tonic-clonic  tonic seizures  atonic seizures  and tonic-atonic seizures.1LGS is a severe childhood-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by drug-resistant seizures with high morbidity3 as well as serious impairment of neurodevelopmental  cognitive  and motor functions.4 LGS has far-reaching effects beyond seizures  including issues with communication  psychiatric symptoms  sleep  behavioral challenges  and mobility.5 LGS affects 30 000 to 50 000 people in the U.S.6""This long-term safety and efficacy interim analysis of adjunctive FINTEPLA showed that patients with LGS experienced sustained  clinically meaningful reductions in the frequency of seizures associated with a drop  with a particularly robust reduction in the frequency of GTCS  which are associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado  and principal investigator of the study. ""Given the sustained efficacy and tolerability of FINTEPLA over time  this medication could be an important long-term therapeutic option for patients with LGS  who are highly treatment-resistant  and could be an especially important therapeutic option for LGS patients who experience a high burden of GTCS.""Story continuesResults of the OLE study showed the median percentage change in monthly frequency of seizures associated with a drop from pre-randomized baseline was -28.6% over the entire OLE (P<0.0001) and -50.5% at month 15 (P<0.0001). Nearly one-third of patients (31.1%) experienced a clinically meaningful 50% or greater reduction in the percentage of seizures associated with a drop  including 11.6% of patients who demonstrated a profound 75% or greater reduction. The median percentage change in the frequency of all motor seizures was 45.9% (P=0.0038).1 GTCS and tonic seizures were most responsive to LGS treatment with FINTEPLA.1 Over the entire OLE  the median percentage change in GTCS from pre-randomized baseline was -48.8% (P<0.0001)  and  over time  ranged from -56.4% at Month 7-9 (P<0.0001) to -79.1% at Month 13-15 (P<0.0001).1 The median percentage change in tonic seizures was -35.8% over the entire OLE (P<0.0001) and  over time  ranged from -37.1% at Month 4-6 (P<0.0001) to -62.6% at Month 13-15 (P<0.0001).1Within the study  the authors note the reason these data are compelling is because GTCS are commonly observed in patients with LGS.1 Moreover  GTCS may result in bodily injury.7 8 Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for people living with LGS  and patients with a history of GTCS have an estimated 10-fold greater risk of SUDEP.9 10The OLE study also demonstrated that FINTEPLA was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed in the OLE were decreased appetite  fatigue  nasopharyngitis  and seizure. The cardiovascular safety in this study further corroborates the FINTEPLA safety profiles; no cases of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension were observed.""This open label extension provides strong evidence that FINTEPLA is effective in reducing multiple seizure types associated with LGS  particularly more severe generalized seizures for up to 15 months "" said Brad Chapman  U.S. Head of Epilepsy and Rare Syndromes  UCB. ""We are pleased to be able to offer FINTEPLA to those living with and caring for people with LGS to help reduce the impact of this devastating disease and potentially  improve the quality of life for those living with LGS.""Additional results of the OLE found that approximately one-third of investigators (37.6%) and caregivers (35.2%) rated their patients as ""Much Improved"" or ""Very Much Improved"" on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale.1FINTEPLA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of LGS in patients 2 years of age and older in March 2022 and for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients 2 years of age and older in June 2020. UCB acquired Zogenix  Inc. and FINTEPLA in March 2022.Study DesignAs of October 19  2020  247 eligible patients entered the OLE study after the patients completed participation in the multi-center  double-blind  parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial that enrolled children and adults  age 2 to 35 years  with a confirmed LGS diagnosis who were using stable anti-seizure medication regimens at 65 study sites in North America  Europe  and Australia. In that randomized trial  a total of 263 patients were assigned to receive either FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day (n=87) or FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day (n=89) or placebo (n=87). After titration (2-week period)  patients were maintained on their randomized dose for 12 additional weeks.A total of 247 eligible patients with LGS who completed that 14-week randomized Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled in the OLE study. Patients were eligible to enroll if they had not experienced any of the following at the end of the Phase 3 clinical trial: clinically meaningful worsening of seizures  clinically significant laboratory findings  or weight loss greater than 15% during the titration and maintenance period that failed to stabilize. The median age of the patients was 14.3 years. All patients were maintained on a stable antiseizure medication regimen of concomitant antiseizure medications during the entire OLE treatment period  and 88.3% received two to four concomitant antiseizure medications.All patients in the OLE were initially started on FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day. After one month  they were flexibly titrated to effectiveness and tolerability  up to a maximum of 0.7 mg/kg/day  which were assessed at three-month intervals. They were treated with FINTEPLA for a median treatment duration of 364 days.The Phase 3 clinical trial and OLE study were both sponsored by Zogenix  Inc.  now part of UCB. The trial is still ongoing.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved in the U.S.  Europe  and in Japan  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. FINTEPLA is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.2In the U.S.  FINTEPLA is available through a restricted distribution program  called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGE2FINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring : Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:U.S. Brand and Media RelationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359Erica.puntel@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Morial Convention Center  278-282About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.Story continuesAbout LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3Kδ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

In light of this  the board of directors has concluded that the listing of the Company's shares should be transferred from the Main List of the Oslo Stock Exchange to Euronext Growth Oslo. Accordingly  Awilco Drilling has today initiated a process towards an admission of its shares to trading on Euronext Growth Oslo. The transfer of the listing is expected to be completed during December 2022. At the same time  Awilco Drilling convenes an extraordinary general meeting to authorize an application for a de-listing from the Main List of the Oslo Stock Exchange. The extraordinary general meeting will be held on 8 December 2022 at 12:00 noon (UK time). Notice for the extraordinary general meeting is hereby attached. Given the changes in the nature of the Company's operations  a new article in the Company’s Articles of Association is proposed that gives the Board authority to change the Company’s name if and when deemed appropriate. To give the Company flexibility to finance the arbitration proceedings against Keppel FELS  the board of directors also ask the general meeting to approve a consolidation of the existing shares  where every 100 ordinary shares of £0.0065 each in the capital of the Company will be consolidated into one ordinary share of £0.65  as well as an authorisation to increase the Company's share capital by GBP 7 000 000  which will permit the issuance of up to 10 769 231 new shares after the consolidation.Aberdeen  23 November 2022For further information please contact:Eric Jacobs  CEOPhone: +44 1224 737900Cathrine Haavind  Investor RelationsPhone: +47 93 42 84 64Email: ch@awilcodrilling.comThis information is subject of the disclosure requirements pursuant to section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.Attachment",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,True,English,"['Awilco Drilling PLC', 'Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Change', 'listing', 'Notice', 'Norwegian Securities Trading Act', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'one ordinary share', 'Awilco Drilling PLC', '100 ordinary shares', 'arbitration proceedings', 'Keppel FELS', 'Main List', 'same time', 'UK time', 'new article', 'share capital', 'Eric Jacobs', 'Cathrine Haavind', 'Investor Relations', 'disclosure requirements', 'existing shares', '10,769,231 new shares', 'Company flexibility', 'sale', 'WilHunter', 'WilPhoenix', 'operations', 'light', 'board', 'directors', 'listing', 'process', 'transfer', 'December', 'application', '12:00 noon', 'Notice', 'changes', 'nature', 'Articles', 'Association', 'authority', 'name', 'consolidation', 'authorisation', 'GBP', 'issuance', 'Aberdeen', 'information', 'CEO', 'Phone', 'Email', 'section', 'Attachment']",2022-11-23,2022-11-23,globenewswire.com

The European Board of Appeal announced its decision at a hearing on November 15  2022.With this final decision  Oxurion further improves its intellectual property position over THR-149  its novel therapeutic for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). Oxurion itself holds granted patents for THR-149 through 2034 with the potential to extend through 2039.“We are pleased with the Appeal Board’s final decision revoking the Dyax claims  ” said Tom Graney  CEO of Oxurion. “We are very proud of our work with THR-149 and removing these claims will assist Oxurion in capturing the long-term value of this important asset.”THR-149 is a bicyclic peptide that selectively inhibits human plasma kallikrein (PKal) with an inhibition constant of 0.22 nM. Through the inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS)  THR-149 prevents the induction of retinal vascular permeability  neurodegeneration  and inflammation.THR-149 is currently being evaluated in the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of DME. DME is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  and the market for treatments is currently estimated at $5+ billion. Results of an interim analysis of the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B trial are expected by year-end 2022.Part B of the KALAHARI study follows a successful Part A  in which three dose levels of THR-149 (0.005mg  0.022mg and 0.13mg)  were each administered in three monthly IVT injections  whch were then evaluated in order to select the best dose for Part B of the study.High-level data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021  which demonstrated that the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  achieved a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint. A post-hoc analysis was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022 based on an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment.The masked reading center identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3  which was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial. The Month 6 data also demonstrated THR-149’s attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended study design excluding patients that would not respond to any treatment. More information can be found here: NCT04527107About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to improve and better preserve vision in patients with retinal disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  as well as other conditions. Oxurion intends to play an important role in the treatment of retinal disorders  including the successful development of THR-149  its novel therapeutic for the treatment of DME. THR-149 is a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor being developed as a potential new standard of care for the up to 50% of DME patients showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy.

(AEX: PRX) has announced a solid set of results for the first half of the year. Despite a turbulent period during which industry growth expectations and valuations came under significant pressure  we have increased ecommerce revenues and continued organic investment into those segments where we see the highest growth potential. This investment is focused on building and extending our offering within core products to meet local market needs  notably within autos at OLX  convenience delivery in Food and credit at PayU. Organic investment levels peaked during the period  and together with increased scale and actively managing our cost base  our business is well positioned for improvements in profitability and cash flow generation. It is our ambition for our consolidated ecommerce portfolio to become profitable in H1 of FY2025. Our buyback programme will continue for the foreseeable future  as it meaningfully improves net asset value (NAV) per share  creating permanent value that will compound over time.Headlines1Ecommerce revenue up 41%  driven by a strong operating performance across all four core segmentsGroup revenue up 9% to US$16.5bnGroup trading profit declined by 37% to US$1.4bn reflecting a lower contribution from Tencent and investment in ecommerce extensions; Core headline earnings down 60% to US$897mFocused organic investment in high potential businesses within our core segments; HY23 reflects peak investment spendOpen-ended buyback has unlocked permanent value for shareholders  with US$5.8bn of Prosus and Naspers shares repurchasedSignificant steps taken to drive profitability within core segments  with ecommerce portfolio on track to reach profitability within two yearsStrong and liquid balance sheet a strategic advantage in the current climate; US$15.8bn gross cash and US$600m net cashTencent announced on 16 November 2022 that it will distribute Meituan shares to its shareholders next year.

To further scale our ecommerce businesses  we have made significant organic investment in OLX Autos  credit  convenience delivery and edtech  which will drive sustainable long-term value creation for the Group. The Group’s open-ended buyback of Prosus and Naspers shares is unlocking real value. We expect the benefits of the programme to compound over time. Looking ahead  we will work towards simplifying the Group’s structure and to crystallise value from our portfolio.”Group performance1 2Group results – economic interest basis HY2023 HY2022 YoY change Revenues US$16.5bn US$16.3bn 9% Trading profit US$1.4bn US$2.8bn -37% Core headline earnings US$897m US$2.3bn -60% Ecommerce portfolio Revenues US$5.2bn US$3.9bn 41% Trading loss US$998m US$522m -62% Classifieds Revenues US$1.3bn US$988m 60% Trading loss US$159m US$42m -279% Food Revenues US$1.9bn US$1.3bn 52% Trading loss US$381m US$312m -10% Payments & Fintech Revenues US$480m US$359m 55% Trading loss US$97m US$31m -194% Education technology Revenues US$334m US$120m 38% Trading loss US$178m US$48m -81% Group results - consolidated Revenues US$3.2bn US$2.8bn 33% Trading loss US$531m US$318m -56%Basil Sgourdos  Group CFO  Prosus and Naspers  commented:“Revenue grew strongly across our segments  despite the significant foreign currency headwinds in emerging markets and a lower contribution from Tencent.

Our strong balance sheet and significant liquidity is a key advantage in the current climate; we will remain disciplined on M&A and committed to maintaining our investment grade rating.”Strong growth and execution in ecommerceEcommerce revenues  on an economic interest basis  grew 41% to US$5.2bn  driven by strong top-line growth across all four core segments.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with: Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREMTM (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREM.Warnings and PrecautionsHypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies  particularly closely spaced studies when possibleAcute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Do not exceed the recommended dose.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BW ELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. There are no available data on ELUCIREM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of ELUCIREM in human milk  the effects on the breastfed infant  or the effects on milk production. However  published lactation data on other GBCAs indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is present in breast milk.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ELUCIREM have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney  and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.Renal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment  the exposure of gadopiclenol is increased compared to patients with normal renal function. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. No dose adjustment of ELUCIREM is recommended for patients with renal impairment. ELUCIREM can be removed from the body by hemodialysisYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information  including the Medication Guide and Boxed Warning  for additional important safety information.DOTAREM® (GADOTERATE MEGLUMINE) INJECTION IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNING: NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS (NSF) Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin  muscle and internal organs. • The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with: o Chronic  severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2)  or o Acute kidney injury. • Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g. age > 60 years  hypertension  diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing. • For patients at highest risk for NSF  do not exceed the recommended DOTAREM dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to any re-administration.INDICATIONS AND USAGEDOTAREM® (gadoterate meglumine) injection is a prescription gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial)  spine and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients (including term neonates) to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.CONTRAINDICATIONSHistory of clinically important hypersensitivity reactions to DOTAREM.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with DOTAREM  involving cardiovascular  respiratory  and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of DOTAREM administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment.Before DOTAREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to DOTAREM.Administer DOTAREM only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions  including personnel trained in resuscitation.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. The highest concentrations have been identified in the bone  followed by brain  skin  kidney  liver and spleen. The duration of retention also varies by tissue  and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs.Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention.Acute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of DOTAREM. Extravasation into tissues during DOTAREM administration may result in tissue irritation.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions associated with DOTAREM in clinical trials were nausea  headache  injection site pain  injection site coldness and rash.Serious adverse reactions in the Postmarketing experience have been reported with DOTAREM. These serious adverse reactions include but are not limited to: arrhythmia  cardiac arrest  respiratory arrest  pharyngeal edema  laryngospasm  bronchospasm  coma and convulsion.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSPregnancy : GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. Use only if imaging is essential during pregnancy and cannot be delayed.Lactation : There are no data on the presence of gadoterate in human milk  the effects on the breastfed infant  or the effects on milk production. However  published lactation data on other GBCAs indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is present in breast milk.Pediatric Use: The safety and efficacy of DOTAREM at a single dose of 0.1 mmol/kg has been established in pediatric patients from birth (term neonates ≥ 37 weeks gestational age) to 17 years of age based on clinical data. The safety of DOTAREM has not been established in preterm neonates. No cases of NSF associated with DOTAREM or any other GBCA have been identified in pediatric patients age 6 years and younger.You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

This investment is focused on building and extending our offering within core products to meet local market needs  notably within autos at OLX  convenience delivery in Food and credit at PayU. Organic investment levels peaked during the period  and together with increased scale and actively managing our cost base  our business is well positioned for improvements in profitability and cash flow generation. It is our ambition for our consolidated ecommerce portfolio to become profitable in H1 of FY2025. Our buyback programme will continue for the foreseeable future  as it meaningfully improves net asset value (NAV) per share  creating permanent value that will compound over time.Headlines1Ecommerce revenue up 38%  driven by a strong operating performance across all four core segmentsGroup revenue up 9% to US$17bnGroup trading profit declined by 38% to US$1.4bn reflecting a lower contribution from Tencent and investment in ecommerce extensions; Core headline earnings down 51% to US$372mFocused organic investment in high potential businesses within our core segments; HY23 reflects peak investment spendOpen-ended buyback has unlocked permanent value for shareholders  with US$5.8bn of Prosus and Naspers shares repurchasedSignificant steps taken to drive profitability within core segments  with ecommerce portfolio on track to reach profitability within two yearsStrong and liquid balance sheet a strategic advantage in the current climate; US$16.0bn gross cash and US$760m net cashTencent announced on 16 November 2022  that it will distribute Meituan shares to its shareholders next year.

13661,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/11/23/healthbeacon-develops-software-platform-for-cancer-medication/,HealthBeacon develops software platform for cancer medication,Dublin-based medical technology company says new platform will create a new recurring revenue stream for the group,Dublin-based medical technology company HealthBeacon has developed a new software platform to help cancer patients take their medication more safely.The “global patient safety platform” has been developed over the last two years in collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry and has been recently approved by regulators in both the UK and Ireland.The company  which floated on Euronext Dublin last December  said the product is scheduled to launch in Australia and New Zealand.The platform is designed to replace a paper-based system to ensure the right people get access to the right drugs and drive down the cost of administration.READ MOREHealthBeacon  which was founded in 2013 and is led by chief executive and co-founder Jim Joyce  said the platform will create a new recurring revenue stream for the group  where pharmaceutical manufacturers pay a licensing fee for access to the system.This would help them meet their regulatory requirements and ensures access to critical medications. HealthBeacon anticipates the technology will support more than 1 000 patients by the end of 2022.To date  more than 800 pharmacies have already adopted the system across Ireland and the UK and 12 pharmaceutical companies have bought licenses to replace their paper-based system with HealthBeacon’s software.The first drug to be prescribed on the platform is lenalidomide  used to treat certain cancers.If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy  it poses a risk of birth defects. Using a series of electronic checks and balances  HealthBeacon’s platform is designed to ensure the medication cannot be dispensed until a set of agreed safety protocols have been validated.Ultimately  according to the group  the platform reduces the potential for human error associated with traditional prescription methods.In Ireland  the system is approved by the Health Products Regulatory Authority and has been whitelisted by the Health Service Executive  meaning it can directly contact every pharmacy in the country.,neutral,0.01,0.84,0.15,mixed,0.29,0.04,0.67,True,English,"['software platform', 'cancer medication', 'HealthBeacon', 'new recurring revenue stream', 'Health Products Regulatory Authority', 'Dublin-based medical technology company', 'global patient safety platform', 'last two years', 'traditional prescription methods', 'Health Service Executive', 'new software platform', 'New Zealand', 'regulatory requirements', 'safety protocols', 'chief executive', 'Euronext Dublin', 'right people', 'right drugs', 'Jim Joyce', 'licensing fee', 'critical medications', 'first drug', 'birth defects', 'electronic checks', 'human error', 'pharmaceutical industry', '12 pharmaceutical companies', 'cancer patients', 'paper-based system', '1,000 patients', 'HealthBeacon', 'collaboration', 'regulators', 'UK', 'Ireland', 'Australia', 'access', 'cost', 'administration', 'READ', 'founder', 'group', 'manufacturers', 'end', 'date', '800 pharmacies', 'licenses', 'lenalidomide', 'cancers', 'pregnancy', 'risk', 'series', 'balances', 'set', 'potential', 'country', '2022']",2022-11-23,2022-11-23,irishtimes.com

(""DDC"")  part of the global network of Eurofins companies  announces that Eric Brunner  a Canton  OH man who was convicted of rape and attempted rape of two women in 1996  has been exonerated based on key DNA analysis performed by DDC's Forensics Department in conjunction with the Ohio Innocence Project (OIP). Mr. Brunner served 13 years in prison before he was released on parole in 2009.After Mr. Brunner's release  the OIP worked to overturn the conviction due to the limitations and stigmatization that Mr. Brunner experienced from the conviction and sexual offender status  including opportunities for employment and housing.In 2019  DNA testing conducted by DDC Forensics definitively concluded that Mr. Brunner's DNA did not match the perpetrator's DNA collected from the rape kit. Based on this evidence  the Stark County judge overturned the rape conviction. On August 30  2022  Ohio's Fifth District Court of Appeals also overturned the attempted rape conviction  freeing Mr. Brunner of sexual offender status.DDC Forensics is proud to have provided the DNA testing in this case  applauds the OIP for its success in freeing Mr. Brunner from both convictions  and hopes this ruling can provide a pathway to healing for Mr. Brunner.Brian Howe  Brunner's attorney at the OIP  said ""DDC Forensics was able to get a clean  unambiguous DNA profile from the rape kit evidence using technological advancements not previously available. Thanks to DDC's outstanding work  Eric Brunner now has physical proof to back up his longstanding innocence claims.""DDC has partnered with Innocence Projects throughout the U.S. on over 100 cases to analyze DNA evidence since the foundation of DDC's Forensics Department in 2003  including fourteen exonerations.Media Contact:Julie A.

Growth in FD-SOI wafers was very strong  confirming structural demand for Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors. Soitec also leveraged sustained growth in Photonics-SOI wafers for data transceivers and in Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications.Gross profit reached 168 million Euros in H1’23  up 27% from 131 million Euros in H1’22  reflecting a 0.4 points increase in gross margin  from 35.2% of revenue in H1’22 to 35.6% of revenue in H1’23. Soitec achieved a strong operating leverage due to the robust increase in activity as well as from a good industrial performance. This strong performance offsets an unfavorable currency impact  due to hedging  and inflationary cost increases  including  as anticipated  higher bulk material prices within the framework of Soitec’s long-term agreements with its suppliers.Current operating income increased by 46% to 110 million Euros in H1’23  up from 75 million Euros in H1’22. This translates into a strong increase in current operating margin from 20.2% of revenue in H1’22 to 23.4% of revenue in H1’23 thanks to a tight control over SG&A as well as slight increase in net R&D expenses:Net R&D expenses increased slightly from 28 million Euros in H1’22 to 29 million Euros in H1’23 but they went down as a percentage of revenue  from 7.4% in H1’22 to 6.1% in H1’23. Gross R&D expenses before capitalization increased by 7 million Euros as Soitec continued to invest in innovation and in the expansion of its product portfolio.increased slightly from 28 million Euros in H1’22 to 29 million Euros in H1’23 but they went down as a percentage of revenue  from 7.4% in H1’22 to 6.1% in H1’23. Gross R&D expenses before capitalization increased by 7 million Euros as Soitec continued to invest in innovation and in the expansion of its product portfolio. Selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were stable compared to H1’22  at 28 million Euros  but they went down as a percentage of revenue  from 7.6% in H1’22 to 6.0% in H1’23. The increase in the number of staff and in salaries was offset by a decline in share-based compensation in line with the lower share price.The EBITDA1 from continuing operations amounted to 167 million Euros in H1’23  up 22% from 137 million Euros in H1’22  reflecting a slightly lower EBITDA1 margin2  down from 36.8% in H1’22 to 35.5% in H1’23. While its strong operating leverage allowed Soitec to maintain a sustained R&D activity and a very sound profitability  the EBITDA1 margin2 integrates a negative currency impact and inflationary cost increases.Depreciation and amortization expenses went up from 37 million Euros in H1’22 to 50 million Euros in H1’23 as a result of the increased industrial capacity as well as R&D investments carried out by the Group in previous years.Consolidated income statement (part 2)(Euros millions) H1’23 H1’22 % change Current operating income 110 75 +46% Other operating income and expenses 0 9 Operating income 110 85 +30% Net financial result (2) (5) Income tax (13) (6) Net profit from continuing operations 95 74 +27% Net profit / (loss) from discontinued operations 0 (0) Net profit  Group share 95 74 +28%Basic earnings per share (in €) 2.72 2.23 +22% Diluted earnings per share (in €) 2.65 2.14 +24% Number of shares 35 001 682 33 311 866 Number of diluted shares 36 951 749 36 680 990In H1’23 the amount of other operating income and expenses was not material whereas the Group recorded a non-recurring income of 9 million Euros in H1’22 mainly reflecting the full reversal of an impairment loss related to Singapore industrial building which had been recognized in FY’16. Consequently  the operating income reached 110 million Euros in H1’23  up 30% compared to 85 million Euros recorded in H1’22.The net financial result was a loss of 2 million Euros in H1’23 compared to a loss of 5 million Euros in H1’22. On the one hand  the Group benefited from a 2 million Euros decrease in net financial expenses mostly related to the conversion of OCEANEs 2023 bonds in October 2021. On the other hand  the Group recorded a net financial income of 4 million Euros in H1’23 compared to a gain of 3 million Euros recorded in H1’22.Income tax expense amounted to 13 million Euros in H1’23 compared to 6 million Euros in H1’22.

In H1’22  net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations amounted to 11 million Euros.In total  including a 26 million Euros positive impact of exchange rate fluctuations  net cash generated by continuing operations reached 15 million Euros in H1’23 compared to a cash outflow of 53 million Euros in H1’22.Overall  Soitec further increased its cash position  which went up from 728 million Euros on March 31st  2022  to 743 million Euros on September 30th  2022.Sound balance sheet maintainedThanks to the strong performance achieved in H1’23  Soitec has maintained a strong balance sheet.Property  plant and equipment increased by a net amount of 86 million Euros in H1’23 as a result of further industrial investments in Bernin and Singapore.Shareholders’ equity increased by 138 million Euros in H1’23 to 1 181 million Euros on September 30th  2022  mainly thanks to the net profit generated during the period.Financial debt stood at 630 million Euros on September 30th  2022. This represents a 44 million Euros increase compared to March 31st  2022  mainly reflecting a 48 million Euros mark-to-market increase of financial derivatives related to currency hedging  4 million Euros interests related to OCEANEs 2025 bonds  partially offset by a 9 million Euros repayment of bank loans in Singapore.Higher financial debt combined with the 15 million Euros increase in cash recorded in H1’23 led to a 29 million Euros decrease in positive net cash position5  from 142 million Euros on March 31st  2022  to 113 million Euros on September 30th  2022. Excluding the change in the fair value of financial derivatives related to hedging  the Group net cash position increased by 19 million Euros.FY’23 Outlook confirmedSoitec still expects FY’23 revenue growth to reach around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter. Growth will continue to be driven by an increase in sales in each of the Group’s three end markets  as Soitec expects to continue benefiting from the 5G deployment  from an increase of the automotive market as well as from sustained market trends for smart devices.Soitec still expects FY’23 EBITDA1 margin2 to reach around 36% notably thanks to a strong operating leverage driven by higher volumes. Soitec expects its industrial performance to remain strong despite higher bulk material and energy prices.In addition  Soitec expects FY’23 net cash out related to capital expenditure to reach around 260 million Euros  essentially reflecting capacity investments to support first acquisitions of SiC tools (150 & 200-mm) in Bernin IV  300-mm SOI refresh capacity in Bernin IV and further 300-mm SOI capacity increase in its Singapore facility  including both refresh and epitaxy capacity.Key events of H1’23CEA  Soitec  GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics to advance next generation FD-SOI roadmap for automotive  IoT and mobile applicationsOn April 8th  2022  leading semiconductor players CEA  Soitec  GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics announced a new collaboration in which they intend to jointly define the industry’s next generation roadmap for FD-SOI technology.

Lymphocytes and Acquired or Congenital Immunodeficiency Disorders: Delineating Immunity from Mice to HumansAbstract number: 608Session date and time: Monday  December 12  2022 from 10:30AM – 12:30PM CSTPresentation date and time: Monday  December 12  2022 at 10:45AM CSTLocation: Room: Ernest N. Morial Convention Center  278-282About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3Kδ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Long-term efficacy and safety findings showed that FINTEPLA  when added to a patient's current anti-epileptic treatment regimen for seizures associated with LGS  was effective in reducing the frequency of multiple seizure types and was generally well tolerated during a median treatment duration of 364 days.1 Study participants experienced a sustained reduction in the frequency of motor seizures including those that resulted in a drop or fall like generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS)  secondary GTCS  focal to bilateral tonic-clonic  tonic seizures  atonic seizures  and tonic-atonic seizures.1LGS is a severe childhood-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by drug-resistant seizures with high morbidity3 as well as serious impairment of neurodevelopmental  cognitive  and motor functions.4 LGS has far-reaching effects beyond seizures  including issues with communication  psychiatric symptoms  sleep  behavioral challenges  and mobility.5 LGS affects 30 000 to 50 000 people in the U.S.6""This long-term safety and efficacy interim analysis of adjunctive FINTEPLA showed that patients with LGS experienced sustained  clinically meaningful reductions in the frequency of seizures associated with a drop  with a particularly robust reduction in the frequency of GTCS  which are associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado  and principal investigator of the study. ""Given the sustained efficacy and tolerability of FINTEPLA over time  this medication could be an important long-term therapeutic option for patients with LGS  who are highly treatment-resistant  and could be an especially important therapeutic option for LGS patients who experience a high burden of GTCS.""Results of the OLE study showed the median percentage change in monthly frequency of seizures associated with a drop from pre-randomized baseline was -28.6% over the entire OLE (P<0.0001) and -50.5% at month 15 (P<0.0001). Nearly one-third of patients (31.1%) experienced a clinically meaningful 50% or greater reduction in the percentage of seizures associated with a drop  including 11.6% of patients who demonstrated a profound 75% or greater reduction. The median percentage change in the frequency of all motor seizures was 45.9% (P=0.0038).1 GTCS and tonic seizures were most responsive to LGS treatment with FINTEPLA.1 Over the entire OLE  the median percentage change in GTCS from pre-randomized baseline was -48.8% (P<0.0001)  and  over time  ranged from -56.4% at Month 7-9 (P<0.0001) to -79.1% at Month 13-15 (P<0.0001).1 The median percentage change in tonic seizures was -35.8% over the entire OLE (P<0.0001) and  over time  ranged from -37.1% at Month 4-6 (P<0.0001) to -62.6% at Month 13-15 (P<0.0001).1Within the study  the authors note the reason these data are compelling is because GTCS are commonly observed in patients with LGS.1 Moreover  GTCS may result in bodily injury.7 8 Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for people living with LGS  and patients with a history of GTCS have an estimated 10-fold greater risk of SUDEP.9 10The OLE study also demonstrated that FINTEPLA was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed in the OLE were decreased appetite  fatigue  nasopharyngitis  and seizure. The cardiovascular safety in this study further corroborates the FINTEPLA safety profiles; no cases of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension were observed.""This open label extension provides strong evidence that FINTEPLA is effective in reducing multiple seizure types associated with LGS  particularly more severe generalized seizures for up to 15 months "" said Brad Chapman  U.S. Head of Epilepsy and Rare Syndromes  UCB. ""We are pleased to be able to offer FINTEPLA to those living with and caring for people with LGS to help reduce the impact of this devastating disease and potentially  improve the quality of life for those living with LGS.""Additional results of the OLE found that approximately one-third of investigators (37.6%) and caregivers (35.2%) rated their patients as ""Much Improved"" or ""Very Much Improved"" on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale.1FINTEPLA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of LGS in patients 2 years of age and older in March 2022 and for the treatment of Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients 2 years of age and older in June 2020. UCB acquired Zogenix  Inc. and FINTEPLA in March 2022.Study DesignAs of October 19  2020  247 eligible patients entered the OLE study after the patients completed participation in the multi-center  double-blind  parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial that enrolled children and adults  age 2 to 35 years  with a confirmed LGS diagnosis who were using stable anti-seizure medication regimens at 65 study sites in North America  Europe  and Australia. In that randomized trial  a total of 263 patients were assigned to receive either FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day (n=87) or FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day (n=89) or placebo (n=87). After titration (2-week period)  patients were maintained on their randomized dose for 12 additional weeks.A total of 247 eligible patients with LGS who completed that 14-week randomized Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled in the OLE study. Patients were eligible to enroll if they had not experienced any of the following at the end of the Phase 3 clinical trial: clinically meaningful worsening of seizures  clinically significant laboratory findings  or weight loss greater than 15% during the titration and maintenance period that failed to stabilize. The median age of the patients was 14.3 years. All patients were maintained on a stable antiseizure medication regimen of concomitant antiseizure medications during the entire OLE treatment period  and 88.3% received two to four concomitant antiseizure medications.All patients in the OLE were initially started on FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day. After one month  they were flexibly titrated to effectiveness and tolerability  up to a maximum of 0.7 mg/kg/day  which were assessed at three-month intervals. They were treated with FINTEPLA for a median treatment duration of 364 days.The Phase 3 clinical trial and OLE study were both sponsored by Zogenix  Inc.  now part of UCB. The trial is still ongoing.About FINTEPLA ® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved in the U.S.  Europe  and in Japan  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. FINTEPLA is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.2In the U.S.  FINTEPLA is available through a restricted distribution program  called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGE2FINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring : Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:U.S. Brand and Media RelationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359[email protected]Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414[email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREMTM (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREM.Warnings and PrecautionsHypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred.

Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM. Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin  muscle and internal organs. • The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with: o Chronic  severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2)  or o Acute kidney injury. • Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g. age > 60 years  hypertension  diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing. • For patients at highest risk for NSF  do not exceed the recommended DOTAREM dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to any re-administration.INDICATIONS AND USAGEDOTAREM® (gadoterate meglumine) injection is a prescription gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial)  spine and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients (including term neonates) to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.CONTRAINDICATIONSHistory of clinically important hypersensitivity reactions to DOTAREM.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with DOTAREM  involving cardiovascular  respiratory  and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of DOTAREM administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment.Before DOTAREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to DOTAREM.Administer DOTAREM only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions  including personnel trained in resuscitation.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. The highest concentrations have been identified in the bone  followed by brain  skin  kidney  liver and spleen. The duration of retention also varies by tissue  and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs.Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention.Acute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of DOTAREM. Extravasation into tissues during DOTAREM administration may result in tissue irritation.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions associated with DOTAREM in clinical trials were nausea  headache  injection site pain  injection site coldness and rash.Serious adverse reactions in the Postmarketing experience have been reported with DOTAREM. These serious adverse reactions include but are not limited to: arrhythmia  cardiac arrest  respiratory arrest  pharyngeal edema  laryngospasm  bronchospasm  coma and convulsion.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSPregnancy : GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.11.016Scientists at the Phoenix-based Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)  part of City of Hope  and EXACT Therapeutics AS (""EXACT-Tx""  Euronext Growth: EXTX)  a Norwegian clinical stage precision health company  today report that the ultrasound based Acoustic Cluster Therapy (ACT) significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of standard care therapies in a preclinical model for pancreatic cancer.The study  titled ""Effect of Acoustic Cluster Therapy combined with chemotherapy in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer "" was published in the Journal of Controlled Release.The ACT technology is based on microclusters of microbubble-microdroplets and when sonicated  vaporization of the microdroplets lead to the formation of larger ACT bubbles. The formation and subsequent oscillation of the ACT bubbles in the microvasculature produces mechanical bioeffects that enhance drug delivery and efficacy.TGen has evaluated the effectiveness of the technology in a preclinical pancreatic cancer model  and the results demonstrated that ACT significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of two cornerstone treatment regimens in the management of pancreatic cancer. The best effect was seen when drug administration preceded the ACT treatment  but interestingly the anti-tumor effect was almost maintained when the drugs were administered after ACT-treatment was finalized.Previous studies have shown that the main effect of ACT is not on the drug itself  but rather affects the vasculature and tumor microenvironment to facilitate drug delivery and therapeutic response.""Our study demonstrates that ACT can significantly improve the effect of two standard of care chemotherapeutic regimens in a patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenograft model. The ACT treatment resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth inhibition and a 7.2 times higher probability of having a complete remission of the tumor compared to the chemotherapeutics alone "" said Haiyong Han  Ph.D.  a Professor in TGen's Molecular Medicine Division and the study's senior author.This year  more than 62 000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer  and nearly 50 000 will die from this disease  making it the third leading cause of cancer-related death. With the best treatments currently available  the median survival for patients with advanced disease is about 10 months following diagnosis  and the 5-year survival rate is less than 9 percent of all patients.""Pancreatic cancer is known to be notoriously resistant to treatment  in part because of poor drug delivery."" said Daniel Von Hoff  M.D.  TGen's Distinguished Professor and one of the nation's leading experts in pancreatic cancer. ""The results from the study are some of the most encouraging ones we have seen in preclinical models for pancreatic cancer  and we look forward to being involved in the further development of this promising technology.""Per Walday  Ph.D.  CEO of EXACT-Tx  said  ""We are very pleased to announce the publication of these encouraging results from our collaboration with the prestigious Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix  Arizona. These data are produced in a model with patient-derived material  which more closely resembles the tumor tissue characteristics of pancreatic cancer in man compared to cell-line based models.""""The results further underpin the established potential of ACT to enhance standard of care treatments for difficult to treat cancers and we look forward to progressing our clinical development program in this area.""More information: Serina Ng et al  Effect of acoustic cluster therapy (ACT®) combined with chemotherapy in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model of pancreatic cancer  Journal of Controlled Release (2022).

The only source of capital suited to uncertain cashflows with uncertain timings is equity  in particular public equity  because equity doesn’t have a definite time horizon.”The Euronext equity listing head said private equity firms  who were buying tech firms in the low interest rate environment that ended last year  are now less competitive than they once were.“When you need to scale  private equity may have deep pockets but you don’t have the certain cashflows they need to finance a leveraged buy-out. So when you need to scale a disruptive business with uncertain outcomes  it’s the public equity markets that can mobilise the amount of capital for that level of risk ” Narminio said.His comments came ahead of the Euronext Tech Leaders in Paris focused on developing a more vibrant European tech segment.And Narminio said that Euronext is a strong choice for European firms looking to list because of its growing network of exchanges and investors.“Euronext now consolidates seven listing venues with 1900 equity issuers from Oslo  Dublin  Amsterdam  Paris  Brussels  Milan and Lisbon.”Euronext’s 2021 acquisition of Borsa Italiana from LSE Group has made it a global force but also important is the work the exchange group has done behind the scenes.“Those venues have a common trading system and a common technology platform so the entry point doesn’t really matter. By listing on Euronext  you have access to the same pool of investors and quality of liquidity  that’s a powerful model because the seven listing venues on aggregate are roughly twice the size of the LSE and three times the size of Deutsche Boerse. Any European firm with global ambitions to access global flows of capital finds its home at Euronext.”And Euronext was keen to consider the relative merits of listing in Europe for a firm based in that bloc  compared to listing on Nasdaq  the US home of tech listings.Narminio said: “For those companies that have roots in Europe and global ambitions  Euronext is a global platform. When you list in the US  90% of your investors are in the US. When you list on Euronext  60% of your investors are in Europe  30% in the US and 10% from the rest of the world.""He added: “That means that for European firms  you have shareholders that understand your environment  the culture you operate in and regulatory constraints  rather than being a European firm in the US which can create complications for the management.”",positive,0.66,0.09,0.25,mixed,0.15,0.1,0.75,True,English,"['Euronext', 'listings', 'challenging', 'The Euronext equity listing head', 'vibrant European tech segment', 'low interest rate environment', 'Euronext Tech Leaders conference', 'Rising interest rates', 'higher interest rates', 'definite time horizon', 'common trading system', 'unpredictable future cashflows', 'disruptive business models', 'public equity markets', 'seven listing venues', 'common technology platform', 'private equity firms', 'private equity investors', 'global platform', '1900 equity issuers', 'European firms', 'technology firms', 'stock market', 'uncertain cashflows', 'uncertain timings', 'deep pockets', 'leveraged buy-out', 'uncertain outcomes', 'strong choice', 'growing network', 'Borsa Italiana', 'global force', 'exchange group', 'entry point', 'same pool', 'powerful model', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'global ambitions', 'global flows', 'relative merits', 'regulatory constraints', 'equity listings', 'LSE Group', 'Aurelien Narminio', 'US home', 'Wednesday', 'funding', 'acquisition', 'ventures', 'source', 'capital', 'particular', 'amount', 'level', 'risk', 'comments', 'Paris', 'exchanges', 'Oslo', 'Dublin', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'scenes', 'access', 'quality', 'liquidity', 'aggregate', 'size', 'bloc', 'Nasdaq', 'companies', 'roots', 'world', 'shareholders', 'culture', 'complications', 'management']",2022-11-23,2022-11-23,globalinvestorgroup.com

In light of this  the board of directors has concluded that the listing of the Company's shares should be transferred from the Main List of the Oslo Stock Exchange to Euronext Growth Oslo. Accordingly  Awilco Drilling has today initiated a process towards an admission of its shares to trading on Euronext Growth Oslo. The transfer of the listing is expected to be completed during December 2022. At the same time  Awilco Drilling convenes an extraordinary general meeting to authorize an application for a de-listing from the Main List of the Oslo Stock Exchange. The extraordinary general meeting will be held on 8 December 2022 at 12:00 noon (UK time). Notice for the extraordinary general meeting is hereby attached. Given the changes in the nature of the Company's operations  a new article in the Company’s Articles of Association is proposed that gives the Board authority to change the Company’s name if and when deemed appropriate. To give the Company flexibility to finance the arbitration proceedings against Keppel FELS  the board of directors also ask the general meeting to approve a consolidation of the existing shares  where every 100 ordinary shares of £0.0065 each in the capital of the Company will be consolidated into one ordinary share of £0.65  as well as an authorisation to increase the Company's share capital by GBP 7 000 000  which will permit the issuance of up to 10 769 231 new shares after the consolidation.Aberdeen  23 November 2022For further information please contact:Eric Jacobs  CEOPhone: +44 1224 737900Cathrine Haavind  Investor RelationsPhone: +47 93 42 84 64Email: ch@awilcodrilling.comThis information is subject of the disclosure requirements pursuant to section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.Attachment",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,True,English,"['Awilco Drilling PLC', 'Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Change', 'listing', 'Notice', 'Norwegian Securities Trading Act', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'Awilco Drilling Plc', 'one ordinary share', '100 ordinary shares', 'arbitration proceedings', 'Keppel FELS', 'Main List', 'same time', 'UK time', 'new article', 'share capital', 'Eric Jacobs', 'Cathrine Haavind', 'Investor Relations', 'disclosure requirements', 'existing shares', '10,769,231 new shares', 'Company flexibility', 'sale', 'WilHunter', 'WilPhoenix', 'operations', 'light', 'board', 'directors', 'listing', 'process', 'transfer', 'December', 'application', '12:00 noon', 'Notice', 'changes', 'nature', 'Articles', 'Association', 'authority', 'name', 'consolidation', 'authorisation', 'GBP', 'issuance', 'Aberdeen', '23 November', 'information', 'CEO', 'Phone', 'Email', 'section', 'Attachment']",2022-11-23,2022-11-23,yahoo.com
