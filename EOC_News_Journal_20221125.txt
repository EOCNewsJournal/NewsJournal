This does not mean that a person who accepts the Tender Offer (the ""Participant"") will be regarded as a customer of Nordea as a result of such acceptance. A Participant will be regarded as a customer only if Nordea has provided advice to the Participant or has otherwise contacted the Participant personally regarding the Tender Offer. If the Participant is not regarded as a customer  the investor protection rules under the Finnish Act on Investment Services (747/2012  as amended) will not apply to the acceptance. This means  among other things  that neither the so-called customer categorization nor the so-called appropriateness test will be performed with respect to the Tender Offer. Each Participant is therefore responsible for ensuring that it has sufficient experience and knowledge to understand the risks associated with the Tender Offer.Important Information regarding NID and LEIAccording to Directive 2014/65/ EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II)  all investors must have a global identification code from 3 January 2018  in order to carry out a securities transaction. These requirements require legal entities to apply for registration of a Legal Entity Identifier (""LEI"") code  and natural persons need to state their NID (National ID or National Client Identifier) when accepting the Tender Offer. Each person's legal status determines whether a LEI code or NID number is required and the book-entry account operator may be prevented from performing the transaction to any person if LEI or NID number is not provided. Legal persons who need to obtain a LEI code can contact the relevant authority or one of the suppliers available on the market. Those who intend to accept the Tender Offer are encouraged to apply for registration of a LEI code (legal persons) or to acquire their NID number (natural persons) well in advance  as this information is required in the acceptance at the time of submission.Information about Processing of Personal DataShareholders who accept the Tender Offer will submit personal data  such as name  address and social security number  to Nordea  which is the controller for the processing.

A Participant will be regarded as a customer only if Nordea has provided advice to the Participant or has otherwise contacted the Participant personally regarding the Tender Offer. If the Participant is not regarded as a customer  the investor protection rules under the Finnish Act on Investment Services (747/2012  as amended) will not apply to the acceptance.

These requirements require legal entities to apply for registration of a Legal Entity Identifier (""LEI"") code  and natural persons need to state their NID (National ID or National Client Identifier) when accepting the Tender Offer. Each person's legal status determines whether a LEI code or NID number is required and the book-entry account operator may be prevented from performing the transaction to any person if LEI or NID number is not provided. Legal persons who need to obtain a LEI code can contact the relevant authority or one of the suppliers available on the market. Those who intend to accept the Tender Offer are encouraged to apply for registration of a LEI code (legal persons) or to acquire their NID number (natural persons) well in advance  as this information is required in the acceptance at the time of submission.Information about Processing of Personal DataShareholders who accept the Tender Offer will submit personal data  such as name  address and social security number  to Nordea  which is the controller for the processing.

In such case  the Offeror will make public its Compensation Obligation without delay and pay the difference between the consideration paid in such an acquisition on more favourable terms and the Offer Price within one (1) month of the date when the Compensation Obligation arose for those shareholders that have accepted the Tender Offer.However  according to Chapter 11  Section 25  Subsection 5 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act  the Compensation Obligation will not be triggered in case the payment of a higher price than the Offer Price is based on an arbitral award pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act  provided that the Offeror or any party referred to in Chapter 11  Section 5 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act has not offered to acquire Shares on terms that are more favourable than those of the Tender Offer before or during the arbitral proceedings.Acceptance Procedure of the Tender OfferThe Tender Offer may be accepted by a shareholder registered during the Offer Period in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy (""Euroclear Finland"")  with the exception of Caverion and its subsidiaries. The Tender Offer must be accepted separately for each book-entry account. A shareholder of Caverion submitting an acceptance must have a cash account with a financial institution operating in Finland or abroad (see also ""- Terms of Payment and Settlement"" and ""Restrictions and Important Information""). Shareholders may only approve the Tender Offer unconditionally and for all Shares that are held on the book-entry accounts mentioned in the acceptance at the time of the execution of the transaction with respect to the Shares of such shareholder. Acceptances submitted during the Offer Period are valid also until the expiration of an extended or discontinued extended Offer Period  if any.Most Finnish account operators will send a notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland. Shareholders of Caverion who do not receive such instructions from their account operator or asset manager should first contact their account operator or asset manager and can subsequently contact Nordea Bank Abp (""Nordea"") by sending an email to [email protected]  where such shareholders of Caverion can receive information on submitting their acceptance of the Tender Offer. Please note  however  that Nordea will not be engaging in communications relating to the Tender Offer with shareholders located within the United States. Shareholders who are located within the United States may contact their brokers for necessary information.Those shareholders of Caverion whose Shares are nominee-registered  and who wish to accept the Tender Offer  must effect such acceptance in accordance with the instructions given by the custodian of the nominee-registered shareholders. The Offeror will not send an acceptance form or any other documents related to the Tender Offer to these shareholders of Caverion.If the Shares held by a shareholder are pledged or otherwise subject to restrictions that prevent or limit the acceptance  the acceptance of the Tender Offer may require the consent of the pledgee or other beneficiary of a such restriction. If so  acquiring this consent is the responsibility of the relevant shareholder of Caverion. Such consent must be delivered in writing to the account operator.A shareholder of Caverion who wishes to accept the Tender Offer must submit the properly completed and duly executed acceptance to the account operator managing the shareholder's book-entry account in accordance with the instructions and within the time period set by the account operator  which may be prior to the expiry of the Offer Period. The Offeror reserves the right to reject or approve  in its sole discretion  any acceptances that have been submitted in an incorrect or incomplete manner.Any acceptance must be submitted in such a manner that it will be received within the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued extended Offer Period) taking into account  however  the instructions given by the relevant account operator. In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the acceptance must be submitted so that it is received during the Subsequent Offer Period  subject to and in accordance with the instructions of the relevant account operator. The account operator may request the receipt of acceptances prior to the expiration of the Offer Period and/or Subsequent Offer Period. Shareholders of Caverion submit acceptances at their own risk. Any acceptance will be considered as submitted only when an account operator has actually received it. The Offeror reserves the right to reject or approve  in its sole discretion  any acceptance submitted outside the Offer Period (or any Subsequent Offer Period  as applicable) or in an incorrect or incomplete manner.A shareholder who has validly accepted the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer may not sell or otherwise transfer his/her tendered Shares. By accepting the Tender Offer  the shareholders authorise their account operator  Nordea or a party appointed by Nordea to enter into their book-entry account a sales reservation or a restriction on the right of disposal in the manner set out in ""- Technical Completion of the Tender Offer"" below after the shareholder has delivered the acceptance with respect to the Shares. Furthermore  the shareholders of Caverion that accept the Tender Offer authorise their account operator  Nordea or a party appointed by Nordea to perform necessary entries and undertake any other measures needed for the technical execution of the Tender Offer  and to sell all the Shares held by the shareholder of Caverion at the time of the execution of trades under the Tender Offer to the Offeror in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. In connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer or the settlement thereof  the sales reservation or the restriction on the right of disposal will be removed and the Offer Price will be transferred to the relevant shareholders of Caverion.By accepting the Tender Offer  the accepting shareholder authorises his/her depository participant to disclose the necessary personal data  the number of his/her book-entry account and the details of the acceptance to the parties involved in the order or the execution of the order and settlement of the Shares.Right of Withdrawal of AcceptanceAn acceptance of the Tender Offer may be withdrawn by a shareholder of Caverion at any time before the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued extended Offer Period) until the Offeror has announced that all Conditions to Completion have been fulfilled or waived by the Offeror  that is  the Offeror has declared the Tender Offer unconditional. After such announcement  the Shares already tendered may not be withdrawn  except in the event that a third party announces a competing public tender offer for the Shares before the execution of the completion trades of the Shares as set out under ""- Completion of the Tender Offer"" below.A valid withdrawal of an acceptance of the Tender Offer requires that a withdrawal notification is submitted in writing to the account operator to whom the original acceptance was submitted.For nominee-registered Shares  the shareholders must request the relevant custodian of the nominee-registered shareholder to execute a withdrawal notification.If a shareholder of Caverion validly withdraws an acceptance of the Tender Offer  the sales reservation or the restriction on the right of disposal with respect to Shares will be removed within three (3) Finnish banking days of the receipt of a withdrawal notification.A shareholder of Caverion who has validly withdrawn its acceptance of the Tender Offer may accept the Tender Offer again during the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued extended Offer Period) by following the procedure set out under ""- Acceptance Procedure of the Tender Offer"" above.A shareholder of Caverion who withdraws its acceptance of the Tender Offer is obligated to pay any fees that the account operator operating the relevant book-entry account or the custodial nominee of a nominee-registered holding may collect for the withdrawal. In accordance with the FIN-FSA Regulations and Guidelines  if a competing offer has been announced during the Offer Period and the completion of the Tender Offer has not taken place  neither the Offeror nor Nordea (in its capacity as arranger) will charge the shareholders for validly withdrawing their acceptance in such a situation.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the acceptance of the Tender Offer will be binding and cannot be withdrawn  unless otherwise provided under mandatory law.Technical Completion of the Tender OfferWhen an account operator has received the properly completed and duly executed acceptance or acceptance otherwise approved by the Offeror with respect to the Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer  the account operator will enter a sales reservation or a restriction on the right of disposal into the relevant shareholder's book-entry account. In connection with the completion trade of the Tender Offer or the settlement thereof  the sales reservation or the restriction on the right of disposal will be removed and the Offer Price will be paid to the relevant shareholder.Announcement of the Result of the Tender OfferThe preliminary result of the Tender Offer will be announced on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued extended Offer Period).

The final result of the Tender Offer will be announced on or about the fourth (4th) Finnish banking day following the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued extended Offer Period) at the latest. In connection with the announcement of the final result  the percentage of the Shares that have been validly tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer  and that have not been validly withdrawn  will be confirmed.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the Offeror will announce the initial percentage of the Shares validly tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period and the final percentage on or about the third (3rd) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period.Completion of the Tender OfferThe completion trades of the Tender Offer will be executed with respect to all of those Shares of Caverion that have been validly tendered  and not validly withdrawn  into the Tender Offer no later than on the fifteenth (15th) Finnish banking day following the announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer (the ""Completion Date""). If possible  the completion trades of the Shares will be executed on Nasdaq Helsinki  provided that such execution is allowed under the rules applied to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki. Otherwise  the completion trades will be made outside Nasdaq Helsinki. The completion trades of the Shares will be settled on the Completion Date or on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the Completion Date (the ""Settlement Date"").Terms of Payment and SettlementThe Offer Price will be paid on the Settlement Date to each shareholder of Caverion who has validly accepted  and not validly withdrawn  the Tender Offer into the management account of the shareholder's book-entry account. In any case  the Offer Price will not be paid to a bank account situated in Australia  Canada  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China  Japan  New Zealand or South Africa or any other jurisdiction where the Tender Offer is not being made (see section ""Restrictions and Important Information""). If the management account of a shareholder of Caverion is with a different financial institution than the applicable book-entry account  the Offer Price will be paid into such cash account approximately two (2) Finnish banking days later in accordance with the schedule for payment transactions between financial institutions.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the Offeror will in connection with the announcement thereof announce the terms of payment and settlement for the Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period. The completion trades with respect to Shares validly tendered and accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer during the Subsequent Offer Period will  however  be executed within not more than two (2) week intervals.The Offeror reserves the right to postpone the payment of the Offer Price if payment is prevented or suspended due to a force majeure event  but will immediately effect such payment once the force majeure event preventing or suspending payment is resolved.If all the Conditions to Completion are not met and the Offeror does not waive such conditions or extend the Offer Period  the Tender Offer will expire  and no consideration will be paid for the tendered Shares.Transfer of OwnershipTitle to the Shares in respect of which the Tender Offer has been validly accepted  and not validly withdrawn  will pass to the Offeror on the Settlement Date against the payment of the Offer Price by the Offeror to the tendering shareholder. In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  title to the Shares in respect of which the Tender Offer has been validly accepted during a Subsequent Offer Period will pass to the Offeror on the relevant settlement date against the payment of the Offer Price by the Offeror to the tendering shareholder.Transfer Tax and Other PaymentsThe Offeror will pay any transfer tax that may be charged in Finland in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer.Fees charged by account operators  asset managers  nominees or any other person for the release of collateral or the revoking of any other restrictions preventing the sale of the Shares  will be borne by each relevant shareholder of Caverion.

Each shareholder is urged to consult with an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Tender Offer.Other MattersThis Tender Offer Document and the Tender Offer are governed by Finnish law. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with the Tender Offer will be settled by a court of competent jurisdiction in Finland.The Offeror reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer in accordance with Chapter 11  Section 15 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act. Should the FIN-FSA issue an order regarding an extension of the Offer Period  the Offeror reserves the right to decide upon the withdrawal of the Tender Offer in accordance with Chapter 11  Section 12 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.Should a competing tender offer be published by a third party during the Offer Period  the Offeror reserves the right  as stipulated in Chapter 11  Section 17 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act  to (i) decide upon an extension of the Offer Period; (ii) decide upon an amendment of the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer; and (iii) decide  during the Offer Period  but before the expiration of the competing offer  to let the Tender Offer lapse. The Offeror will decide on all other matters related to the Tender Offer  subject to applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of the Combination Agreement.Other InformationNordea acts as arranger outside the United States in relation to the Tender Offer  which means that it performs certain administrative services relating to the Tender Offer. This does not mean that a person who accepts the Tender Offer (the ""Participant"") will be regarded as a customer of Nordea as a result of such acceptance. A Participant will be regarded as a customer only if Nordea has provided advice to the Participant or has otherwise contacted the Participant personally regarding the Tender Offer. If the Participant is not regarded as a customer  the investor protection rules under the Finnish Act on Investment Services (747/2012  as amended) will not apply to the acceptance. This means  among other things  that neither the so-called customer categorization nor the so-called appropriateness test will be performed with respect to the Tender Offer. Each Participant is therefore responsible for ensuring that it has sufficient experience and knowledge to understand the risks associated with the Tender Offer.Important Information regarding NID and LEIAccording to Directive 2014/65/ EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II)  all investors must have a global identification code from 3 January 2018  in order to carry out a securities transaction. These requirements require legal entities to apply for registration of a Legal Entity Identifier (""LEI"") code  and natural persons need to state their NID (National ID or National Client Identifier) when accepting the Tender Offer. Each person's legal status determines whether a LEI code or NID number is required and the book-entry account operator may be prevented from performing the transaction to any person if LEI or NID number is not provided. Legal persons who need to obtain a LEI code can contact the relevant authority or one of the suppliers available on the market. Those who intend to accept the Tender Offer are encouraged to apply for registration of a LEI code (legal persons) or to acquire their NID number (natural persons) well in advance  as this information is required in the acceptance at the time of submission.Information about Processing of Personal DataShareholders who accept the Tender Offer will submit personal data  such as name  address and social security number  to Nordea  which is the controller for the processing. Personal data provided to Nordea will be processed in data systems to the extent required to administer the Tender Offer. Personal data obtained from sources other than the customer may also be processed. Personal data may also be processed in the data systems of companies with which Nordea cooperates and it may be disclosed to the Offeror and the members of the Consortium to the extent necessary for administering the Tender Offer. Address details may be obtained by Nordea through an automatic procedure executed by Euroclear Finland.

13690,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veon-announces-launch-scheme-arrangement-123100301.html,VEON announces launch of scheme of arrangement to extend 2023 Notes maturities,Amsterdam  Netherlands  24 November 2022 13:30 ‚Äì VEON Ltd. (Nasdaq: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or  together with its subsidiaries  the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù) ...,"VEON Ltd.Amsterdam  Netherlands  24 November 2022 13:30 ‚Äì VEON Ltd. (Nasdaq: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or  together with its subsidiaries  the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù) and VEON Holdings B.V. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announced the launch of a scheme of arrangement in England (the ‚ÄúScheme‚Äù) via the issuance of a Practice Statement Letter to extend the maturity of the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and 7.25% notes due April 2023 issued by the Company (together  the ‚Äú2023 Notes‚Äù) by eight months from their respective maturity dates.Rationale for the AmendmentsThe Scheme launched by the Company today proposes an eight-month extension to the respective maturity dates of the 2023 Notes  together with certain other amendments to the terms of the 2023 Notes and related trust deeds as further outlined in this announcement.The Scheme represents the culmination of six months of discussions between the Group and its advisers during which they have considered multiple different potential transaction structures. If the status quo were to continue  the options available to it would be significantly constrained by the current and evolving political situation  international sanctions laws and Russian regulations. In these circumstances  the Group has concluded that a short-term extension of the maturity of the 2023 Notes represents the best option available to the Group and its stakeholders  as it will provide the Group with additional time to pursue a number of strategic transactions.The Amendments will allow the Group time to conclude the agreed sale of its Russian subsidiary  PJSC VimpelCom (‚ÄúVimpelCom‚Äù)  as announced separately earlier today ( https://www.veon.com/media/media-releases/2022/veon-ltd-press-release-24-11-2022/ ) (the ‚ÄúVimpelCom Disposal‚Äù)  which is expected to be completed in early June 2023 (subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals  any required consent from VEON creditors and satisfaction of customary closing conditions). Under the sale agreement for the VimpelCom Disposal  VEON will receive total consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately USD 2.1 billion1). Subject to receipt of the necessary licenses and/or approval from competent sanctions authorities  it is expected that the total consideration will be paid primarily by VimpelCom taking on and discharging certain notes issued by the Company  thus significantly deleveraging VEON‚Äôs consolidated balance sheet. The Group considers that the VimpelCom Disposal represents the single-most material deleveraging action available to the Group  which will at the same time increase the prospect of future access to international debt capital markets  which are currently not available to the Group.Story continuesThe Amendments  together with the deleveraging described above  are also expected to curtail the inefficient use of cash which would result from the payments on the Russian National Settlement Depository (the ‚ÄúNSD‚Äù) held portion of the 2023 Notes being trapped in the international clearing systems and the principal amount of the 2023 Notes held through Russian depositaries being repaid by both the Company and VimpelCom due to the European Union‚Äôs sanctions targeting the NSD  and possibly in response to United States and United Kingdom sanctions laws and regulations targeting Russia more broadly  as further described below. It will also provide short term stability and further optionality to implement the asset monetization strategy underpinning VEON‚Äôs objectives to further reduce leverage and maximize its stakeholders‚Äô returns.The Scheme launched by the Company today proposes the following changes with respect to the 2023 Notes (together  the ‚ÄúAmendments‚Äù):an eight-month extension of the respective maturity dates of the February 2023 Notes and April 2023 Notes to October 2023 and December 2023 respectively;an amendment of the consent and quorum thresholds for ordinary matters and Reserved Matters (as defined in the 2023 Notes trust deeds) 2 and excluding beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes who are the target of applicable sanctions laws or regulations that prohibit them from dealing with the 2023 Notes from counting in the consent and quorum thresholds 3 ; andpayment of an amendment fee of 75bps payable on the 2023 Notes outstanding on their respective amended maturity dates.Subject to the Amendments being successfully implemented  and completion of the VimpelCom Disposal  the Group currently intends to use excess liquidity to redeem financial liabilities to deleverage and reduce its interest obligations.BackgroundOver the past nine months  the Group has successfully strengthened its liquidity position  and this will remain a key priority in the near term. However  despite the resilient performance of its underlying operating companies  which are considered largely self-sustaining  VEON‚Äôs ability to upstream cash for debt service is currently impaired by currency and capital controls in two of its major markets (Ukraine and Russia) and other geopolitical/FX pressures affecting emerging markets generally  including the countries in which the Group has operations.In addition  the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and developments since February 2022 with respect to sanctions laws and regulations have resulted in unprecedented challenges for VEON  limiting access to the international debt capital markets in which VEON has traditionally refinanced maturing debt and so hampering its ability to refinance indebtedness. Without a change in the status quo  the situation is likely to remain challenging  including as a result of the withdrawal of VEON‚Äôs credit ratings by rating agencies due to VEON‚Äôs current exposure to Russia.Blocking of NSD PaymentsAs a result of sanctions laws and regulations imposed on Russia  cash payments of both interest and principal amounts that either have already been made or will be made by the Company under its various RUB and USD notes (the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù) through the international clearing systems do not reach the beneficial owners of the Notes that are held directly or indirectly (through the chain of Russian depositaries) via the NSD (such owners  the ‚ÄúNSD Noteholders‚Äù). VEON understands that such cash payments are instead being blocked by the international clearing systems  as the international clearing systems are not making payments to the NSD  due to the European Union‚Äôs targeting of the NSD  and possibly in response to United States and United Kingdom sanctions laws and regulations targeting Russia more broadly.Given the Company believes a significant proportion of NSD Noteholders are among the holders of the 2023 Notes (estimated to represent c. 60% of the 2023 Notes and c. 50% of all Notes maturing through 20274)  any maturity payments made by the Company in respect of the 2023 Notes on their respective maturity dates are expected to result in an inefficient use of material sums of liquidity  due to the cash remaining blocked in the international clearing systems.Russian Regulatory BackdropOn 5 July 2022  the President of the Russian Federation issued Decree 430  which states that ‚ÄúRussian legal entities with obligations related to Eurobonds are required to ensure the fulfilment of obligations to holders of Eurobonds whose rights are recorded by Russian depositaries‚Äù.Although the Notes have been issued by the Company and VimpelCom is neither a co-obligor nor a guarantor under the Notes  on 20 September 2022  VimpelCom received correspondence from the Russian Ministry of Finance (the ""Russian MinFin"") in which the Russian MinFin stated that it ‚Äúconsider[s] it appropriate that PJSC VimpelCom ensure the fulfilment of obligations under [the Notes] ‚Ä¶ to holders of Eurobonds whose rights are recorded by Russian depositaries‚Äù. In addition  the Russian MinFin requested VimpelCom to provide information on payments made with respect to the Notes. Certain Russian noteholders have also commenced legal proceedings in Russia against VimpelCom requesting VimpelCom to pay under certain Notes.VEON is currently assessing the potential impact of any obligation that may be imposed on VimpelCom as a matter of Russian law to assume direct responsibility for the discharge of the Notes held through Russian depositaries and potential solutions to the same. In the event that VimpelCom were to make principal or interest payments directly to beneficial owners of the Notes that are held through Russian depositaries  the Group has no comfort that the clearing systems would recognize the payment by VimpelCom as being good discharge of the Company‚Äôs payment obligations (and the trust deeds do not otherwise make provision for recognizing such payments). Accordingly  as matters stand  it is possible that VimpelCom and the Company could both be required to make material payments in respect of the same amounts of interest and principal due on 2023 Notes held through Russian depositories.Scheme of ArrangementThe Scheme is expected to enable the Amendments to be implemented upon obtaining the necessary majority consents (being a majority in number  representing at least 75% by value of those beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes present and voting at the Scheme meeting  either in person or by proxy). Any sanctioned beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes and sanctioned persons that may act as custodian for beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes will be excluded from participating in and voting on the Scheme.All actions taken in connection with the Amendments shall be in full compliance with all applicable sanctions laws and regulations  including any economic or financial sanctions laws or regulations as amended from time to time  administered  enacted  or enforced by: the United States; the United Nations; the European Union or any member states thereof; the United Kingdom; Bermuda and other jurisdictions applicable to the Group (excluding the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus)  and any necessary licenses and approvals issued by the competent sanctions authorities of the foregoing jurisdictions.The Scheme will include a standstill provision whereby if the Company (in its sole discretion) has determined to seek any sanctions licenses in connection with the Amendments and any such license has not been granted by the time the Scheme is sanctioned  a standstill on enforcement action shall commence and the principal amount of the 2023 Notes will be treated for all purposes as if it has not fallen due for payment until the earlier of (i) the date on which the Amendments are implemented  (ii) 13 October 2023 or (iii) the date on which the Scheme is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms.Next StepsFurther details regarding the Scheme and the Amendments are contained in the Practice Statement Letter  which is available to Scheme Creditors (as defined in the Practice Statement Letter) on the Scheme Website at https://deals.is.kroll.com/veon.The Group is targeting the sanctioning and effectiveness of the Scheme in the coming months. If the Scheme becomes effective  all of the Scheme Creditors (irrespective of whether or not they voted in favour of the Scheme) will be bound by the terms of the Scheme and the Scheme will alter the rights of the Scheme Creditors. However  completion of the Amendments will be conditional upon obtaining licenses from competent sanctions authorities  to the extent that the Company determines that such licenses are required.The board of directors of the Company recommends to the Scheme Creditors that are entitled to vote on the Scheme that they should vote in favour of and approve the Scheme.Any beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes who wish to discuss the Scheme or the Amendments  and are not designated or otherwise subject to asset freezes or equivalent blocking restrictions under European Union  United Kingdom  United States or other applicable sanctions regimes  are invited to contact VEON (bonds@veon.com) and/or Moelis & Company  who are acting as financial advisors in relation to the Scheme or the Amendments (Marcel.Brouwer@moelis.com).Anticipated Process & TimelineKey Date5 Steps 24 November 2022 Transaction announcement and launch of the Scheme via issuance of the practice statement letter 20 December 2022 Convening hearing On or after 20 December 2022 Issuance of explanatory statement (and accompanying documents) and  subject to receipt of any necessary licenses and approvals  invitation to submit voting and proxy forms  and notice of Scheme meeting On or after 24 January 2023 Scheme meeting* On or after 30 January 2023 Sanction hearing  filing of sanction order and implementation of the Amendments**Subject to receipt of any necessary licenses and/or approvals from competent sanctions authorities  if relevant. See ‚ÄúScheme of Arrangement‚Äù above for details of the standstill provisionsPortfolio Strategy & 2022-24 AmbitionIn line with its previously communicated strategy  the Group remains focused on active portfolio management and the pursuit of opportunities to realize the value of its infrastructure assets (with around $0.8 billion of potential asset monetization proceeds in 2023 and beyond)  further bolster Group and HQ liquidity and de-lever. At the same time  it expects to continue to invest into connectivity  digital opportunities and support portfolio investments to drive growth in its core countries.Expected key areas of focus in each geography are outlined below:Russia : Completion of the VimpelCom Disposal in compliance with applicable sanctions laws and regulations.Ukraine : Ensure people remain connected by keeping the network operational and re invest cash generated locally to create value.Pakistan & Kazakhstan : Consolidate market leadership positions and unlock infrastructure value while pioneering digital services.Bangladesh : Unlock infrastructure value and free up capital for country wide investment.Uzbekistan : Capitalize on growth opportunities.Kyrgyzstan : Continue to develop business while exploring strategic options.Based on its current geographic footprint and asset profile (and taking into account the anticipated VimpelCom Disposal)  it is VEON‚Äôs ambition to achieve low to mid-single-digit growth in U.S. Dollar over the next three years in both Group revenue and EBITDA  while maintaining EBITDA margins in line with current levels and reducing group capex below 20%.FY2022 corporate costs are expected to be approximately USD 185m  compared to USD 208m in 2021  a decrease of approximately 10% YoY. In light of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine  capital controls and sanctions environment  no dividend upstreaming is expected from Russia and Ukraine in the foreseeable future. Cash upstreaming potential is expected to remain in Pakistan  Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan (medium-high expected probability)  Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan (low expected probability).Important NoticeThis announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute a prospectus or an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction  nor shall there be any offer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under applicable securities laws.This presentation is not a prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.This communication or information contained herein is not an offer  or an invitation to make offers  to sell  exchange or otherwise transfer securities in the Russian Federation and does not constitute an advertisement or offering of securities in the Russian Federation within the meaning of Russian securities laws.

Renault Group ...,"RENAULTRenault Group is accelerating the decarbonisation plan for its plants in France and innovating with new partners: Voltalia  ENGIE  and Dalkia.Renault Group announces three major partnerships with energy players ;With Voltalia   the largest green electricity supply contract in France to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of its production activities in 2027 through the installation of photovoltaic panels ;with the ENGIE group  a first-of-its-kind deep geothermal project in Europe that would replace 70% of the gas needs of the Douai plant by 2025;With Dalkia   EDF Group   a partnership to install a biomass boiler to replace 65% of the gas consumption at its Maubeuge plant;These three strategic partnerships constitute a new step in the Global Climate Plan and will make it possible to achieve net zero carbon for the plants of the ElectriCity cluster in France in 2025  in Europe in 2030 and worldwide in 2050.Boulogne-Billancourt  November 24  2022 ‚Äì As part of its Renaulution strategy  Renault Group today announces an acceleration of the decarbonization plan for its industrial sites with three strategic and unprecedented partnerships to achieve its energy transition objectives. This new stage is materializing today with Voltalia for the largest green electricity supply contract in France ‚Äì for the French factories of the Group; with ENGIE for the first deep geothermal project on a European industrial site  in Douai; with Dalkia  EDF Group  for the installation of a biomass boiler  in Maubeuge.Committed to the energy transition for more than 10 years and reaffirmed in the Climate Plan in April 2021  the Group confirms its commitments to achieve net zero carbon at its ElectriCity plants in Hauts-de-France by 2025  in Europe by 2030 and worldwide by 2050. The Group is drawing up a large-scale concrete plan to accelerate industrial decarbonization via photovoltaics  geothermal energy and biomass  among other initiatives.Story continuesLuca de Meo  CEO of Renault Group  said: ""Today we are taking a strategic step towards achieving carbon neutrality in our plants. Thanks to this partnership signed with Voltalia  ElectriCity will become the Group's first production hub to be supplied with carbon-free and competitive electricity. And we don't stop there! We are already working on the next step of our plan and are working towards carbon-free heat to power our factories. In Douai  we are proud to launch with ENGIE one of the most ambitious decarbonisation projects on a European industrial site: the installation of deep geothermal energy. Finally  we are very pleased to partner with Dalkia to launch a biomass boiler project at the Maubeuge plant. We take responsibility  as a leading car manufacturer  to innovate and reduce the carbon footprint of our plants.""Renault Group and Voltalia sign the largest green electricity supply contract in France.Renault Group and Voltalia sign France's largest long-term renewable electricity supply agreement (Corporate Power Purchasing Agreement) for a capacity of 350 megawatts representing the production of approximately 500 gigawatt hours per year by 2027. With a duration of 15 years  it is an unprecedented commitment in France terms of power. This long-term agreement will enable Renault Group to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of the manufacturer's production activities in France in 2027.Voltalia will install photovoltaic panels on French territory for a capacity of 100 megawatts from 2025. The capacity made available to Renault by Voltalia will increase steadily over the following years  reaching a total of 350 megawatts in 2027. This agreement will cover Cl√©on's electric activities as well as all the sustainable electricity needs of the ElectriCity cluster  the largest and most competitive electric vehicle production centre in Europe whose ambition is to produce 500 000 vehicles per year by 2025.S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  said: ""Voltalia is proud to be a privileged partner of this new stage of Renault Group's Climate Plan and to actively contribute to its objective of net zero carbon for the plants in the ElectriCity cluster. Providing renewable  carbon-free and competitive electricity to reduce CO2 emissions is Voltalia's daily mission. This major partnership delights us and illustrates our ability to be a key player in green electricity solutions in France.""Renault Group and ENGIE are developing a deep geothermal energy project at the Douai plant  an unprecedented project in Europe.This large-scale project is integrated as part of a Heat Purchase Agreement (HPA) with the aim of supplying the plant with carbon-free heat  replacing 70% of its gas needs from local and renewable sources. The partnership would span 15 years. Renault Group will thus strengthen its leading position in the decarbonisation of its industrial sites through this commitment.At the end of 2023  ENGIE  through its subsidiary ENGIE Solutions  will begin drilling work at the Douai plant to draw hot water (130-140¬∞C) at a depth of 4 000 metres to capture the calories needed for the plant's industrial and heating process needs from 2025. The geothermal water will then be returned to its natural environment. Once implemented  this geothermal technology would provide a power of nearly 40 MW continuously. In summer  when the need for heat is lower  geothermal energy could be used to produce carbon-free electricity.C√©cile Pr√©vieu  Executive Vice President in charge of Energy Solutions  said: ""We are proud to be one of the partners that Renault has trusted to decarbonise its activities. The technological expertise represented by this geothermal solution applied to a large industrial site demonstrates our know-how and our ability to innovate to support our customers in their energy transition. We provide virtuous  resilient solutions that guarantee the highest operational performance.""Renault Group and Dalkia  EDF Group  join forces to supply carbon-free heat to the Maubeuge plant.Renault Group and Dalkia  an EDF Group subsidiary specialising in renewable energies  have signed a 15-year partnership to supply carbon-free heat to the Maubeuge Renault plant through the installation of a biomass boiler and waste heat recovery systems on site. With a capacity of 15 MW  these boilers should enable the plant to cover 65% of its gas needs from local and renewable sources by 2025.Sylvie J√©hanno  CEO of Dalkia  said: ""I would like to thank Renault Group for placing its trust in us. The decarbonisation of industry is at the heart of our activities and our teams are very committed to making this biomass heating plant project at the Maubeuge plant a benchmark for the region's energy transition!""----The decarbonization plan concerns all Renault Group sites on the four continents where the Group operates.

13702,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finbold.com/e780-billion-outflows-europes-largest-stock-exchange-in-2022-as-financial-markets-bleed/,‚Ç¨780 billion outflows Europe‚Äôs largest stock exchange in 2022 as financial markets bleed,The stock market continues to operate in an environment of high uncertainty  with most economies struggling to remain afloat amid ‚Ä¶ ContinuedThe post ‚Ç¨780 billion outflows Europe‚Äôs largest stock exchange in 2022 as financial markets bleed appeared first on F‚Ä¶,The stock market continues to operate in an environment of high uncertainty  with most economies struggling to remain afloat amid soaring inflation and a subsequent slowdown in consumer spending. Consequently  entities like Euronext paint a picture of sustained capital outflow as investors remain skeptical about the general economic outlook.In particular  data acquired by Finbold indicates that as of October 2022  Europe‚Äôs largest stock exchange Euronext had lost ‚Ç¨780 billion in capital this year at ‚Ç¨4.87 trillion. The value represents a drop of 13.8% from the ‚Ç¨5.65 trillion market cap recorded in 2021  the highest valuation in the last eight years. Notably  last year‚Äôs valuation represented an increase of 28.12% from 2020‚Äôs figure of ‚Ç¨4.41 trillion.Elsewhere  LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton remains the highest-valued company on Euronext  with a market cap of ‚Ç¨321.58 billion as of October 2022. Merck and Co rank second at ‚Ç¨237.24 billion  followed by oil giant Shell at ‚Ç¨200.64 billion. ASML Holding ranks fourth with a market cap of ‚Ç¨194.29 billion  while Caterpillar occupies the fifth spot at ‚Ç¨176.02 billion.Triggers of Euronext capital outflowThe capital outflow from Euronext can be attributed to the prevailing economic uncertainty characterized by extended geopolitical tensions and stock market volatility alongside skyrocketing inflation and the threat of interest rate hikes. In this line  the factors have led to a fear of recession  with investors staying on the sidelines waiting for possible changes.Notably  the ongoing uncertainty partly triggered panic outflows of capital from the exchange at a period consumer spending appears depressed amid rising living costs  energy prices  and unemployment. At the same time  investors have become more sensitive to risk investment  hence reducing their stake in stocks.Indeed  Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah had warned that the resulting market volatility means investors should be ready for a bumpy ride.In general  Europe‚Äôs economy has struggled post-pandemic  associated with a cocktail of risks that threatens to reverse growth  with the stock market standing in line to face the adverse impact. Besides inflation  the region is grappling with an energy crisis uncertainty alongside the effects of climate change.It is worth noting that exchange has also been impacted by the decision taken by specific jurisdictions in a bid to contain the economy‚Äôs free fall. For instance  most European stocks are still recovering from the negative impact following a previous plan by the Bank of England to buy long-dated bonds to calm the market chaos temporarily.IPO activity remains lowFurthermore  companies have been hit with liquidity concerns as they seek to raise funds. However  a majority have been held back by investors‚Äô reduced appetite to take on equity risks.Interestingly  the slump in Euronext‚Äôs valuation can also be linked to reduced activity around initial public offerings (IPO). Notably  across 2021  part of the exchange‚Äôs record market cap could be attributed to the roaring IPO activity after the downturn in 2020.At the same time  the exchange has also failed to attract the frenzy around the Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC). This comes as European regulators warned that the approach is associated with risks of dilution  conflicts of interest  and uncertainty.It‚Äôs worth noting that our previous report indicated that among leading global exchanges  Euronext only added three companies this year as of September 2022.Overall  most companies planning to go public this year have taken a step back to evaluate the markets and find ways of adapting to the existing conditions.On the other hand  Euronext is also faced with a series of delistings as the bear market takes shape  with companies looking for means to save costs in line with tackling the current economic turmoil. For instance  oil drilling firm Tullow Oil alongside Holcim is among the high-profile entities to announce their exit.The future of European stocksDespite the loss of capital  analysts have maintained the European stock market is likely to rally in the coming months. Notably  dropping valuation on platforms like the Euronext exchange is making the stocks look attractive with the potential to attract new investors. However  the recovery will depend on how economies exits its current state.Like other global economies  Europe will also be monitoring happenings in the Asian market with a specific focus on China.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces that following a competitive process  it has entered into ‚Ä¶,Amsterdam  Netherlands  24 November 2022 13:25 ‚Äì VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces that following a competitive process  it has entered into an agreement to sell VEON‚Äôs Russian operations to certain senior members of the management team of PJSC VimpelCom (‚ÄúVimpelCom‚Äù)  led by its current CEO Aleksander Torbakhov.The management buy-out of VimpelCom implies an expected enterprise value of approximately RUB 370 billion  representing an expected enterprise value / 2022E EBITDA multiple of 3.2x. On a standalone basis  for the twelve months ended 30 September 2022  VimpelCom generated revenue of RUB 339 billion and EBITDA of RUB 115 billion.Under the agreement  VEON will receive total consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately USD 2.1 billion1). It is expected that the total consideration will be paid primarily by VimpelCom taking on and discharging certain VEON Holdings B.V. debt  thus significantly deleveraging VEON‚Äôs balance sheet. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including receipt of requisite regulatory approvals  licenses from relevant government authorities and any required consent from VEON creditors. The target completion date for the transaction is on or before 1 June 2023  with options on both sides for extensions in case any required regulatory license has not yet been received.‚ÄúAfter considering numerous options  I am confident that the agreed sale of VEON‚Äôs Russian operations to the VimpelCom management team represents an optimal solution for VEON  its Russian operations and the stakeholders of both companies  including customers  shareholders and creditors  as well as employees both in and outside of Russia. VEON is committed to ensuring the transaction is seamless for staff and customers in Russia  with no disruption to the services currently provided ‚Äù said Kaan Terzioƒülu  CEO of VEON Group. ‚ÄúThis transaction will be equity accretive  result in significant deleveraging of VEON‚Äôs balance sheet and will enhance VEON‚Äôs credit profile.‚ÄùAs part of the transaction  ownership of VEON‚Äôs Kazakhstan operations will be transferred to VEON Holdings B.V. and certain inter-company loans will be extinguished. This will ensure that VEON will continue to consolidate its Kazakhstan operations  with VEON Holdings B.V. taking direct ownership of the Group‚Äôs 75% stake in Kar-Tel  which operates under the Beeline brand.The agreement also includes a customary provision that enables VEON to benefit from a potential subsequent event  including a sale of VimpelCom at a higher valuation  for a period of 30 months following closing  and provides for typical termination rights in favor of VEON in case of a change in control of the buyer entity (JSC Kopernik-Invest 3). The agreement is governed by Russian law and provides for international dispute resolution.About VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets.

(Nasdaq: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or  together with its subsidiaries  the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù) and VEON Holdings B.V. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity‚Ä¶,"Amsterdam  Netherlands  24 November 2022 13:30 ‚Äì VEON Ltd. (Nasdaq: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or  together with its subsidiaries  the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù) and VEON Holdings B.V. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announced the launch of a scheme of arrangement in England (the ‚ÄúScheme‚Äù) via the issuance of a Practice Statement Letter to extend the maturity of the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and 7.25% notes due April 2023 issued by the Company (together  the ‚Äú2023 Notes‚Äù) by eight months from their respective maturity dates.Rationale for the AmendmentsThe Scheme launched by the Company today proposes an eight-month extension to the respective maturity dates of the 2023 Notes  together with certain other amendments to the terms of the 2023 Notes and related trust deeds as further outlined in this announcement.The Scheme represents the culmination of six months of discussions between the Group and its advisers during which they have considered multiple different potential transaction structures. If the status quo were to continue  the options available to it would be significantly constrained by the current and evolving political situation  international sanctions laws and Russian regulations. In these circumstances  the Group has concluded that a short-term extension of the maturity of the 2023 Notes represents the best option available to the Group and its stakeholders  as it will provide the Group with additional time to pursue a number of strategic transactions.The Amendments will allow the Group time to conclude the agreed sale of its Russian subsidiary  PJSC VimpelCom (‚ÄúVimpelCom‚Äù)  as announced separately earlier today ( https://www.veon.com/media/media-releases/2022/veon-ltd-press-release-24-11-2022/ ) (the ‚ÄúVimpelCom Disposal‚Äù)  which is expected to be completed in early June 2023 (subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals  any required consent from VEON creditors and satisfaction of customary closing conditions). Under the sale agreement for the VimpelCom Disposal  VEON will receive total consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately USD 2.1 billion1). Subject to receipt of the necessary licenses and/or approval from competent sanctions authorities  it is expected that the total consideration will be paid primarily by VimpelCom taking on and discharging certain notes issued by the Company  thus significantly deleveraging VEON‚Äôs consolidated balance sheet. The Group considers that the VimpelCom Disposal represents the single-most material deleveraging action available to the Group  which will at the same time increase the prospect of future access to international debt capital markets  which are currently not available to the Group.The Amendments  together with the deleveraging described above  are also expected to curtail the inefficient use of cash which would result from the payments on the Russian National Settlement Depository (the ‚ÄúNSD‚Äù) held portion of the 2023 Notes being trapped in the international clearing systems and the principal amount of the 2023 Notes held through Russian depositaries being repaid by both the Company and VimpelCom due to the European Union‚Äôs sanctions targeting the NSD  and possibly in response to United States and United Kingdom sanctions laws and regulations targeting Russia more broadly  as further described below. It will also provide short term stability and further optionality to implement the asset monetization strategy underpinning VEON‚Äôs objectives to further reduce leverage and maximize its stakeholders‚Äô returns.The Scheme launched by the Company today proposes the following changes with respect to the 2023 Notes (together  the ‚ÄúAmendments‚Äù):an eight-month extension of the respective maturity dates of the February 2023 Notes and April 2023 Notes to October 2023 and December 2023 respectively;an amendment of the consent and quorum thresholds for ordinary matters and Reserved Matters (as defined in the 2023 Notes trust deeds) 2 and excluding beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes who are the target of applicable sanctions laws or regulations that prohibit them from dealing with the 2023 Notes from counting in the consent and quorum thresholds 3 ; andand excluding beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes who are the target of applicable sanctions laws or regulations that prohibit them from dealing with the 2023 Notes from counting in the consent and quorum thresholds ; and payment of an amendment fee of 75bps payable on the 2023 Notes outstanding on their respective amended maturity dates.Subject to the Amendments being successfully implemented  and completion of the VimpelCom Disposal  the Group currently intends to use excess liquidity to redeem financial liabilities to deleverage and reduce its interest obligations.BackgroundOver the past nine months  the Group has successfully strengthened its liquidity position  and this will remain a key priority in the near term. However  despite the resilient performance of its underlying operating companies  which are considered largely self-sustaining  VEON‚Äôs ability to upstream cash for debt service is currently impaired by currency and capital controls in two of its major markets (Ukraine and Russia) and other geopolitical/FX pressures affecting emerging markets generally  including the countries in which the Group has operations.In addition  the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and developments since February 2022 with respect to sanctions laws and regulations have resulted in unprecedented challenges for VEON  limiting access to the international debt capital markets in which VEON has traditionally refinanced maturing debt and so hampering its ability to refinance indebtedness. Without a change in the status quo  the situation is likely to remain challenging  including as a result of the withdrawal of VEON‚Äôs credit ratings by rating agencies due to VEON‚Äôs current exposure to Russia.Blocking of NSD PaymentsAs a result of sanctions laws and regulations imposed on Russia  cash payments of both interest and principal amounts that either have already been made or will be made by the Company under its various RUB and USD notes (the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù) through the international clearing systems do not reach the beneficial owners of the Notes that are held directly or indirectly (through the chain of Russian depositaries) via the NSD (such owners  the ‚ÄúNSD Noteholders‚Äù). VEON understands that such cash payments are instead being blocked by the international clearing systems  as the international clearing systems are not making payments to the NSD  due to the European Union‚Äôs targeting of the NSD  and possibly in response to United States and United Kingdom sanctions laws and regulations targeting Russia more broadly.Given the Company believes a significant proportion of NSD Noteholders are among the holders of the 2023 Notes (estimated to represent c. 60% of the 2023 Notes and c. 50% of all Notes maturing through 20274)  any maturity payments made by the Company in respect of the 2023 Notes on their respective maturity dates are expected to result in an inefficient use of material sums of liquidity  due to the cash remaining blocked in the international clearing systems.Russian Regulatory BackdropOn 5 July 2022  the President of the Russian Federation issued Decree 430  which states that ‚ÄúRussian legal entities with obligations related to Eurobonds are required to ensure the fulfilment of obligations to holders of Eurobonds whose rights are recorded by Russian depositaries‚Äù.Although the Notes have been issued by the Company and VimpelCom is neither a co-obligor nor a guarantor under the Notes  on 20 September 2022  VimpelCom received correspondence from the Russian Ministry of Finance (the ""Russian MinFin"") in which the Russian MinFin stated that it ‚Äúconsider[s] it appropriate that PJSC VimpelCom ensure the fulfilment of obligations under [the Notes] ‚Ä¶ to holders of Eurobonds whose rights are recorded by Russian depositaries‚Äù. In addition  the Russian MinFin requested VimpelCom to provide information on payments made with respect to the Notes. Certain Russian noteholders have also commenced legal proceedings in Russia against VimpelCom requesting VimpelCom to pay under certain Notes.VEON is currently assessing the potential impact of any obligation that may be imposed on VimpelCom as a matter of Russian law to assume direct responsibility for the discharge of the Notes held through Russian depositaries and potential solutions to the same. In the event that VimpelCom were to make principal or interest payments directly to beneficial owners of the Notes that are held through Russian depositaries  the Group has no comfort that the clearing systems would recognize the payment by VimpelCom as being good discharge of the Company‚Äôs payment obligations (and the trust deeds do not otherwise make provision for recognizing such payments). Accordingly  as matters stand  it is possible that VimpelCom and the Company could both be required to make material payments in respect of the same amounts of interest and principal due on 2023 Notes held through Russian depositories.Scheme of ArrangementThe Scheme is expected to enable the Amendments to be implemented upon obtaining the necessary majority consents (being a majority in number  representing at least 75% by value of those beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes present and voting at the Scheme meeting  either in person or by proxy). Any sanctioned beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes and sanctioned persons that may act as custodian for beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes will be excluded from participating in and voting on the Scheme.All actions taken in connection with the Amendments shall be in full compliance with all applicable sanctions laws and regulations  including any economic or financial sanctions laws or regulations as amended from time to time  administered  enacted  or enforced by: the United States; the United Nations; the European Union or any member states thereof; the United Kingdom; Bermuda and other jurisdictions applicable to the Group (excluding the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus)  and any necessary licenses and approvals issued by the competent sanctions authorities of the foregoing jurisdictions.The Scheme will include a standstill provision whereby if the Company (in its sole discretion) has determined to seek any sanctions licenses in connection with the Amendments and any such license has not been granted by the time the Scheme is sanctioned  a standstill on enforcement action shall commence and the principal amount of the 2023 Notes will be treated for all purposes as if it has not fallen due for payment until the earlier of (i) the date on which the Amendments are implemented  (ii) 13 October 2023 or (iii) the date on which the Scheme is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms.Next StepsFurther details regarding the Scheme and the Amendments are contained in the Practice Statement Letter  which is available to Scheme Creditors (as defined in the Practice Statement Letter) on the Scheme Website at https://deals.is.kroll.com/veon.The Group is targeting the sanctioning and effectiveness of the Scheme in the coming months. If the Scheme becomes effective  all of the Scheme Creditors (irrespective of whether or not they voted in favour of the Scheme) will be bound by the terms of the Scheme and the Scheme will alter the rights of the Scheme Creditors. However  completion of the Amendments will be conditional upon obtaining licenses from competent sanctions authorities  to the extent that the Company determines that such licenses are required.The board of directors of the Company recommends to the Scheme Creditors that are entitled to vote on the Scheme that they should vote in favour of and approve the Scheme.Any beneficial owners of the 2023 Notes who wish to discuss the Scheme or the Amendments  and are not designated or otherwise subject to asset freezes or equivalent blocking restrictions under European Union  United Kingdom  United States or other applicable sanctions regimes  are invited to contact VEON (bonds@veon.com) and/or Moelis & Company  who are acting as financial advisors in relation to the Scheme or the Amendments (Marcel.Brouwer@moelis.com).Anticipated Process & TimelineKey Date5 Steps 24 November 2022 Transaction announcement and launch of the Scheme via issuance of the practice statement letter 20 December 2022 Convening hearing On or after 20 December 2022 Issuance of explanatory statement (and accompanying documents) and  subject to receipt of any necessary licenses and approvals  invitation to submit voting and proxy forms  and notice of Scheme meeting On or after 24 January 2023 Scheme meeting* On or after 30 January 2023 Sanction hearing  filing of sanction order and implementation of the Amendments**Subject to receipt of any necessary licenses and/or approvals from competent sanctions authorities  if relevant. See ‚ÄúScheme of Arrangement‚Äù above for details of the standstill provisionsPortfolio Strategy & 2022-24 AmbitionIn line with its previously communicated strategy  the Group remains focused on active portfolio management and the pursuit of opportunities to realize the value of its infrastructure assets (with around $0.8 billion of potential asset monetization proceeds in 2023 and beyond)  further bolster Group and HQ liquidity and de-lever. At the same time  it expects to continue to invest into connectivity  digital opportunities and support portfolio investments to drive growth in its core countries.Expected key areas of focus in each geography are outlined below:Russia : Completion of the VimpelCom Disposal in compliance with applicable sanctions laws and regulations.: Completion of the VimpelCom Disposal in compliance with applicable sanctions laws and regulations. Ukraine : Ensure people remain connected by keeping the network operational and re invest cash generated locally to create value.: Ensure people remain connected by keeping the network operational and re invest cash generated locally to create value. Pakistan & Kazakhstan : Consolidate market leadership positions and unlock infrastructure value while pioneering digital services.: Consolidate market leadership positions and unlock infrastructure value while pioneering digital services. Bangladesh : Unlock infrastructure value and free up capital for country wide investment.: Unlock infrastructure value and free up capital for country wide investment. Uzbekistan : Capitalize on growth opportunities.: Capitalize on growth opportunities. Kyrgyzstan : Continue to develop business while exploring strategic options.Based on its current geographic footprint and asset profile (and taking into account the anticipated VimpelCom Disposal)  it is VEON‚Äôs ambition to achieve low to mid-single-digit growth in U.S. Dollar over the next three years in both Group revenue and EBITDA  while maintaining EBITDA margins in line with current levels and reducing group capex below 20%.FY2022 corporate costs are expected to be approximately USD 185m  compared to USD 208m in 2021  a decrease of approximately 10% YoY. In light of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine  capital controls and sanctions environment  no dividend upstreaming is expected from Russia and Ukraine in the foreseeable future. Cash upstreaming potential is expected to remain in Pakistan  Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan (medium-high expected probability)  Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan (low expected probability).Important NoticeThis announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute a prospectus or an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction  nor shall there be any offer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under applicable securities laws.This presentation is not a prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.This communication or information contained herein is not an offer  or an invitation to make offers  to sell  exchange or otherwise transfer securities in the Russian Federation and does not constitute an advertisement or offering of securities in the Russian Federation within the meaning of Russian securities laws.

This new stage is materializing today with Voltalia for the largest green electricity supply contract in France ‚Äì for the French factories of the Group; with ENGIE for the first deep geothermal project on a European industrial site  in Douai; with Dalkia  EDF Group  for the installation of a biomass boiler  in Maubeuge.Committed to the energy transition for more than 10 years and reaffirmed in the Climate Plan in April 2021  the Group confirms its commitments to achieve net zero carbon at its ElectriCity plants in Hauts-de-France by 2025  in Europe by 2030 and worldwide by 2050. The Group is drawing up a large-scale concrete plan to accelerate industrial decarbonization via photovoltaics  geothermal energy and biomass  among other initiatives.Luca de Meo  CEO of Renault Group  said: ""Today we are taking a strategic step towards achieving carbon neutrality in our plants. Thanks to this partnership signed with Voltalia  ElectriCity will become the Group's first production hub to be supplied with carbon-free and competitive electricity. And we don't stop there! We are already working on the next step of our plan and are working towards carbon-free heat to power our factories. In Douai  we are proud to launch with ENGIE one of the most ambitious decarbonisation projects on a European industrial site: the installation of deep geothermal energy. Finally  we are very pleased to partner with Dalkia to launch a biomass boiler project at the Maubeuge plant. We take responsibility  as a leading car manufacturer  to innovate and reduce the carbon footprint of our plants.""Renault Group and Voltalia sign the largest green electricity supply contract in France.Renault Group and Voltalia sign France's largest long-term renewable electricity supply agreement (Corporate Power Purchasing Agreement) for a capacity of 350 megawatts representing the production of approximately 500 gigawatt hours per year by 2027. With a duration of 15 years  it is an unprecedented commitment in France terms of power. This long-term agreement will enable Renault Group to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of the manufacturer's production activities in France in 2027.Voltalia will install photovoltaic panels on French territory for a capacity of 100 megawatts from 2025. The capacity made available to Renault by Voltalia will increase steadily over the following years  reaching a total of 350 megawatts in 2027. This agreement will cover Cl√©on's electric activities as well as all the sustainable electricity needs of the ElectriCity cluster  the largest and most competitive electric vehicle production centre in Europe whose ambition is to produce 500 000 vehicles per year by 2025.S√©bastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  said: ""Voltalia is proud to be a privileged partner of this new stage of Renault Group's Climate Plan and to actively contribute to its objective of net zero carbon for the plants in the ElectriCity cluster. Providing renewable  carbon-free and competitive electricity to reduce CO2 emissions is Voltalia's daily mission. This major partnership delights us and illustrates our ability to be a key player in green electricity solutions in France.""Renault Group and ENGIE are developing a deep geothermal energy project at the Douai plant  an unprecedented project in Europe.This large-scale project is integrated as part of a Heat Purchase Agreement (HPA) with the aim of supplying the plant with carbon-free heat  replacing 70% of its gas needs from local and renewable sources. The partnership would span 15 years. Renault Group will thus strengthen its leading position in the decarbonisation of its industrial sites through this commitment.At the end of 2023  ENGIE  through its subsidiary ENGIE Solutions  will begin drilling work at the Douai plant to draw hot water (130-140¬∞C) at a depth of 4 000 metres to capture the calories needed for the plant's industrial and heating process needs from 2025. The geothermal water will then be returned to its natural environment. Once implemented  this geothermal technology would provide a power of nearly 40 MW continuously. In summer  when the need for heat is lower  geothermal energy could be used to produce carbon-free electricity.C√©cile Pr√©vieu  Executive Vice President in charge of Energy Solutions  said: ""We are proud to be one of the partners that Renault has trusted to decarbonise its activities. The technological expertise represented by this geothermal solution applied to a large industrial site demonstrates our know-how and our ability to innovate to support our customers in their energy transition. We provide virtuous  resilient solutions that guarantee the highest operational performance.""Renault Group and Dalkia  EDF Group  join forces to supply carbon-free heat to the Maubeuge plant.Renault Group and Dalkia  an EDF Group subsidiary specialising in renewable energies  have signed a 15-year partnership to supply carbon-free heat to the Maubeuge Renault plant through the installation of a biomass boiler and waste heat recovery systems on site. With a capacity of 15 MW  these boilers should enable the plant to cover 65% of its gas needs from local and renewable sources by 2025.Sylvie J√©hanno  CEO of Dalkia  said: ""I would like to thank Renault Group for placing its trust in us. The decarbonisation of industry is at the heart of our activities and our teams are very committed to making this biomass heating plant project at the Maubeuge plant a benchmark for the region's energy transition!""----The decarbonization plan concerns all Renault Group sites on the four continents where the Group operates.

This performance reflects a steep 11.4% rise due to price mix  in line with the Group‚Äôs strategic focus on value  and 9.7% growth in volume. Current Operating Profit came in at ‚Ç¨319.3 million  representing a 27.2% organic rise and 50.0% growth on a reported basis. This was more than double the 2019-20 figure. Current operating margin showed a 1.7-point organic rise to 36.8% (up 3.8 points as reported).Eric Vallat  R√©my Cointreau‚Äôs CEO  stated: ‚ÄúR√©my Cointreau reported excellent results and made solid progress toward achieving our strategic priorities. In a persistently tough and demanding environment  we are fortunate to be ahead of schedule with our strategic plan  which allows us to stay on course and continue investing in our brands to enhance their appeal and awareness as we prepare for future growth. Building on these results  we are confirming our full-year guidance  with the second half set to reflect a return to normal consumption in the post-covid era and some base of comparison effects after two years of truly exceptional growth. In a half year that has seen a host of innovation and commercial initiatives  our people have shown impressive agility  creativity and engagement in carrying out our strategy  and I would like to take this opportunity to express my warmest thanks to them.‚ÄùKey figures ‚Äì in ‚Ç¨m (unless otherwise stated) H1 2022-23 H1 2021-22 Reported change Organic change vs. H1 2021-22 vs. H1 2019-20 Sales 867.1 645.3 +34.4% +21.1% +54.6% Gross margin (%) 71.9% 69.1% +2.8 pts +1.8 pts +3.3 pts Current Operating Profit 319.3 212.9 +50.0% +27.2% +98.7% Current operating margin (%) 36.8% 33.0% +3.8 pts +1.7 pts +7.7 pts Net profit - Group share 223.8 134.0 +67.0% +39.9% +107.2% Net margin (%) 25.8% 20.8% +5.0 pts +3.2 pts +6.1 pts Net profit ‚Äì Group share excl. non-recurring items 226.8 148.2 +53.0% +28.5% +125.2% Net margin excl. non-recurring items (%) 26.2% 23.0% +3.2 pts +1.4 pts +7.6 pts EPS Group share (‚Ç¨) 4.40 2.67 +64.7% +38.0% +102.8% EPS Group share excl. non-recurring items (‚Ç¨) 4.46 2.95 +50.9% +26.8% +120.3% Net debt /EBITDA ratio 0.65x 0.77x -0.12x -0.12x -0.74xCurrent Operating Profit by divisionIn ‚Ç¨m (unless otherwise stated) H1 2022-23 H1 2021-22 Reported change Organic change vs. H1 2021-22 vs. H1 2019-20 Cognac 299.7 188.1 +59.3% +35.7% +103.8% As % of sales 47.0% 40.5% +6.5 pts +4.4 pts +10.6 pts Liqueurs & Spirits 31.9 37.8 -15.8% -27.5% +33.6% As % of sales 14.9% 23.1% -8.2 pts -9.2 pts -2.3 pts Subtotal: Group brands 331.5 225.9 +46.7% +25.1% +93.9% As % of sales 38.9% 35.9% +3.0 pts +0.9 pts +7.3 pts Partner brands 0.1 0.3 -72.0% -24.8% -147.8% Holding company costs (12.3) (13.4) -8.1% -8.6% +36.1% Total 319.3 212.9 +50.0% +27.2% +98.7% As % of sales 36.8% 33.0% +3.8 pts +1.7 pts +7.7 ptsCognacFirst-half sales at the Cognac division were up a strong 22.4% on an organic basis (up 55.8% compared to 2019-2020)  including volume growth of 6.4% and a 16.0% rise from price/mix effects. All regions contributed to this excellent showing.Current Operating Profit rose 35.7% on an organic basis to total ‚Ç¨299.7 million  for a 4.4-point organic rise in margin to 47.0%. This outstanding performance reflects very strong growth in gross margin and firm control of overheads. At the same time  the Group decided to postpone various marketing outlays in China until the second half of the year due to the ongoing pandemic. As a result  the ratio of ‚ÄúMarketing and communications spend / sales‚Äù shows a temporary decline.Liqueurs & SpiritsFirst-half sales at the Liqueurs & Spirits division were up 20.7% on an organic basis (up 55.5% compared to 2019-20)  including volume growth of 16.8% and an increase of 3.9% from the price/mix effect. The division also reported a very good summer season. All brands contributed to this very good performance.Current Operating Profit stood at ‚Ç¨31.9 million  down 27.5% on an organic basis. This set current operating margin at 14.9%  or 9.2 points lower on an organic basis. This decline in margin reflected  as expected  a steep rise in marketing and communication spend aimed at preparing for future growth  along with a decrease in gross margin linked to rising production costs that was partially offset by higher sales prices and a reduction in overheads.Partner BrandsFirst-half sales of Partner Brands were down 13.0% on an organic basis  reflecting unfavourable base effects in Europe  particularly in the Benelux countries.Current Operating Profit came in at ‚Ç¨0.1 million  compared with ‚Ç¨0.3 million in the first half of financial year 2021-22.Consolidated resultsConsolidated Operating Profit (COP) stood at ‚Ç¨319.3 million  up 50.0% as reported and a rise of 27.2% on an organic basis. This means the Group recorded the equivalent of 12 months of COP in just six months  which would make this its ‚Äúsecond best year‚Äù ever.This performance includes some very positive currency effects (+‚Ç¨48.6 million)  due primarily to trends in the US dollar and renminbi. The average EUR/USD conversion rate improved from 1.19 in H1 2021-2022 to 1.04 in H1 2022-2023  while the average collection rate (linked to the Group‚Äôs hedging policy) came in at 1.08 in H1 2022-2023 compared with 1.18 in H1 2021-2022.Current operating margin stood at 36.8%  up 1.7 points on an organic basis and up 3.8 points as reported. This rise reflects the following:organic growth of 1.8 points in the gross margin to 71.9% (+3.3 points compared to 2019-20)  driven largely by very favourable price/mix effectsvery good absorption of overheads (ratio down 0.7 pts on an organic basis)(ratio down 0.7 pts on an organic basis) increased marketing and communication spend (ratio up 0.8 pts on an organic basis)(ratio up 0.8 pts on an organic basis) very favourable currency effects (+2.2 pts).Operating profit came in at ‚Ç¨315.3 million  up 58.3% as reported  after taking into account a net charge of ‚Ç¨4.0 million in non-recurring items. This was mainly due to early unwinding of rouble hedges linked to the current geopolitical situation.Net financial expense improved from -‚Ç¨7.4 million in H1 2021-2022 to -‚Ç¨5.1 million in H1 2022-2023 thanks to the early conversion of OCEANE bonds and currency gains on hedging of debts denominated in foreign currency.Tax expense totalled ‚Ç¨86.9 million  for an effective tax rate of 28.0% as reported (and excluding non-recurring items) compared with 30.3% as reported in H1 2021-2022 (28.0% excluding non-recurring items). This includes the reduction in the tax rate in France.Net profit - Group share came in at ‚Ç¨223.8 million  up 67.0% as reported  which sets net margin at 25.8%  up 5.0 pts as reported.Excluding non-recurring items  net profit ‚Äì Group share stood at ‚Ç¨226.8 million  up 53.0% as reported  setting net margin at 26.2%  up 3.2 pts as reported.EPS Group - share came to ‚Ç¨4.40  up 64.7% as reported from 2021-2022 and more than double the 2019-2020 figure. Excluding non-recurring items  EPS was ‚Ç¨4.46.Net debt was ‚Ç¨348.3 million  down ‚Ç¨5.0 million from the position at 31 March 2022. In addition to free cash flow  this improvement reflects the non-cash impact of early conversion of part of the Group‚Äôs OCEANE debt for ‚Ç¨42.3 million  offset by rollout of a ‚Ç¨61.7 million share buyback programme. A total of 393 667 OCEANE bonds were thus converted to R√©my Cointreau shares over the period  raising the total share of OCEANE bonds converted to 73.7%. Given the conversion ratio  397 993 shares were created in this way.The net debt/EBITDA ratio came out at 0.65 at 30 September 2022  compared with 0.79 at 31 March 2022 and 0.77 at 30 September 2021.Full-year guidance confirmedIdeally positioned to take advantage of new consumption trends and buoyed by its advance on roll-out of its strategic plan  R√©my Cointreau is looking to 2022-2023 with confidence.The Group intends to continue to gain market share value in the exceptional spirits sector. It expects another year of strong organic growth  including normalization of consumption trends in the second half on the heels of two outstanding years.More specifically  as life ‚Äúreturns to normal‚Äù in most regions  overall consumption from H2 on is likely to settle in at ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù levels that are well above those observed in 2019/20. At the same time  growth should be tempered by high bases of comparison.The Group intends to continue implementing its strategy focused on medium-term brand development and underpinned by a policy of sustained investment in marketing and communications  particularly in the second half of the year.As a result  organic COP margin improvement will be driven by gross margin resilience despite the inflationary environment and by tight control of overhead costs.Taking into account the impact of phasing effects on sales trends and marketing/communication spends  organic COP margin improvement will be primarily driven by H1.The full-year impact of currency should be positive for:sales : +‚Ç¨ 110/120m: +‚Ç¨ 110/120m COP: +‚Ç¨55/60mSubsequent eventsOn 20 October 2022  R√©my Cointreau announced the creation of Maison Psych√©  a luxury perfume house that will harness blending and ageing expertise specific to the world of spirits to transform the finest raw materials used in perfumes and create innovative fragrances.On 27 October 2022  R√©my Cointreau announced the successful launch of My R√©my Cointreau  its first international employee share ownership plan.

Such differences are not material.R√©my Cointreau‚Äôs management process is based on the following alternative performance indicators  selected for planning and reporting purposes. The Group‚Äôs management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand the Group‚Äôs performance. These alternative performance indicators should be considered as supplementing those included in the consolidated financial statements and the resulting movements.Organic growth in sales and Current Operating ProfitOrganic growth is calculated excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals. This indicator serves to focus on Group performance common to both financial years  which local management is more directly capable of measuring.The impact of exchange rates is calculated by converting sales and Current Operating Profit for the current financial year using average exchange rates (or  for Current Operating Profit  the hedged exchange rate) from the previous financial year.For acquisitions in the current financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For acquisitions in the previous financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year; however  they are only included in current year organic growth calculations with effect from the anniversary date of the acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5  under which results of entities disposed of are systematically reclassified under ‚ÄúNet earnings from discontinued operations‚Äù.Indicators ‚Äúexcluding non-recurring items‚ÄùThe two items set out below constitute key indicators for measuring recurring business performance  since they exclude significant items which  by virtue of their unusual nature  cannot be considered inherent to the Group‚Äôs ongoing performance:Current Operating Profit consists of operating profit before other non-recurring operating income and expenses.Net profit attributable to the Group excluding non-recurring items consists of net profit attributable to the Group adjusted to exclude other non-recurring operating income and expenses  associated tax effects  profit from deconsolidated  divested and discontinued operations and the contribution from dividends paid in cash.Gross operating profit (EBITDA)This measure  which is used in particular to calculate certain ratios  equates to Current Operating Profit less amortisation and depreciation expenses on intangible assets and property  plant and equipment for the period  expenses arising from stock option plans  and dividends received from associates during the period.Net debtNet financial debt as defined and used by the Group is equal to the sum of long- and short-term financial debt and accrued interest  less cash and cash equivalents.About R√©my CointreauAll around the world  there are clients seeking exceptional experiences; clients for whom a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavors.

In connection with the resolution on this share issue  the board has also resolved  as authorized by the general meeting on 2 May 2022  on a directed share issue to a group of existing and new investors on the same terms as for this issue. Thus  the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right in this issue is the same as for the other directed share issue  namely to  in a time and cost-effective way  secure the Company's need for additional funding. The board of directors has made an overall assessment of the various alternatives at hand and has carefully considered the possibility of raising the required capital by carrying out a share issue with preferential rights for the existing shareholders. After close evaluation together with its advisers  the board of directors has concluded that a preferential rights issue would entail a significant risk that the Company would not be able to raise the required funding  the main reason being that a rights issue would be significantly more time-consuming and therefore subject to higher market risk exposure compared to a directed issue. As a consequence  especially due to the higher than normal market volatility observed in 2022 and which is still ongoing  the board of directors has assessed that a rights issue would require underwriting commitments in amounts close to the full amount sought  which the board assesses that it would not be able to obtain on acceptable terms under current market conditions. In any case  the costs for the necessary underwriting commitments and advisers in a rights issue would have used up a large part of the subscription price  which would have been to the detriment to the Company and its shareholders compared to the directed issues at hand. The board of directors has therefore made the assessment that directed share issues on the terms described in this release is the most favorable alternative for the Company and in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. Subscription shall be made on a subscription list not later than 22 November 2022. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The new shares are issued at a subscription price of SEK 1.425 per share. The part of the subscription price exceeding the quotient value of the previous shares shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. The subscription price for the new shares has been determined in negotiations between the Company and the persons entitled to subscribe for shares in the share issues resolved on by the board on 20 November 2022. Payment for new shares shall be made not later than 22 November 2022. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the payment period. The new shares entitle to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividend that take place after the issue of new shares has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and been recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The managing director  or any other person appointed by the board of directors  shall have the right to take those smaller measures that may be required in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Majority requirementsAn approval by the general meeting of the board of director's resolution is valid only if supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.DocumentationThe complete proposals of the board of directors are included in this notice. The complete proposals as well as other documents according to the Swedish Companies Act will also be held available at the Company's premises with address Metallgatan 6  262 72 √Ñngelholm and on the Company's website at the latest on 29 November 2022.

Out of the total amount  SEK 68‚Ä¶","√ÑNGELHOLM  Sweden  Nov. 25  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On 20 November 2022  the board of directors of OXE Marine AB (publ) (the ""Company"") resolved to raise SEK 70 m by way of a directed share issue of in total 49 122 807 new shares. Out of the total amount  SEK 68.575 m  corresponding to 48 122 807 new shares  was resolved by the board under the mandate from the annual general meeting and was directed to a group of existing and new investors. The remaining amount of SEK 1.425 m  corresponding to 1 000 000 shares  was directed to Alpraaz AB  a company owned by board member Christian von Koenigsegg  and was therefore resolved by the board subject to the general meeting's approval in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (Lex Leo).Against the above background  the board of directors hereby convenes an extraordinary meeting on 13 December 2022 as per the below notice.EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING IN OXE MARINE AB (PUBL)The shareholders in OXE Marine AB (publ)  reg. no 556889-7226 (the ""Company"")  are convened to the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held on Tuesday 13 December 2022.The board of directors has resolved  in accordance with the act (2022:121) on temporary exceptions to facilitate the execution of general meetings in companies and other associations  that the general meeting shall be held without the physical presence of shareholders  proxies or any third parties  and that the shareholders' voting rights may only be exercised in advance by postal voting.Right to attend and noticeShareholders who want to attend the extraordinary general meeting must:be recorded as a shareholder in the share register prepared by Euroclear Sweden AB ("" Euroclear "") relating to the circumstances on Monday 5 December 2022; and"") relating to the circumstances on Monday 5 December 2022; and notify their intention to attend the extraordinary general meeting no later than Monday 12 December 2022 by submitting their postal vote in accordance with the instructions set forth under the heading ""Postal voting"" below.Nominee-registered sharesShareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee must  in addition to notify their intention to attend the extraordinary general meeting  re-register their shares in their own name so that the shareholder is recorded in the share register on 5 December 2022. Such registration may be temporary (so-called voting right registration) and is requested from the nominee in accordance with the nominee's procedures and in such time in advance as the nominee determines. Voting right registrations duly effected by the nominee no later than 7 December 2022 will be regarded in the preparation of the share register.Postal votingThe shareholders may exercise their voting rights at the general meeting only by postal voting in accordance with sections 20 and 22 of the act (2022:121) on temporary exceptions to facilitate the execution of general meetings in companies and other associations. A special form shall be used for the postal voting  which will be made available on the Company's website. The postal vote will also constitute the shareholder's notification of participation. Shareholders may not provide the postal vote with any special instructions or conditions. If so  the vote (i.e. the postal vote in its entirety) is invalid. Further instructions and conditions will be set forth in the postal voting form.The completed postal voting form must have been received by Advokatfirman Lindahl no later than Monday 12 December 2022. The form shall be sent by e-mail to [email protected] or by post to Advokatfirman Lindahl KB  att. Lisa Lantz  Box 11911  404 39 G√∂teborg. Shareholders who are legal entities shall enclose a certificate of registration or equivalent authorization document to the postal voting form.A shareholder may in the postal voting form request that one or several matters in the proposed agenda is postponed to a so called continued general meeting  which may not be held solely by postal voting. Such a continued general meeting shall be convened if the general meeting resolves in accordance with such request or if shareholders representing at least one tenth of all shares in the Company so request.ProxyShareholders who wish to be represented by a proxy must submit a dated proxy form. If the proxy is executed by a legal person  a copy of the certificate of registration or equivalent authorization document must be enclosed. The proxy form may not be valid for a period longer than five years from its issuance. The original proxy form and certificate of registration should be enclosed to the postal voting form. The Company provides a form of proxy at request and it is also available at the Company's website  www.oxemarine.com.Proposed agendaOpening of the general meeting and election of chairman of the general meeting Preparation and approval of the voting list Election of one or several persons to verify the minutes of the meeting Determination of whether the meeting has been duly convened Approval of the agenda Resolution to approve the board of director's resolution to issue new shares Close of the general meetingProposalsItem 1 - Election of chairman of the general meetingThe board of directors proposes that attorney-at-law Mikael Mellberg is elected as chairman of the general meeting.Item 2 - Preparation and approval of the voting listThe board of directors proposes that the voting list to be approved is the voting list prepared by Advokatfirman Lindahl based on the Company's EGM share register and the received postal votes.Item 3 - Election of one or several persons to verify the minutes of the meetingThe board of directors proposes that Theodor Jeansson is elected to verify the minutes of the general meeting.Item 6 - Resolution to approve the board of director's resolution to issue new sharesThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the board of directors' resolution on 20 November 2022 (subject to approval by the general meeting) to increase the Company's share capital with not more than SEK 29 984.62 by an issue of not more than 1 000 000 new shares on the terms and conditions set out below:The right to subscribe for new shares shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  belong to Alpraaz AB  reg. no. 556451-9378  a company owned by the Company's board member Christian von Koenigsegg. In connection with the resolution on this share issue  the board has also resolved  as authorized by the general meeting on 2 May 2022   on a directed share issue to a group of existing and new investors on the same terms as for this issue. Thus  the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right in this issue is the same as for the other directed share issue  namely to  in a time and cost-effective way  secure the Company's need for additional funding. The board of directors has made an overall assessment of the various alternatives at hand and has carefully considered the possibility of raising the required capital by carrying out a share issue with preferential rights for the existing shareholders. After close evaluation together with its advisers  the board of directors has concluded that a preferential rights issue would entail a significant risk that the Company would not be able to raise the required funding  the main reason being that a rights issue would be significantly more time-consuming and therefore subject to higher market risk exposure compared to a directed issue. As a consequence  especially due to the higher than normal market volatility observed in 2022 and which is still ongoing  the board of directors has assessed that a rights issue would require underwriting commitments in amounts close to the full amount sought  which the board assesses that it would not be able to obtain on acceptable terms under current market conditions. In any case  the costs for the necessary underwriting commitments and advisers in a rights issue would have used up a large part of the subscription price  which would have been to the detriment to the Company and its shareholders compared to the directed issues at hand. The board of directors has therefore made the assessment that directed share issues on the terms described in this release is the most favorable alternative for the Company and in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. Subscription shall be made on a subscription list not later than 22 November 2022 . The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The new shares are issued at a subscription price of SEK 1.425 per share. The part of the subscription price exceeding the quotient value of the previous shares shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. The subscription price for the new shares has been determined in negotiations between the Company and the persons entitled to subscribe for shares in the share issues resolved on by the board on 20 November 2022 . Payment for new shares shall be made not later than 22 November 2022 . The board of directors shall have the right to extend the payment period. The new shares entitle to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividend that take place after the issue of new shares has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and been recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The managing director  or any other person appointed by the board of directors  shall have the right to take those smaller measures that may be required in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Majority requirementsAn approval by the general meeting of the board of director's resolution is valid only if supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.DocumentationThe complete proposals of the board of directors are included in this notice. The complete proposals as well as other documents according to the Swedish Companies Act will also be held available at the Company's premises with address Metallgatan 6  262 72 √Ñngelholm and on the Company's website at the latest on 29 November 2022. The documents will also be sent without charge to shareholders who so request and inform the Company of their postal address.Information to shareholdersUpon the request of a shareholder  and where the board of directors believes that so may take place without significant harm to the Company  the board of directors and the CEO shall provide information in respect of any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda  and any circumstances which may affect the assessment of the Company's financial position. A request for such information shall be sent by e-mail to [email protected] or by post to Advokatfirman Lindahl KB  att.

In the coming years  market participants expect the settlement timeframe to substantially shorten as technology continue to advance and as more jurisdictions move to a T+1 settlement cycle where the settlement of a transaction occurs less than 24 hours from the day of transaction  a new study by Citi found.The second edition of Citi‚Äôs Securities Services Evolution whitepaper  released on November 02  2022  shares the results of a survey of nearly 300 industry participants including custodians  banks  broker dealers  asset managers and institutional investors. The survey sought to understand their views and predictions for the future of the global securities market ecosystem.Findings from the study show that market participants from around the world increasingly believe that shorter settlement cycles are the forthcoming reality.Of the ~300 market participants polled  51% think T+1 will be the prevailing settlement timeframe for equities to be T+1 by 2026  up seven points from last year.The survey also found a notable increase in those regarding immediate atomic settlement as the likely 2026 settlement timeframe  from 18% last year to 20% now.Overall  85% of respondents expect settlement to be at T+1  T+0 or atomic over the same timeframe  versus 78% in 2021.This rise  the report says  can be explained by a drive from regulators to accelerate settlement cycles.In the securities industry  the settlement period refers to the time between the trade date ‚Äì the day on which the order was executed ‚Äì and the settlement date ‚Äì the date when a trade is final and that the buyer must make payment to the seller while the seller delivers the assets to the buyer.The abbreviations T+1  T+2  and T+3 refer to the settlement dates of security transactions that occur on a transaction date (‚ÄúT‚Äù) plus one day  plus two days  and plus three days  respectively. T+0 refers to same day settlement  while atomic settlement refers to real-time  immediate settlement.Currently  most securities transactions settle within a couple of days of the actual trade date  but a combination of better technology  the sheer volume of securities trading and regulatory momentum have allowed this window to be reduced over time.Europe  in pioneer in the domain  moved to a T+2 basis back in 2014. This was followed in 2017 by the US  Canada  Mexico  Peru and Argentina. Leading Asia-Pacific (APAC) markets including Australia  India  Indonesia  Japan  Hong Kong  Korea  New Zealand  Singapore and Taiwan  have also migrated to T+2.Now  several jurisdictions have announced their intention to shorten settlement cycles even further and move to a T+1 basis. India is taking a phased approach to this migration  which commenced in February 2022  while the US and Canada are planning to adopt T+1 in 2024.DLT and tokenizationChanges in securities settlement processes are also being driven by the rise of digital assets. Renewed interest in the sector over the past two years has prompted industry participants to start exploring the potential of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenization in securities markets  the report notes.Last year  Deutsche B√∂rse  Deutsche Bundesbank and Germany‚Äôs Finance Agency completed the testing of a blockchain-based settlement interface for electronic securities. The pilot made use of tokenization and DLT to digitize securities and make the settlement process much faster and more efficient.In the broader European Union (EU)  the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)  the bloc‚Äôs securities markets regulator  is currently developing the trading and settlement of tokenized securities  or digital representations of traditional securities  utilizing DLT.In Switzerland  the Swiss National Bank  the BIS Innovation Hub and the financial infrastructure operator SIX have been collaborating on Project Helvetia since 2020  an initiative which focuses on exploring the settlement of tokenized assets in central bank money.Interest in digital assets was reflected by the market participants surveyed by Citi with 88% of those polled by the bank indicating that their organization was either actively participating in  or exploring use cases for digital assets  blockchain or DLT.Market participants have clear expectations of tokenization  with more than 90% of respondents believing that tokenization will be either extremely or moderately valuable in terms of increasing market liquidity.They are also optimistic on the possible cost savings opportunities brought about DLT market infrastructure. A quarter of respondents anticipate that DLT-based market infrastructure could cut post trade processing costs by 31-50% and 54% expecting it will produce savings of 10-30%.Featured image credit: edited from Freepik,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.92,0.07,0.0,True,English,"['Market Participants', 'Settlement Cycle', 'Potential', 'DLT', 'Tokenization', 'Leading Asia-Pacific (APAC) markets', 'possible cost savings opportunities', 'post trade processing costs', 'Securities Services Evolution whitepaper', 'global securities market ecosystem', 'BIS Innovation Hub', 'financial infrastructure operator', 'Featured image credit', 'Deutsche B√∂rse', 'broader European Union', 'DLT-based market infrastructure', 'Swiss National Bank', 'central bank money', 'securities markets regulator', 'real-time, immediate settlement', 'blockchain-based settlement interface', 'past two years', 'most securities transactions', 'distributed ledger technology', 'immediate atomic settlement', 'securities settlement processes', 'shorter settlement cycles', 'actual trade date', 'prevailing settlement timeframe', 'T+1 settlement cycle', 'DLT market infrastructure', 'same day settlement', 'European Securities', 'same timeframe', 'Markets Authority', 'coming years', 'security transactions', 'Deutsche Bundesbank', 'securities industry', 'electronic securities', 'tokenized securities', 'traditional securities', 'market participants', 'market liquidity', '2026 settlement timeframe', 'settlement landscape', 'settlement period', 'settlement date', 'two days', 'major transformation', 'accelerated pace', 'second edition', '300 industry participants', 'broker dealers', 'asset managers', 'institutional investors', 'forthcoming reality', 'last year', 'notable increase', 'sheer volume', 'regulatory momentum', 'T+2 basis', 'Hong Kong', 'New Zealand', 'phased approach', 'Finance Agency', 'digital representations', 'Project Helvetia', 'clear expectations', 'A quarter', 'securities trading', 'digital assets', 'tokenized assets', 'technology development', 'one day', 'three days', 'T+1 basis', 'new study', 'several jurisdictions', 'transaction date', 'DLT.', 'clearing', 'brick', 'adoption', 'Citi', 'November', 'results', 'survey', 'custodians', 'banks', 'views', 'predictions', 'future', 'Findings', 'world', 'equities', 'likely', 'respondents', 'rise', 'report', 'drive', 'regulators', 'order', 'buyer', 'payment', 'seller', 'abbreviations', 'T+0', 'couple', 'combination', 'window', 'pioneer', 'domain', 'Canada', 'Mexico', 'Peru', 'Argentina', 'Australia', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Singapore', 'Taiwan', 'intention', 'migration', 'February', 'tokenization', 'Changes', 'interest', 'sector', 'potential', 'Germany', 'testing', 'pilot', 'use', 'ESMA', 'Switzerland', 'SIX', 'initiative', 'organization', 'cases', 'terms', 'increasing', 'Freepik', '24']",2022-11-25,2022-11-25,fintechnews.ch

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces that following a competitive process  it has entered into an agreement to sell VEON‚Äôs Russian operations to certain senior members of the management team of PJSC VimpelCom (‚ÄúVimpelCom‚Äù)  led by its current CEO Aleksander Torbakhov.The management buy-out of VimpelCom implies an expected enterprise value of approximately RUB 370 billion  representing an expected enterprise value / 2022E EBITDA multiple of 3.2x. On a standalone basis  for the twelve months ended 30 September 2022  VimpelCom generated revenue of RUB 339 billion and EBITDA of RUB 115 billion.Under the agreement  VEON will receive total consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately USD 2.1 billion1).

This method was shown to be robust  rapid and sensitive which is a prerequisite for conducting in vivo pharmacokinetic studies.The paper is titled  ‚ÄúDetermination of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate octaacetate and its metabolites in plasma of rats for pharmacokinetic study by ultra-performance-liquid-chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass-spectrometry‚Äù has been published in Frontiers in Pharmacology which can be downloaded at the following website address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36304154/.Dr Thomas Lee  Head of Research and Development of Aptorum Group commented  ‚ÄúWe are pleased to have this assay developed by The Chinese University of Hong Kong via our collaboration. Pro-EGCG is a prodrug of EGCG via octa-acetylation. As expected  it will be metabolized in multiple steps to EGCG and therefore monitoring of these metabolites at the same time is a major challenge. Heartfelt thanks to our collaborators  especially Prof. Ronald Chi Chiu Wang  at The Chinese University of Hong Kong  their hard work has translated to a sensitive  robust LC/MS assay which can monitor multiple Pro-EGCG and its metabolites in the plasma. Developing a sensitive assay is a necessary step before conducting in vivo IND-enabling studies such as GLP-compliant pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies. We believe the same assay can be further optimized for eventual Phase 1 clinical trials in humans.‚ÄùAbout Aptorum‚Äôs Pro-EGCG ProgramPro-EGCG is a novel small molecule designed for oral administration as a potential non-hormonal based treatment for Endometriosis. The endometriosis condition is a painful disorder where the endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus  potentially affecting ovaries  fallopian tubes and pelvis tissue  in severe cases affecting fertility. It has been estimated that endometriosis affects c. 10% of reproductive age women and girls according to the World Health Organisation1.1. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis#:~:text=Endometriosis%20affects%20roughly%2010%25%20(190 and%20girls%20globally%20(2).About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications)  autoimmune and infectious diseases.

These results have been driven by the strong demand for Champagne around the world  and the efforts made over the past few years on the Group's value policy  which have resulted in significant price/mix effects for several years. However  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits. The Laurent-Perrier Group is therefore maintaining its strategic course by continuing to rely on the quality of its Champagnes  the quality of its teams  the strength of its brands and the control of its distribution. ""Change in turnover:During the period from 1 April 2022 to 30 September 2022  the champagne market grew in volumes shipped  reaching +3.5% compared to FY N-1  the latter already showing strong growth compared to the market situation before the covid pandemic.Story continuesDuring this same period  the Group once again experienced strong growth in sales volume of 12.4% compared to FY N-1. In addition to consumer enthusiasm for Champagne  this performance is also supported by the strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its top-of-the-range champagnes  thus driving consolidated sales for the first half of the year (Champagne sales) to ‚Ç¨159.3 million at current exchange rates.Change in profit :During the first half of 2022-2023  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This investment in sales enhancement contributes to the strength of the brands and the price/mix effect. The Group's operating margin reached 33.3% at current exchange rates. The Group share of net profit also rose sharply. It stands at ‚Ç¨36.9 million at current exchange rates and thus represents 23.1% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in operational cash flow and financial structure:Operational cash flow for the period shows a strong increase due to growth in operational activity  pressure on stocks and the impact of previous harvests. It therefore stood at +‚Ç¨30.7 million at 30 September 2022. These factors should reverse in the second half.The interim consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2022 reaffirms the strength of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to ‚Ç¨524.3 million and net debt (*) stood at ‚Ç¨202.5 million including available cash of ‚Ç¨133.4 million. Gearing thus improved further to 0.38 from 0.45 at 31 March 2022.(*) Net debt: financial liabilities and other non-current debts + current debts ‚Äì active cashOutlookThe Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the results published for the first half of the year cannot be extrapolated to its full 2022-2023 financial year. Indeed  the geopolitical context linked to the war in Ukraine  strong inflationary pressure and resulting monetary policies oblige the Group to be very cautious about the outlook for the coming months. Moreover  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits.The Laurent-Perrier Group is confidently and attentively pursuing its 2021-2025 business plan and maintaining its value strategy based on the following 4 pillars:Exclusive focus on producing and selling high-end champagnesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distributionLaurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

Prospective investors must be able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the New Shares  the Preferential Rights or the Scrips and should be able to sustain a partial or total loss of their investment. Before making any investment decision  the investors must read the prospectus  approved by the FSMA on 15 November 2022 and available on the website (www.vgpparks.eu)  in its entirety (and  in particular  the section on Risk factors starting on page 9). Investors should in particular note that the Issuer‚Äôs solvability and liquidity depends on the sustainability of its development activities  its ability to execute new lease agreements and its sales cycles of completed projects to the Second Joint Venture and the Fourth Joint Venture  taking into account the postponement of the first closing with the Fourth Joint Venture.During the Subscription Period with Preferential Rights  which closed on 24 November 2022 (16:00 CET)  5 153 976 New Shares  or 94.43% of the maximum number of New Shares offered for subscription  have been subscribed for at a subscription price of EUR 55.50 per New Share  on the basis of 1 New Share for 4 Preferential Rights.The 1 217 146 unexercised Preferential Rights have automatically been converted into an equal number of Scrips. These Scrips will be be sold in a private placement with qualified investors in Belgium and by way of a private placement exempt from prospectus requirements or similar formalities in such other jurisdictions as will be determined by the Issuer in consultation with the Global Coordinators. The Scrips Private Placement will be conducted in reliance on Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933  as amended. The Scrips Private Placement will be organised by way of an accelerated book-building procedure  in order to determine a single market price per Scrip. The Private Placement of Scrips will take place as from the publication of this press release and is expected to end on the same day. Investors who acquire Scrips enter into an irrevocable commitment to exercise the Scrips and thus to subscribe for the corresponding number of New Shares at the Issue Price and in accordance with the Ratio  i.e.  1 New Share (at EUR 55.50 per New Share) for 4 Preferential Rights in the form of Scrips.Story continuesThe net proceeds from the sale of Scrips (rounded down to a whole eurocent per unexercised Preferential Right) after deducting expenses  charges and all forms of expenditure which the Issuer has to incur for the sale of the Scrips (the ‚ÄúNet Scrips Proceeds‚Äù)  if any  will be distributed proportionally between all holders of unexercised Preferential Rights and will be paid to the holders of such unexercised Preferential Rights upon presentation of coupon n¬∞ 11  as from 30 November 2022. If the Net Scrips Proceeds are less than EUR 0.01 per unexercised Preferential Right  the holders of such unexercised Preferential Rights are not entitled to receive any payment and  instead  the Net Scrips Proceeds will be transferred to the Issuer.The results of the subscriptions for New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Scrips and the Net Scrips Proceeds due to the holders of unexercised Preferential Rights  will be published in a press release on the Company‚Äôs website  in principle later today  25 November 2022.The payment and delivery of the New Shares is expected to be carried out with a value date as per 29 November 2022 and the subscribers‚Äô account will be debited on the same date (subject to the relevant financial intermediary procedures) (except for subscriptions with Preferential Rights attached to registered Existing Shares  for which the payment had to reach the Company by 24 November 2022 at 16:00 CET).The New Shares will in principle be tradable on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels as from 29 November 2022.The trading of the shares of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels was  at the Company‚Äôs request  suspended as from the opening of the markets earlier today  25 November 2022  until the publication of the press release relating to the results of the Offering (after completion of the Private Placement of Scrips).Any decision to invest in securities in the framework of the Offering must be based on all information provided in the Prospectus  and any supplements thereto  as the case may be.

However  a recent issue in the electricity transmission grid has created unplanned power outages. Kenmare is actively working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the problem but the outages have resulted in lower production  and consequently  we are revising our ilmenite guidance.Q4 is expected to be our strongest quarter of shipments  which will not be impacted by lower production  and Q4 prices remain strong.‚Äù2022 guidanceKenmare informed the market in its Q3 2022 Production Report  dated 13 October 2022  that it expected production to be at or around the bottom of the Company‚Äôs 2022 guidance ranges. During October 2022  Kenmare achieved an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite production  in line with original guidance and driven by the Company‚Äôs robust performance in Q3 2022. However  more recently  Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) production weakened due to unplanned power outages.Consequently  2022 guidance for production of ilmenite and rutile is updated as follows:Unit Updated2022 Guidance Previous2022 Guidance Production Ilmenite tonnes 1 080 000-1 110 000 1 125 000-1 225 000 Primary zircon tonnes Unchanged 54 400-63 200 Rutile tonnes 8 500-9 500 9 500-11 500 Concentrates1 tonnes Unchanged 40 300-46 800Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.The lower end of the revised guidance ranges assumes a continuation of recent power disruptions until the end of the year. However  Kenmare is working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the issues as a matter of urgency.Story continuesProduction guidance for primary zircon and concentrates is unchanged due to higher zircon content in the HMC mined and stronger recoveries.Q4 2022 is anticipated to be the strongest quarter of the year for shipments  due to seasonally favourable weather conditions and unrestricted shipping capacity.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to be very slightly above the top end of 2022 guidance ($190-210 million)  due primarily to higher fuel prices. Cash operating costs per tonne will be a function of lower production volumes and higher operating costs.Kenmare expects to announce its Q4 and Full Year 2022 Production Report  which will include 2023 guidance  in mid-January 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O‚ÄôKanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

These results have been driven by the strong demand for Champagne around the world  and the efforts made over the past few years on the Group's value policy  which have resulted in significant price/mix effects for several years. However  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits. The Laurent-Perrier Group is therefore maintaining its strategic course by continuing to rely on the quality of its Champagnes  the quality of its teams  the strength of its brands and the control of its distribution. ""Change in turnover:During the period from 1 April 2022 to 30 September 2022  the champagne market grew in volumes shipped  reaching +3.5% compared to FY N-1  the latter already showing strong growth compared to the market situation before the covid pandemic.During this same period  the Group once again experienced strong growth in sales volume of 12.4% compared to FY N-1. In addition to consumer enthusiasm for Champagne  this performance is also supported by the strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its top-of-the-range champagnes  thus driving consolidated sales for the first half of the year (Champagne sales) to ‚Ç¨159.3 million at current exchange rates.Change in profit :During the first half of 2022-2023  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This investment in sales enhancement contributes to the strength of the brands and the price/mix effect. The Group's operating margin reached 33.3% at current exchange rates. The Group share of net profit also rose sharply. It stands at ‚Ç¨36.9 million at current exchange rates and thus represents 23.1% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in operational cash flow and financial structure:Operational cash flow for the period shows a strong increase due to growth in operational activity  pressure on stocks and the impact of previous harvests. It therefore stood at +‚Ç¨30.7 million at 30 September 2022. These factors should reverse in the second half.The interim consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2022 reaffirms the strength of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to ‚Ç¨524.3 million and net debt (*) stood at ‚Ç¨202.5 million including available cash of ‚Ç¨133.4 million. Gearing thus improved further to 0.38 from 0.45 at 31 March 2022.(*) Net debt: financial liabilities and other non-current debts + current debts ‚Äì active cashOutlookThe Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the results published for the first half of the year cannot be extrapolated to its full 2022-2023 financial year. Indeed  the geopolitical context linked to the war in Ukraine  strong inflationary pressure and resulting monetary policies oblige the Group to be very cautious about the outlook for the coming months. Moreover  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits.The Laurent-Perrier Group is confidently and attentively pursuing its 2021-2025 business plan and maintaining its value strategy based on the following 4 pillars:Exclusive focus on producing and selling high-end champagnesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distributionLaurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

Investors who acquire Scrips enter into an irrevocable commitment to exercise the Scrips and thus to subscribe for the corresponding number of New Shares at the Issue Price and in accordance with the Ratio  i.e.  1 New Share (at EUR 55.50 per New Share) for 4 Preferential Rights in the form of Scrips.The net proceeds from the sale of Scrips (rounded down to a whole eurocent per unexercised Preferential Right) after deducting expenses  charges and all forms of expenditure which the Issuer has to incur for the sale of the Scrips (the ‚ÄúNet Scrips Proceeds‚Äù)  if any  will be distributed proportionally between all holders of unexercised Preferential Rights and will be paid to the holders of such unexercised Preferential Rights upon presentation of coupon n¬∞ 11  as from 30 November 2022. If the Net Scrips Proceeds are less than EUR 0.01 per unexercised Preferential Right  the holders of such unexercised Preferential Rights are not entitled to receive any payment and  instead  the Net Scrips Proceeds will be transferred to the Issuer.The results of the subscriptions for New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Scrips and the Net Scrips Proceeds due to the holders of unexercised Preferential Rights  will be published in a press release on the Company‚Äôs website  in principle later today  25 November 2022.The payment and delivery of the New Shares is expected to be carried out with a value date as per 29 November 2022 and the subscribers‚Äô account will be debited on the same date (subject to the relevant financial intermediary procedures) (except for subscriptions with Preferential Rights attached to registered Existing Shares  for which the payment had to reach the Company by 24 November 2022 at 16:00 CET).The New Shares will in principle be tradable on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels as from 29 November 2022.The trading of the shares of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels was  at the Company‚Äôs request  suspended as from the opening of the markets earlier today  25 November 2022  until the publication of the press release relating to the results of the Offering (after completion of the Private Placement of Scrips).Any decision to invest in securities in the framework of the Offering must be based on all information provided in the Prospectus  and any supplements thereto  as the case may be. The approval of the Prospectus by the FSMA should not be understood as an endorsement of the new shares offered.*****Belfius Bank NV in cooperation with Kepler Cheuvreux S.A.

However  a recent issue in the electricity transmission grid has created unplanned power outages. Kenmare is actively working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the problem but the outages have resulted in lower production  and consequently  we are revising our ilmenite guidance.Q4 is expected to be our strongest quarter of shipments  which will not be impacted by lower production  and Q4 prices remain strong.‚Äù2022 guidanceKenmare informed the market in its Q3 2022 Production Report  dated 13 October 2022  that it expected production to be at or around the bottom of the Company‚Äôs 2022 guidance ranges. During October 2022  Kenmare achieved an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite production  in line with original guidance and driven by the Company‚Äôs robust performance in Q3 2022. However  more recently  Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) production weakened due to unplanned power outages.Consequently  2022 guidance for production of ilmenite and rutile is updated as follows:Unit Updated2022 Guidance Previous2022 Guidance Production Ilmenite tonnes 1 080 000-1 110 000 1 125 000-1 225 000 Primary zircon tonnes Unchanged 54 400-63 200 Rutile tonnes 8 500-9 500 9 500-11 500 Concentrates1 tonnes Unchanged 40 300-46 800Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.The lower end of the revised guidance ranges assumes a continuation of recent power disruptions until the end of the year. However  Kenmare is working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the issues as a matter of urgency.Production guidance for primary zircon and concentrates is unchanged due to higher zircon content in the HMC mined and stronger recoveries.Q4 2022 is anticipated to be the strongest quarter of the year for shipments  due to seasonally favourable weather conditions and unrestricted shipping capacity.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to be very slightly above the top end of 2022 guidance ($190-210 million)  due primarily to higher fuel prices. Cash operating costs per tonne will be a function of lower production volumes and higher operating costs.Kenmare expects to announce its Q4 and Full Year 2022 Production Report  which will include 2023 guidance  in mid-January 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O‚ÄôKanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

Italy  February 25  2020. REUTERS/Flavio Lo ScalzoSummarySummary Companies Atlantia to be delisted after buyoutMany Italian companies steer clear of stock marketAuthorities seeking to boost standing of Borsa ItalianaMILAN  Nov 25 (Reuters) - The buyout of Atlantia (ATL.MI) will cut another 19 billion euros ($19.5 billion) from the value of the Milan bourse and bring to 12 the number of companies to leave the stock exchange this year  fuelling fears about its standing.Legislators and regulators want to reverse the trend and reinforce the role of the 200-year-old Borsa Italiana at the heart of Italian business.Barbara Lunghi  head of equity listings Italy at market owner Euronext  argues the scrutiny of being a listed business and having external investors pushes businesses to innovate and develop.""It gives companies that extra gear that helps to drive growth "" Lunghi said.But the problem has deep roots  with many of Italy's family-run businesses unwilling to relinquish control by listing their businesses unless they need cash for M&A or other expansion strategies.Market watchdog Consob approved measures this year to simplify procedures for the approval of IPO prospectuses  including allowing them to be submitted in English.Also aiming to accelerate change  Italy this year started to study how to overhaul its listing  voting and other rules to address the issues holding back the country's capital markets - though this process was frozen by a change in government after a right-wing coalition won elections at the end of September.MILAN EXODUSSo far this year 11 companies have abandoned Euronext Milan  including the Agnelli family's holding company Exor (EXOR.AS)  which moved to the Amsterdam bourse in line with where it is legally registered.Road and airport operator Atlantia is leaving after a buyout by the Benetton family and Blackstone passed the 90% support threshold on Thursday.Travel caterer Autogrill (AGL.MI) is expected to be delisted after a merger with Switzerland's Dufry  and the fate of shoemaker Tod's (TOD.MI) remains uncertain after the failure of a buyout offer by its main shareholder.CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI)  whose shares are listed both in Milan and New York  is also evaluating the possibility of putting an end to its dual listing and focusing on the NYSE.Taking listed companies private is a broader trend shared by many European stock exchanges  as low prices and availability of cheap money made it convenient.snapshotFEW NEWCOMERSOn the plus side  four companies joined the main Euronext Milan market this year  including truckmaker Iveco (IVG.MI)  which was the result of a spin off. Two other companies upgraded from the smaller Euronext Growth Milan.The situation is healthier for Euronext Growth Milan itself  a market dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises with minimum access requirements. In 2022 it counted 18 new listings  but the overall market cap is very low.A dearth of Italian IPOs is a perennial issue.Over the past 20 years  the main market has lost 268 listed companies and gained only 185  according to Intermonte research published in March. In contrast  the less regulated SME market has attracted 263 listed companies and seen 68 delistings.CULTURAL ISSUEThe fact that there are relatively few listed companies has its roots in the country's history  said Andrea Beltratti  professor of Political Economy at Milan's Bocconi University.Beltratti said Italy lacks a long tradition of equity finance and its economy has been relatively weak for the last 20 years.The heavy presence of banks and other financial intermediaries in Italy has supplanted the role of the markets  so companies often preferred to ask them for funding.""The benefits of being listed are the ease of collecting capital and reputational (position)  but there are also costs  associated with regulation  the need for transparency  and the many interactions with investors""  Beltratti said.""I don't think these are issues that can be solved in months or even years because it is a cultural issue "" Beltratti added.

Two other companies upgraded from the smaller Euronext Growth Milan.The situation is healthier for Euronext Growth Milan itself  a market dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises with minimum access requirements. In 2022 it counted 18 new listings  but the overall market cap is very low.A dearth of Italian IPOs is a perennial issue.Over the past 20 years  the main market has lost 268 listed companies and gained only 185  according to Intermonte research published in March. In contrast  the less regulated SME market has attracted 263 listed companies and seen 68 delistings.CULTURAL ISSUEThe fact that there are relatively few listed companies has its roots in the country's history  said Andrea Beltratti  professor of Political Economy at Milan's Bocconi University.Beltratti said Italy lacks a long tradition of equity finance and its economy has been relatively weak for the last 20 years.The heavy presence of banks and other financial intermediaries in Italy has supplanted the role of the markets  so companies often preferred to ask them for funding.""The benefits of being listed are the ease of collecting capital and reputational (position)  but there are also costs  associated with regulation  the need for transparency  and the many interactions with investors""  Beltratti said.""I don't think these are issues that can be solved in months or even years because it is a cultural issue "" Beltratti added.($1 = 0.9755 euros)(Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; Graphic by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Keith Weir and David Holmes)",neutral,0.01,0.86,0.13,mixed,0.2,0.19,0.61,True,English,"['Atlantia exit', 'Milan', 'battle', 'market', 'heavyweights', 'less regulated SME market', 'many European stock exchanges', 'smaller Euronext Growth Milan', 'main Euronext Milan market', '200-year-old Borsa Italiana', 'Travel caterer Autogrill', 'minimum access requirements', 'other expansion strategies', 'other financial intermediaries', 'overall market cap', 'Milan%20stock%20market', 'Milan market cap', 'Two other companies', 'main market', 'many interactions', 'other rules', 'main shareholder', 'market owner', 'Market watchdog', 'Milan bourse', 'MILAN EXODUS', 'Elisa Anzolin', 'Italian business', 'equity listings', 'listed business', 'extra gear', 'M&A', 'IPO prospectuses', 'right-wing coalition', 'Agnelli family', 'holding company', 'Amsterdam bourse', 'airport operator', 'Benetton family', '90% support threshold', 'shoemaker Tod', 'CNH Industrial', 'New York', 'low prices', 'cheap money', 'FEW NEWCOMERS', 'plus side', 'truckmaker Iveco', 'medium-sized enterprises', '18 new listings', 'Italian IPOs', 'perennial issue', 'Intermonte research', 'CULTURAL ISSUE', 'Bocconi University', 'long tradition', 'equity finance', 'heavy presence', 'Danilo Masoni', 'Keith Weir', 'David Holmes', 'past 20 years', 'last 20 years', 'listed companies', 'four companies', '19 billion euros', 'Barbara Lunghi', 'external investors', 'deep roots', 'dual listing', 'broader trend', 'Political Economy', 'family-run businesses', 'buyout offer', 'Andrea Beltratti', 'capital markets', '11 companies', '0.9755 euros', 'Reuters', 'Atlantia', 'value', 'number', 'fears', 'standing', 'regulators', 'role', 'heart', 'head', 'Italy', 'scrutiny', 'problem', 'control', 'cash', 'Consob', 'measures', 'procedures', 'approval', 'English', 'voting', 'issues', 'country', 'process', 'government', 'elections', 'September', 'Exor', 'line', 'Blackstone', 'Thursday', 'merger', 'Switzerland', 'Dufry', 'fate', 'failure', 'shares', 'possibility', 'NYSE', 'Story', 'private', 'availability', 'Paris', 'London', 'result', 'spin', 'situation', 'dearth', 'March', 'contrast', '68 delistings', 'fact', 'professor', 'banks', 'funding', 'benefits', 'ease', 'position', 'costs', 'regulation', 'need', 'transparency', 'months', 'Graphic', 'Editing']",2022-11-25,2022-11-25,yahoo.com
