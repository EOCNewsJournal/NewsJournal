In connection with the resolution on this share issue  the board has also resolved  as authorized by the general meeting on 2 May 2022  on a directed share issue to a group of existing and new investors on the same terms as for this issue. Thus  the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right in this issue is the same as for the other directed share issue  namely to  in a time and cost-effective way  secure the Company's need for additional funding. The board of directors has made an overall assessment of the various alternatives at hand and has carefully considered the possibility of raising the required capital by carrying out a share issue with preferential rights for the existing shareholders. After close evaluation together with its advisers  the board of directors has concluded that a preferential rights issue would entail a significant risk that the Company would not be able to raise the required funding  the main reason being that a rights issue would be significantly more time-consuming and therefore subject to higher market risk exposure compared to a directed issue. As a consequence  especially due to the higher than normal market volatility observed in 2022 and which is still ongoing  the board of directors has assessed that a rights issue would require underwriting commitments in amounts close to the full amount sought  which the board assesses that it would not be able to obtain on acceptable terms under current market conditions. In any case  the costs for the necessary underwriting commitments and advisers in a rights issue would have used up a large part of the subscription price  which would have been to the detriment to the Company and its shareholders compared to the directed issues at hand. The board of directors has therefore made the assessment that directed share issues on the terms described in this release is the most favorable alternative for the Company and in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. Subscription shall be made on a subscription list not later than 22 November 2022. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The new shares are issued at a subscription price of SEK 1.425 per share. The part of the subscription price exceeding the quotient value of the previous shares shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. The subscription price for the new shares has been determined in negotiations between the Company and the persons entitled to subscribe for shares in the share issues resolved on by the board on 20 November 2022. Payment for new shares shall be made not later than 22 November 2022. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the payment period. The new shares entitle to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividend that take place after the issue of new shares has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and been recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The managing director  or any other person appointed by the board of directors  shall have the right to take those smaller measures that may be required in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Majority requirementsAn approval by the general meeting of the board of director's resolution is valid only if supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.DocumentationThe complete proposals of the board of directors are included in this notice. The complete proposals as well as other documents according to the Swedish Companies Act will also be held available at the Company's premises with address Metallgatan 6  262 72 √Ñngelholm and on the Company's website at the latest on 29 November 2022.

This method was shown to be robust  rapid and sensitive which is a prerequisite for conducting in vivo pharmacokinetic studies.The paper is titled  ‚ÄúDetermination of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate octaacetate and its metabolites in plasma of rats for pharmacokinetic study by ultra-performance-liquid-chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass-spectrometry‚Äù has been published in Frontiers in Pharmacology which can be downloaded at the following website address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36304154/.Dr Thomas Lee  Head of Research and Development of Aptorum Group commented  ‚ÄúWe are pleased to have this assay developed by The Chinese University of Hong Kong via our collaboration. Pro-EGCG is a prodrug of EGCG via octa-acetylation. As expected  it will be metabolized in multiple steps to EGCG and therefore monitoring of these metabolites at the same time is a major challenge. Heartfelt thanks to our collaborators  especially Prof. Ronald Chi Chiu Wang  at The Chinese University of Hong Kong  their hard work has translated to a sensitive  robust LC/MS assay which can monitor multiple Pro-EGCG and its metabolites in the plasma. Developing a sensitive assay is a necessary step before conducting in vivo IND-enabling studies such as GLP-compliant pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies. We believe the same assay can be further optimized for eventual Phase 1 clinical trials in humans.‚ÄùAbout Aptorum‚Äôs Pro-EGCG ProgramPro-EGCG is a novel small molecule designed for oral administration as a potential non-hormonal based treatment for Endometriosis. The endometriosis condition is a painful disorder where the endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus  potentially affecting ovaries  fallopian tubes and pelvis tissue  in severe cases affecting fertility. It has been estimated that endometriosis affects c. 10% of reproductive age women and girls according to the World Health Organisation1.1. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis#:~:text=Endometriosis%20affects%20roughly%2010%25%20(190 and%20girls%20globally%20(2).About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications)  autoimmune and infectious diseases.

However  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits. The Laurent-Perrier Group is therefore maintaining its strategic course by continuing to rely on the quality of its Champagnes  the quality of its teams  the strength of its brands and the control of its distribution. ""Change in turnover:During the period from 1 April 2022 to 30 September 2022  the champagne market grew in volumes shipped  reaching +3.5% compared to FY N-1  the latter already showing strong growth compared to the market situation before the covid pandemic.Story continuesDuring this same period  the Group once again experienced strong growth in sales volume of 12.4% compared to FY N-1. In addition to consumer enthusiasm for Champagne  this performance is also supported by the strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its top-of-the-range champagnes  thus driving consolidated sales for the first half of the year (Champagne sales) to ‚Ç¨159.3 million at current exchange rates.Change in profit :During the first half of 2022-2023  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This investment in sales enhancement contributes to the strength of the brands and the price/mix effect. The Group's operating margin reached 33.3% at current exchange rates. The Group share of net profit also rose sharply. It stands at ‚Ç¨36.9 million at current exchange rates and thus represents 23.1% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in operational cash flow and financial structure:Operational cash flow for the period shows a strong increase due to growth in operational activity  pressure on stocks and the impact of previous harvests. It therefore stood at +‚Ç¨30.7 million at 30 September 2022. These factors should reverse in the second half.The interim consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2022 reaffirms the strength of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to ‚Ç¨524.3 million and net debt (*) stood at ‚Ç¨202.5 million including available cash of ‚Ç¨133.4 million. Gearing thus improved further to 0.38 from 0.45 at 31 March 2022.(*) Net debt: financial liabilities and other non-current debts + current debts ‚Äì active cashOutlookThe Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the results published for the first half of the year cannot be extrapolated to its full 2022-2023 financial year. Indeed  the geopolitical context linked to the war in Ukraine  strong inflationary pressure and resulting monetary policies oblige the Group to be very cautious about the outlook for the coming months. Moreover  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits.The Laurent-Perrier Group is confidently and attentively pursuing its 2021-2025 business plan and maintaining its value strategy based on the following 4 pillars:Exclusive focus on producing and selling high-end champagnesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distributionLaurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

However  a recent issue in the electricity transmission grid has created unplanned power outages. Kenmare is actively working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the problem but the outages have resulted in lower production  and consequently  we are revising our ilmenite guidance.Q4 is expected to be our strongest quarter of shipments  which will not be impacted by lower production  and Q4 prices remain strong.‚Äù2022 guidanceKenmare informed the market in its Q3 2022 Production Report  dated 13 October 2022  that it expected production to be at or around the bottom of the Company‚Äôs 2022 guidance ranges. During October 2022  Kenmare achieved an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite production  in line with original guidance and driven by the Company‚Äôs robust performance in Q3 2022. However  more recently  Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) production weakened due to unplanned power outages.Consequently  2022 guidance for production of ilmenite and rutile is updated as follows:Unit Updated2022 Guidance Previous2022 Guidance Production Ilmenite tonnes 1 080 000-1 110 000 1 125 000-1 225 000 Primary zircon tonnes Unchanged 54 400-63 200 Rutile tonnes 8 500-9 500 9 500-11 500 Concentrates1 tonnes Unchanged 40 300-46 800Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.The lower end of the revised guidance ranges assumes a continuation of recent power disruptions until the end of the year. However  Kenmare is working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the issues as a matter of urgency.Story continuesProduction guidance for primary zircon and concentrates is unchanged due to higher zircon content in the HMC mined and stronger recoveries.Q4 2022 is anticipated to be the strongest quarter of the year for shipments  due to seasonally favourable weather conditions and unrestricted shipping capacity.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to be very slightly above the top end of 2022 guidance ($190-210 million)  due primarily to higher fuel prices. Cash operating costs per tonne will be a function of lower production volumes and higher operating costs.Kenmare expects to announce its Q4 and Full Year 2022 Production Report  which will include 2023 guidance  in mid-January 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O‚ÄôKanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

These results have been driven by the strong demand for Champagne around the world  and the efforts made over the past few years on the Group's value policy  which have resulted in significant price/mix effects for several years. However  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits. The Laurent-Perrier Group is therefore maintaining its strategic course by continuing to rely on the quality of its Champagnes  the quality of its teams  the strength of its brands and the control of its distribution. ""Change in turnover:During the period from 1 April 2022 to 30 September 2022  the champagne market grew in volumes shipped  reaching +3.5% compared to FY N-1  the latter already showing strong growth compared to the market situation before the covid pandemic.During this same period  the Group once again experienced strong growth in sales volume of 12.4% compared to FY N-1. In addition to consumer enthusiasm for Champagne  this performance is also supported by the strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its top-of-the-range champagnes  thus driving consolidated sales for the first half of the year (Champagne sales) to ‚Ç¨159.3 million at current exchange rates.Change in profit :During the first half of 2022-2023  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This investment in sales enhancement contributes to the strength of the brands and the price/mix effect. The Group's operating margin reached 33.3% at current exchange rates. The Group share of net profit also rose sharply. It stands at ‚Ç¨36.9 million at current exchange rates and thus represents 23.1% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in operational cash flow and financial structure:Operational cash flow for the period shows a strong increase due to growth in operational activity  pressure on stocks and the impact of previous harvests. It therefore stood at +‚Ç¨30.7 million at 30 September 2022. These factors should reverse in the second half.The interim consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2022 reaffirms the strength of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to ‚Ç¨524.3 million and net debt (*) stood at ‚Ç¨202.5 million including available cash of ‚Ç¨133.4 million. Gearing thus improved further to 0.38 from 0.45 at 31 March 2022.(*) Net debt: financial liabilities and other non-current debts + current debts ‚Äì active cashOutlookThe Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the results published for the first half of the year cannot be extrapolated to its full 2022-2023 financial year. Indeed  the geopolitical context linked to the war in Ukraine  strong inflationary pressure and resulting monetary policies oblige the Group to be very cautious about the outlook for the coming months. Moreover  the capacity of the Champagne region and of the Group to serve a growing demand in volume will reach its limits.The Laurent-Perrier Group is confidently and attentively pursuing its 2021-2025 business plan and maintaining its value strategy based on the following 4 pillars:Exclusive focus on producing and selling high-end champagnesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distributionLaurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

Prospective investors must be able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the New Shares  the Preferential Rights or the Scrips and should be able to sustain a partial or total loss of their investment. Before making any investment decision  the investors must read the prospectus  approved by the FSMA on 15 November 2022 and available on the website (www.vgpparks.eu)  in its entirety (and  in particular  the section on Risk factors starting on page 9). Investors should in particular note that the Issuer‚Äôs solvability and liquidity depends on the sustainability of its development activities  its ability to execute new lease agreements and its sales cycles of completed projects to the Second Joint Venture and the Fourth Joint Venture  taking into account the postponement of the first closing with the Fourth Joint Venture.During the Subscription Period with Preferential Rights  which closed on 24 November 2022 (16:00 CET)  5 153 976 New Shares  or 94.43% of the maximum number of New Shares offered for subscription  have been subscribed for at a subscription price of EUR 55.50 per New Share  on the basis of 1 New Share for 4 Preferential Rights.The 1 217 146 unexercised Preferential Rights have automatically been converted into an equal number of Scrips. These Scrips will be be sold in a private placement with qualified investors in Belgium and by way of a private placement exempt from prospectus requirements or similar formalities in such other jurisdictions as will be determined by the Issuer in consultation with the Global Coordinators. The Scrips Private Placement will be conducted in reliance on Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933  as amended. The Scrips Private Placement will be organised by way of an accelerated book-building procedure  in order to determine a single market price per Scrip. The Private Placement of Scrips will take place as from the publication of this press release and is expected to end on the same day. Investors who acquire Scrips enter into an irrevocable commitment to exercise the Scrips and thus to subscribe for the corresponding number of New Shares at the Issue Price and in accordance with the Ratio  i.e.  1 New Share (at EUR 55.50 per New Share) for 4 Preferential Rights in the form of Scrips.The net proceeds from the sale of Scrips (rounded down to a whole eurocent per unexercised Preferential Right) after deducting expenses  charges and all forms of expenditure which the Issuer has to incur for the sale of the Scrips (the ‚ÄúNet Scrips Proceeds‚Äù)  if any  will be distributed proportionally between all holders of unexercised Preferential Rights and will be paid to the holders of such unexercised Preferential Rights upon presentation of coupon n¬∞ 11  as from 30 November 2022. If the Net Scrips Proceeds are less than EUR 0.01 per unexercised Preferential Right  the holders of such unexercised Preferential Rights are not entitled to receive any payment and  instead  the Net Scrips Proceeds will be transferred to the Issuer.The results of the subscriptions for New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Scrips and the Net Scrips Proceeds due to the holders of unexercised Preferential Rights  will be published in a press release on the Company‚Äôs website  in principle later today  25 November 2022.The payment and delivery of the New Shares is expected to be carried out with a value date as per 29 November 2022 and the subscribers‚Äô account will be debited on the same date (subject to the relevant financial intermediary procedures) (except for subscriptions with Preferential Rights attached to registered Existing Shares  for which the payment had to reach the Company by 24 November 2022 at 16:00 CET).The New Shares will in principle be tradable on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels as from 29 November 2022.The trading of the shares of the Company on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels was  at the Company‚Äôs request  suspended as from the opening of the markets earlier today  25 November 2022  until the publication of the press release relating to the results of the Offering (after completion of the Private Placement of Scrips).Any decision to invest in securities in the framework of the Offering must be based on all information provided in the Prospectus  and any supplements thereto  as the case may be. The approval of the Prospectus by the FSMA should not be understood as an endorsement of the new shares offered.*****Belfius Bank NV in cooperation with Kepler Cheuvreux S.A.

However  a recent issue in the electricity transmission grid has created unplanned power outages. Kenmare is actively working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the problem but the outages have resulted in lower production  and consequently  we are revising our ilmenite guidance.Q4 is expected to be our strongest quarter of shipments  which will not be impacted by lower production  and Q4 prices remain strong.‚Äù2022 guidanceKenmare informed the market in its Q3 2022 Production Report  dated 13 October 2022  that it expected production to be at or around the bottom of the Company‚Äôs 2022 guidance ranges. During October 2022  Kenmare achieved an annualised run rate of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite production  in line with original guidance and driven by the Company‚Äôs robust performance in Q3 2022. However  more recently  Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) production weakened due to unplanned power outages.Consequently  2022 guidance for production of ilmenite and rutile is updated as follows:Unit Updated2022 Guidance Previous2022 Guidance Production Ilmenite tonnes 1 080 000-1 110 000 1 125 000-1 225 000 Primary zircon tonnes Unchanged 54 400-63 200 Rutile tonnes 8 500-9 500 9 500-11 500 Concentrates1 tonnes Unchanged 40 300-46 800Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.The lower end of the revised guidance ranges assumes a continuation of recent power disruptions until the end of the year. However  Kenmare is working with the state electricity provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique  to identify and rectify the issues as a matter of urgency.Production guidance for primary zircon and concentrates is unchanged due to higher zircon content in the HMC mined and stronger recoveries.Q4 2022 is anticipated to be the strongest quarter of the year for shipments  due to seasonally favourable weather conditions and unrestricted shipping capacity.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to be very slightly above the top end of 2022 guidance ($190-210 million)  due primarily to higher fuel prices. Cash operating costs per tonne will be a function of lower production volumes and higher operating costs.Kenmare expects to announce its Q4 and Full Year 2022 Production Report  which will include 2023 guidance  in mid-January 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O‚ÄôKanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

Italy  February 25  2020. REUTERS/Flavio Lo ScalzoSummarySummary Companies Atlantia to be delisted after buyoutMany Italian companies steer clear of stock marketAuthorities seeking to boost standing of Borsa ItalianaMILAN  Nov 25 (Reuters) - The buyout of Atlantia (ATL.MI) will cut another 19 billion euros ($19.5 billion) from the value of the Milan bourse and bring to 12 the number of companies to leave the stock exchange this year  fuelling fears about its standing.Legislators and regulators want to reverse the trend and reinforce the role of the 200-year-old Borsa Italiana at the heart of Italian business.Barbara Lunghi  head of equity listings Italy at market owner Euronext  argues the scrutiny of being a listed business and having external investors pushes businesses to innovate and develop.""It gives companies that extra gear that helps to drive growth "" Lunghi said.But the problem has deep roots  with many of Italy's family-run businesses unwilling to relinquish control by listing their businesses unless they need cash for M&A or other expansion strategies.Market watchdog Consob approved measures this year to simplify procedures for the approval of IPO prospectuses  including allowing them to be submitted in English.Also aiming to accelerate change  Italy this year started to study how to overhaul its listing  voting and other rules to address the issues holding back the country's capital markets - though this process was frozen by a change in government after a right-wing coalition won elections at the end of September.MILAN EXODUSSo far this year 11 companies have abandoned Euronext Milan  including the Agnelli family's holding company Exor (EXOR.AS)  which moved to the Amsterdam bourse in line with where it is legally registered.Road and airport operator Atlantia is leaving after a buyout by the Benetton family and Blackstone passed the 90% support threshold on Thursday.Travel caterer Autogrill (AGL.MI) is expected to be delisted after a merger with Switzerland's Dufry  and the fate of shoemaker Tod's (TOD.MI) remains uncertain after the failure of a buyout offer by its main shareholder.CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI)  whose shares are listed both in Milan and New York  is also evaluating the possibility of putting an end to its dual listing and focusing on the NYSE.Taking listed companies private is a broader trend shared by many European stock exchanges  as low prices and availability of cheap money made it convenient.snapshotFEW NEWCOMERSOn the plus side  four companies joined the main Euronext Milan market this year  including truckmaker Iveco (IVG.MI)  which was the result of a spin off. Two other companies upgraded from the smaller Euronext Growth Milan.The situation is healthier for Euronext Growth Milan itself  a market dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises with minimum access requirements. In 2022 it counted 18 new listings  but the overall market cap is very low.A dearth of Italian IPOs is a perennial issue.Over the past 20 years  the main market has lost 268 listed companies and gained only 185  according to Intermonte research published in March. In contrast  the less regulated SME market has attracted 263 listed companies and seen 68 delistings.CULTURAL ISSUEThe fact that there are relatively few listed companies has its roots in the country's history  said Andrea Beltratti  professor of Political Economy at Milan's Bocconi University.Beltratti said Italy lacks a long tradition of equity finance and its economy has been relatively weak for the last 20 years.The heavy presence of banks and other financial intermediaries in Italy has supplanted the role of the markets  so companies often preferred to ask them for funding.""The benefits of being listed are the ease of collecting capital and reputational (position)  but there are also costs  associated with regulation  the need for transparency  and the many interactions with investors""  Beltratti said.""I don't think these are issues that can be solved in months or even years because it is a cultural issue "" Beltratti added.

Two other companies upgraded from the smaller Euronext Growth Milan.The situation is healthier for Euronext Growth Milan itself  a market dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises with minimum access requirements. In 2022 it counted 18 new listings  but the overall market cap is very low.A dearth of Italian IPOs is a perennial issue.Over the past 20 years  the main market has lost 268 listed companies and gained only 185  according to Intermonte research published in March. In contrast  the less regulated SME market has attracted 263 listed companies and seen 68 delistings.CULTURAL ISSUEThe fact that there are relatively few listed companies has its roots in the country's history  said Andrea Beltratti  professor of Political Economy at Milan's Bocconi University.Beltratti said Italy lacks a long tradition of equity finance and its economy has been relatively weak for the last 20 years.The heavy presence of banks and other financial intermediaries in Italy has supplanted the role of the markets  so companies often preferred to ask them for funding.""The benefits of being listed are the ease of collecting capital and reputational (position)  but there are also costs  associated with regulation  the need for transparency  and the many interactions with investors""  Beltratti said.""I don't think these are issues that can be solved in months or even years because it is a cultural issue "" Beltratti added.($1 = 0.9755 euros)(Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; Graphic by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Keith Weir and David Holmes)",neutral,0.01,0.86,0.13,mixed,0.2,0.19,0.61,True,English,"['Atlantia exit', 'Milan', 'battle', 'market', 'heavyweights', 'less regulated SME market', 'many European stock exchanges', 'smaller Euronext Growth Milan', 'main Euronext Milan market', '200-year-old Borsa Italiana', 'Travel caterer Autogrill', 'minimum access requirements', 'other expansion strategies', 'other financial intermediaries', 'overall market cap', 'Milan%20stock%20market', 'Milan market cap', 'Two other companies', 'main market', 'many interactions', 'other rules', 'main shareholder', 'market owner', 'Market watchdog', 'Milan bourse', 'MILAN EXODUS', 'Elisa Anzolin', 'Italian business', 'equity listings', 'listed business', 'extra gear', 'M&A', 'IPO prospectuses', 'right-wing coalition', 'Agnelli family', 'holding company', 'Amsterdam bourse', 'airport operator', 'Benetton family', '90% support threshold', 'shoemaker Tod', 'CNH Industrial', 'New York', 'low prices', 'cheap money', 'FEW NEWCOMERS', 'plus side', 'truckmaker Iveco', 'medium-sized enterprises', '18 new listings', 'Italian IPOs', 'perennial issue', 'Intermonte research', 'CULTURAL ISSUE', 'Bocconi University', 'long tradition', 'equity finance', 'heavy presence', 'Danilo Masoni', 'Keith Weir', 'David Holmes', 'past 20 years', 'last 20 years', 'listed companies', 'four companies', '19 billion euros', 'Barbara Lunghi', 'external investors', 'deep roots', 'dual listing', 'broader trend', 'Political Economy', 'family-run businesses', 'buyout offer', 'Andrea Beltratti', 'capital markets', '11 companies', '0.9755 euros', 'Reuters', 'Atlantia', 'value', 'number', 'fears', 'standing', 'regulators', 'role', 'heart', 'head', 'Italy', 'scrutiny', 'problem', 'control', 'cash', 'Consob', 'measures', 'procedures', 'approval', 'English', 'voting', 'issues', 'country', 'process', 'government', 'elections', 'September', 'Exor', 'line', 'Blackstone', 'Thursday', 'merger', 'Switzerland', 'Dufry', 'fate', 'failure', 'shares', 'possibility', 'NYSE', 'Story', 'private', 'availability', 'Paris', 'London', 'result', 'spin', 'situation', 'dearth', 'March', 'contrast', '68 delistings', 'fact', 'professor', 'banks', 'funding', 'benefits', 'ease', 'position', 'costs', 'regulation', 'need', 'transparency', 'months', 'Graphic', 'Editing']",2022-11-25,2022-11-26,finance.yahoo.com
