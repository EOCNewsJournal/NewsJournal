The potential for sustainable investment was explored in the keynote presentation: How can nature be made bankable? by founder of ResponsibleRisk Richard Peers a…,How are different financial institutions approaching climate strategy and sustainable investment? The potential for sustainable investment was explored in the keynote presentation: How can nature be made bankable? by founder of ResponsibleRisk Richard Peers and CEO of sustainable investment company Mirova  Philippe Zaouati.“Climate and nature is a double-sided coin. Most big companies in a variety of industries realise that they have a lot dependencies on nature. However  starting to understand dependecies is not enough  they need to have to right information to move forward ” Zaouati began.Zaouati listed three pillars as part of the roadmap on the impact of companies on nature: the first being participating in biodiversity in nature  the second is helping the market in biodiversity  and the third and most important is investing in nature-based solutions.As an example  Zaouati cited French fintech Iceberg Data Lab as having the first set of data to report the impact of businesses on nature.Emphasising that the investment of economic conveyable entities with the objective of restoration can contribute greatly to sustainable development  Zaouati cited the Sustainable Ocean Fund that is working on nature-based projects in Latin America to restore land and water ecosystems and combat deforestation as a successful example of sustainable investment.Zaouati concluded: “Utilising land and labels to restore land  plant trees  harvest  aiding the local population in partnerships between NGOs  farmers on the ground  and co-investors  and scaling up businesses led by expert innovation will have a long term impact and is a part of a big roadmap in our investment framework.”The largest green finance instrument is a bond  but whether they are green  sustainability linked  or conventional  the jury is out on the impact they deliver.Sustainable Finance Live explored how while the BIS are exploring tokenisation of bonds and how new forms such as sovereign sustainability linked bonds are emerging  the use of distributed ledger technology is currently being debated by banks and other financial institutions.However  can the use of blockchain and encryption algorithms truly help boost confidence in the green bond market? Or do we need alternatives such as rewilding tokens as verifiers of impact? All these questions were debated in a panel led byRichard Peers  who was joined by Shana Vida Gavron  CEO and founder  Endangered Wild.Life; Paul Jepson  head of innovation  Ecosulis; and Professor Brian Scott-Quinn  chairman  ICMA Centre for Financial Markets.While the session title was ‘What are the benefits of green bonds vs. green tokens?’ Peers explained that it is not a battle. Instead  the sustainable finance industry must consider what is occurring within institutions and within communities. “Is there not merit in both ” Peers asked. Bond instruments are the largest provider of finance for sustainability. However  increased proceeds do not mean impact will be made on the ground.We are now in the age of sustainability linked bonds and sovereign linked bonds  which do have greater veracity  but also come at a greater cost. The panel explored the capitalisation of nature and whether this means that we lose nature. Should we be pricing nature? Gavron posited that perhaps the sector should separate pricing nature and valuing nature.By putting a price tag on nature  it could incentivise people to destroy nature. Moreover  by not putting a value on nature  biodiversity could be taken for granted. Gavron continued to explain that we must think about how human make purchases and how we place more value on objects that are more expensive. In this respect  we as a society  are letting nature down.“We must acknowledge that nature is at the very core of how we survive ” Gavron said. “The greatest service provider – everyone interacts with nature and by not being able to put value on nature is ignoring a large part of our planet. We should feel obliged to value nature and actually recognise the snail in your garden is creating value. Start levelling the playing field and value nature in the same way we value companies. Some species are equivalent to multinational corporations in terms of value ” Gavron explained.But how do we value nature? How do we manage this value and measure it? How do we make nature recovery and rewilding investable? How do we make nature fit for finance? How do we make finance fit for nature? In answer to these questions  Jepson responded by saying that there have been two large shifts in the biodiversity and conservation world.“There has been a big shift from the goal to protect nature from humans and corporations to a second agenda where nature recovery and restoration is being viewed as a major opportunity for investment ” Jepson said. As explored in other sessions  there has been no historic precedent to resolving the issue of climate change  so it is difficult to imagine what investment into this space can deliver.Jepson’s view is to measure what is in front of us and configure ecosystems now that we have the science to back it and can measure the components against function  structure  and integrity. He provided an overview of the Ecosulis digital asset which is a nature impact token underpinned by metrics of recovery. While this token is inspired by NFTs  it is a nature positive biodiversity credit that acts more like a share in a company.Scott-Quinn also questioned the concept of green bonds and tokens. “If we’re going to save nature and biodiversity  we must consider the energy transition and for this to be successful  funding is required and that will come from the infrastructure of bond markets.” He added that in time  all bonds and loans will need to be green. Investors are buying green bonds – for whatever reason  virtue signalling or otherwise – but the issues persist.Scott-Quinn suggested that while “blockchain and distributed ledgers will help  it won’t solve the real problems.” The industry has been working on common domain models  which he described as a “blockchain without blockchain” but this could lead to the likes of Swift and Euroclear being disintermediated  which is why they are heavily involved in the creation of these projects.Decentralised blockchains provide a common view across the chain of events across the bond process and over issuance  trading  clearing and settlement  but it calls into question whether intermediaries need to be abolished  or if they provide the security that is required.Scott-Quinn concluded by saying that greenwashing still permeates the landscape and the only way that real change can be made is if directors of companies are held personally liable for untruths about how sustainable their businesses are. “The green revolution will fail unless huge number of green litigation cases actually succeed. Directors need to be taken to court and held personally liable for the things that they say  and that is the only thing that will speed up the climate change mitigation revolution.”CEO of Chora Foundation  Gina Belle  explored use cases in both public and private sectors to incite environmental and social change using sustainable strategy in her presentation: 'The transformation challenge: ? uncertainty  Δ strategic innovation  $ capital allocation.' Observing how positive change can be made in the financial industry  Belle touched on how transformative action is becoming more complex in the sustainable finance sector.Belle explained that Chora Foundation works in disrupted systems at the intersections of SDGs  creating an impact on a societal level  and using financial services to manage risk and adapt to what comes next. She detailed a triple-tiered model of how Chora aims to tackle the current challenges in the space:1. Capital allocation: determining the right amount of capital and financial resource to invest in your sustainable strategy;2. Strategic innovation: managing investments to respond to present needs and problems that climate change is creating; and 3. Uncertainty: coping with strategic uncertainty and risks to your business created by rapidly increasing complexity.Belle emphasised that Chora examines the evolving role of finance that interacts at intervention  human experiences  and resources; leveraging new resources to create positive value. Moving back to strategic innovation  she defined it as a means to learn ways into change and adaptively manage strategies over time in complex systems.Belle noted that not many organisations take into account complexity and ambiguity in sustainability strategy  but instead building organisational departments to be compliant with ESG strategies.“I think one of the opportunity spaces that we identified in the beginning is what happens if we start to create constellations of action and value generation. What we realised is that these things don't neatly plug into each other. Often think about sustainability  ESG  regulation compliance  and data  almost like Tetris; like we are trying to fit everything together perfectly. What we really need is ways of actually forming shared intent  and then using our human judgement and forging informal and social connections between organisations that can attend to the things that sit in between measurable data and all the things that we are trying to fill the boxes in.”Using a case study of sustainable tourism in Egypt as an example  Belle explained how Chora explored and designed a variety of options to move towards sustainable tourism using the Social System Transformation Canvas  a tool to help manage the complexity and multiple dimensions of a problem. They analysed different journeys towards the desired outcomes  using their portfolio as a source of new solutions and generate new strategic intelligence.Belle questioned: “Whose job is it to invest in the future of sustainability and resilience of whole systems?” She went on to challenge the audience to be willing to step into a space of unprecedented change  collaboration  and investments inside organisations and across organisations.“You cannot stay the same and transform at the same time ” Belle concluded.,neutral,0.06,0.94,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.17,0.43,True,English,"['Sustainable Finance Live', 'nature', 'French fintech Iceberg Data Lab', 'sovereign sustainability linked bonds', 'largest green finance instrument', 'sovereign linked bonds', 'economic conveyable entities', 'distributed ledger technology', 'Endangered Wild.Life', 'Professor Brian Scott-Quinn', 'Sustainable Ocean Fund', 'greatest service provider', 'two large shifts', 'different financial institutions', 'Sustainable Finance Live', 'sustainable finance industry', 'other financial institutions', 'Shana Vida Gavron', 'long term impact', 'ResponsibleRisk Richard Peers', 'sustainable investment company', 'Most big companies', 'green bond market', 'largest provider', 'green bonds', 'green tokens', 'Financial Markets', 'sustainable development', 'other sessions', 'big shift', 'keynote presentation', 'double-sided coin', 'lot dependencies', 'right information', 'three pillars', 'nature-based solutions', 'first set', 'nature-based projects', 'Latin America', 'plant trees', 'local population', 'new forms', 'encryption algorithms', 'rewilding tokens', 'ICMA Centre', 'session title', 'Bond instruments', 'greater veracity', 'greater cost', 'price tag', 'playing field', 'same way', 'conservation world', 'second agenda', 'major opportunity', 'historic precedent', 'big roadmap', 'large part', 'investment framework', 'climate strategy', 'climate change', 'water ecosystems', 'successful example', 'expert innovation', 'multinational corporations', 'Paul Jepson', 'Philippe Zaouati', 'pricing nature', 'nature recovery', 'potential', 'founder', 'CEO', 'Mirova', 'variety', 'industries', 'dependecies', 'biodiversity', 'businesses', 'objective', 'restoration', 'land', 'deforestation', 'labels', 'harvest', 'partnerships', 'NGOs', 'farmers', 'ground', 'investors', 'jury', 'BIS', 'tokenisation', 'use', 'banks', 'blockchain', 'confidence', 'alternatives', 'verifiers', 'questions', 'panel', 'head', 'Ecosulis', 'chairman', 'benefits', 'battle', 'communities', 'merit', 'proceeds', 'capitalisation', 'sector', 'people', 'value', 'human', 'purchases', 'objects', 'respect', 'society', 'core', 'everyone', 'planet', 'snail', 'garden', 'species', 'terms', 'answer', 'goal', 'issue', 'space', 'view', 'front']",2022-11-29,2022-11-30,finextra.com

As president  he sought to reduce unemployment  cut the deficit  and strengthen ties with Germany.…,"""Chirac"" redirects here. For other uses  see Chirac (disambiguation)Jacques René Chirac ( SHEER-ak [1][2] ZHAHK sheer-AHK [2][3][4] French: [ʒak ʁəne ʃiʁak] ; 29 November 1932 – 26 September 2019) was a French politician who served as President of France[5] from 1995 to 2007. Chirac was previously the Prime Minister of France from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988  as well as the Mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.After attending the École nationale d'administration  Chirac began his career as a high-level civil servant  entering politics shortly thereafter. Chirac occupied various senior positions  including Minister of Agriculture and Minister of the Interior. Chirac's internal policies initially included lower tax rates  the removal of price controls  strong punishment for crime and terrorism  and business privatisation.[6] After pursuing these policies in his second term as Prime Minister  he changed his views. He argued for more socially responsible economic policies and was elected president in the 1995 presidential election with 52.6% of the vote in the second round  beating Socialist Lionel Jospin  after campaigning on a platform of healing the ""social rift"" (fracture sociale).[7] Then  Chirac's economic policies  based on dirigisme  allowing for state-directed investment  stood in opposition to the laissez-faire policies of the United Kingdom under the ministries of Margaret Thatcher and John Major  which Chirac described as ""Anglo-Saxon ultraliberalism"".[8]He was also known for his stand against the American-led assault on Iraq  his recognition of the collaborationist French Government's role in deporting Jews  and his reduction of the presidential term from 7 years to 5 through a referendum in 2000. At the 2002 French presidential election  he won 82.2% of the vote in the second round against the far-right candidate  Jean-Marie Le Pen. During his second term  however  he had a very low approval rating and was considered one of the least popular presidents in modern French political history.In 2011  the Paris court declared Chirac guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence  giving him a two-year suspended prison sentence.Early life and educationFamily backgroundJacques René Chirac was born on 29 November 1932 in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.[9] He was the son of Abel François Marie Chirac (1898–1968)  a successful executive for an aircraft company [7] and Marie-Louise Valette (1902–1973)  a housewife. His grandparents were teachers[10] from Sainte-Féréole in Corrèze. His great-grandparents on both sides were peasants in the rural south-western region of the Corrèze.[11]According to Chirac  his name ""originates from the langue d'oc  that of the troubadours  therefore that of poetry"". He was a Roman Catholic.[12]Chirac was an only child (his elder sister  Jacqueline  died in infancy before his birth).[13] He was educated in Paris at the Cours Hattemer  a private school.[14] He then attended the Lycée Carnot and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. After his baccalauréat  he served for three months as a sailor on a coal-transport.[15]Chirac played rugby union for Brive's youth team  and also played at university level. He played no. 8 and second row.[16]Education and early careerInspired by Charles de Gaulle  Chirac started to pursue a civil service career in the 1950s. During this period  he joined the French Communist Party  sold copies of L'Humanité  and took part in meetings of a communist cell.[17] In 1950  he signed the Soviet-inspired Stockholm Appeal for the abolition of nuclear weapons – which led him to be questioned when he applied for his first visa to the United States.[18]In 1953  after graduating from the Sciences Po  he attended a non-credit course at Harvard University's summer school  before entering the École nationale d'administration  which trains France's top civil servants  in 1957.In the United States Chirac worked at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis  Missouri.[19]Chirac trained as a reserve military officer in armoured cavalry at Saumur.[20] He then volunteered to fight in the Algerian War  using personal connections to be sent despite the reservations of his superiors. His superiors did not want to make him an officer because they suspected he had communist leanings.[21] In 1965  he became an auditor in the Court of Auditors.[22]Early political careerThe ""Bulldozer"": 1962–1971In April 1962  Chirac was appointed head of the personal staff of Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. This appointment launched Chirac's political career. Pompidou considered Chirac his protégé  and referred to him as ""my bulldozer"" for his skill at getting things done. The nickname ""Le Bulldozer"" caught on in French political circles  where it also referred to his abrasive manner. As late as the 1988 presidential election  Chirac maintained this reputation.[23]At Pompidou's suggestion  Chirac ran as a Gaullist for a seat in the National Assembly in 1967. He was elected deputy for his home Corrèze département  a stronghold of the left. This surprising victory in the context of a Gaullist ebb permitted him to enter the government as Minister of Social Affairs. Although Chirac was well-situated in de Gaulle's entourage  being related by marriage to the general's sole companion at the time of the Appeal of 18 June 1940  he was more of a ""Pompidolian"" than a ""Gaullist"". When student and worker unrest rocked France in May 1968  Chirac played a central role in negotiating a truce. Then  as state secretary of economy (1968–1971)  he worked closely with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing  who headed the ministry of economy and finance.Cabinet minister: 1971–1974After some months in the ministry for Relations with Parliament  Chirac's first high-level post came in 1972 when he became Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development under Pompidou  who had been elected president in 1969  after de Gaulle retired. Chirac quickly earned a reputation as a champion of French farmers' interests  and first attracted international attention when he assailed U.S.  West German  and European Commission agricultural policies which conflicted with French interests.On 27 February 1974  after the resignation of Raymond Marcellin  Chirac was appointed Minister of the Interior. On 21 March 1974  he cancelled the SAFARI project due to privacy concerns after its existence was revealed by Le Monde. From March 1974  he was entrusted by President Pompidou with preparations for the presidential election then scheduled for 1976. These elections were moved forward because of Pompidou's sudden death on 2 April 1974.Chirac vainly attempted to rally Gaullists behind Prime Minister Pierre Messmer. Jacques Chaban-Delmas announced his candidacy in spite of the disapproval of the ""Pompidolians"". Chirac and others published the call of the 43 in favour of Giscard d'Estaing  the leader of the non-Gaullist part of the parliamentary majority. Giscard d'Estaing was elected as Pompidou's successor after France's most competitive election campaign in years. In return  the new president chose Chirac to lead the cabinet.Prime Minister of Giscard: 1974–1976When Valéry Giscard d'Estaing became president  he nominated Chirac as prime minister on 27 May 1974  to reconcile the ""Giscardian"" and ""non-Giscardian"" factions of the parliamentary majority. At the age of 41  Chirac stood out as the very model of the jeunes loups (""young wolves"") of French politics  but he was faced with the hostility of the ""Barons of Gaullism"" who considered him a traitor for his role during the previous presidential campaign. In December 1974  he took the lead of the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR) against the will of its more senior personalities.As prime minister  Chirac quickly set about persuading the Gaullists that  despite the social reforms proposed by President Giscard  the basic tenets of Gaullism  such as national and European independence  would be retained. Chirac was advised by Pierre Juillet and Marie-France Garaud  two former advisers of Pompidou. These two organised the campaign against Chaban-Delmas in 1974. They advocated a clash with Giscard d'Estaing because they thought his policy bewildered the conservative electorate.[24]Citing Giscard's unwillingness to give him authority  Chirac resigned as Prime Minister in 1976. He proceeded to build up his political base among France's several conservative parties  with a goal of reconstituting the Gaullist UDR into a Neo-Gaullist group  the Rally for the Republic (RPR). Chirac's first tenure as prime minister was also an arguably progressive one  with improvements in both the minimum wage and the social welfare system carried out during the course of his premiership.[25]Mayor of Paris: 1977–1995After his departure from the cabinet  Chirac wanted to gain the leadership of the political right  to gain the French presidency in the future. The RPR was conceived as an electoral machine against President Giscard d'Estaing. Paradoxically  Chirac benefited from Giscard's decision to create the office of mayor in Paris  which had been in abeyance since the 1871 Commune  because the leaders of the Third Republic (1871–1940) feared that having municipal control of the capital would give the mayor too much power. In 1977  Chirac stood as a candidate against Michel d'Ornano  a close friend of the president  and he won. As mayor of Paris  Chirac's political influence grew. He held this post until 1995.[26]Chirac supporters point out that  as mayor  he provided programmes to help the elderly  people with disabilities  and single mothers  and introduced the street-cleaning Motocrotte [27] while providing incentives for businesses to stay in Paris. His opponents contend that he installed ""clientelist"" policies.Governmental oppositionStruggle for the right-wing leadership: 1976–1986In 1978  Chirac attacked the pro-European policy of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (VGE)  and made a nationalist turn with the December 1978 Call of Cochin  initiated by his counsellors Marie-France Garaud and Pierre Juillet  which had first been called by Pompidou. Hospitalised in Hôpital Cochin after a car crash  he declared that ""as always about the drooping of France  the pro-foreign party acts with its peaceable and reassuring voice"". He appointed Yvan Blot  an intellectual who would later join the National Front  as director of his campaigns for the 1979 European election.[28]After the poor results of the election  Chirac broke with Garaud and Juillet. Vexed Marie-France Garaud stated: ""We thought Chirac was made of the same marble of which statues are carved in  we perceive he's of the same faience bidets are made of.""[29] His rivalry with Giscard d'Estaing intensified. Although it has been often interpreted by historians as the struggle between two rival French right-wing families (the Bonapartists  represented by Chirac  and the Orleanists  represented by VGE)  both figures in fact were members of the liberal  Orleanist tradition  according to historian Alain-Gérard Slama.[28] But the eviction of the Gaullist barons and of President Giscard d'Estaing convinced Chirac to assume a strong neo-Gaullist stance.Chirac made his first run for president against Giscard d'Estaing in the 1981 election  thus splitting the centre-right vote. He was eliminated in the first round with 18% of the vote. He reluctantly supported Giscard in the second round. He refused to give instructions to the RPR voters but said that he supported the incumbent president ""in a private capacity""  which was interpreted as almost de facto support of the Socialist Party's (PS) candidate  François Mitterrand  who was elected by a broad majority.Giscard has always blamed Chirac for his defeat. He was told by Mitterrand  before his death  that the latter had dined with Chirac before the election. Chirac told the Socialist candidate that he wanted to ""get rid of Giscard"". In his memoirs  Giscard wrote that between the two rounds  he phoned the RPR headquarters. He passed himself off  as a right-wing voter  by changing his voice. The RPR employee advised him ""certainly do not vote Giscard!"" After 1981  the relationship between the two men became tense  with Giscard  even though he had been in the same government coalition as Chirac  criticising Chirac's actions openly.After the May 1981 presidential election  the right also lost the subsequent legislative election that year. However  as Giscard had been knocked out  Chirac appeared as the principal leader of the right-wing opposition. Due to his attacks against the economic policy of the Socialist government  he gradually aligned himself with prevailing economically liberal opinion  even though it did not correspond with Gaullist doctrine. While the far-right National Front grew  taking advantage of the proportional representation electoral system which had been introduced for the 1986 legislative elections  he signed an electoral pact with the Giscardian (and more or less Christian Democratic) party Union for French Democracy (UDF).Prime Minister of Mitterrand: 1986–1988Chirac during his second term as Prime MinisterWhen the RPR/UDF right-wing coalition won a slight majority in the National Assembly in the 1986 election  Mitterrand (PS) appointed Chirac prime minister (though many in Mitterrand's inner circle lobbied him to choose Jacques Chaban-Delmas instead). This unprecedented power-sharing arrangement  known as cohabitation  gave Chirac the lead in domestic affairs. However  it is generally conceded that Mitterrand used the areas granted to the President of the Republic  or ""reserved domains"" of the Presidency  Defence and Foreign Affairs  to belittle his Prime Minister.Chirac's cabinet sold many public companies  renewing the liberalisation initiated under Laurent Fabius's Socialist government of 1984–1986  and abolished the solidarity tax on wealth (ISF)  a symbolic tax on those with high value assets introduced by Mitterrand's government. Elsewhere  the plan for university reform (plan Devaquet) caused a crisis in 1986 when a student called Malik Oussekine was killed by the police  leading to massive demonstrations and the proposal's withdrawal. It has been said during other student crises that this event strongly affected Jacques Chirac  who was afterwards careful about possible police violence during such demonstrations (e.g.  maybe explaining part of the decision to ""promulgate without applying"" the First Employment Contract (CPE) after large student demonstrations against it).One of his first acts concerning foreign policy was to call back Jacques Foccart (1913–1997)  who had been de Gaulle's and his successors' leading counsellor for African matters  called by journalist Stephen Smith the ""father of all ""networks"" on the continent  at the time [in 1986] aged 72.""[30] Foccart  who had also co-founded the Gaullist SAC militia (dissolved by Mitterrand in 1982 after the Auriol massacre) along with Charles Pasqua  and who was a key component of the ""Françafrique"" system  was again called to the Elysée Palace when Chirac won the 1995 presidential election. Furthermore  confronted by anti-colonialist movements in New Caledonia  Prime Minister Chirac ordered a military intervention against the separatists in the Ouvéa cave  leading to several tragic deaths. He allegedly refused any alliance with Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National.[31]Crossing the desert: 1988–1995Chirac ran against Mitterrand for a second time in the 1988 election. He obtained 20 percent of the vote in the first round  but lost the second with only 46 percent. He resigned from the cabinet and the right lost the next legislative election.[32]For the first time  his leadership over the RPR was challenged. Charles Pasqua and Philippe Séguin criticised his abandonment of Gaullist doctrines. On the right  a new generation of politicians  the ""renovation men""  accused Chirac and Giscard of being responsible for the electoral defeats. In 1992  convinced a candidate could not become president whilst advocating anti-European policies  he called for a ""yes"" vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty  against the opinion of Pasqua  Séguin and a majority of the RPR voters  who chose to vote ""no"".[33]While he still was mayor of Paris (since 1977) [34] Chirac went to Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire) where he supported President Houphouët-Boigny (1960–1993)  although the latter was being called a ""thief"" by the local population. Chirac then declared that multipartism was a ""kind of luxury.""[30]Nevertheless  the right won the 1993 legislative election. Chirac announced that he did not want to come back as prime minister as his previous term had ended with his unsuccessful run for the presidency against Mitterand who was still President at this point.Chirac instead suggested the appointment of Edouard Balladur  who had promised that he would not run for the presidency against Chirac in 1995. However  benefiting from positive polls  Balladur decided to be a presidential candidate  with the support of a majority of right-wing politicians. Balladur broke from Chirac along with a number of friends and allies  including Charles Pasqua  Nicolas Sarkozy  etc.  who supported his candidacy. A small group of ""fidels"" would remain with Chirac  including Alain Juppé and Jean-Louis Debré. When Nicolas Sarkozy became president in 2007  Juppé was one of the few ""chiraquiens"" to serve in François Fillon's government.[35]Presidency (1995–2007)First term: 1995–2002Juppé ministryChirac with Bill Clinton outside the Élysée Palace in Paris  June 1999During the 1995 presidential campaign  Chirac criticised the ""sole thought"" (pensée unique) of neoliberalism represented by his challenger on the right and promised to reduce the ""social fracture""  placing himself more to the centre and thus forcing Balladur to radicalise himself. Ultimately  he obtained more votes than Balladur in the first round (20.8 percent)  and then defeated the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in the second round (52.6 percent).Chirac was elected on a platform of tax cuts and job programmes  but his policies did little to ease the labour strikes during his first months in office. On the domestic front  neo-liberal economic austerity measures introduced by Chirac and his conservative prime minister Alain Juppé  including budgetary cutbacks  proved highly unpopular. At about the same time  it became apparent that Juppé and others had obtained preferential conditions for public housing  as well as other perks. At the year's end Chirac faced major workers' strikes which turned  in November–December 1995  into a general strike  one of the largest since May 1968. The demonstrations were largely pitted against Juppé's plan for pension reform  and ultimately led to his dismissal.Shortly after taking office  Chirac – undaunted by international protests by environmental groups – insisted upon the resumption of nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia in 1995  a few months before signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.[36] Reacting to criticism  Chirac said  ""You only have to look back at 1935...There were people then who were against France arming itself  and look what happened."" On 1 February 1996  Chirac announced that France had ended ""once and for all"" its nuclear testing and intended to accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.Elected as President of the Republic  he refused to discuss the existence of French military bases in Africa  despite requests by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[30] The French Army thus remained in Côte d'Ivoire as well as in Omar Bongo's Gabon.Chirac with Russian President Vladimir Putin   2001Chirac with German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder   2003State responsibility for the roundup of JewsPrior to 1995  the French government had maintained that the French Republic had been dismantled when Philippe Pétain instituted a new French State during World War II and that the Republic had been re-established when the war was over. It was not for France  therefore  to apologise for the roundup of Jews for deportation that happened while the Republic had not existed and was carried out by a state  Vichy France  which it did not recognise. President François Mitterrand had reiterated this position: ""The Republic had nothing to do with this. I do not believe France is responsible "" he said in September 1994.[37]Chirac was the first President of France to take responsibility for the deportation of Jews during the Vichy regime. In a speech made on 16 July 1995 at the site of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup  where 13 000 Jews had been held for deportation to concentration camps in July 1942  Chirac said  ""France  on that day  committed the irreparable"". Those responsible for the roundup were ""4 500 policemen and gendarmes  French  under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis. ... the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French  by the French State"".[38][39][40]""Cohabitation"" with JospinIn 1997  Chirac dissolved parliament for early legislative elections in a gamble designed to bolster support for his conservative economic program. But instead  it created an uproar  and his power was weakened by the subsequent backlash. The Socialist Party (PS)  joined by other parties on the left  soundly defeated Chirac's conservative allies  forcing Chirac into a new period of cohabitation with Jospin as prime minister (1997–2002)  which lasted five years.Cohabitation significantly weakened the power of Chirac's presidency. The French president  by a constitutional convention  only controls foreign and military policy— and even then  allocation of funding is under the control of Parliament and under the significant influence of the prime minister. Short of dissolving parliament and calling for new elections  the president was left with little power to influence public policy regarding crime  the economy  and public services. Chirac seized the occasion to periodically criticise Jospin's government.His position was weakened by scandals about the financing of RPR by Paris municipality. In 2001  the left  represented by Bertrand Delanoë (PS)  won a majority on the city council of the capital. Jean Tiberi  Chirac's successor at the Paris city hall  was forced to resign after having been put under investigations in June 1999 on charges of trafic d'influences in the HLMs of Paris affairs (related to the illegal financing of the RPR). Tiberi was finally expelled from the Rally for the Republic  Chirac's party  on 12 October 2000  declaring to the Figaro magazine on 18 November 2000: ""Jacques Chirac is not my friend anymore"".[41]After the publication of the Jean-Claude Méry by Le Monde on 22 September 2000  in which Jean-Claude Méry  in charge of the RPR's financing  directly accused Chirac of organizing the network  and of having been physically present on 5 October 1986  when Méry gave in cash 5 million Francs  which came from companies who had benefited from state deals  to Michel Roussin  personal secretary (directeur de cabinet) of Chirac [42][43] Chirac refused to attend court in response to his summons by judge Eric Halphen  and the highest echelons of the French justice system declared that he could not be inculpated while in office.During his two terms  he increased the Elysee Palace's total budget by 105 percent (to €90 million  whereas 20 years before it was the equivalent of €43.7 million). He doubled the number of presidential cars – to 61 cars and seven scooters in the Palace's garage. He hired 145 extra employees – the total number of the people he employed simultaneously was 963.Defence policyAs the Supreme Commander of the French armed forces  he reduced the military budget  as did his predecessor. At the end of his first term it accounted for three percent of GDP.[44] In 1997 the aircraft carrier Clemenceau was decommissioned after 37 years of service  with her sister ship Foch decommissioned in 2000 after 37 years of service  leaving the French Navy with no aircraft carrier until 2001  when Charles de Gaulle was commissioned.[45] He also reduced expenditure on nuclear weapons[46] and the French nuclear arsenal was reduced to include 350 warheads  compared to the Russian nuclear arsenal of 16 000 warheads.[47] He also published a plan to reduce the number of fighters the French military had by 30.[48]After François Mitterrand left office in 1995  Chirac began a rapprochement with NATO by joining the Military Committee and attempting to negotiate a return to the integrated military command  which failed after the French demand for parity with the United States went unmet. The possibility of a further attempt foundered after Chirac was forced into cohabitation with a Socialist-led cabinet between 1997 and 2002  then poor Franco-American relations after the French UN veto threat over Iraq in 2003 made transatlantic negotiations impossible.Close callOn 25 July 2000  as Chirac and the first lady were returning from the G7 Summit in Okinawa  Japan  they were placed in a dangerous situation by Air France Flight 4590 after they landed at Charles de Gaulle International Airport. The first couple were in an Air France Boeing 747 taxiing toward the terminal when the jet had to stop and wait for Flight 4590 to take off.[49] The departing plane  an Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde  ran over a strip of metal on takeoff puncturing its left fuel tank and sliced electrical wires near the left landing gear. The sequence of events ignited a large fire and caused the Concorde to veer left on its takeoff roll. As it reached takeoff speed and lifted off the ground  it came within 30 feet of hitting Chirac's 747. The photograph of Flight 4590 ablaze  the only picture taken of the Concorde on fire  was taken by passenger Toshihiko Sato on Chirac's jetliner.Second term: 2002–2007At the age of 69  Chirac faced his fourth presidential campaign in 2002. He received 20% of the vote in the first ballot of the presidential elections in April 2002. It had been expected that he would face incumbent prime minister Lionel Jospin (PS) in the second round of elections; instead  Chirac faced far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front (FN)  who came in 200 000 votes ahead of Jospin. All parties other than the National Front (except for Lutte ouvrière) called for opposing Le Pen  even if it meant voting for Chirac. The 14-day period between the two rounds of voting was marked by demonstrations against Le Pen and slogans such as ""Vote for the crook  not for the fascist"" or ""Vote with a clothespin on your nose"". Chirac won re-election by a landslide  with 82 percent of the vote on the second ballot. However  Chirac became increasingly unpopular during his second term. According to a July 2005 poll [50] 32 percent judged Chirac favourably and 63 percent unfavorably. In 2006  The Economist wrote that Chirac ""is the most unpopular occupant of the Elysée Palace in the fifth republic's history.""[51]Early termAs the left-wing Socialist Party was in thorough disarray following Jospin's defeat  Chirac reorganised politics on the right  establishing a new party – initially called the Union of the Presidential Majority  then the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The RPR had broken down; a number of members had formed Eurosceptic breakaways. While the Giscardian liberals of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) had moved to the right  the UMP won the parliamentary elections that followed the presidential poll with ease.During an official visit to Madagascar on 21 July 2005  Chirac described the repression of the 1947 Malagasy uprising  which left between 80 000 and 90 000 dead  as ""unacceptable"".Despite past opposition to state intervention the Chirac government approved a €2.8 billion aid package to troubled manufacturing giant Alstom.[52] In October 2004  Chirac signed a trade agreement with PRC President Hu Jintao where Alstom was given €1 billion in contracts and promises of future investment in China.[53]Assassination attemptOn 14 July 2002  during Bastille Day celebrations  Chirac survived an assassination attempt by a lone gunman with a rifle hidden in a guitar case. The would-be assassin fired a shot toward the presidential motorcade  before being overpowered by bystanders.[54] The gunman  Maxime Brunerie  underwent psychiatric testing; the violent far-right group with which he was associated  Unité Radicale  was then administratively dissolved.Foreign policyAlong with Vladimir Putin (whom he called ""a personal friend"") [55] Hu Jintao  and Gerhard Schröder  Chirac emerged as a leading voice against George W. Bush and Tony Blair in 2003 during the organisation and deployment of American and British forces participating in a military coalition to forcibly remove the government of Iraq controlled by the Ba'ath Party under the leadership of Saddam Hussein that resulted in the 2003–2011 Iraq War.Despite British and American pressure  Chirac threatened to veto  at that given point  a resolution in the UN Security Council that would authorise the use of military force to rid Iraq of alleged weapons of mass destruction  and rallied other governments to his position. ""Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war""  Chirac said on 18 March 2003. Future Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin acquired much of his popularity for his speech against the war at the United Nations (UN).After Togo's leader Gnassingbé Eyadéma's death on 5 February 2005  Chirac gave him tribute and supported his son  Faure Gnassingbé  who has since succeeded his father.[30]On 19 January 2006  Chirac said that France was prepared to launch a nuclear strike against any country that sponsors a terrorist attack against French interests. He said his country's nuclear arsenal had been reconfigured to include the ability to make a tactical strike in retaliation for terrorism.[56]Chirac criticized the Israeli offensive into Lebanon on 14 July 2006.[57] However  Israeli Army Radio later reported that Chirac had secretly told Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that France would support an Israeli invasion of Syria and the overthrow of the government of President Bashar al-Assad  promising to veto any moves against Israel in the United Nations or European Union.[58] Whereas the disagreement on Iraq had caused a rift between Paris and Washington  recent analysis suggests that both governments worked closely together on the Syria file to end the Syrian occupation of Lebanon  and that Chirac was a driver of this diplomatic cooperation.[59]In July 2006  the G8 met to discuss international energy concerns. Despite the rising awareness of global warming issues  the G8 focused on ""energy security"" issues. Chirac continued to be the voice within the G8 summit meetings to support international action to curb global warming and climate change concerns. Chirac warned that ""humanity is dancing on a volcano"" and called for serious action by the world's leading industrialised nations.After Chirac's death in 2019  the street leading to the Louvre Abu Dhabi was named Jacques Chirac Street in November 2019 in celebration of Chirac's efforts to bolster links between France and the United Arab Emirates during his presidency.[60]Flight taxChirac requested the Landau-report (published in September 2004) and combined with the Report of the Technical Group on Innovative Financing Mechanisms formulated upon request by the Heads of State of Brazil  Chile  France and Spain (issued in December 2004)  these documents present various opportunities for innovative financing mechanisms while equally stressing the advantages (stability and predictability) of tax-based models. The UNITAID project was born. Today the organisation executive board is chaired by Philippe Douste-Blazy.2005 referendum on TCEFurther information: 2005 French European Constitution referendum and Treaty establishing a Constitution for EuropeOn 29 May 2005  a referendum was held in France to decide whether the country should ratify the proposed treaty for a Constitution of the European Union (TCE). The result was a victory for the No campaign  with 55 percent of voters rejecting the treaty on a turnout of 69 percent  dealing a devastating blow to Chirac and the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party  and to part of the centre-left which had supported the TCE. Following the referendum defeat  Chirac replaced his Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin with Domenique de Villepin. In an address to the nation  Chirac declared that the new cabinet's top priority was to curb unemployment  which was consistently hovering above 10 percent  calling for a ""national mobilisation"" to that effect.[61]2005 civil unrest and CPE protestsFollowing major student protests in spring 2006  which followed civil unrest in autumn 2005 after the death of two young boys in Clichy-sous-Bois  one of the poorest communes in Paris' suburbs  Chirac retracted the proposed First Employment Contract (CPE) by ""promulgating [it] without applying it""  an unheard-of – and  some claim  illegal – move intended to appease the protesters while giving the appearance of not making a volte-face regarding the contract  and therefore to continue his support for his Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.RetirementIn early September 2005  Chirac suffered an event that his doctors described as a ""vascular incident"". It was officially reported as a ""minor stroke""[62] or a mild stroke (also known as a transient ischemic attack).[63] He recovered and returned to his duties soon afterward.In a pre-recorded television broadcast aired on 11 March 2007  he announced  in a widely predicted move  that he would not choose to seek a third term as president. (In 2000 the constitution had been amended to reduce the length of the presidential term to five years  so his second term was shorter than his first.)[64] ""My whole life has been committed to serving France  and serving peace""  Chirac said  adding that he would find new ways to serve France after leaving office. He did not explain the reasons for his decision.[65] He did not  during the broadcast  endorse any of the candidates running for election  but did devote several minutes of his talk to a plea against extremist politics that was considered a thinly disguised invocation to voters not to vote for Jean-Marie Le Pen and a recommendation to Nicolas Sarkozy not to orient his campaign so as to include themes traditionally associated with Le Pen.[66]Post-presidency and deathJacques Chirac in Saint-Tropez   2010Shortly after leaving office  he launched the Fondation Chirac[67] in June 2008. Since then it has been striving for peace through five advocacy programmes: conflict prevention  access to water and sanitation  access to quality medicines and healthcare  access to land resources  and preservation of cultural diversity. It supports field projects that involve local people and provide concrete and innovative solutions. Chirac chaired the jury for the Prize for Conflict Prevention awarded every year by his foundation.[68]As a former President of France  he was entitled to a lifetime pension and personal security protection  and was an ex officio member for life of the Constitutional Council.[69] He sat for the first time on the council on 15 November 2007  six months after leaving the presidency. Immediately after Sarkozy's victory  Chirac moved into a 180-square-metre (1 900 sq ft) duplex on the Quai Voltaire in Paris lent to him by the family of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. During the Didier Schuller affair  the latter accused Hariri of having participated in illegal funding of the RPR's political campaigns  but the judge closed the case without further investigations.[70]In Volume 2 of his memoirs published in June 2011  Chirac mocked his successor Nicolas Sarkozy as ""irritable  rash  impetuous  disloyal  ungrateful  and un-French"".[71][72] Chirac wrote that he considered firing Sarkozy previously  and conceded responsibility in allowing Jean-Marie Le Pen to advance in 2002.[73] A poll conducted in 2010 suggested he was the most admired political figure in France  while Sarkozy was 32nd.[71]On 11 April 2008  Chirac's office announced that he had undergone successful surgery to fit a pacemaker.Chirac suffered from frail health and memory loss in later life. In February 2014 he was admitted to hospital because of pains related to gout.[74][75] On 10 December 2015  Chirac was hospitalised in Paris for undisclosed reasons  although his state of health did not ""give any cause for concern""  he remained for about a week in ICU.[76] According to his son-in-law Frederic Salat-Baroux  Chirac was again hospitalised in Paris with a lung infection on 18 September 2016.[77]Death and state funeralChirac's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery  2 October 2019Chirac died at his home in Paris on 26 September 2019  surrounded by his family.[78] His requiem mass was held at the Saint-Sulpice Church on 30 September 2019  celebrated by Michel Aupetit  Archbishop of Paris  and attended by representatives from about 175 countries  included 69 past and present heads of state  government and international organizations. Notable names included António Guterres  Jean-Claude Juncker  Jens Stoltenberg  Vladimir Putin  Sergio Mattarella  Frank-Walter Steinmeier  Charles Michel  Viktor Orbán  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  Saad Hariri  Borut Pahor  Salome Zourabichvili  Tony Blair  Jean Chrétien  Vaira Vike-Freiberga  Bill Clinton  Hamid Karzai  Dai Bingguo plus many ministers.The day was declared a national day of mourning in France and a minute of silence was held nationwide at 15:00. Following the public ceremony  Chirac was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery with only his closest family in attendance.Popular cultureImpact on French popular culturePortrait of Jacques Chirac by Donald SheridanBecause of Jacques Chirac's long career in visible government positions  he was often parodied or caricatured: Young Jacques Chirac is the basis of a young  dashing bureaucrat character in the 1976 Asterix comic strip album Obelix and Co.  proposing methods to quell Gallic unrest to elderly  old-style Roman politicians. Chirac was also featured in Le Bêbête Show as an overexcited  jumpy character.Jacques Chirac was a favorite character of Les Guignols de l'Info  a satiric latex puppet show.[79] He was originally portrayed as a rather likable  though overexcited  character; following the corruption allegations  however  he was depicted as a kind of dilettante and incompetent who pilfered public money and lied through his teeth. His character for a while developed a superhero alter ego  Super Menteur (""Super Liar"") to get him out of embarrassing situations. Because of his alleged improprieties  he was lambasted in a song Chirac en prison (""Chirac in prison"") by French punk band Les Wampas  with a video clip made by the Guignols.He was given the Ig Nobel prize for peace  for commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Hiroshima with atomic bomb tests in the Pacific (1996).Portrayals in filmCharles Fathy appears as Chirac in the Oliver Stone film W. Marc Rioufol plays him in Richard Loncraine's 2010 film The Special Relationship.[80]Bernard Le Coq portrays Chirac in La Dernière Campagne and The Conquest by Xavier Durringer.[81][82]ControversiesOsirak controversyAt the invitation of Saddam Hussein (then vice-president of Iraq  but de facto dictator)  Chirac made an official visit to Baghdad in 1975. Saddam approved a deal granting French oil companies a number of privileges plus a 23-percent share of Iraqi oil.[83] As part of this deal  France sold Iraq the Osirak MTR nuclear reactor  designed to test nuclear materials.The Israeli Air Force alleged that the reactor's imminent commissioning was a threat to its security  and pre-emptively bombed the Osirak reactor on 7 June 1981  provoking considerable anger from French officials and the United Nations Security Council.[84]The Osirak deal became a controversy again in 2002–2003  when an international military coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq and forcibly removed Hussein's government from power. France led several other European countries in an effort to prevent the invasion. The Osirak deal was then used by parts of the American media to criticise the Chirac-led opposition to starting a war in Iraq [85] despite French involvement in the Gulf War.[86]Conviction for corruptionChirac has been named in several cases of alleged corruption that occurred during his term as mayor  some of which have led to felony convictions of some politicians and aides. However  a controversial judicial decision in 1999 granted Chirac immunity while he was president of France. He refused to testify on these matters  arguing that it would be incompatible with his presidential functions. Investigations concerning the running of Paris's city hall  the number of whose municipal employees increased by 25% from 1977 to 1995 (with 2 000 out of approximately 35 000 coming from the Corrèze region where Chirac had held his seat as deputy)  as well as a lack of financial transparency (marchés publics) and the communal debt  were thwarted by the legal impossibility of questioning him as president.[87]The conditions of the privatisation of the Parisian water system acquired very cheaply by the Compagnie Générale des Eaux and the Lyonnaise des Eaux  then directed by Jérôme Monod  a close friend of Chirac  were also criticised. Furthermore  the satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné revealed the astronomical ""food expenses"" paid by the Parisian municipality (€15 million a year according to the Canard)  expenses managed by Roger Romani (who allegedly destroyed all archives of the period 1978–93 during night raids in 1999–2000). Thousands of people were invited each year to receptions in the Paris city hall  while many political  media and artistic personalities were hosted in private flats owned by the city.[87]Chirac's immunity from prosecution ended in May 2007  when he left office as president. In November 2007 a preliminary charge of misuse of public funds was filed against him.[88] Chirac is said to be the first former French head of state to be formally placed under investigation for a crime.[89] On 30 October 2009  a judge ordered Chirac to stand trial on embezzlement charges  dating back to his time as mayor of Paris.[90]On 7 March 2011  he went on trial on charges of diverting public funds  accused of giving fictional city jobs to twenty-eight activists from his political party while serving as the mayor of Paris (1977–95).[91][92] Along with Chirac  nine others stood trial in two separate cases  one dealing with fictional jobs for 21 people and the other with jobs for the remaining seven.[91] The President of Union for a Popular Movement  who later served as France's Minister of Foreign Affairs  Alain Juppé  was sentenced to a 14-month suspended prison sentence for the same case in 2004.[93]On 15 December 2011  Chirac was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years.[93] He was convicted of diverting public funds  abuse of trust and illegal conflict of interest. The suspended sentence meant he did not have to go to prison  and took into account his age  health  and status as a former head of state.[94] He did not attend his trial  since medical doctors deemed that his neurological problems damaged his memory.[93] His defence team decided not to appeal.[93][95]The Clearstream AffairDuring April and May 2006  Chirac's administration was beset by a crisis as his chosen Prime Minister  Dominique de Villepin  was accused of asking Philippe Rondot  a top level French spy  for a secret investigation into Villepin's chief political rival  Nicolas Sarkozy  in 2004. This matter has been called the second Clearstream Affair. On 10 May 2006  following a Cabinet meeting  Chirac made a rare television appearance to try to protect Villepin from the scandal and to debunk allegations that Chirac himself had set up a Japanese bank account containing 300 million francs in 1992 as Mayor of Paris.[96] Chirac said that ""The Republic is not a dictatorship of rumours  a dictatorship of calumny.""[97]Personal lifeIn 1956  Chirac married Bernadette Chodron de Courcel  with whom he had two daughters: Laurence (4 March 1958 – 14 April 2016)[98] and Claude (born 6 December 1962). Claude was a long-term public relations assistant and personal adviser to her father [99] while Laurence  who suffered from anorexia nervosa in her youth  did not participate in her father's political activities.[100] Chirac was the grandfather of Martin Rey-Chirac by the relationship of Claude with French judoka Thierry Rey. A former Vietnamese refugee  Anh Dao Traxel  is a foster daughter of Jacques and Bernadette Chirac.[101]Chirac remained married  but had several other relationships.[102][103][104]Academic worksIn 1954  Chirac presented The Development of the Port of New-Orleans  a short geography/economic thesis to the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po)  which he had entered three years before. The 182-page typewritten work  supervised by Professor Jean Chardonnet  is illustrated by photographs  sketches and diagrams.Political careerPresident of the French Republic: 1995–2007.

TeloSizer® allows for high precision measurement of telomere length and distribution to uncover links between telomere length and the onset and severity of diseases such as cancer and age-associated diseases.Learn more about TeloSizer® by visualizing the video: https://info.genomicvision.com/TeloSizer“Genomic Vision continues to apply its innovative technologies for the benefit of patients and this collaboration with CNRS is an important milestone. We are pioneering the use of telomere length as a disease biomarker and this will contribute to cancer research.” said Thierry Huet  Ph.D.  Research and Development Director of Genomic Vision. “Telomere instability is a well-known hallmark of cancer. With TeloSizer®  we can accurately visualize and measure telomeres length.”Christophe Lachaud  Group Leader at CRCM  commented: “We are very excited to utilize Genomic Vision’s TeloSizer® application to develop highly accurate companion tests that will benefit patients. TeloSizer® offers greater accuracy and more information compared to other telomere measurement methods.”Vincent Geli  Deputy Director of CRCM expert in telomeres added: “TeloSizer® will provide new information on individual telomere length and their distribution.”New tests will be developed as part of a four-year core scientific program collaboration set up between Genomic Vision and the CRCM and will utilize Genomic Vision’s DNA combing technology and TeloSizer® application. The program will employ scientific teams across the institute and will examine telomere length heterogeneity across different samples to uncover novel leukemia-specific telomere characteristics. Actionable insights from the project will be used for the development of personalize medicine approaches based on telomere morphology.This project is part of the CRCM/IPC project supported by the OPALE Carnot Institute  a preferred partner to the healthcare Industry for research and development of innovative solutions aimed at diagnostic  treatment and follow-up of patients with leukemia  the blood cancer with the highest mortality rate  but also the leading cancer in children.About Genomic VisionGENOMIC VISION is a biotechnology company developing products and services dedicated to the analysis (structural and functional) of genome modifications as well as to the quality and safety control of these modifications  in particular in genome editing technologies and biomanufacturing processes.

The indication for use of Select mdx is covered by Medicare’s foundational LCD Molecular Biomarkers to Risk-Stratify Patients at Increased Risk for Prostate Cancer  which became effective in July 2022. The Select mdx TA has already been submitted and we are engaged in an interactive review process with MolDX. Based on our most recent communication with MolDX  a final coverage decision is not expected until H1 2023.NCCN Guidelines expand Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) indication to include high-risk patientsThe recently released NCCN for Prostate Cancer Guideline (Version 1.2023)* expands the indication for use of the GPS test to include high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer. In August 2022  mdxhealth announced that it acquired the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score® (GPS) test from Exact Sciences  further solidifying the Company’s leadership in the precision diagnostics urology market. This expanded criteria to address high-risk patients provides additional validation for the clinical utility of GPS in making prostate cancer treatment decisions and enables us to more fully serve our targeted patient population.Michael K. McGarrity  CEO of mdxhealth  commented: “Securing Medicare reimbursement for new molecular diagnostic technologies is now a more rigorous and iterative process under the new Foundational LCD program. Due to the additional time required to obtain Medicare coverage  the Company no longer expects to receive Medicare payments for Select mdx tests in 2022. Based on this development  coupled with revenue cycle timing associated with the acquisition and integration of the GPS test  the Company is revising its 2022 revenue guidance to $36.5-37.5 million from $40-42 million. We remain confident in our ability to address any remaining questions with MolDX  which we believe will lead to a positive reimbursement decision for Select mdx in the first half of 2023. To further underscore the growing diagnostic value of Select mdx  we are also pleased to report that the results of an independent  multi-institutional clinical study was recently recognized as a best poster by the American Urological Association  demonstrating the diagnostic accuracy of Select mdx and as well as its complementary utility with mpMRI for the prediction of prostate cancer in biopsies.Story continues“Further  we are also pleased to note the expanded indication for our GPS test in the recently updated NCCN Prostate Cancer guidelines”  continued Mr. McGarrity. “The addition of GPS to our current menu of tests targeted into urology and prostate cancer reflects our strategy to generate sustainable growth and enable mdxhealth to become the leading precision diagnostics company with the most comprehensive test menu focused on prostate cancer. While early  we are well into our integration plan for our GPS test and have our expanded field sales organization in place to support continued growth. With multiple levers for sustainable revenue growth  the company is initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $65-70 million.”About mdxhealth®Mdxhealth is a commercial-stage precision diagnostics company that provides actionable molecular diagnostic information to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

For its own operations (scope 1 and 2)  the company remains committed to become net-zero by 2040 with an interim target of a 50% reduction by 2030. With this updated scope 3 interim target  Ahold Delhaize aims to achieve the decarbonization of its entire value chain and ensures that all of its climate targets are in line with the UN's goal of keeping global warming below 1.5°C.The updated interim target is aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative’s Net-Zero Standard. In accordance with the recommendation by the Science Based Targets initiative  Ahold Delhaize is using its latest available emission profile from 2020 as baseline for its 37% 2030 reduction target  updated from a 2018 baseline before. In November 2021 the company joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C  a global coalition of UN agencies  business and industry leaders  in partnership with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the UN led campaign ‘Race to Zero’. The update today is part of the annual climate reporting cycle as per the Business Ambition agreements.Decarbonization pathwayWhereas scopes 1 and 2 involve the CO2 emissions of Ahold Delhaize’s own operations (mainly consisting of energy  refrigeration systems  and owned and leased transport)  scope 3 represents the indirect CO2 emissions across our entire value chain. This value chain consists of thousands of suppliers  producers and farmers who supply hundreds of thousands of products that are sold to millions of customers across the United States and Europe each day.Story continuesJan Ernst de Groot  Chief Sustainability Officer of Ahold Delhaize: “As a group of mainstream supermarkets and retailers  we want to provide customers with sustainable and healthy products  while keeping shelf availability and affordability top of mind. Our commitment is to future generations  to continue to play a leading role in the transition to a more sustainable food system. We are proud of frontrunners like Albert Heijn  who inspire other brands within the Ahold Delhaize group – and the sector - to take sustainability performance to the next level in their market.”The updated interim target is the result of extensive review  which started in November 2021 together with external experts. This review shows that the main drivers of emission reduction in scope 3 can be structured in three categories: suppliers and farmers  low-carbon products and customer engagement.Suppliers and farmersA key element of our decarbonization efforts is encouraging and supporting our suppliers in setting their own emission reduction targets in line with the latest scientific evidence  and signing up to the Science Based Targets initiative. These emission reduction commitments will accelerate improvements in livestock farming  raw material sourcing  deforestation reduction  processing  food waste reduction  packaging and transport. Our brands can contribute by supporting their suppliers and farmers with concrete environmental actions. They can do this  for example  by setting up long-term contracts with farmers.Low-carbon productsSeveral of Ahold Delhaize’s brands continue to introduce more plant-based protein products in their assortments  driving the improvement of existing assortments and the development of new assortments with less embedded emissions. Our Dutch local brand Albert Heijn  for example  committed to achieve a distribution of 60% plant-based and 40% animal-based protein sales by 2030. All our brands in Europe will commit to baseline their current protein ratio and set protein ratio targets by the end of 2024.Customer engagementHelping customers understand the impact of their buying decisions and make choices that fit their needs  their tastes and their values is an important part of our approach. This includes stimulating and rewarding more sustainable choices through loyalty programs and discounts  increasing product transparency through navigation systems and product labelling  improving assortments with more vegan and vegetarian products  and increasing awareness and knowledge about a healthy lifestyle.As a result of this new target the Ahold Delhaize climate plan has been updated  and is available on the corporate website.- Ends -Cautionary noticeThis communication includes forward-looking statements.

This truly stand-out property has been made possible through the hard work of our partners on the project – McAleer and Rushe who constructed the hotel on behalf of the developers Artisan Real Estate and our landlords Union Investment.“This is good news for Glasgow’s tourism sector  its business community and its overall economy. We have created 100 new jobs and have already assembled a great team under General Manager  Hazel Galloway who successfully led the team at Maldron Hotel Glasgow City previously.

TeloSizer® allows for high precision measurement of telomere length and distribution to uncover links between telomere length and the onset and severity of diseases such as cancer and age-associated diseases.Learn more about TeloSizer® by visualizing the video https://info.genomicvision.com/TeloSizer.“Genomic Vision continues to apply its innovative technologies for the benefit of patients and this collaboration with CNRS is an important milestone. We are pioneering the use of telomere length as a disease biomarker and this will contribute to cancer research.” said Thierry Huet  Ph.D.  Research and Development Director of Genomic Vision. “Telomere instability is a well-known hallmark of cancer. With TeloSizer  we can accurately visualize and measure telomeres length”.Christophe Lachaud  Group Leader at CRCM  commented: “We are very excited to utilize Genomic Vision’s TeloSizer application to develop highly accurate companion tests that will benefit patients. TeloSizer offers greater accuracy and more information compared to other telomere measurement methods.” Vincent Geli  Deputy Director of CRCM expert in telomeres added  “TeloSizer will provide new information on individual telomere length and their distribution ”.New tests will be developed as part of a four-year core scientific program collaboration set up between Genomic Vision and the CRCM and will utilize Genomic Vision’s DNA combing technology and TeloSizer application. The program will employ scientific teams across the institute and will examine telomere length heterogeneity across different samples to uncover novel leukemia-specific telomere characteristics. Actionable insights from the project will be used for the development of personalize medicine approaches based on telomere morphology. This project is part of the CRCM/IPC project supported by the OPALE Carnot Institute  a preferred partner to the healthcare Industry for research and development of innovative solutions aimed at diagnostic  treatment and follow-up of patients with leukemia  the blood cancer with the highest mortality rate  but also the leading cancer in children.About Genomic VisionGENOMIC VISION is a biotechnology company developing products and services dedicated to the analysis (structural and functional) of genome modifications as well as to the quality and safety control of these modifications  in particular in genome editing technologies and biomanufacturing processes.

The ReneCann formulation is commercially protected by granted and pending patents acquired by Incannex as part of the APIRx acquisition that was finalised in August of 2022.The unique formulation combines Cannabigerol (‘CBG’) and Cannabidiol (‘CBD’). CBG is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid with potent anti-inflammatory properties. A previous version of ReneCann was used in an in-human proof of concept study with dosing over a 6-week period. The study was conducted at the Maurits Clinic  The Netherlands  and led by a world-renowned dermatologist Dr. Marcus Meinardi  MD  PhD.In the study  ReneCann reduced disease scores in patients with each of the target skin diseases. Patients with vitiligo  psoriasis and atopic dermatitis were observed to experience improvements in symptoms of 10%  33% and 22% respectively.In particular  the results for study participants with vitiligo are highly encouraging  partly because the incidence of the disease is high at 0.5-1.0% of the global population and treatments for it are limited. Vitiligo is observed when pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) stop producing melanin  causing the loss of skin colour in patches and the discoloured areas generally become larger over time. ReneCann was associated with diffuse re-pigmentation (usually perifollicular or from the borders of the lesion) and efficacy lasted for weeks eventually before pigmentation recurred.The ReneCann Drug product that is produced by Eurofins CDMO will be used in clinical trials confirming the safety and therapeutic effect of ReneCann in vitiligo  psoriasis  and atopic dermatitis. Data on the quality and stability of ReneCann generated as part of this project at Eurofins will be used in the chemistry and manufacturing control modules of future regulatory packages with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ReneCann also has the potential to be assessed for efficacy in other diseases where topical application may provide a benefit over conventional oral dosed cannabinoid formulations.Dr Mark Bleackley  chief scientific officer of Incannex  said: “The production of ReneCann adds a new route of cannabinoid delivery to the Incannex portfolio  opening the possibility for direct application of cannabinoid medicines to affected areas in dermatological conditions. ReneCann is also Incannex’s first product to incorporate CBG  a minor cannabinoid. Expansion into minor cannabinoids provides us the opportunity to explore different activity profiles of this diverse family of molecules across a range of new therapeutic areas”.About Eurofins ScientificEurofins Scientific through its subsidiaries is the world leader in food  environment  pharmaceutical and cosmetic product testing  discovery pharmacology  forensics  advanced material sciences  and in agroscience Contract Research services.

The indication for use of Select mdx is covered by Medicare’s foundational LCD Molecular Biomarkers to Risk-Stratify Patients at Increased Risk for Prostate Cancer  which became effective in July 2022. The Select mdx TA has already been submitted and we are engaged in an interactive review process with MolDX. Based on our most recent communication with MolDX  a final coverage decision is not expected until H1 2023.NCCN Guidelines expand Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) indication to include high-risk patientsThe recently released NCCN for Prostate Cancer Guideline (Version 1.2023)* expands the indication for use of the GPS test to include high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer. In August 2022  mdxhealth announced that it acquired the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score® (GPS) test from Exact Sciences  further solidifying the Company’s leadership in the precision diagnostics urology market. This expanded criteria to address high-risk patients provides additional validation for the clinical utility of GPS in making prostate cancer treatment decisions and enables us to more fully serve our targeted patient population.Michael K. McGarrity  CEO of mdxhealth  commented: “Securing Medicare reimbursement for new molecular diagnostic technologies is now a more rigorous and iterative process under the new Foundational LCD program. Due to the additional time required to obtain Medicare coverage  the Company no longer expects to receive Medicare payments for Select mdx tests in 2022. Based on this development  coupled with revenue cycle timing associated with the acquisition and integration of the GPS test  the Company is revising its 2022 revenue guidance to $36.5-37.5 million from $40-42 million. We remain confident in our ability to address any remaining questions with MolDX  which we believe will lead to a positive reimbursement decision for Select mdx in the first half of 2023. To further underscore the growing diagnostic value of Select mdx  we are also pleased to report that the results of an independent  multi-institutional clinical study was recently recognized as a best poster by the American Urological Association  demonstrating the diagnostic accuracy of Select mdx and as well as its complementary utility with mpMRI for the prediction of prostate cancer in biopsies.“Further  we are also pleased to note the expanded indication for our GPS test in the recently updated NCCN Prostate Cancer guidelines”  continued Mr. McGarrity. “The addition of GPS to our current menu of tests targeted into urology and prostate cancer reflects our strategy to generate sustainable growth and enable mdxhealth to become the leading precision diagnostics company with the most comprehensive test menu focused on prostate cancer. While early  we are well into our integration plan for our GPS test and have our expanded field sales organization in place to support continued growth. With multiple levers for sustainable revenue growth  the company is initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $65-70 million.”About mdxhealth®Mdxhealth is a commercial-stage precision diagnostics company that provides actionable molecular diagnostic information to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The Company's tests are based on proprietary genetic  epigenetic (methylation) and other molecular technologies and assist physicians with the diagnosis of urologic cancers and prognosis of recurrence risk.

For its own operations (scope 1 and 2)  the company remains committed to become net-zero by 2040 with an interim target of a 50% reduction by 2030. With this updated scope 3 interim target  Ahold Delhaize aims to achieve the decarbonization of its entire value chain and ensures that all of its climate targets are in line with the UN's goal of keeping global warming below 1.5°C.The updated interim target is aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative’s Net-Zero Standard. In accordance with the recommendation by the Science Based Targets initiative  Ahold Delhaize is using its latest available emission profile from 2020 as baseline for its 37% 2030 reduction target  updated from a 2018 baseline before. In November 2021 the company joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C  a global coalition of UN agencies  business and industry leaders  in partnership with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the UN led campaign ‘Race to Zero’. The update today is part of the annual climate reporting cycle as per the Business Ambition agreements.Decarbonization pathwayWhereas scopes 1 and 2 involve the CO2 emissions of Ahold Delhaize’s own operations (mainly consisting of energy  refrigeration systems  and owned and leased transport)  scope 3 represents the indirect CO2 emissions across our entire value chain. This value chain consists of thousands of suppliers  producers and farmers who supply hundreds of thousands of products that are sold to millions of customers across the United States and Europe each day.Jan Ernst de Groot  Chief Sustainability Officer of Ahold Delhaize: “As a group of mainstream supermarkets and retailers  we want to provide customers with sustainable and healthy products  while keeping shelf availability and affordability top of mind. Our commitment is to future generations  to continue to play a leading role in the transition to a more sustainable food system. We are proud of frontrunners like Albert Heijn  who inspire other brands within the Ahold Delhaize group – and the sector - to take sustainability performance to the next level in their market.”The updated interim target is the result of extensive review  which started in November 2021 together with external experts. This review shows that the main drivers of emission reduction in scope 3 can be structured in three categories: suppliers and farmers  low-carbon products and customer engagement.Suppliers and farmersA key element of our decarbonization efforts is encouraging and supporting our suppliers in setting their own emission reduction targets in line with the latest scientific evidence  and signing up to the Science Based Targets initiative. These emission reduction commitments will accelerate improvements in livestock farming  raw material sourcing  deforestation reduction  processing  food waste reduction  packaging and transport. Our brands can contribute by supporting their suppliers and farmers with concrete environmental actions. They can do this  for example  by setting up long-term contracts with farmers.Low-carbon productsSeveral of Ahold Delhaize’s brands continue to introduce more plant-based protein products in their assortments  driving the improvement of existing assortments and the development of new assortments with less embedded emissions. Our Dutch local brand Albert Heijn  for example  committed to achieve a distribution of 60% plant-based and 40% animal-based protein sales by 2030. All our brands in Europe will commit to baseline their current protein ratio and set protein ratio targets by the end of 2024.Customer engagementHelping customers understand the impact of their buying decisions and make choices that fit their needs  their tastes and their values is an important part of our approach. This includes stimulating and rewarding more sustainable choices through loyalty programs and discounts  increasing product transparency through navigation systems and product labelling  improving assortments with more vegan and vegetarian products  and increasing awareness and knowledge about a healthy lifestyle.As a result of this new target the Ahold Delhaize climate plan has been updated  and is available on the corporate website.- Ends -Cautionary noticeThis communication includes forward-looking statements.

Business activity grew faster than during the previous financial year  which marked a significant recovery to levels seen before the crisis. The group took full advantage of the strong performance of the sector.In France  sales increased by 13% to €199.2m. The performance was driven by all sectors. Aerospace-Defence remained the leading contributor to turnover in the first half of the year  ahead of Banking-Insurance and Telecoms-Media. The group maintained its very active policy in favour of recruiting. Parallel to the opening of new premises  the SII group opened its first space solely for a client  a historical partner of the group  thus bringing more proximity and reactivity to its requests. In the course of this first half-year  899 new employees joined the workforce in France.Outside France  organic growth reached an exceptional level of 40.6%. Turnover for the first half of the year reached €278.1m. Poland  the largest contributor to international sales  grew by 40.1%. All countries with the exception of Spain  which is currently being restructured with the closure of some unprofitable activities  reported growth over the half-year.

The Aerospace-Space-Defence sector  which contributed 20.4% of turnover  posted a 21.4% increase in activity.

Other businesses (Industries Services Health Retail Automotive and Transport) experienced very strong growth (+42.9%).Good Profitability LevelThe profitability of the SII group increased with an operating result in clear increase of 26.4% to reach a level of €44.5m. This performance was carried by the positive effects of the organisation deployed since several exercises the pooling of the working tools and management as well as by average TACE (Rate of Activity Excluded Leaves) reached optimal levels. The average TACE for France was 91.3%  up 1.2 points compared to the first half of 2021-2022. At group level  the TACE reached 90.1%.Overall  the operating margin was 9.3%. In France  the operating margin was 5%  negatively impacted by one less working day in the first half of the year  by salary adjustments in line with inflation and by a delay in the price adjustment. The international operating margin stood at 12.5%  holding steady compared to the end of September 2021 and driven by the rebound in business in Germany and the very good performance of Poland and several subsidiaries.After taking into account the financial result and taxes  the net result amounted to €34.9 million  i.e. a net margin of 7.3%.At September 30  2022  the balance sheet showed a net cash position (excluding IFRS 16) of €121m  compared with €128.6m at the end of March 2022.

Nov. 29  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Royal DSM  a global science-based company active in Health  Nutrition and Bioscience  comments on the findings from a recently published paper in Nature Medicine which reported that those infected with COVID-19 are at increased risk of long-term neurologic disorders that persist post infection.[i] These symptoms are one part of what is now known as ""long COVID "" which is estimated to impact 7.5% of adults in the total US population.[ii] The neurological conditions reported include cerebrovascular disease  cognition and memory disorders  sensory disorders and mental health conditions. Risk of neurologic conditions related to long COVID were elevated even in people who were not hospitalized with acute COVID-19 infection. The recent study also demonstrated that the risk was present regardless of age  race and sex  or conditions such as obesity  smoking  diabetes and immune dysfunction  amongst other factors.Researchers are working hard to understand the mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection leads to the neurological disorders observed in long COVID. Mechanisms of great interest include the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses present in COVID-19 infection. It is hypothesized that omega-3s – namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) – could help to lessen the impact of long COVID because they play an important role in modulating the inflammatory response and resolving inflammation in the body[iii] [iv] Additionally  omega-3s have been shown to have a positive impact on brain health – including brain development[v] [vi] [vii]  cognitive performance[viii] [ix] and mood[x] [xi] [xii] [xiii] – thus these nutritional ingredients are of particular interest in the context of neurological outcomes.The recent publication indicates promising opportunities to expand research on the potential role of omega-3 supplementation as part of a strategy to support long COVID symptoms. ""As a global leader of nutritional lipid solutions  DSM remains at the forefront of new developments in omega-3 science "" comments Dr. Sonia Hartunian-Sowa  Director of Science  Translation  & Advocacy  DSM.

Polling nearly 1 000 IT leaders  architects  and developers about their digital strategies and top concerns  the survey found nearly 40% of organizations are in the process of adopting a new hybrid approach for their IT infrastructure. The transformation comes as 68% of respondents cite their fears about API sprawl.The survey data reflects responses from those engaged primarily in API development (893) and managed file transfer (MFT) services (102). Ensuring data security and controlling API sprawl were top concerns  with over two-thirds (68%) worrying about complexity due to sprawl and almost half (48%) of respondents ranking “increased security challenges” as their single greatest concern with API growth. Respondents again cited security as far and away the most important criteria when creating an API (30% among API respondents) and when setting up a new MFT service (48% among MFT respondents).“Enterprises are in the thick of digital transformation and accompanying cloud and data migrations have made it possible to free up data so it can be exchanged  reused and remixed to fuel innovation and business growth. But that’s messy ” said Vince Padua  Chief Innovation and Technology Officer at Axway. “It brings complexity and security challenges that must be answered by using truly universal API management—that bridges the gap between API development and consumption and opens everything  lines of business and innovation  while building on and out from heritage infrastructure.”The survey results indicate that budgets for API management have increased over the past two years and that security is top of mind as companies begin to unlock the full value of their data to create new digital experiences  markets and opportunities for revenue. Half of those surveyed reported modestly elevated API management budgets  with about 34% of respondents seeing increases up to 25%. Less than 20% of respondents saw budget decreases.Drilling down further into security strategy and the impending skills gapDigging deeper  the survey found that a significant majority  59%  employ user authentication as a top strategy to secure APIs  and almost two-thirds of the API respondents (61%) said data encryption can help them personally feel their data is more secure. They also cited developing a more holistic approach to security as the number one strategy for protecting personal data.When a member logs into our online channels or walks into one of our branches  we want to personalize their experience in real time. To achieve this  we targeted a high-performance API integration layer ” said Ravi Peru  Chief Information Officer at Community America Credit Union.""When you have more than 50 products  handling integration in an agile way is very important "" added Peru. ""With Axway  we can interface with anything and move data between any internal systems we want. That would be really slow with point-to-point integration  but Axway makes it quick and easy.""Security factors into cloud strategy as well. Among the most significant challenges inhibiting cloud strategy  according to respondents  are:53% – Dealing with different security requirements for regional instances of cloud infra55% – Tracking and controlling the flow of personal data into and through the cloudOne of the most alarming  but not entirely surprising data points  deals with concerns about talent: 86% of API respondents fear an expertise gap in the coming years  where companies will not have the skilled software and IT infrastructure talent they need to innovate.Click here to see the full report.Survey MethodologyThe 2022 Open Everything Strategy Survey was conducted between July 21 and August 16 of 2022 among two similar  but divided subsets of respondents: API development and MFT integration professionals. Axway engaged in direct email outreach among its contacts with opt-in email addresses  and received nearly 1 000 responses  including 893 from those in API development and 102 in MFT services  from various locations throughout the world.About AxwayAxway enables enterprises to securely open everything by integrating and moving data across a complex world of new and old technologies.

As holdings and weights change over time  updated reviews are posted when necessary.IGRO strategy and portfolioThe iShares International Dividend Growth ETF (BATS:IGRO) has been tracking the Morningstar Global ex-US Dividend Growth Index since 05/17/2016. It has a portfolio of 398 stocks  a 12-month distribution yield of 2.99% and a total expense ratio of 0.15%. Dividends are paid quarterly.As described in the prospectus by iShares  eligible companies must:pay a qualified dividend have at least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth have an earnings payout ratio of less than 75% not be in the top decile of the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index ranked on dividend yield.The fund invests mostly in large and mega cap companies (86% of asset value). About 42% is in Europe and the second region is Asia with 34%. The next chart lists the top 10 countries  representing an aggregate weight of 87%. Canada is the heaviest one with almost 21%  closely followed by Japan at about 19%. China and Hong Kong weigh 9% together  so direct exposure to geopolitical and regulatory risks related to China is moderate.IGRO countries (Chart: author; data: Fidelity)The fund is overweight in financials (23.3%). Then  come healthcare (13.5%)  industrials (12.9%) and consumer staples (11.9%). Other sectors are below 10%.IGRO sectors (Chart: author; data: iShares)The price-to-earnings ratio looks cheap: 13.42. However  valuation metrics are naturally attractive  but unfortunately unreliable  in the fund’s heaviest sector. As a reference  the iShares Global Financials ETF (IXG) has a P/E of 9.98.The top 10 holdings  listed below  represent 27% of asset value.

Moreover  most international funds have underperformed the U.S. market in this period: SPY has returned 112.7% in the same time (12.3% annualized).In 2022 to date  IGRO is second to PID in total return in the same group (see next chart).IGRO vs. competitors in 2022 (Portfolio123)TakeawayIGRO holds about 400 dividend stocks  mostly large caps from developed countries. The top 2 countries  Canada and Japan  weigh 40% together. Europe represents about 42% of asset value. The fund is overweight in financials. Therefore  valuation ratios are skewed and the fund may not be as cheap as it looks. The yield is quite attractive for a dividend growth fund  but total return since inception is significantly behind at least 3 other global dividend growth ETFs.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

Its latest batch of four satellites  each the size of three cubesats  were deployed Nov. 26 as a secondary payload aboard India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket.Karlsen said this successful launch will aid the company’s discussions with investors.More satellites enable the company to improve coverage and satellite revisit rates. Astrocast ultimately aims to operate 100 of them in low Earth orbit.In August  Italy’s D-Orbit said it struck a deal to use its orbital transfer vehicle to launch 20 Astrocast satellites over a three-year period.Karlsen said D-Orbit is slated to deploy four satellites for Astrocast in late December on a Falcon 9 rideshare mission.“That is it for this year ” he said  adding: “We are evaluating our launch plans for 2023 as we are meeting our customer needs with these satellites in orbit.”According to Karlsen  the company has also “partially funded” four more satellites “and the launch for them as well”.Astrocast recently recorded 287 000 Swiss Francs in revenues for the six months to the end of June  down from 824 000 Swiss Francs for the same period in 2021 — a year it benefited from a European Space Agency development contract.The company reported a 9.1 million Swiss Franc loss for the first half of 2022 in EBITDA — or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization — compared with a loss of 5.5 million Swiss Francs for H1 2021.At the end of June  Astrocast said it had a cash balance of 553 000 Swiss Francs.,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,mixed,0.12,0.19,0.69,True,English,"['failed acquisition', 'Hiber', 'Astrocast', 'cash', 'SpaceNews', 'Euronext Growth Paris junior stock market', 'European Space Agency development contract', 'Euronext Growth Oslo stock exchange', 'Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket', 'Dutch remote monitoring specialist', 'Swiss small satellite operator', '9.1 million Swiss Franc loss', 'key growth area', 'satellite revisit rates', 'orbital transfer vehicle', 'Falcon 9 rideshare mission', 'volatile financial markets', 'chief financial officer', '43 million Swiss Francs', '5.5 million Swiss Francs', 'initial commercial services', 'spectrum Hiber leases', 'stock listing', '287,000 Swiss Francs', '824,000 Swiss Francs', '553,000 Swiss Francs', 'remote areas', 'remote locations', 'Swiss operator', 'financial claim', 'successful launch', 'Dutch company', 'things devices', 'satellite-connected devices', 'particular focus', 'gas industry', 'Nov. 24 announcement', 'short-term debt', 'current operations', 'strategic alternatives', 'financial position', 'long-term basis', 'eventual listing', 'current timeframe', 'certain areas', 'purchase agreement', 'arbitration process', 'legal remedies', 'Fabienne Pinot', 'marketing director', 'latest batch', 'three cubesats', 'secondary payload', 'low Earth', 'three-year period', 'late December', 'launch plans', 'customer needs', 'six months', 'same period', 'first half', 'cash balance', 'Swiss company', 'new investors', '14 operational satellites', 'More satellites', 'Nov. 30 deadline', 'expansion plans', 'ongoing discussions', 'four satellites', 'Kjell Karlsen', 'existing investors', 'cash-strapped Astrocast', '20 Astrocast satellites', '20 satellites', 'TAMPA', 'Fla.', 'acquisition', 'shares', 'France', 'offering', 'summer', 'internet', 'constellation', 'Inmarsat', 'Americas', 'solutions', 'customers', 'assets', 'oil', 'May', 'fleet', 'end', 'coverage', 'intent', 'deal', 'SpaceNews', 'target', 'support', 'mediation', 'dispute', 'sale', 'Norway', 'August', 'February', 'size', 'India', 'Italy', 'D-Orbit', 'revenues', 'June', 'EBITDA', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortization', 'H1', '2022']",2022-11-30,2022-11-30,spacenews.com

Following an increased call for…,PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Thales today announced the launch of its CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager integration with the AWS External Key Store  a feature of the AWS Key Management Service announced at AWS re:Invent 2022. Following an increased call for enhanced sovereign controls amid growing regulatory requirements  the integration enables organisations to retain control of their encryption keys when migrating their sensitive data to the AWS cloud.Developed with Thales since its inception  the AWS External Key Store combined with CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager offers organisations looking to move critical workloads to the cloud a way to maintain sovereign control of sensitive data throughout their digital transformation journey.“We’ve had a strong technical collaboration with Thales on the development of the AWS External Key Store specification from the very beginning  in part due to their long history of expertise developing hardware security modules and key management services ” said Ken Beer  General Manager  Key Management Service at AWS. “The cloud has become a critical point of operation across businesses  and our combined expertise provides a way of helping organisations address specific needs and know they’re getting industry-best security controls in the process.”According to the Thales 2022 Cloud Security Study  encryption is the number one choice to protect data in the cloud. However  only about one-third (29%) of respondents report total control of their keys to encrypted data in the cloud. User-controlled encryption and key management in hybrid IT are essential safeguards to enforce digital sovereignty in a modern data-driven world governed by privacy compliance mandates  regulated sectors  or general IT security recommendations such as the Shared Responsibility Model and the NIS2 Directive.CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager ensures AWS External Key Store customers can satisfy these urgent regulatory requirements by leveraging strong encryption and data security methods that allow organisations to manage their data separately from the cloud service provider. Such a safeguard  also known as Hold Your Own Key (HYOK)  enables organisations to maintain key ownership separate from the cloud data store.“Varying data protection regulations across countries have presented a challenge for global organisations migrating to the cloud ” said Heleen Herselman  VP AWS Powerhouse at T-Systems Cloud Service. “The CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager simplifies this challenge and ensures we remain compliant while taking advantage of all the benefits of leveraging cloud services. The ability to lean on Thales’ solution has become especially important  as we  and other organisations  increasingly rely on multi-cloud environments.”CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager is an industry-leading multi-cloud encryption key life cycle management solution that supports all major public cloud service providers. With a marked increase in multi-cloud adoption  this solution allows users to centralise key management across all clouds.“This is the first integration on the market to solve a major pain point for AWS cloud customers: how can they utilise protected data in the AWS cloud while retaining encryption keys outside the cloud.” said Todd Moore  VP  Encryption Products at Thales. “As an industry leader in key management solutions  we are proud to offer an encryption solution that provides the ability to maintain external control of keys and cryptographic operations using those keys. CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager is at the forefront of advanced digital sovereignty. We’ll continue to introduce cutting-edge security and compliance features that support organisations in their digital transformation journeys.”The Thales CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager integration for AWS External Key Store is available today.

Revenue totaled €2 122m  up +17.9% in absolute terms and +13.8% at constant currency over the first 9M 2022.Content production revenue rose by +16.3% over 9M 2022  driven by a dynamic production cycle  with the recommission of successful well-known programs (“Star Academy” and “Masterchef” in France)  the development of new shows delivered for local and international markets across both non-scripted (“Blow-up” in Germany  Australia and New Zealand  “Starstruck” in the UK)  and scripted (“SAS Rogue Heroes” for BBC in the UK and “Marie-Antoinette” for Canal+ in France) and to a lessor extent the positive impact from bolt-on acquisitions.Distribution: revenue increased by +38.6% driven by both linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted content such as “You” for Sky and “Peaky Blinders” for Netflix in the UK.Overall  the number of content hours at the end of September 2022 reached about 146 000 hours9  up +25% versus 9M 2021.Online sports betting & gaming:The Online sports betting & gaming business recorded +5.7% revenue growth in absolute terms over the first 9M 2022 (+5.8% at constant currency) with a strong rebound in Q3 2022 (+29.3%) following a first half that saw a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (including the Euro 2020 football tournament held in June / July 2021). These figures also reflect the discontinued Bet-at-home activities.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued Bet-at-home operations in certain jurisdictions  revenue was up +13% over 9M 2022  driven by the solid continued performance of Betclic entity (+15%)  offsetting the -11% decline at Bet-at-home.Unique Active Players increased sharply by +11% in 9M 2022 versus 9M 2021  illustrating the appeal of the Betclic platform.ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA amounted to €446.4m  up +17.5% over 9M 2022  on revenue up +15.0%. This was driven by a strong +23.4% rise to €297.2m for Content production & distribution and +8.4% to €150.8m for Online sports betting & gaming.Overall  this led to a 40bp improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin to 16.5% for the first 9M 2022  with improved profitability across both business lines thanks to revenue growth and a higher proportion of Distribution revenue for Content production & distribution as well as a strong operational leverage for Online sports betting & gaming.The increase in external and personnel expenses was mainly driven by Content production & distribution  in line with the increase in production revenue.In € million 9M 2021 9M 2022 % change Content production & distribution 240.8 297.2 23.4% Online sports betting & gaming 139.1 150.8 8.4% Holding (0.1) (1.5) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 17.5% Content production & distribution 13.4% 14.0% Online sports betting & gaming 24.9% 25.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5%NORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMENormalized P&L highlights the underlying performance of the group for the first 9M 2022 without one-off items related to reorganization and business combination.Comments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” over the first 9M 2022 compared to the first 9M 2021 reported P&L.In € million 9M 2021 Reported9M 2022 Reported (1) Transaction impact(2) 9M 2022 Normalized P&L(1) - (2) Revenue 2 359.3 2 712.9 2 712.9 External expenses (1 155.2) (1 308.5) (1 308.5) Personnel expenses excluding LTIP & employment-related earn-out & option expenses (815.9) (940.4) (940.4) Other operating income (loss) excl. restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (8.3) (15.8) (15.8) Depreciation and amortization expenses related to D&A fiction (0.1) (1.7) (1.7) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 446.4 Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5% 16.5% Restructuring costs and other non-recurring items (37.4) (99.5) (105.7) 6.2 LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses (127.3) (104.7) (33.0) (71.7) Depreciation and amortization (excl.

Under IFRS  the merger with the SPAC is considered as an equity-settled share-based payment for a service rendered by the SPAC to list the Group. This service is valued at €86m and is recorded as a listing fee.LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses : €33m mainly driven by the change in fair value of financial instruments explained by the LTIP following the upward reassessment of the Banijay Group’s shares.Other finance income / loss: €96m attributable mainly to the change in fair value of financial instruments. This includes re-evaluation and the change in fair value of Vivendi’s convertible bond derivatives following the upward assessment of the Banijay Group’s shares. This bond was paid back as part of the transaction.Exceptional income from the deconsolidation of Bet-at-home Entertainment LtdFL Entertainment recorded a net exceptional income of +€6m mainly coming from the deconsolidation of Bet-at-home Entertainment Ltd in H1 2022.Net financial resultNet financial result amounted to -€91.1m over 9M 2022 compared to -€118.4m in 9M 2021. Of this amount:Cost of net debt totaled -€106.4m in 9M 2022 vs -€99.5m in 9M 2021  mostly attributable to a higher level of interest charges explained by a timing effect of interest charges related to Betclic loan issued on 13 December 2021.Other financial income and expenses as of September 2022 amounted to +€15.3m  compared to - €18.9m for 9M 2021 mainly explained by derivatives during 9M 2022.Income tax expensesThe tax charge in 9M 2022 totaled -€40.3m compared to -€16.0m in 9M 2021  representing an effective tax rate of 17.2% compared with 12.5% respectively.The change is mostly explained by a particularly low effective income tax interest rate in over 9M 2021 due to the use of significant loss carry-forward in 2021 for Online sports betting & gaming business.Adjusted net incomeAdjusted net income rose by +15.3% to €209.8m in 9M 2022 from €181.8m in 9M 2021.FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBT OVER 9M 2022FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSIONAdjusted free cash flow (after lease payments) reached €369m  up +66m yoy (+21.6%)  driven by the business performance as well as a tight control of cash expenses and capex.The change in working capital mainly derived from Content production and distribution. The third quarter traditionally has the highest requirements  reflecting the seasonality of the activity and the timing of deliveries.The rise in income taxes paid was attributable to greater use of tax loss carry-forward in 9M 2021.Adjusted free cash flow conversion after capex and leases payment amounted to 83%.€m 9M 2021 9M 2022 % change Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 17.5% Capex (43.0) (43.2) Total cash outflows for leases that are not recognized as rental expenses (33.6) (34.3) Adjusted free-cash flow 303.3 368.9 21.6% Change in working capital* (108.9) (101.1) Income tax paid (28.6) (48.6) Adjusted operating free cash flow 165.8 219.1 32.2%*Excludes LTIP paid and exceptional items cash-outSOLID FINANCIAL POSITION AND DE-LEVERAGINGThe Group’s net financial debt as of September 30  2022 stood at €2 272m  compared to €2 269m as of 31 December 2021. It is at fixed rate with no maturity before 2025.The stability in net financial debt reflected the seasonality of the Content production & distribution business and negative exchange rates impact.Net financial debt came mainly from an increase in adjusted free cash flows of the period for -€219m and cash proceeds received following the transaction (-€121m)  partly offset by LTIP paid & exceptionals for €139m  net acquisitions for €68m and €106m interests recognized during9M 2022.The financial leverage ratio was 3.4x as of September 30  2022  compared to 3.7x as of December 31  2021.AgendaFY 2022 results: 16 March 2022Investor RelationsCaroline Cohen – Phone: +33 1 44 95 23 34 – c.cohen@flentertainment.comPress RelationsAnne-France Malrieu - afmalrieu@image7.frAbout FL EntertainmentFounded by Stéphane Courbit  a 30-year entertainment industry pioneer and entrepreneur  FL Entertainment Group is a global leader in multimedia content and gambling  combining the strengths of Banijay  the world’s largest independent producer distributor  with Betclic Everest Group  the fastest-growing online sports betting platform in Europe.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company’s operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis.

The clinical trial was led by DNDi and its partners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea.Dr Victor KandeFormer Neglected Tropical Diseases Expert Advisor at the Ministry of Health of the DRC  principal investigator of the trial  and lead author of the Lancet article“Sleeping sickness is a nightmare disease that affects patients in some of the most remote settings in West and Central Africa  where distance from hospital can be measured in days. We are now on the cusp of a potential treatment that can be given in one day  in a single dose of three pills – this would be a revolution for doctors and communities.”Transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly  sleeping sickness is fatal without treatment. In the early stage of the disease  people suffer from headaches or fever. In the late stage  the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier and invades the central nervous system  causing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as sleep disruption  confusion  lethargy  and convulsions – and ultimately  death.Never been so close to elimination in decadesTreatment for sleeping sickness has radically improved in the last decade  thanks to the successes of a partnership bringing together DNDi  Sanofi  the national sleeping sickness control programmes of the DRC and Guinea  the World Health Organization (WHO)  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)  and other partners.Story continuesThe number of reported cases of sleeping sickness has fallen sharply in the last 20 years  from almost 40 000 reported cases in 1998 (with estimates of over 300 000 undiagnosed cases) to less than 1 000 in 2020. Though an encouraging trend  it should not be a reason for complacency  as the disease is known to resurge in the form of devastating outbreaks.Dr Antoine TarralHead of the sleeping sickness programme at DNDi and co-author of the paper“By simplifying the treatment paradigm  acoziborole would be an innovation that enables a sustainable response to sleeping sickness for health systems. With these new data  we have hope that we may be able to finally eliminate the disease  once and for all  by opening the door to a ‘screen-and-treat' approach at the village level.”Dr Wilfried Mutombo KalonjiDNDi Clinical Project Leader and Medical Manager  and co-author of the paper“Acoziborole has the potential to have a major impact on sleeping sickness treatment. This is a complicated disease  with patients living in very remote and unstable areas. We need simple approaches. We now have the promise of single-dose  oral treatment that doesn’t need to be taken with food  removes the need for hospitalization  removes the need for complex or invasive diagnosis or disease staging  and requires minimal training. In many ways  it doesn’t get any simpler than this.”The WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap strategy sets a goal of interrupting transmission of the gambiense strain of human African trypanosomiasis (g-HAT)  the scientific name of the disease  by 2030. (The gambiense strain accounts for 93% of all sleeping sickness cases). In alignment with this strategy  acoziborole could open the possibility of a simple ‘screen-and-treat’ approach  whereby any person whose rapid pinprick blood test suggests they might be infected could be treated with acoziborole  without the need for more complex parasitological confirmation or hospitalization.About the Phase II/III studyBetween 2016 and 2019  DNDi and its partners led an open-label  Phase II/III study to assess the safety and efficacy of acoziborole in patients with early- and late-stage g-HAT. 208 patients were recruited at 10 hospitals in the DRC and Guinea.The 18-month treatment success rate for acoziborole was 95% in late-stage g-HAT patients  corresponding to the best results from studies with existing treatments (94%). In addition  100% of the 41 patients with early-stage g-HAT were considered as treatment successes at all timepoints. The study shows that acoziborole has a favourable safety profile  with no significant drug-related safety signals reported.These pivotal results will form the basis of Sanofi’s dossier submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and represent another milestone in the quest to eliminate sleeping sickness. Upon the EMA’s positive opinion and local approval  Sanofi will donate acoziborole to the WHO through its philanthropic organization  Foundation S – The Sanofi Collective. Acoziborole is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDHead of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“Sanofi is a long-standing partner in the fight against sleeping sickness alongside DNDi and the World Health Organization. We are leveraging Sanofi’s unique expertise in developing  registering and producing new  innovative medicines to address areas of significant unmet need and in this case  support the World Health Organization’s goal to eliminate sleeping sickness in humans by 2030.”Dr Mariame Camaraprincipal investigator of the study at the HAT Treatment Centre in Dubreka  Guinea and co-author of the Lancet article“Many sleeping sickness patients live in remote villages in the mangrove swamps along the coast of Guinea – even though we have good treatment options now  we still need to send people who test positive with a sleeping sickness rapid test from their village to a confirmatory health centre. Acoziborole could potentially become the first treatment that would allow doctors to treat people on the spot  once they receive a positive rapid test in their village.”About the DNDi programme for the development of acoziboroleThe DNDi programme for the development of acoziborole was supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; UK aid; the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through KfW  Germany; the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Médecins Sans Frontières; the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS); the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  as part of Norway’s in-kind contribution to EDCTP2; Stavros Niarchos Foundation; the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID); and the BBVA Foundation (through the ‘Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Development Cooperation’).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

DNDi is also coordinating the ANTICOV clinical trial to find treatments for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases in low-resource settings. Since its inception in 2003  DNDi has delivered twelve new treatments to date  including new drug combinations for kala-azar  two fixed-dose antimalarials  and DNDi’s first successfully developed new chemical entity  fexinidazole  approved in 2018 for the treatment of both stages of sleeping sickness. dndi.orgMedia Relations SanofiSandrine Guendoul | + 33 6 25 09 14 25 | sandrine.guendoul@sanofi.comEvan Berland | +1 215 432 0234 | evan.berland@sanofi.comVictor Rouault | + 33 6 70 93 71 40 | victor.rouault@sanofi.comInvestor Relations SanofiEva Schaefer-Jansen | + 33 7 86 80 56 39 | eva.schaefer-jansen@sanofi.comCorentine Driancourt | + 33 6 40 56 92 21 | corentine.driancourt@sanofi.comMedia Relations DNDiFrédéric Ojardias (DNDi Geneva) | +41 79 431 62 16 | fojardias@dndi.orgIlan Moss (DNDi New York) | +1 646 266 5216 | imoss@dndi.orgFrancine Ngalula (DNDi Kinshasa) | + 243 816 402 389 | francinengal@gmail.comNotes for the editorsAcoziborole is the first oral single-dose new chemical entity to be issued from DNDi’s lead optimization programme for sleeping sickness. It started with an initial hit identified in the chemical library of Anacor Pharmaceuticals  which was acquired by Pfizer in 2016. The initial structure was then optimized with Scynexis and Pace University and was then selected as a candidate for development and Phase I safety studies conducted successfully in France.Acoziborole is the latest innovation brought by two decades of innovation efforts by DNDi  Sanofi  and partners. In 2009  they developed a combination of existing drugs known as NECT  which was extremely effective and much safer than the toxic arsenic derivative that doctors had to use at the time. A donation programme was set up by Sanofi and Bayer to the World Health Organization (WHO)  radically improving treatment options for patients.But NECT requires complex logistics  with each treatment weighing 8 kg  and must be administered in hospital settings with skilled staff. In 2018  DNDi  Sanofi  and partners developed fexinidazole  which became the first all-oral treatment available for sleeping sickness. This 10-day treatment is now available in all sleeping sickness-endemic countries.Acoziborole can be administered as a single oral dose  meaning treatment could be done in villages: healthcare workers from mobile teams will be able to immediately administer a single pill of acoziborole as soon as the patient is diagnosed  without the need of hospitalization or supervision of the treatment at home. This means it could become a major tool to facilitate the efforts to finally eliminate sleeping sickness.Sanofi Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  as amended.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The Uaru project is located in the Stabroek Block  a 26 800 km2 strategic basin located off Guyana’s continental shelf  where several important discoveries have been made since 2015.The Group will deliver 35 000 metric tons of line-pipe  including 2 000 metric tons of X80  an innovative and unique material developed and qualified by Vallourec’s R&D teams. The X80 combines high strength with resistance to service conditions  making it a key enabler for future deeper-water developments.Following the Yellowtail and Gas-to-Energy orders  signed under the same LTA  the Uaru order further strengthens Vallourec’s strategic supplier relationship with ExxonMobil Guyana  underpinned by a significant backlog of line-pipe orders of approximately 90 000 metric tons (or 520 km of line pipe) booked since December 2021.Vallourec will serve ExxonMobil Guyana from its state-of-the-art Jeceaba (Minas Gerais) factory which combines large production capacities and premium capabilities.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vallourec  commented: “This significant new contract represents the third under the 10-year frame agreement signed last year with ExxonMobil Guyana. Our new grade X80 has been qualified by ExxonMobil and will be field-proven with this order  demonstrating Vallourec’s ability to deliver solutions to the industry that are both technology and efficiency enablers. This is a new milestone in Vallourec's long history with ExxonMobil  and I would like to thank ExxonMobil once again for its confidence and our own teams for this great work”.The contract is subject to ExxonMobil Guyana securing necessary approvals from the Government of Guyana for the project.About VallourecVallourec is a world leader in premium tubular solutions for the energy markets and for demanding industrial applications such as oil & gas wells in harsh environments  new generation power plants  challenging architectural projects  and high-performance mechanical equipment.

The plant will signi…,"HEERLEN  Netherlands  Nov. 30  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Royal DSM  a global purpose-led science-based company active in Health  Nutrition and Bioscience  today began construction of a new manufacturing facility at its site in Dalry  Scotland. The plant will significantly increase global production of Bovaer®  DSM's unique methane-reducing feed additive for cattle. In an official groundbreaking ceremony attended by the First Minister of Scotland  Nicola Sturgeon  and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEO of DSM  the company marked the next step in its plan to use Bovaer® to reduce global methane emissions and contribute to worldwide methane reduction targets.DSM announced that planning had started during the UN Climate Change Conference last year in Glasgow. Construction officially began today on a facility that will help DSM scale-up production of Bovaer® in the coming years and marks another milestone in the company's ambition to bring its methane-reducing feed additive to the market worldwide. This development of DSM's Dalry site has been supported by the Scottish Government through Scottish Enterprise  the national agency supporting economic development and innovation.Reducing methane emissions is crucial for keeping warming below the 1.5°C target outlined in the Paris Agreement. Over 100 countries have signed a Global Methane Pledge   agreeing to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. The addition of new signatories in recent months  such as Australia in October 2022  underscores growing recognition of the need for urgent action. Ruminants (mainly cows) emit around 20% of all methane gasses globally  so reducing emissions in ruminant herds will play a vital role in meeting global climate ambitions.Bovaer® is a feed additive that can achieve an average enteric methane reduction of 30% in dairy cows  and 45% in beef cattle (with some tests showing reductions of up to 90%). DSM has initial product volumes available for near term market development. The product is in the early commercialization phase in many countries around the world  including the EU/EEA  Argentina  Australia  Brazil  Chile  Pakistan  Switzerland  Turkey  and Uruguay. Since the start of the development of Bovaer® an estimate of 15 000 tons of CO2e has been saved  and reductions will accelerate further once the Dalry plant is fully operational  expected in the course of 2025.Rt Hon Nicola Sturgeon MSP  First Minister of Scotland  said: ""Just one year on from the announcement at COP26  I am very pleased to see the progress being made on site and the fact that spades are now in the ground.We are here today to celebrate a world-leading project and multi-million pound investment which will make Scotland the home of this innovative product  underlining that Scotland continues to lead the way in delivering a net zero future.""Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEO of DSM  commented: ""After many years of hard work and dedication  it's a wonderful feeling to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for such a large-scale production facility. This is a historic moment for DSM: We are continuing to deliver on our 2030 methane pledge  one of our food systems commitments. I wish the construction team every success as they develop this plant in the coming years.""Scottish Enterprise's Chief Executive  Adrian Gillespie  added: ""Today's groundbreaking ceremony is a significant milestone and the next step in delivering such an innovative project for Ayrshire and Scotland.Royal DSM's Project Bovaer® has the potential to be a game-changer for emissions reductions from cattle. Scottish Enterprise has developed a close relationship with Royal DSM over many years and we were delighted to work with the company to secure Dalry as the home for this global manufacturing opportunity.""About Bovaer®Bovaer® is a feed additive for cows researched and developed over 10 years by DSM. Just a quarter teaspoon of Bovaer® per cow per day consistently reduces enteric methane emission by on average 30% for dairy cows on average 45% for beef cattle. The feed additive Bovaer® therefore contributes to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of meat  milk and dairy products. Bovaer® is the most extensively studied and scientifically proven solution to the challenge of burped methane to date. Upon feeding  it takes effect immediately.About DSM in DalryDSM is one of the region's most prominent companies  employing over 400 staff and around 150 to 200 contractors at the Dalry production facility situated in North Ayrshire  25 miles south-west of Glasgow.

In absolute terms  consolidated revenue grew by +15.0% over the period (the difference mainly came from US$ and £ currencies).The performance in 9M 2022 reflects  as expected  distinct growth pattern between first half and third quarter in the two business lines. This is attributable to the impact of covid lockdowns  a busier sports calendar in 2021 for Online sports betting & gaming  and a return to normalized pre-covid seasonality in Q3 2022 for Content Production & distribution.This is reflected as follows by business:In € million Q3 2021 Q3 2022 % change 9M 2021 9M 2022 % change % constant currency Production 570.0 575.9 1.0% 1 499.4 1 744.2 16.3% Distribution 82.3 107.6 30.8% 192.8 267.2 38.6% Other 42.0 34.1 -18.7% 108.1 110.4 2.2% Content production & distribution 694.2 717.6 3.4% 1 800.2 2 121.8 17.9% 13.8% Sportsbook 111.8 154.8 38.5% 445.6 477.1 7.1% Casino 26.9 25.3 -5.7% 76.9 71.8 -6.5% Poker 10.5 11.7 11.4% 32.1 34.9 8.7% Other 1.4 2.6 87.1% 4.6 7.2 56.8% Online sports betting & gaming 150.4 194.4 29.3% 559.1 591.0 5.7% 5.8% TOTAL REVENUE 844.6 912.1 8.0% 2 359.3 2 712.9 15.0% 12.0%Content production & distribution:After a strong recovery in H1 2022 in comparison with H1 2021 that was still heavily impacted by Covid effects  the business returned to a normalized pre-covid seasonality pattern in Q3 2022. Revenue totaled €2 122m  up +17.9% in absolute terms and +13.8% at constant currency over the first 9M 2022.Content production revenue rose by +16.3% over 9M 2022  driven by a dynamic production cycle  with the recommission of successful well-known programs (“Star Academy” and “Masterchef” in France)  the development of new shows delivered for local and international markets across both non-scripted (“Blow-up” in Germany  Australia and New Zealand  “Starstruck” in the UK)  and scripted (“SAS Rogue Heroes” for BBC in the UK and “Marie-Antoinette” for Canal+ in France) and to a lessor extent the positive impact from bolt-on acquisitions.Distribution: revenue increased by +38.6% driven by both linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted content such as “You” for Sky and “Peaky Blinders” for Netflix in the UK.Overall  the number of content hours at the end of September 2022 reached about 146 000 hours9  up +25% versus 9M 2021.Online sports betting & gaming:The Online sports betting & gaming business recorded +5.7% revenue growth in absolute terms over the first 9M 2022 (+5.8% at constant currency) with a strong rebound in Q3 2022 (+29.3%) following a first half that saw a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (including the Euro 2020 football tournament held in June / July 2021). These figures also reflect the discontinued Bet-at-home activities.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued Bet-at-home operations in certain jurisdictions  revenue was up +13% over 9M 2022  driven by the solid continued performance of Betclic entity (+15%)  offsetting the -11% decline at Bet-at-home.Unique Active Players increased sharply by +11% in 9M 2022 versus 9M 2021  illustrating the appeal of the Betclic platform.ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA amounted to €446.4m  up +17.5% over 9M 2022  on revenue up +15.0%. This was driven by a strong +23.4% rise to €297.2m for Content production & distribution and +8.4% to €150.8m for Online sports betting & gaming.Overall  this led to a 40bp improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin to 16.5% for the first 9M 2022  with improved profitability across both business lines thanks to revenue growth and a higher proportion of Distribution revenue for Content production & distribution as well as a strong operational leverage for Online sports betting & gaming.The increase in external and personnel expenses was mainly driven by Content production & distribution  in line with the increase in production revenue.In € million 9M 2021 9M 2022 % change Content production & distribution 240.8 297.2 23.4% Online sports betting & gaming 139.1 150.8 8.4% Holding (0.1) (1.5) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 17.5% Content production & distribution 13.4% 14.0% Online sports betting & gaming 24.9% 25.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5%NORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMENormalized P&L highlights the underlying performance of the group for the first 9M 2022 without one-off items related to reorganization and business combination.Comments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” over the first 9M 2022 compared to the first 9M 2021 reported P&L.In € million 9M 2021 Reported9M 2022 Reported (1) Transaction impact(2) 9M 2022 Normalized P&L(1) - (2) Revenue 2 359.3 2 712.9 2 712.9 External expenses (1 155.2) (1 308.5) (1 308.5) Personnel expenses excluding LTIP & employment-related earn-out & option expenses (815.9) (940.4) (940.4) Other operating income (loss) excl. restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (8.3) (15.8) (15.8) Depreciation and amortization expenses related to D&A fiction (0.1) (1.7) (1.7) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 446.4 Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5% 16.5% Restructuring costs and other non-recurring items (37.4) (99.5) (105.7) 6.2 LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses (127.3) (104.7) (33.0) (71.7) Depreciation and amortization (excl.

The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and Sanofi announce treatment success rates of up to 95% from a Phase II/III study investigating the safety and efficacy of single-dose acoziborole  a potentially transformative investigational treatment for sleeping sickness  published today in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal. The clinical trial was led by DNDi and its partners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea.Dr Victor KandeFormer Neglected Tropical Diseases Expert Advisor at the Ministry of Health of the DRC  principal investigator of the trial  and lead author of the Lancet article“Sleeping sickness is a nightmare disease that affects patients in some of the most remote settings in West and Central Africa  where distance from hospital can be measured in days. We are now on the cusp of a potential treatment that can be given in one day  in a single dose of three pills – this would be a revolution for doctors and communities.”Transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly  sleeping sickness is fatal without treatment. In the early stage of the disease  people suffer from headaches or fever. In the late stage  the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier and invades the central nervous system  causing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as sleep disruption  confusion  lethargy  and convulsions – and ultimately  death.Never been so close to elimination in decadesTreatment for sleeping sickness has radically improved in the last decade  thanks to the successes of a partnership bringing together DNDi  Sanofi  the national sleeping sickness control programmes of the DRC and Guinea  the World Health Organization (WHO)  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)  and other partners.The number of reported cases of sleeping sickness has fallen sharply in the last 20 years  from almost 40 000 reported cases in 1998 (with estimates of over 300 000 undiagnosed cases) to less than 1 000 in 2020. Though an encouraging trend  it should not be a reason for complacency  as the disease is known to resurge in the form of devastating outbreaks.Dr Antoine TarralHead of the sleeping sickness programme at DNDi and co-author of the paper“By simplifying the treatment paradigm  acoziborole would be an innovation that enables a sustainable response to sleeping sickness for health systems. With these new data  we have hope that we may be able to finally eliminate the disease  once and for all  by opening the door to a ‘screen-and-treat' approach at the village level.”Dr Wilfried Mutombo KalonjiDNDi Clinical Project Leader and Medical Manager  and co-author of the paper“Acoziborole has the potential to have a major impact on sleeping sickness treatment. This is a complicated disease  with patients living in very remote and unstable areas. We need simple approaches. We now have the promise of single-dose  oral treatment that doesn’t need to be taken with food  removes the need for hospitalization  removes the need for complex or invasive diagnosis or disease staging  and requires minimal training. In many ways  it doesn’t get any simpler than this.”The WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap strategy sets a goal of interrupting transmission of the gambiense strain of human African trypanosomiasis (g-HAT)  the scientific name of the disease  by 2030. (The gambiense strain accounts for 93% of all sleeping sickness cases). In alignment with this strategy  acoziborole could open the possibility of a simple ‘screen-and-treat’ approach  whereby any person whose rapid pinprick blood test suggests they might be infected could be treated with acoziborole  without the need for more complex parasitological confirmation or hospitalization.About the Phase II/III studyBetween 2016 and 2019  DNDi and its partners led an open-label  Phase II/III study to assess the safety and efficacy of acoziborole in patients with early- and late-stage g-HAT. 208 patients were recruited at 10 hospitals in the DRC and Guinea.The 18-month treatment success rate for acoziborole was 95% in late-stage g-HAT patients  corresponding to the best results from studies with existing treatments (94%). In addition  100% of the 41 patients with early-stage g-HAT were considered as treatment successes at all timepoints. The study shows that acoziborole has a favourable safety profile  with no significant drug-related safety signals reported.These pivotal results will form the basis of Sanofi’s dossier submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and represent another milestone in the quest to eliminate sleeping sickness. Upon the EMA’s positive opinion and local approval  Sanofi will donate acoziborole to the WHO through its philanthropic organization  Foundation S – The Sanofi Collective. Acoziborole is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDHead of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“Sanofi is a long-standing partner in the fight against sleeping sickness alongside DNDi and the World Health Organization. We are leveraging Sanofi’s unique expertise in developing  registering and producing new  innovative medicines to address areas of significant unmet need and in this case  support the World Health Organization’s goal to eliminate sleeping sickness in humans by 2030.”Dr Mariame Camaraprincipal investigator of the study at the HAT Treatment Centre in Dubreka  Guinea and co-author of the Lancet article“Many sleeping sickness patients live in remote villages in the mangrove swamps along the coast of Guinea – even though we have good treatment options now  we still need to send people who test positive with a sleeping sickness rapid test from their village to a confirmatory health centre. Acoziborole could potentially become the first treatment that would allow doctors to treat people on the spot  once they receive a positive rapid test in their village.”About the DNDi programme for the development of acoziboroleThe DNDi programme for the development of acoziborole was supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; UK aid; the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through KfW  Germany; the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Médecins Sans Frontières; the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS); the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  as part of Norway’s in-kind contribution to EDCTP2; Stavros Niarchos Foundation; the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID); and the BBVA Foundation (through the ‘Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Development Cooperation’).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

DNDi is also coordinating the ANTICOV clinical trial to find treatments for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases in low-resource settings. Since its inception in 2003  DNDi has delivered twelve new treatments to date  including new drug combinations for kala-azar  two fixed-dose antimalarials  and DNDi’s first successfully developed new chemical entity  fexinidazole  approved in 2018 for the treatment of both stages of sleeping sickness. dndi.orgMedia Relations SanofiSandrine Guendoul | + 33 6 25 09 14 25 | sandrine.guendoul@sanofi.comEvan Berland | +1 215 432 0234 | evan.berland@sanofi.comVictor Rouault | + 33 6 70 93 71 40 | victor.rouault@sanofi.comInvestor Relations SanofiEva Schaefer-Jansen | + 33 7 86 80 56 39 | eva.schaefer-jansen@sanofi.comCorentine Driancourt | + 33 6 40 56 92 21 | corentine.driancourt@sanofi.comMedia Relations DNDiFrédéric Ojardias (DNDi Geneva) | +41 79 431 62 16 | fojardias@dndi.orgIlan Moss (DNDi New York) | +1 646 266 5216 | imoss@dndi.orgFrancine Ngalula (DNDi Kinshasa) | + 243 816 402 389 | francinengal@gmail.comNotes for the editorsAcoziborole is the first oral single-dose new chemical entity to be issued from DNDi’s lead optimization programme for sleeping sickness. It started with an initial hit identified in the chemical library of Anacor Pharmaceuticals  which was acquired by Pfizer in 2016. The initial structure was then optimized with Scynexis and Pace University and was then selected as a candidate for development and Phase I safety studies conducted successfully in France.Acoziborole is the latest innovation brought by two decades of innovation efforts by DNDi  Sanofi  and partners. In 2009  they developed a combination of existing drugs known as NECT  which was extremely effective and much safer than the toxic arsenic derivative that doctors had to use at the time. A donation programme was set up by Sanofi and Bayer to the World Health Organization (WHO)  radically improving treatment options for patients.But NECT requires complex logistics  with each treatment weighing 8 kg  and must be administered in hospital settings with skilled staff. In 2018  DNDi  Sanofi  and partners developed fexinidazole  which became the first all-oral treatment available for sleeping sickness. This 10-day treatment is now available in all sleeping sickness-endemic countries.Acoziborole can be administered as a single oral dose  meaning treatment could be done in villages: healthcare workers from mobile teams will be able to immediately administer a single pill of acoziborole as soon as the patient is diagnosed  without the need of hospitalization or supervision of the treatment at home. This means it could become a major tool to facilitate the efforts to finally eliminate sleeping sickness.Sanofi Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  as amended.

Its latest batch of four satellites  each the size of three cubesats  were deployed Nov. 26 as a secondary payload aboard India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket.Karlsen said this successful launch will aid the company’s discussions with investors.More satellites enable the company to improve coverage and satellite revisit rates. Astrocast ultimately aims to operate 100 of them in low Earth orbit.In August  Italy’s D-Orbit said it struck a deal to use its orbital transfer vehicle to launch 20 Astrocast satellites over a three-year period.Karlsen said D-Orbit is slated to deploy four satellites for Astrocast in late December on a Falcon 9 rideshare mission.“That is it for this year ” he said  adding: “We are evaluating our launch plans for 2023 as we are meeting our customer needs with these satellites in orbit.”According to Karlsen  the company has also “partially funded” four more satellites “and the launch for them as well”.Astrocast recently recorded 287 000 Swiss Francs in revenues for the six months to the end of June  down from 824 000 Swiss Francs for the same period in 2021 — a year it benefited from a European Space Agency development contract.The company reported a 9.1 million Swiss Franc loss for the first half of 2022 in EBITDA — or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization — compared with a loss of 5.5 million Swiss Francs for H1 2021.At the end of June  Astrocast said it had a cash balance of 553 000 Swiss Francs.,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,mixed,0.12,0.19,0.69,True,English,"['Hiber', 'Astrocast', 'cash', 'failed', 'acquisition', 'Euronext Growth Paris junior stock market', 'European Space Agency development contract', 'Euronext Growth Oslo stock exchange', 'Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket', 'Dutch remote monitoring specialist', 'Swiss small satellite operator', '9.1 million Swiss Franc loss', 'key growth area', 'satellite revisit rates', 'orbital transfer vehicle', 'Falcon 9 rideshare mission', 'volatile financial markets', 'chief financial officer', '43 million Swiss Francs', '5.5 million Swiss Francs', 'initial commercial services', 'spectrum Hiber leases', 'stock listing', '287,000 Swiss Francs', '824,000 Swiss Francs', '553,000 Swiss Francs', 'remote areas', 'remote locations', 'Swiss operator', 'financial claim', 'successful launch', 'Dutch company', 'things devices', 'satellite-connected devices', 'particular focus', 'gas industry', 'Nov. 24 announcement', 'short-term debt', 'current operations', 'strategic alternatives', 'financial position', 'long-term basis', 'eventual listing', 'current timeframe', 'certain areas', 'purchase agreement', 'arbitration process', 'legal remedies', 'Fabienne Pinot', 'marketing director', 'latest batch', 'three cubesats', 'secondary payload', 'low Earth', 'three-year period', 'late December', 'launch plans', 'customer needs', 'six months', 'same period', 'first half', 'cash balance', 'Swiss company', 'new investors', '14 operational satellites', 'More satellites', 'Nov. 30 deadline', 'expansion plans', 'ongoing discussions', 'four satellites', 'Kjell Karlsen', 'existing investors', 'cash-strapped Astrocast', '20 Astrocast satellites', '20 satellites', 'TAMPA', 'Fla.', 'acquisition', 'shares', 'France', 'offering', 'summer', 'internet', 'constellation', 'Inmarsat', 'Americas', 'solutions', 'customers', 'assets', 'oil', 'May', 'fleet', 'end', 'coverage', 'intent', 'deal', 'SpaceNews', 'target', 'support', 'mediation', 'dispute', 'sale', 'Norway', 'August', 'February', 'size', 'India', 'Italy', 'D-Orbit', 'revenues', 'June', 'EBITDA', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortization', 'H1', '2022']",2022-11-30,2022-11-30,spacenews.com

Corporate & Other 1 1 12.5% n.a. 215 157 36.9% 26.2% Total 624 424 47.2% 37.1%Technicolor Creative Studios revenues amounted to €624 million in the first nine months 2022  up 47.2% (up 37.1% at constant rate) compared to the same period in 2021. Third quarter revenues increase by 36.9% to €215 million versus Q3 2021. This improvement resulted from the significant demand for original content compared to the first nine months of 2021 and was achieved despite lower-than-expected Q3 sales at MPC and The Mill  and advertising spending decline in Q2 and Q3 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions.At MPC  9-month 2022 revenues amounted to €317 million  up 99.1% (87.1% at constant exchange rate)  while Q3 2022 was up 54.8% year-on-year to €104 million. This significant revenue growth was driven by the continued ramp-up in production of major theatrical projects  as well as increasing contributions from all the major streaming platforms. However  growth of third quarter revenues was lower than initially anticipated due to the shortage of experienced talents creating more delays and inefficiencies in delivering some major projects.At Mikros Animation  9-month 2022 revenues amounted to €99 million and were up 70.4% (60.2% at constant exchange rate)  while Q3 2022 revenues were up 107.3% year-on-year to €43 million. This improvement was mainly a result of higher volumes in feature animation projects.At The Mill  9-month 2022 advertising revenues amounted to €198 million  representing an 0.1% decrease (8.6% decrease at constant exchange rate) compared to the same period in 2021. Activity was restricted by decelerating advertising spending growth compared with a high comparative base in 2021  along with the miss from passing on certain projects in Q3 because of the lack of specific types of experienced talent. Q3 revenues declined by 2.1% year-on-year to €65 million. The Mill activity is closely related to advertising spending  which is sensitive to the macroeconomic environment and GDP growth.At Technicolor Games  9-month 2022 revenues amounted to €10 million and were higher compared to the same period last year thanks to greater production capacity.Adjusted EBITDA after lease9-month 2022 adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €52 million (8.3% margin)  up €3 million compared to the same period in 2021 at constant rate. In Q3 2022  adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €9 million compared to €23 million in Q3 2021  with margin down from 14.8% to 4.2%.Despite the increase in revenues  9-month margin declined from 10.7% to 8.3%. Margin at The Mill decreased due to lower sales combined with the lack of experienced talents resulting in the miss of higher margin projects. In addition at MPC  during the third quarter shortage of experienced talent and high key talents departures drove production inefficiencies. This resulted in higher costs and production delays notably over the third quarter.At September 30  2022  the Company employed approximately 13 000 people.Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after leaseOver the first nine-month of 2022  adjusted operating free cash flow after lease2 amounted to €(78) million  compared to €11 million for the first nine-month of 2021.This €89 million deterioration is explained by:+€7 million adjusted EBITDA after lease improvement;More than offset by;€(23) million capex and capital lease cash out increase to €48 million  as a result of increased level of activity over the period;€(69) million working capital deterioration  due to lower advanced payments as the level of order book is lower compared with the same period last year and in parallel cash received from 2021 advanced payments is being consumed over the period along with the project’s advancement  notably over the third quarter;€(3) million of higher other non-current and restructuring cash out.Over the third quarter of 2022  adjusted operating free cash flow after lease amounted to €(59) million  compared to €(12) million for Q3 2021.This €(47) million deterioration is primarily explained by:€(14) million adjusted EBITDA after lease deterioration;€(9) million capex and capital lease cash out increase  as a result of increased level of activity over the period;€(28) million change in working capital deterioration from €(17) million to €(45) million  due to lower advanced payments as the level of order book is lower compared with the same period last year  lower intermediary milestone payments due to delivery delays and in parallel cash received from 2021 advanced payments is being consumed over the period along with the project’s advancement; less than offset by €3 million of lower other non-current and restructuring cash out.Standalone cash and debtCash and cash equivalents at the end of September 2022 amounted to €24 million and nominal gross debt excluding operating lease debt to €662 million (€742 million IFRS debt  €606 million excluding operating lease3).Liquidity as of September 30  2022 amounted to €57 million  consisting of the above €24 million of cash and cash equivalents and €33 million undrawn RCF (out of a total of €40 million RCF).As of November 25  2022  the Company fully drew its €40 million Revolving Credit Facility.Conclusion and next stepsWith the actions taken by the Company  including the Re*Imagined program  Technicolor Creative Studios is focused on resolving the operational issues and remains committed to deliver high quality projects.Given the current situation  based on the ongoing assessment and the revised expectations following November 15  2022  announcement  Technicolor Creative Studios estimates to date that it may face a liquidity shortage as from Q2 2023.In this context  Technicolor Creative Studios intends to soon engage in discussions with all stakeholders and/or third-party investors  in an effort to address its liquidity needs.Some institutional shareholders and financial lenders have already reiterated their support and willingness to help resolve the financial and operational issues. Clients continue to strongly rely on our strong skills for ongoing and additional projects and Technicolor Creative Studios remains committed to deliver high quality projects.An analyst audio webcast hosted by Christian Roberton  CEO and Laurent Carozzi  CFO will be held today  November 30  2022  at 6:30pm CEST.Financial Calendar2022 Full Year Results March 8  2023***WarningThis press release has been prepared by Technicolor Creative Studios SA (“TCS”) solely for informational purposes.In order to provide accounting information to understand the Group’s financial position  this press release includes Combined Financial information.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALONX) (Paris:ALONX)  hereafter ""Onxeo"" or the ""Company""  a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative drugs targeting tumor DNA Damage Response (DDR)  today announces the expansion of its pipeline of drug candidates with OX425  the optimized new compound of OX400 series sourced from its proprietary PlatON™ platform.OX425 is a new-generation decoy oligonucleotide (ODN) with a well differentiated mechanism of action from PARP inhibitors as it drives PARP-1 hyperactivation and leads to exhaustion of the DNA damage response  ultimately killing cancer cells. In addition  it also leads to activation of the STING pathway. In preclinical proof-of-concept studies performed to date  OX425 demonstrated high antitumor activity while sparing healthy cells. It also showed the ability to mediate multiple immunostimulatory effects  standing out as promising option for potential combination with immunotherapy  especially in tumors that are not attackable by the immune system (""cold"" tumors).Like the other drug candidates sourced from platON™  such as AsiDNA™  OX425’s benefits from decoy agonist mechanism of action and does not induce tumor resistance to treatment. This profile represents a clear differentiation from other targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors. Moreover  OX425 shows no activity on healthy cells  which should yield a favorable safety profile in the clinical setting.Story continuesBased on these promising results  Onxeo will complete the preclinical development with the objective to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) with the FDA in mid of 2023.Dr. Shefali Agarwal  President and CEO of Onxeo  stated: ""With the selection of OX425  we demonstrate once again our ability to source new drug candidates with distinctive properties based on the unique decoy mechanism of action which is the technological engine of our PlatON™ platform. OX425 showed robust antitumor activity during our preclinical studies in multiple solid tumor models from different indications. OX425 is thus positioned as an innovative monotherapy and an ideal candidate for partnering  particularly in combination with immunotherapies  and specifically in cold tumors.""About OnxeoOnxeo (Euronext Growth Paris: ALONX) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing innovative oncology drugs targeting tumor DNA-binding functions through unique mechanisms of action in the sought-after field of DNA Damage Response (DDR). The Company is focused on bringing early-stage first-in-class or disruptive compounds from translational research to clinical proof-of-concept  a value-creating inflection point appealing to potential partners.platON™ is Onxeo’s proprietary chemistry platform of oligonucleotides acting as decoy agonists  which generates new innovative compounds and broaden the Company’s product pipeline.AsiDNA  the first compound from platON  is a highly differentiated  clinical-stage first-in-class candidate in the field of DNA damage response (DDR) applied to oncology. Its decoy and agonist mechanism acting upstream of multiple DDR pathways results in distinctive antitumor properties  including the ability to prevent or abrogate tumor resistance to targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors and strong synergy with tumor DNA-damaging agents such as radio-chemotherapy. AsiDNA is currently being studied in Europe and the US in combination with other treatment modalities in difficult-to-treat solid tumors.OX425  the second compound from platON  is a novel DDR Decoy Agonist with high antitumor activity. It also mediates multiple immunostimulatory effects by activating the STING pathway. OX425 is currently undergoing IND-enabling preclinical development.For further information  please visit www.onxeo.com.Forward looking statementsThis communication expressly or implicitly contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Onxeo and its business.
