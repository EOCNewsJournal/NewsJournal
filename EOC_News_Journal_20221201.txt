Polling nearly 1 000 IT leaders  architects  and developers about their digital strategies and top concerns  the survey found nearly 40% of organizations are in the process of adopting a new hybrid approach for their IT infrastructure. The transformation comes as 68% of respondents cite their fears about API sprawl.The survey data reflects responses from those engaged primarily in API development (893) and managed file transfer (MFT) services (102). Ensuring data security and controlling API sprawl were top concerns  with over two-thirds (68%) worrying about complexity due to sprawl and almost half (48%) of respondents ranking “increased security challenges” as their single greatest concern with API growth. Respondents again cited security as far and away the most important criteria when creating an API (30% among API respondents) and when setting up a new MFT service (48% among MFT respondents).“Enterprises are in the thick of digital transformation and accompanying cloud and data migrations have made it possible to free up data so it can be exchanged  reused and remixed to fuel innovation and business growth. But that’s messy ” said Vince Padua  Chief Innovation and Technology Officer at Axway. “It brings complexity and security challenges that must be answered by using truly universal API management—that bridges the gap between API development and consumption and opens everything  lines of business and innovation  while building on and out from heritage infrastructure.”The survey results indicate that budgets for API management have increased over the past two years and that security is top of mind as companies begin to unlock the full value of their data to create new digital experiences  markets and opportunities for revenue. Half of those surveyed reported modestly elevated API management budgets  with about 34% of respondents seeing increases up to 25%. Less than 20% of respondents saw budget decreases.Drilling down further into security strategy and the impending skills gapDigging deeper  the survey found that a significant majority  59%  employ user authentication as a top strategy to secure APIs  and almost two-thirds of the API respondents (61%) said data encryption can help them personally feel their data is more secure. They also cited developing a more holistic approach to security as the number one strategy for protecting personal data.When a member logs into our online channels or walks into one of our branches  we want to personalize their experience in real time. To achieve this  we targeted a high-performance API integration layer ” said Ravi Peru  Chief Information Officer at Community America Credit Union.""When you have more than 50 products  handling integration in an agile way is very important "" added Peru. ""With Axway  we can interface with anything and move data between any internal systems we want. That would be really slow with point-to-point integration  but Axway makes it quick and easy.""Security factors into cloud strategy as well. Among the most significant challenges inhibiting cloud strategy  according to respondents  are:53% – Dealing with different security requirements for regional instances of cloud infra55% – Tracking and controlling the flow of personal data into and through the cloudOne of the most alarming  but not entirely surprising data points  deals with concerns about talent: 86% of API respondents fear an expertise gap in the coming years  where companies will not have the skilled software and IT infrastructure talent they need to innovate.Click here to see the full report.Survey MethodologyThe 2022 Open Everything Strategy Survey was conducted between July 21 and August 16 of 2022 among two similar  but divided subsets of respondents: API development and MFT integration professionals. Axway engaged in direct email outreach among its contacts with opt-in email addresses  and received nearly 1 000 responses  including 893 from those in API development and 102 in MFT services  from various locations throughout the world.About AxwayAxway enables enterprises to securely open everything by integrating and moving data across a complex world of new and old technologies.

It has a portfolio of 398 stocks  a 12-month distribution yield of 2.99% and a total expense ratio of 0.15%. Dividends are paid quarterly.As described in the prospectus by iShares  eligible companies must:pay a qualified dividend have at least five years of uninterrupted annual dividend growth have an earnings payout ratio of less than 75% not be in the top decile of the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index ranked on dividend yield.The fund invests mostly in large and mega cap companies (86% of asset value).

The top 2 countries  Canada and Japan  weigh 40% together. Europe represents about 42% of asset value. The fund is overweight in financials. Therefore  valuation ratios are skewed and the fund may not be as cheap as it looks. The yield is quite attractive for a dividend growth fund  but total return since inception is significantly behind at least 3 other global dividend growth ETFs.

It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

Its latest batch of four satellites  each the size of three cubesats  were deployed Nov. 26 as a secondary payload aboard India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket.Karlsen said this successful launch will aid the company’s discussions with investors.More satellites enable the company to improve coverage and satellite revisit rates. Astrocast ultimately aims to operate 100 of them in low Earth orbit.In August  Italy’s D-Orbit said it struck a deal to use its orbital transfer vehicle to launch 20 Astrocast satellites over a three-year period.Karlsen said D-Orbit is slated to deploy four satellites for Astrocast in late December on a Falcon 9 rideshare mission.“That is it for this year ” he said  adding: “We are evaluating our launch plans for 2023 as we are meeting our customer needs with these satellites in orbit.”According to Karlsen  the company has also “partially funded” four more satellites “and the launch for them as well”.Astrocast recently recorded 287 000 Swiss Francs in revenues for the six months to the end of June  down from 824 000 Swiss Francs for the same period in 2021 — a year it benefited from a European Space Agency development contract.The company reported a 9.1 million Swiss Franc loss for the first half of 2022 in EBITDA — or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization — compared with a loss of 5.5 million Swiss Francs for H1 2021.At the end of June  Astrocast said it had a cash balance of 553 000 Swiss Francs.,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,mixed,0.12,0.19,0.69,True,English,"['failed acquisition', 'Hiber', 'Astrocast', 'cash', 'SpaceNews', 'Euronext Growth Paris junior stock market', 'European Space Agency development contract', 'Euronext Growth Oslo stock exchange', 'Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket', 'Dutch remote monitoring specialist', 'Swiss small satellite operator', '9.1 million Swiss Franc loss', 'key growth area', 'satellite revisit rates', 'orbital transfer vehicle', 'Falcon 9 rideshare mission', 'volatile financial markets', 'chief financial officer', '43 million Swiss Francs', '5.5 million Swiss Francs', 'initial commercial services', 'spectrum Hiber leases', 'stock listing', '287,000 Swiss Francs', '824,000 Swiss Francs', '553,000 Swiss Francs', 'remote areas', 'remote locations', 'Swiss operator', 'financial claim', 'successful launch', 'Dutch company', 'things devices', 'satellite-connected devices', 'particular focus', 'gas industry', 'Nov. 24 announcement', 'short-term debt', 'current operations', 'strategic alternatives', 'financial position', 'long-term basis', 'eventual listing', 'current timeframe', 'certain areas', 'purchase agreement', 'arbitration process', 'legal remedies', 'Fabienne Pinot', 'marketing director', 'latest batch', 'three cubesats', 'secondary payload', 'low Earth', 'three-year period', 'late December', 'launch plans', 'customer needs', 'six months', 'same period', 'first half', 'cash balance', 'Swiss company', 'new investors', '14 operational satellites', 'More satellites', 'Nov. 30 deadline', 'expansion plans', 'ongoing discussions', 'four satellites', 'Kjell Karlsen', 'existing investors', 'cash-strapped Astrocast', '20 Astrocast satellites', '20 satellites', 'TAMPA', 'Fla.', 'acquisition', 'shares', 'France', 'offering', 'summer', 'internet', 'constellation', 'Inmarsat', 'Americas', 'solutions', 'customers', 'assets', 'oil', 'May', 'fleet', 'end', 'coverage', 'intent', 'deal', 'SpaceNews', 'target', 'support', 'mediation', 'dispute', 'sale', 'Norway', 'August', 'February', 'size', 'India', 'Italy', 'D-Orbit', 'revenues', 'June', 'EBITDA', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortization', 'H1', '2022']",2022-11-30,2022-12-01,spacenews.com

Following an increased call for…,PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Thales today announced the launch of its CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager integration with the AWS External Key Store  a feature of the AWS Key Management Service announced at AWS re:Invent 2022. Following an increased call for enhanced sovereign controls amid growing regulatory requirements  the integration enables organisations to retain control of their encryption keys when migrating their sensitive data to the AWS cloud.Developed with Thales since its inception  the AWS External Key Store combined with CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager offers organisations looking to move critical workloads to the cloud a way to maintain sovereign control of sensitive data throughout their digital transformation journey.“We’ve had a strong technical collaboration with Thales on the development of the AWS External Key Store specification from the very beginning  in part due to their long history of expertise developing hardware security modules and key management services ” said Ken Beer  General Manager  Key Management Service at AWS. “The cloud has become a critical point of operation across businesses  and our combined expertise provides a way of helping organisations address specific needs and know they’re getting industry-best security controls in the process.”According to the Thales 2022 Cloud Security Study  encryption is the number one choice to protect data in the cloud. However  only about one-third (29%) of respondents report total control of their keys to encrypted data in the cloud. User-controlled encryption and key management in hybrid IT are essential safeguards to enforce digital sovereignty in a modern data-driven world governed by privacy compliance mandates  regulated sectors  or general IT security recommendations such as the Shared Responsibility Model and the NIS2 Directive.CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager ensures AWS External Key Store customers can satisfy these urgent regulatory requirements by leveraging strong encryption and data security methods that allow organisations to manage their data separately from the cloud service provider. Such a safeguard  also known as Hold Your Own Key (HYOK)  enables organisations to maintain key ownership separate from the cloud data store.“Varying data protection regulations across countries have presented a challenge for global organisations migrating to the cloud ” said Heleen Herselman  VP AWS Powerhouse at T-Systems Cloud Service. “The CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager simplifies this challenge and ensures we remain compliant while taking advantage of all the benefits of leveraging cloud services. The ability to lean on Thales’ solution has become especially important  as we  and other organisations  increasingly rely on multi-cloud environments.”CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager is an industry-leading multi-cloud encryption key life cycle management solution that supports all major public cloud service providers. With a marked increase in multi-cloud adoption  this solution allows users to centralise key management across all clouds.“This is the first integration on the market to solve a major pain point for AWS cloud customers: how can they utilise protected data in the AWS cloud while retaining encryption keys outside the cloud.” said Todd Moore  VP  Encryption Products at Thales. “As an industry leader in key management solutions  we are proud to offer an encryption solution that provides the ability to maintain external control of keys and cryptographic operations using those keys. CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager is at the forefront of advanced digital sovereignty. We’ll continue to introduce cutting-edge security and compliance features that support organisations in their digital transformation journeys.”The Thales CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager integration for AWS External Key Store is available today.

In absolute terms  consolidated revenue grew by +15.0% over the period (the difference mainly came from US$ and £ currencies).The performance in 9M 2022 reflects  as expected  distinct growth pattern between first half and third quarter in the two business lines.

Revenue totaled €2 122m  up +17.9% in absolute terms and +13.8% at constant currency over the first 9M 2022.Content production revenue rose by +16.3% over 9M 2022  driven by a dynamic production cycle  with the recommission of successful well-known programs (“Star Academy” and “Masterchef” in France)  the development of new shows delivered for local and international markets across both non-scripted (“Blow-up” in Germany  Australia and New Zealand  “Starstruck” in the UK)  and scripted (“SAS Rogue Heroes” for BBC in the UK and “Marie-Antoinette” for Canal+ in France) and to a lessor extent the positive impact from bolt-on acquisitions.Distribution: revenue increased by +38.6% driven by both linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted content such as “You” for Sky and “Peaky Blinders” for Netflix in the UK.Overall  the number of content hours at the end of September 2022 reached about 146 000 hours9  up +25% versus 9M 2021.Online sports betting & gaming:The Online sports betting & gaming business recorded +5.7% revenue growth in absolute terms over the first 9M 2022 (+5.8% at constant currency) with a strong rebound in Q3 2022 (+29.3%) following a first half that saw a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (including the Euro 2020 football tournament held in June / July 2021). These figures also reflect the discontinued Bet-at-home activities.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued Bet-at-home operations in certain jurisdictions  revenue was up +13% over 9M 2022  driven by the solid continued performance of Betclic entity (+15%)  offsetting the -11% decline at Bet-at-home.Unique Active Players increased sharply by +11% in 9M 2022 versus 9M 2021  illustrating the appeal of the Betclic platform.ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA amounted to €446.4m  up +17.5% over 9M 2022  on revenue up +15.0%. This was driven by a strong +23.4% rise to €297.2m for Content production & distribution and +8.4% to €150.8m for Online sports betting & gaming.Overall  this led to a 40bp improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin to 16.5% for the first 9M 2022  with improved profitability across both business lines thanks to revenue growth and a higher proportion of Distribution revenue for Content production & distribution as well as a strong operational leverage for Online sports betting & gaming.The increase in external and personnel expenses was mainly driven by Content production & distribution  in line with the increase in production revenue.In € million 9M 2021 9M 2022 % change Content production & distribution 240.8 297.2 23.4% Online sports betting & gaming 139.1 150.8 8.4% Holding (0.1) (1.5) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 17.5% Content production & distribution 13.4% 14.0% Online sports betting & gaming 24.9% 25.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5%NORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMENormalized P&L highlights the underlying performance of the group for the first 9M 2022 without one-off items related to reorganization and business combination.Comments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” over the first 9M 2022 compared to the first 9M 2021 reported P&L.In € million 9M 2021 Reported9M 2022 Reported (1) Transaction impact(2) 9M 2022 Normalized P&L(1) - (2) Revenue 2 359.3 2 712.9 2 712.9 External expenses (1 155.2) (1 308.5) (1 308.5) Personnel expenses excluding LTIP & employment-related earn-out & option expenses (815.9) (940.4) (940.4) Other operating income (loss) excl. restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (8.3) (15.8) (15.8) Depreciation and amortization expenses related to D&A fiction (0.1) (1.7) (1.7) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 446.4 Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5% 16.5% Restructuring costs and other non-recurring items (37.4) (99.5) (105.7) 6.2 LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses (127.3) (104.7) (33.0) (71.7) Depreciation and amortization (excl.

Under IFRS  the merger with the SPAC is considered as an equity-settled share-based payment for a service rendered by the SPAC to list the Group. This service is valued at €86m and is recorded as a listing fee.LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses : €33m mainly driven by the change in fair value of financial instruments explained by the LTIP following the upward reassessment of the Banijay Group’s shares.Other finance income / loss: €96m attributable mainly to the change in fair value of financial instruments. This includes re-evaluation and the change in fair value of Vivendi’s convertible bond derivatives following the upward assessment of the Banijay Group’s shares.

Of this amount:Cost of net debt totaled -€106.4m in 9M 2022 vs -€99.5m in 9M 2021  mostly attributable to a higher level of interest charges explained by a timing effect of interest charges related to Betclic loan issued on 13 December 2021.Other financial income and expenses as of September 2022 amounted to +€15.3m  compared to - €18.9m for 9M 2021 mainly explained by derivatives during 9M 2022.Income tax expensesThe tax charge in 9M 2022 totaled -€40.3m compared to -€16.0m in 9M 2021  representing an effective tax rate of 17.2% compared with 12.5% respectively.The change is mostly explained by a particularly low effective income tax interest rate in over 9M 2021 due to the use of significant loss carry-forward in 2021 for Online sports betting & gaming business.Adjusted net incomeAdjusted net income rose by +15.3% to €209.8m in 9M 2022 from €181.8m in 9M 2021.FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBT OVER 9M 2022FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSIONAdjusted free cash flow (after lease payments) reached €369m  up +66m yoy (+21.6%)  driven by the business performance as well as a tight control of cash expenses and capex.The change in working capital mainly derived from Content production and distribution.

The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and Sanofi announce treatment success rates of up to 95% from a Phase II/III study investigating the safety and efficacy of single-dose acoziborole  a potentially transformative investigational treatment for sleeping sickness  published today in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal. The clinical trial was led by DNDi and its partners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea.Dr Victor KandeFormer Neglected Tropical Diseases Expert Advisor at the Ministry of Health of the DRC  principal investigator of the trial  and lead author of the Lancet article“Sleeping sickness is a nightmare disease that affects patients in some of the most remote settings in West and Central Africa  where distance from hospital can be measured in days. We are now on the cusp of a potential treatment that can be given in one day  in a single dose of three pills – this would be a revolution for doctors and communities.”Transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly  sleeping sickness is fatal without treatment. In the early stage of the disease  people suffer from headaches or fever. In the late stage  the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier and invades the central nervous system  causing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as sleep disruption  confusion  lethargy  and convulsions – and ultimately  death.Never been so close to elimination in decadesTreatment for sleeping sickness has radically improved in the last decade  thanks to the successes of a partnership bringing together DNDi  Sanofi  the national sleeping sickness control programmes of the DRC and Guinea  the World Health Organization (WHO)  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)  and other partners.Story continuesThe number of reported cases of sleeping sickness has fallen sharply in the last 20 years  from almost 40 000 reported cases in 1998 (with estimates of over 300 000 undiagnosed cases) to less than 1 000 in 2020. Though an encouraging trend  it should not be a reason for complacency  as the disease is known to resurge in the form of devastating outbreaks.Dr Antoine TarralHead of the sleeping sickness programme at DNDi and co-author of the paper“By simplifying the treatment paradigm  acoziborole would be an innovation that enables a sustainable response to sleeping sickness for health systems. With these new data  we have hope that we may be able to finally eliminate the disease  once and for all  by opening the door to a ‘screen-and-treat' approach at the village level.”Dr Wilfried Mutombo KalonjiDNDi Clinical Project Leader and Medical Manager  and co-author of the paper“Acoziborole has the potential to have a major impact on sleeping sickness treatment. This is a complicated disease  with patients living in very remote and unstable areas. We need simple approaches. We now have the promise of single-dose  oral treatment that doesn’t need to be taken with food  removes the need for hospitalization  removes the need for complex or invasive diagnosis or disease staging  and requires minimal training. In many ways  it doesn’t get any simpler than this.”The WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap strategy sets a goal of interrupting transmission of the gambiense strain of human African trypanosomiasis (g-HAT)  the scientific name of the disease  by 2030. (The gambiense strain accounts for 93% of all sleeping sickness cases). In alignment with this strategy  acoziborole could open the possibility of a simple ‘screen-and-treat’ approach  whereby any person whose rapid pinprick blood test suggests they might be infected could be treated with acoziborole  without the need for more complex parasitological confirmation or hospitalization.About the Phase II/III studyBetween 2016 and 2019  DNDi and its partners led an open-label  Phase II/III study to assess the safety and efficacy of acoziborole in patients with early- and late-stage g-HAT. 208 patients were recruited at 10 hospitals in the DRC and Guinea.The 18-month treatment success rate for acoziborole was 95% in late-stage g-HAT patients  corresponding to the best results from studies with existing treatments (94%). In addition  100% of the 41 patients with early-stage g-HAT were considered as treatment successes at all timepoints. The study shows that acoziborole has a favourable safety profile  with no significant drug-related safety signals reported.These pivotal results will form the basis of Sanofi’s dossier submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and represent another milestone in the quest to eliminate sleeping sickness. Upon the EMA’s positive opinion and local approval  Sanofi will donate acoziborole to the WHO through its philanthropic organization  Foundation S – The Sanofi Collective. Acoziborole is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDHead of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“Sanofi is a long-standing partner in the fight against sleeping sickness alongside DNDi and the World Health Organization. We are leveraging Sanofi’s unique expertise in developing  registering and producing new  innovative medicines to address areas of significant unmet need and in this case  support the World Health Organization’s goal to eliminate sleeping sickness in humans by 2030.”Dr Mariame Camaraprincipal investigator of the study at the HAT Treatment Centre in Dubreka  Guinea and co-author of the Lancet article“Many sleeping sickness patients live in remote villages in the mangrove swamps along the coast of Guinea – even though we have good treatment options now  we still need to send people who test positive with a sleeping sickness rapid test from their village to a confirmatory health centre. Acoziborole could potentially become the first treatment that would allow doctors to treat people on the spot  once they receive a positive rapid test in their village.”About the DNDi programme for the development of acoziboroleThe DNDi programme for the development of acoziborole was supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; UK aid; the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through KfW  Germany; the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Médecins Sans Frontières; the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS); the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  as part of Norway’s in-kind contribution to EDCTP2; Stavros Niarchos Foundation; the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID); and the BBVA Foundation (through the ‘Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Development Cooperation’).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

DNDi is also coordinating the ANTICOV clinical trial to find treatments for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases in low-resource settings. Since its inception in 2003  DNDi has delivered twelve new treatments to date  including new drug combinations for kala-azar  two fixed-dose antimalarials  and DNDi’s first successfully developed new chemical entity  fexinidazole  approved in 2018 for the treatment of both stages of sleeping sickness. dndi.orgMedia Relations SanofiSandrine Guendoul | + 33 6 25 09 14 25 | sandrine.guendoul@sanofi.comEvan Berland | +1 215 432 0234 | evan.berland@sanofi.comVictor Rouault | + 33 6 70 93 71 40 | victor.rouault@sanofi.comInvestor Relations SanofiEva Schaefer-Jansen | + 33 7 86 80 56 39 | eva.schaefer-jansen@sanofi.comCorentine Driancourt | + 33 6 40 56 92 21 | corentine.driancourt@sanofi.comMedia Relations DNDiFrédéric Ojardias (DNDi Geneva) | +41 79 431 62 16 | fojardias@dndi.orgIlan Moss (DNDi New York) | +1 646 266 5216 | imoss@dndi.orgFrancine Ngalula (DNDi Kinshasa) | + 243 816 402 389 | francinengal@gmail.comNotes for the editorsAcoziborole is the first oral single-dose new chemical entity to be issued from DNDi’s lead optimization programme for sleeping sickness. It started with an initial hit identified in the chemical library of Anacor Pharmaceuticals  which was acquired by Pfizer in 2016. The initial structure was then optimized with Scynexis and Pace University and was then selected as a candidate for development and Phase I safety studies conducted successfully in France.Acoziborole is the latest innovation brought by two decades of innovation efforts by DNDi  Sanofi  and partners. In 2009  they developed a combination of existing drugs known as NECT  which was extremely effective and much safer than the toxic arsenic derivative that doctors had to use at the time. A donation programme was set up by Sanofi and Bayer to the World Health Organization (WHO)  radically improving treatment options for patients.But NECT requires complex logistics  with each treatment weighing 8 kg  and must be administered in hospital settings with skilled staff. In 2018  DNDi  Sanofi  and partners developed fexinidazole  which became the first all-oral treatment available for sleeping sickness. This 10-day treatment is now available in all sleeping sickness-endemic countries.Acoziborole can be administered as a single oral dose  meaning treatment could be done in villages: healthcare workers from mobile teams will be able to immediately administer a single pill of acoziborole as soon as the patient is diagnosed  without the need of hospitalization or supervision of the treatment at home. This means it could become a major tool to facilitate the efforts to finally eliminate sleeping sickness.Sanofi Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  as amended.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The Uaru project is located in the Stabroek Block  a 26 800 km2 strategic basin located off Guyana’s continental shelf  where several important discoveries have been made since 2015.The Group will deliver 35 000 metric tons of line-pipe  including 2 000 metric tons of X80  an innovative and unique material developed and qualified by Vallourec’s R&D teams.

Our new grade X80 has been qualified by ExxonMobil and will be field-proven with this order  demonstrating Vallourec’s ability to deliver solutions to the industry that are both technology and efficiency enablers. This is a new milestone in Vallourec's long history with ExxonMobil  and I would like to thank ExxonMobil once again for its confidence and our own teams for this great work”.The contract is subject to ExxonMobil Guyana securing necessary approvals from the Government of Guyana for the project.About VallourecVallourec is a world leader in premium tubular solutions for the energy markets and for demanding industrial applications such as oil & gas wells in harsh environments  new generation power plants  challenging architectural projects  and high-performance mechanical equipment.

The plant will signi…,"HEERLEN  Netherlands  Nov. 30  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Royal DSM  a global purpose-led science-based company active in Health  Nutrition and Bioscience  today began construction of a new manufacturing facility at its site in Dalry  Scotland. The plant will significantly increase global production of Bovaer®  DSM's unique methane-reducing feed additive for cattle. In an official groundbreaking ceremony attended by the First Minister of Scotland  Nicola Sturgeon  and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEO of DSM  the company marked the next step in its plan to use Bovaer® to reduce global methane emissions and contribute to worldwide methane reduction targets.DSM announced that planning had started during the UN Climate Change Conference last year in Glasgow. Construction officially began today on a facility that will help DSM scale-up production of Bovaer® in the coming years and marks another milestone in the company's ambition to bring its methane-reducing feed additive to the market worldwide. This development of DSM's Dalry site has been supported by the Scottish Government through Scottish Enterprise  the national agency supporting economic development and innovation.Reducing methane emissions is crucial for keeping warming below the 1.5°C target outlined in the Paris Agreement. Over 100 countries have signed a Global Methane Pledge   agreeing to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. The addition of new signatories in recent months  such as Australia in October 2022  underscores growing recognition of the need for urgent action. Ruminants (mainly cows) emit around 20% of all methane gasses globally  so reducing emissions in ruminant herds will play a vital role in meeting global climate ambitions.Bovaer® is a feed additive that can achieve an average enteric methane reduction of 30% in dairy cows  and 45% in beef cattle (with some tests showing reductions of up to 90%). DSM has initial product volumes available for near term market development. The product is in the early commercialization phase in many countries around the world  including the EU/EEA  Argentina  Australia  Brazil  Chile  Pakistan  Switzerland  Turkey  and Uruguay. Since the start of the development of Bovaer® an estimate of 15 000 tons of CO2e has been saved  and reductions will accelerate further once the Dalry plant is fully operational  expected in the course of 2025.Rt Hon Nicola Sturgeon MSP  First Minister of Scotland  said: ""Just one year on from the announcement at COP26  I am very pleased to see the progress being made on site and the fact that spades are now in the ground.We are here today to celebrate a world-leading project and multi-million pound investment which will make Scotland the home of this innovative product  underlining that Scotland continues to lead the way in delivering a net zero future.""Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEO of DSM  commented: ""After many years of hard work and dedication  it's a wonderful feeling to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for such a large-scale production facility. This is a historic moment for DSM: We are continuing to deliver on our 2030 methane pledge  one of our food systems commitments. I wish the construction team every success as they develop this plant in the coming years.""Scottish Enterprise's Chief Executive  Adrian Gillespie  added: ""Today's groundbreaking ceremony is a significant milestone and the next step in delivering such an innovative project for Ayrshire and Scotland.Royal DSM's Project Bovaer® has the potential to be a game-changer for emissions reductions from cattle. Scottish Enterprise has developed a close relationship with Royal DSM over many years and we were delighted to work with the company to secure Dalry as the home for this global manufacturing opportunity.""About Bovaer®Bovaer® is a feed additive for cows researched and developed over 10 years by DSM. Just a quarter teaspoon of Bovaer® per cow per day consistently reduces enteric methane emission by on average 30% for dairy cows on average 45% for beef cattle. The feed additive Bovaer® therefore contributes to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of meat  milk and dairy products. Bovaer® is the most extensively studied and scientifically proven solution to the challenge of burped methane to date. Upon feeding  it takes effect immediately.About DSM in DalryDSM is one of the region's most prominent companies  employing over 400 staff and around 150 to 200 contractors at the Dalry production facility situated in North Ayrshire  25 miles south-west of Glasgow.

This is attributable to the impact of covid lockdowns  a busier sports calendar in 2021 for Online sports betting & gaming  and a return to normalized pre-covid seasonality in Q3 2022 for Content Production & distribution.This is reflected as follows by business:In € million Q3 2021 Q3 2022 % change 9M 2021 9M 2022 % change % constant currency Production 570.0 575.9 1.0% 1 499.4 1 744.2 16.3% Distribution 82.3 107.6 30.8% 192.8 267.2 38.6% Other 42.0 34.1 -18.7% 108.1 110.4 2.2% Content production & distribution 694.2 717.6 3.4% 1 800.2 2 121.8 17.9% 13.8% Sportsbook 111.8 154.8 38.5% 445.6 477.1 7.1% Casino 26.9 25.3 -5.7% 76.9 71.8 -6.5% Poker 10.5 11.7 11.4% 32.1 34.9 8.7% Other 1.4 2.6 87.1% 4.6 7.2 56.8% Online sports betting & gaming 150.4 194.4 29.3% 559.1 591.0 5.7% 5.8% TOTAL REVENUE 844.6 912.1 8.0% 2 359.3 2 712.9 15.0% 12.0%Content production & distribution:After a strong recovery in H1 2022 in comparison with H1 2021 that was still heavily impacted by Covid effects  the business returned to a normalized pre-covid seasonality pattern in Q3 2022. Revenue totaled €2 122m  up +17.9% in absolute terms and +13.8% at constant currency over the first 9M 2022.Content production revenue rose by +16.3% over 9M 2022  driven by a dynamic production cycle  with the recommission of successful well-known programs (“Star Academy” and “Masterchef” in France)  the development of new shows delivered for local and international markets across both non-scripted (“Blow-up” in Germany  Australia and New Zealand  “Starstruck” in the UK)  and scripted (“SAS Rogue Heroes” for BBC in the UK and “Marie-Antoinette” for Canal+ in France) and to a lessor extent the positive impact from bolt-on acquisitions.Distribution: revenue increased by +38.6% driven by both linear TV and streaming platforms for key non-scripted and scripted content such as “You” for Sky and “Peaky Blinders” for Netflix in the UK.Overall  the number of content hours at the end of September 2022 reached about 146 000 hours9  up +25% versus 9M 2021.Online sports betting & gaming:The Online sports betting & gaming business recorded +5.7% revenue growth in absolute terms over the first 9M 2022 (+5.8% at constant currency) with a strong rebound in Q3 2022 (+29.3%) following a first half that saw a quieter sports calendar compared with H1 2021 (including the Euro 2020 football tournament held in June / July 2021). These figures also reflect the discontinued Bet-at-home activities.At constant exchange rates and excluding discontinued Bet-at-home operations in certain jurisdictions  revenue was up +13% over 9M 2022  driven by the solid continued performance of Betclic entity (+15%)  offsetting the -11% decline at Bet-at-home.Unique Active Players increased sharply by +11% in 9M 2022 versus 9M 2021  illustrating the appeal of the Betclic platform.ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA amounted to €446.4m  up +17.5% over 9M 2022  on revenue up +15.0%. This was driven by a strong +23.4% rise to €297.2m for Content production & distribution and +8.4% to €150.8m for Online sports betting & gaming.Overall  this led to a 40bp improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin to 16.5% for the first 9M 2022  with improved profitability across both business lines thanks to revenue growth and a higher proportion of Distribution revenue for Content production & distribution as well as a strong operational leverage for Online sports betting & gaming.The increase in external and personnel expenses was mainly driven by Content production & distribution  in line with the increase in production revenue.In € million 9M 2021 9M 2022 % change Content production & distribution 240.8 297.2 23.4% Online sports betting & gaming 139.1 150.8 8.4% Holding (0.1) (1.5) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 17.5% Content production & distribution 13.4% 14.0% Online sports betting & gaming 24.9% 25.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5%NORMALIZED P&L: FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ADJUSTED NET INCOMENormalized P&L highlights the underlying performance of the group for the first 9M 2022 without one-off items related to reorganization and business combination.Comments thereafter analyze the “Normalized P&L” over the first 9M 2022 compared to the first 9M 2021 reported P&L.In € million 9M 2021 Reported9M 2022 Reported (1) Transaction impact(2) 9M 2022 Normalized P&L(1) - (2) Revenue 2 359.3 2 712.9 2 712.9 External expenses (1 155.2) (1 308.5) (1 308.5) Personnel expenses excluding LTIP & employment-related earn-out & option expenses (815.9) (940.4) (940.4) Other operating income (loss) excl. restructuring costs & other non-recurring items (8.3) (15.8) (15.8) Depreciation and amortization expenses related to D&A fiction (0.1) (1.7) (1.7) Adjusted EBITDA 379.8 446.4 446.4 Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.1% 16.5% 16.5% Restructuring costs and other non-recurring items (37.4) (99.5) (105.7) 6.2 LTIP & employment-related earn-out and option expenses (127.3) (104.7) (33.0) (71.7) Depreciation and amortization (excl.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results.

The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and Sanofi announce treatment success rates of up to 95% from a Phase II/III study investigating the safety and efficacy of single-dose acoziborole  a potentially transformative investigational treatment for sleeping sickness  published today in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal. The clinical trial was led by DNDi and its partners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea.Dr Victor KandeFormer Neglected Tropical Diseases Expert Advisor at the Ministry of Health of the DRC  principal investigator of the trial  and lead author of the Lancet article“Sleeping sickness is a nightmare disease that affects patients in some of the most remote settings in West and Central Africa  where distance from hospital can be measured in days. We are now on the cusp of a potential treatment that can be given in one day  in a single dose of three pills – this would be a revolution for doctors and communities.”Transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly  sleeping sickness is fatal without treatment. In the early stage of the disease  people suffer from headaches or fever. In the late stage  the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier and invades the central nervous system  causing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as sleep disruption  confusion  lethargy  and convulsions – and ultimately  death.Never been so close to elimination in decadesTreatment for sleeping sickness has radically improved in the last decade  thanks to the successes of a partnership bringing together DNDi  Sanofi  the national sleeping sickness control programmes of the DRC and Guinea  the World Health Organization (WHO)  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)  and other partners.The number of reported cases of sleeping sickness has fallen sharply in the last 20 years  from almost 40 000 reported cases in 1998 (with estimates of over 300 000 undiagnosed cases) to less than 1 000 in 2020. Though an encouraging trend  it should not be a reason for complacency  as the disease is known to resurge in the form of devastating outbreaks.Dr Antoine TarralHead of the sleeping sickness programme at DNDi and co-author of the paper“By simplifying the treatment paradigm  acoziborole would be an innovation that enables a sustainable response to sleeping sickness for health systems. With these new data  we have hope that we may be able to finally eliminate the disease  once and for all  by opening the door to a ‘screen-and-treat' approach at the village level.”Dr Wilfried Mutombo KalonjiDNDi Clinical Project Leader and Medical Manager  and co-author of the paper“Acoziborole has the potential to have a major impact on sleeping sickness treatment. This is a complicated disease  with patients living in very remote and unstable areas. We need simple approaches. We now have the promise of single-dose  oral treatment that doesn’t need to be taken with food  removes the need for hospitalization  removes the need for complex or invasive diagnosis or disease staging  and requires minimal training. In many ways  it doesn’t get any simpler than this.”The WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap strategy sets a goal of interrupting transmission of the gambiense strain of human African trypanosomiasis (g-HAT)  the scientific name of the disease  by 2030. (The gambiense strain accounts for 93% of all sleeping sickness cases). In alignment with this strategy  acoziborole could open the possibility of a simple ‘screen-and-treat’ approach  whereby any person whose rapid pinprick blood test suggests they might be infected could be treated with acoziborole  without the need for more complex parasitological confirmation or hospitalization.About the Phase II/III studyBetween 2016 and 2019  DNDi and its partners led an open-label  Phase II/III study to assess the safety and efficacy of acoziborole in patients with early- and late-stage g-HAT. 208 patients were recruited at 10 hospitals in the DRC and Guinea.The 18-month treatment success rate for acoziborole was 95% in late-stage g-HAT patients  corresponding to the best results from studies with existing treatments (94%). In addition  100% of the 41 patients with early-stage g-HAT were considered as treatment successes at all timepoints. The study shows that acoziborole has a favourable safety profile  with no significant drug-related safety signals reported.These pivotal results will form the basis of Sanofi’s dossier submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and represent another milestone in the quest to eliminate sleeping sickness. Upon the EMA’s positive opinion and local approval  Sanofi will donate acoziborole to the WHO through its philanthropic organization  Foundation S – The Sanofi Collective. Acoziborole is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDHead of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“Sanofi is a long-standing partner in the fight against sleeping sickness alongside DNDi and the World Health Organization. We are leveraging Sanofi’s unique expertise in developing  registering and producing new  innovative medicines to address areas of significant unmet need and in this case  support the World Health Organization’s goal to eliminate sleeping sickness in humans by 2030.”Dr Mariame Camaraprincipal investigator of the study at the HAT Treatment Centre in Dubreka  Guinea and co-author of the Lancet article“Many sleeping sickness patients live in remote villages in the mangrove swamps along the coast of Guinea – even though we have good treatment options now  we still need to send people who test positive with a sleeping sickness rapid test from their village to a confirmatory health centre. Acoziborole could potentially become the first treatment that would allow doctors to treat people on the spot  once they receive a positive rapid test in their village.”About the DNDi programme for the development of acoziboroleThe DNDi programme for the development of acoziborole was supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; UK aid; the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through KfW  Germany; the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Médecins Sans Frontières; the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS); the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  as part of Norway’s in-kind contribution to EDCTP2; Stavros Niarchos Foundation; the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID); and the BBVA Foundation (through the ‘Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Development Cooperation’).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

DNDi is also coordinating the ANTICOV clinical trial to find treatments for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases in low-resource settings. Since its inception in 2003  DNDi has delivered twelve new treatments to date  including new drug combinations for kala-azar  two fixed-dose antimalarials  and DNDi’s first successfully developed new chemical entity  fexinidazole  approved in 2018 for the treatment of both stages of sleeping sickness. dndi.orgMedia Relations SanofiSandrine Guendoul | + 33 6 25 09 14 25 | sandrine.guendoul@sanofi.comEvan Berland | +1 215 432 0234 | evan.berland@sanofi.comVictor Rouault | + 33 6 70 93 71 40 | victor.rouault@sanofi.comInvestor Relations SanofiEva Schaefer-Jansen | + 33 7 86 80 56 39 | eva.schaefer-jansen@sanofi.comCorentine Driancourt | + 33 6 40 56 92 21 | corentine.driancourt@sanofi.comMedia Relations DNDiFrédéric Ojardias (DNDi Geneva) | +41 79 431 62 16 | fojardias@dndi.orgIlan Moss (DNDi New York) | +1 646 266 5216 | imoss@dndi.orgFrancine Ngalula (DNDi Kinshasa) | + 243 816 402 389 | francinengal@gmail.comNotes for the editorsAcoziborole is the first oral single-dose new chemical entity to be issued from DNDi’s lead optimization programme for sleeping sickness. It started with an initial hit identified in the chemical library of Anacor Pharmaceuticals  which was acquired by Pfizer in 2016. The initial structure was then optimized with Scynexis and Pace University and was then selected as a candidate for development and Phase I safety studies conducted successfully in France.Acoziborole is the latest innovation brought by two decades of innovation efforts by DNDi  Sanofi  and partners. In 2009  they developed a combination of existing drugs known as NECT  which was extremely effective and much safer than the toxic arsenic derivative that doctors had to use at the time. A donation programme was set up by Sanofi and Bayer to the World Health Organization (WHO)  radically improving treatment options for patients.But NECT requires complex logistics  with each treatment weighing 8 kg  and must be administered in hospital settings with skilled staff. In 2018  DNDi  Sanofi  and partners developed fexinidazole  which became the first all-oral treatment available for sleeping sickness. This 10-day treatment is now available in all sleeping sickness-endemic countries.Acoziborole can be administered as a single oral dose  meaning treatment could be done in villages: healthcare workers from mobile teams will be able to immediately administer a single pill of acoziborole as soon as the patient is diagnosed  without the need of hospitalization or supervision of the treatment at home. This means it could become a major tool to facilitate the efforts to finally eliminate sleeping sickness.Sanofi Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  as amended.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The goal of this cooperation is the adoption by ST of Soitec’s SmartSiC™ technology for its future 200mm substrate manufacturing  feeding its devices and modules manufacturing business  with volume production expected in the midterm.“The transition to 200mm SiC wafers will bring substantial advantages to our automotive and industrial customers as they accelerate the transition toward electrification of their systems and products. It is important in driving economies of scale as product volumes ramp ” said Marco Monti  President Automotive and Discrete Group  STMicroelectronics. “We have chosen a vertically integrated model to maximize our know-how across the full manufacturing chain  from high-quality substrates to large-scale front- and back-end production. The goal of the technology cooperation with Soitec is to continue to improve our manufacturing yields and quality.”“The automotive industry is facing major disruption with the advent of electric vehicles. Our cutting-edge SmartSiC™ technology  which adapts our unique SmartCut™ process to silicon carbide semiconductors  will play a key role in accelerating their adoption ” said Bernard Aspar  Chief Operating Officer of Soitec. “The combination of Soitec’s SmartSiC™ substrates with STMicroelectronics’ industry-leading silicon carbide technology and expertise is a game-changer for automotive chip manufacturing that will set new standards.”Story continuesSilicon Carbide (SiC) is a disruptive compound semiconductor material with intrinsic properties providing superior performance and efficiency over silicon in key  high-growth power applications for electric mobility and industrial processes  among others. It allows for more efficient power conversion  lighter and more compact designs  and overall system-design cost savings – all key parameters and factors for success in automotive and industrial systems. Transitioning from 150mm to 200mm wafers will enable a substantial capacity increase  with almost twice the useful area for manufacturing integrated circuits  delivering 1.8 – 1.9 times as many working chips per wafer.SmartSiC™ is a proprietary Soitec technology which uses Soitec proprietary SmartCut™ technology  to split a thin layer of a high quality SiC ‘donor’ wafer  and bond it on top of a low resistivity ‘handle’ polySiC wafer. The engineered substrate then improves device performance and manufacturing yields. The prime quality SiC ‘donor’ wafer can be reused multiple times  significantly reducing the overall energy consumption required to produce it.About STMicroelectronicsAt ST  we are 48 000 creators and makers of semiconductor technologies mastering the semiconductor supply chain with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.

This statistic pr…,PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today  most banking services are not adapted for people with disabilities. 90% of visually impaired people have once in their life faced fraud or encountered a mistake at a point of sales. This statistic prompted Thales to develop a solution which offers trust and autonomy to people with impaired vision in their daily payment experiences. This unique innovation that vocalises each step of a transaction  is now certified by Visa and Mastercard.There is a global commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion to build a better environment for all. In collaboration with its partner Handsome1  Thales decided to use its innovation to offer inclusive solutions in the payment area. To benefit from it  the Voice Payment Card users just have to install an app on their mobile phone  which is uniquely associated with their card. Each time they make a payment  the mobile app vocalises the amount of the transaction before letting users validate it with their secret code.The Thales Voice Payment Card works as a connected device that gets the amount from the point of sales terminal and communicates it to the mobile app via Bluetooth. The customer can then hear the information either through the phone’s speaker or through earphones. This one-of-a-kind solution is about to be commercialized soon by several banks  convinced of its interest.“At Thales we know innovation has the potential to solve a multitude of issues. That’s why  with the support of Handsome1 and based on Thales’ key expertise in developing secure and convenient payment solutions  we decided to tackle concerns faced by blind and visually impaired people. Since then  it appeared that the solution has proven to be useful for other disabilities. All in all we are thrilled to see our innovations contribute to building more sustainable and responsible payment solutions.” said Bertrand Knopf  Vice President Banking and Payment Services at Thales.1 Handsome is a French Fintech  specialised in inclusive solutions for people with disabilities.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and “deep tech” innovations – connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies – to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today reported antibody persistence data six months after the completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) …,"English FrenchAntibody levels remained above baseline six months after completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) vaccination scheduleHigher antibody levels were observed in the three-dose vaccination schedule versus the two-dose vaccination schedule  further validating the use of this schedule in the ongoing Phase 3 studyThere were no safety concerns observed in this six-month observational follow upNew York & Saint-Herblain (France)  December 1  2022 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today reported antibody persistence data six months after the completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) vaccination schedule with their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15 in both children and adults. This is the first time antibody persistence data are reported in pediatric populations for this vaccine candidate.Following positive immunogenicity and safety data for Phase 2 study VLA15-221 in April 20221  Valneva and Pfizer evaluated the persistence of antibodies six months after the Month 0-2-6 and the Month 0-6 vaccination schedule with VLA15 in healthy adults and pediatric participants (5 to 65 years of age). Data were collected in 96 healthy adults and 81 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule and in 84 healthy adults and 78 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-6 schedule.As observed in previous clinical studies with VLA15  antibody levels declined over time in all study groups but remained above baseline  confirming their persistence six months after completion of both vaccination schedules. Overall  antibody levels remained higher with the three-dose vaccination schedule compared to the two-dose schedule. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFRs) compared to baseline were 1.9-fold for Serotype 1 (ST1) to 3.2-fold Serotype 2 (ST2) across all age groups in the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule. The highest GMFRs were reported in the 5 to 11 years old age group  with GMFR levels at 2.8-fold (ST1) to 6.6-fold (ST2).These results further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants.No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are pleased with these antibody persistence data that further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule in our ongoing Phase 3 study and the acceptable safety and tolerability profiles of our vaccine candidate. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing a high unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many in the Northern Hemisphere  and each new report of positive data takes us a step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children who could benefit from it.”Earlier this year  Pfizer and Valneva initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA152. Approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio). Enrollment is ongoing in Europe and the United States and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023. To learn more  visit www.pfizerclinicaltrials.com/nct05477524. To achieve the required pediatric safety database  Pfizer and Valneva are planning to initiate a complementary Phase 3 clinical study in early December 2022 to collect additional VLA15 safety data in participants 5 to 17 years of age.“Rates of Lyme disease continue to increase globally  underscoring the importance of a vaccine that may help protect both adults and children ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “These six-month antibody persistence data are encouraging  and we hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 studies will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date.”Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Despite challenging market conditions  including an inflationary environment  Vantiva has increased its adjusted EBITDA by €14 million. The margin dilution in the quarter came mostly from a higher share of Connected Home division in the group’s adjusted EBITDA.Adjusted EBITA more than doubled to €21 million (versus €9 million in Q3 2021) thanks to improved growth and performance.Free cash flow before financial and tax was positive at €10 million and showed a total €21 million improvement in the quarter. This is largely due to a higher adjusted EBITDA and lower restructuring  pensions and other costs.At the end of Q3  Vantiva held a cash position of €83 million  and did not have any drawings on its available $125m credit line. Total net debt amounted to €369 million in nominal terms.The group confirms its full year 2022 guidance  and management remains confident to meet 2023 forecasts.Luis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:“Our Q3 results confirm the soundness of our strategy and the positive outcome of the transformation plan executed over recent years. We are leading the industry in many areas  but most importantly  our speed  proximity to our customers and partners  and operational agility in front of supply challenges  are allowing us to keep serving our customers with the best products and leading technologies.Connected Home division showed strong business in the quarter  reaching €1.6bn in revenues for the first 9 months. This is a strong quarter from a business point of view  with several highly relevant new product launches with key customers such as Vodafone  DTAG and others  and our technological leadership demonstrated by the very first fiber Wifi7 product in the market. All this demonstrates that we are staying on the right track to keep developing our market leadership.We will continue to apply a strict execution discipline while looking to new business opportunities  and I am confident that our team is fully equipped for taking up the challenges ahead of us. Based on the current results achieved under challenging market conditions  I am confident in our future plans.”V antiva performance in Q3The group’s growth has been fueled by higher volumes  adjusted prices to recover cost evolution  and improved product mix at Connected Home division. Supply Chain Solutions’ performance has been impacted by lower demand in its DVD activity  but with a strong Q3 2021 base of comparison.Adjusted EBITDA improvement stems from volume effects  better pass through of additional costs versus last year  and the strict cost control in place.Vantiva Q3 revenues totaled €765 million  up 45% (+27.1% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €584 million in the quarter  an increase of 77% (+54.3% at constant exchange rate).Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €181m  down 8.6% (-18.2% at constant exchange rate).The group’s adjusted EBITDA reached €50 million in the quarter  a €14 million improvement over last year. The margin dilution  from 6.8% to 6.5%  came from the higher contribution of Connected Home division in the group’s adjusted EBITDA.Connected Home contributed €33 million (versus €16 million last year) to adjusted EBITDA and Supply Chain €25 million (versus €29 million last year).FCF before financial and tax in the quarter was €10 million  showing a €21 millionIncrease.Q3 and 9M resultsQ3 9M In € million  continuing operations 2022 2021 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate 20222021 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate Revenues 765 528 45.0% 27.1% 1 958 1 585 23.5% 11.0% o/w CH 584 330 77.0% 54.3% 1 481 1 100 34.6% 20.3% o/w SCS 181 198 -8.6% -18.2% 476 481 -0.9% -9.4% Adjusted EBITDA 50 36 39.9% 25.5% 123 86 42.1% 27.8% As a % of revenues 6.5% 6.8% 6.3% 5.4% o/w CH 33 16 nm 83.2% 103 72 42.7% 29.9% As a % of revenues 5.7% 4.9% 6.9% 6.5% o/w SCS 25 29 -14.0% -21.5% 40 39 2.7% -6.5% As a % of revenues 13.7% 14.6% 8.4% 8.1% Adjusted EBITA 21 9 nm na 43 11 nm na Free Cash Flow before financial & tax 10 -11 -26 -261includes IFRS 16 see appendixConnected HomeConnected Home represented 76% of Vantiva revenues in Q3 (versus 63% in Q3 21)  out of which 71% was Broadband and 29% was Video (respectively 58% and 42% in Q3 21).

The division has shown the very first Wi-Fi7 product in the industry at the Amsterdam Broadband World Forum  preparing the next evolution of gateways for the next three years.Demand in North America and LATAM remains strong  while we see some slowdown in Asia and Europe.Revenue growth has been supported by better supply and pricing support from our customers to mitigate the impact of increased costs.Components availability has improved  and logistic bottlenecks have eased  but some key components are still scarce  and this has continued to limit the group’s ability to fully satisfy the demand.The division continues to invest in promising projects  and it operates with a very efficient cost base.Adjusted EBITDA reached €33 million in the quarter versus €16 million last year  showing a margin improvement of 72 basis points at 5.7%. This increase reflects the group’s efficiency plans  higher volume  improved mix of products and pass through actions to mitigate the additional cost impact.It is worth noticing that the division has increased its margin (in %) despite the mechanical negative impact of the pass through actions which inflated revenues without contributing to the margin.Supply Chain S olutionsSCS represented 24% of Vantiva revenues in Q3 (versus 37% in Q3 21).Demand for DVDs was down in the quarter  considering that Q3 21 was abnormally strong in the context of Covid and due to an unexpected manufacturing orders reduction from one of our clients.The division continues to adapt its manufacturing and distribution footprint to the changing environment.Vinyl demand has been strong and is still growing.Vantiva already has active contracts with 2 of the 3 global musical groups and may start business in 2023 with a 3rd.One challenge is to put in place the manufacturing capacity which should progressively improve as of 2023.The Fulfillment business division continues to add new contracts contributing to our diversification objective.In this context of lower volume  the adjusted EBITDA margin has shown resilience at 13.7%  down only 87 basis points.The contribution to adjusted EBITDA has decreased from €29 million to €25 million for Q3 2022.Group FCF before f inancial and taxGroup FCF  before financial and tax  was positive at €10 million in the quarter  showing a €21 million improvement coming notably from adjusted EBITDA and lower pension costs and others.Capex was up €2 million while restructuring costs were down €8 million  working capital deteriorated by €6 million and pensions costs & others were down €11 million.Cash positionAt the end of September  the company held a cash position of €83 million before taking into account the undrawn $125m credit line .OutlookBusiness in Q4 should remain on the same trend as for the first 9 months  with good demand for Connected Home products  especially for Broadband  and declining demand for DVDs and lack of production capacity for vinyl.Against this background  the group confirms its guidance for full year 2022  and also for 2023.€ (€ vs $:1.15) 2022e 2023e Adjusted EBITDA >140m >140m Adjusted EBITA 38-48m 29-39m FCF before financial and tax 62-72m 43-63mIndicative TimetableVantiva FY 2022 results March 9th  2023AppendixDebt details€ millionLine Characteristics Nominal IFRS amount Nominal Rate IFRS Rate Barclays Cash: Euribor 3M + 2.50% & PIK 250 243 6.5% 10.9% Angelo Gordon Cash: Euribor 3M + 4.00% & PIK 125 118 10.0% 15.7% Wells Fargo 8.75% 0 0 8.8% 8.8% Operating Lease 76 76 10.4% 10.4% Capital Lease 1 1 2.8% 2.8% Other 1 1 0.0% 0.0% Total Debt 452 437 8.1% 12.1% Cash & Cash Equivalents 83 83 Net Debt 369 355IFRS 16 impactActual Q3 22 (incl IFRS 16) Actual Q3 22(excl.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today reported antibody persistence data six months after the completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) vaccination schedule with their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15 in both children and adults. This is the first time antibody persistence data are reported in pediatric populations for this vaccine candidate.Following positive immunogenicity and safety data for Phase 2 study VLA15-221 in April 20221  Valneva and Pfizer evaluated the persistence of antibodies six months after the Month 0-2-6 and the Month 0-6 vaccination schedule with VLA15 in healthy adults and pediatric participants (5 to 65 years of age). Data were collected in 96 healthy adults and 81 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule and in 84 healthy adults and 78 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-6 schedule.As observed in previous clinical studies with VLA15  antibody levels declined over time in all study groups but remained above baseline  confirming their persistence six months after completion of both vaccination schedules. Overall  antibody levels remained higher with the three-dose vaccination schedule compared to the two-dose schedule. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFRs) compared to baseline were 1.9-fold for Serotype 1 (ST1) to 3.2-fold Serotype 2 (ST2) across all age groups in the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule. The highest GMFRs were reported in the 5 to 11 years old age group  with GMFR levels at 2.8-fold (ST1) to 6.6-fold (ST2).Story continuesThese results further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants.No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are pleased with these antibody persistence data that further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule in our ongoing Phase 3 study and the acceptable safety and tolerability profiles of our vaccine candidate. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing a high unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many in the Northern Hemisphere  and each new report of positive data takes us a step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children who could benefit from it.”Earlier this year  Pfizer and Valneva initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA152. Approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio). Enrollment is ongoing in Europe and the United States and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023. To learn more  visit www.pfizerclinicaltrials.com/nct05477524. To achieve the required pediatric safety database  Pfizer and Valneva are planning to initiate a complementary Phase 3 clinical study in early December 2022 to collect additional VLA15 safety data in participants 5 to 17 years of age.“Rates of Lyme disease continue to increase globally  underscoring the importance of a vaccine that may help protect both adults and children ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “These six-month antibody persistence data are encouraging  and we hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 studies will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date.”Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Van Lanschot Kempen believe s this increase i s necessary in developed countries to achieve the Paris climate goals.The analysis shows that the impact of higher carbon prices and the scope of emissions coverage is not fully priced into markets – creating opportunities for investors who are allocating to the transition economy.Applying an appropriate sustainable benchmark for a global equity portfolio could lower the carbon-transition price risk by 70-80% for global equities and by 90% for European equities.The sensitivity of equity markets to carbon pricing risk has increased over the past 12 months due to rising energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Van Lanschot Kempen has updated its model on the impact of a shock increase in carbon prices globally - implemented through a carbon tax or through emissions trading scheme (ETS). The analysis focuses on how responses to climate change can be integrated into investment analysis in order to protect and enhance the portfolios of long-term investors.Van Lanschot Kempen’s analysis models a worst-case scenario but expects the impact to be spread over a number of years.Maarten Edixhoven  Chair of the Management Board of Van Lanschot Kempen  said. “The current energy crisis has raised concerns that meeting global climate goals has become less urgent. However  nature is telling us that it is still a high priority by the number of huge environmental impacts we are seeing. We think the focus on reducing carbon emissions will – and should - only get stronger in the medium term.“As an entrepreneurial wealth manager with a strong focus on sustainability we aim to act as a guide to our clients in the current climate and energy transition. Reducing the carbon-transition risk in clients’ portfolios is essential in this respect. Also  we are seeking out opportunities to invest in the transition to a sustainable economy  in both investment and non-investment related services to our clients. We’ve reallocated to lower carbon or climate transition tilted assets and we’re investing in green technologies in both private and public markets.”Current carbon price must rise to meet Paris objectives and geopolitical energy security risksThe war in Ukraine and Europe’s urgent need to reduce reliance on Russian gas imports have accelerated the need to provide affordable financing for green energy solutions. At COP27  the IMF called for a $75/ton carbon price2  but several institutions  such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)  now estimate that a carbon price of more than $100 would be required to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement3. According to the World Bank  just 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions are covered by a carbon pricing mechanism4. The IMF estimates that the global average carbon emission price is currently no more than $5 (per tCO2e)5.Also  the need for energy independence - which mirrors the broader trend of deglobalisation - increases the likelihood of carbon emission prices increasing rapidly in the coming years and being applied to a greater number of high emitting companies.See attachment for entire message.Media Relations: +31 20 354 45 85; mediarelations@vanlanschotkempen.comInvestor Relations: +31 20 354 45 90; investorrelations@vanlanschotkempen.comAbout Van Lanschot KempenVan Lanschot Kempen  a wealth manager active in Private Banking  Professional Solutions  Investment Management and Investment Banking  with the aim of preserving and creating wealth  in a sustainable way  for both its clients and the society of which it is part.
