Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The goal of this cooperation is the adoption by ST of Soitec’s SmartSiC™ technology for its future 200mm substrate manufacturing  feeding its devices and modules manufacturing business  with volume production expected in the midterm.“The transition to 200mm SiC wafers will bring substantial advantages to our automotive and industrial customers as they accelerate the transition toward electrification of their systems and products. It is important in driving economies of scale as product volumes ramp ” said Marco Monti  President Automotive and Discrete Group  STMicroelectronics. “We have chosen a vertically integrated model to maximize our know-how across the full manufacturing chain  from high-quality substrates to large-scale front- and back-end production. The goal of the technology cooperation with Soitec is to continue to improve our manufacturing yields and quality.”“The automotive industry is facing major disruption with the advent of electric vehicles. Our cutting-edge SmartSiC™ technology  which adapts our unique SmartCut™ process to silicon carbide semiconductors  will play a key role in accelerating their adoption ” said Bernard Aspar  Chief Operating Officer of Soitec. “The combination of Soitec’s SmartSiC™ substrates with STMicroelectronics’ industry-leading silicon carbide technology and expertise is a game-changer for automotive chip manufacturing that will set new standards.”Story continuesSilicon Carbide (SiC) is a disruptive compound semiconductor material with intrinsic properties providing superior performance and efficiency over silicon in key  high-growth power applications for electric mobility and industrial processes  among others. It allows for more efficient power conversion  lighter and more compact designs  and overall system-design cost savings – all key parameters and factors for success in automotive and industrial systems. Transitioning from 150mm to 200mm wafers will enable a substantial capacity increase  with almost twice the useful area for manufacturing integrated circuits  delivering 1.8 – 1.9 times as many working chips per wafer.SmartSiC™ is a proprietary Soitec technology which uses Soitec proprietary SmartCut™ technology  to split a thin layer of a high quality SiC ‘donor’ wafer  and bond it on top of a low resistivity ‘handle’ polySiC wafer. The engineered substrate then improves device performance and manufacturing yields. The prime quality SiC ‘donor’ wafer can be reused multiple times  significantly reducing the overall energy consumption required to produce it.About STMicroelectronicsAt ST  we are 48 000 creators and makers of semiconductor technologies mastering the semiconductor supply chain with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.

This statistic pr…,PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today  most banking services are not adapted for people with disabilities. 90% of visually impaired people have once in their life faced fraud or encountered a mistake at a point of sales. This statistic prompted Thales to develop a solution which offers trust and autonomy to people with impaired vision in their daily payment experiences. This unique innovation that vocalises each step of a transaction  is now certified by Visa and Mastercard.There is a global commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion to build a better environment for all. In collaboration with its partner Handsome1  Thales decided to use its innovation to offer inclusive solutions in the payment area. To benefit from it  the Voice Payment Card users just have to install an app on their mobile phone  which is uniquely associated with their card. Each time they make a payment  the mobile app vocalises the amount of the transaction before letting users validate it with their secret code.The Thales Voice Payment Card works as a connected device that gets the amount from the point of sales terminal and communicates it to the mobile app via Bluetooth. The customer can then hear the information either through the phone’s speaker or through earphones. This one-of-a-kind solution is about to be commercialized soon by several banks  convinced of its interest.“At Thales we know innovation has the potential to solve a multitude of issues. That’s why  with the support of Handsome1 and based on Thales’ key expertise in developing secure and convenient payment solutions  we decided to tackle concerns faced by blind and visually impaired people. Since then  it appeared that the solution has proven to be useful for other disabilities. All in all we are thrilled to see our innovations contribute to building more sustainable and responsible payment solutions.” said Bertrand Knopf  Vice President Banking and Payment Services at Thales.1 Handsome is a French Fintech  specialised in inclusive solutions for people with disabilities.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and “deep tech” innovations – connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies – to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today reported antibody persistence data six months after the completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) …,"English FrenchAntibody levels remained above baseline six months after completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) vaccination scheduleHigher antibody levels were observed in the three-dose vaccination schedule versus the two-dose vaccination schedule  further validating the use of this schedule in the ongoing Phase 3 studyThere were no safety concerns observed in this six-month observational follow upNew York & Saint-Herblain (France)  December 1  2022 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today reported antibody persistence data six months after the completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) vaccination schedule with their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15 in both children and adults. This is the first time antibody persistence data are reported in pediatric populations for this vaccine candidate.Following positive immunogenicity and safety data for Phase 2 study VLA15-221 in April 20221  Valneva and Pfizer evaluated the persistence of antibodies six months after the Month 0-2-6 and the Month 0-6 vaccination schedule with VLA15 in healthy adults and pediatric participants (5 to 65 years of age). Data were collected in 96 healthy adults and 81 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule and in 84 healthy adults and 78 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-6 schedule.As observed in previous clinical studies with VLA15  antibody levels declined over time in all study groups but remained above baseline  confirming their persistence six months after completion of both vaccination schedules. Overall  antibody levels remained higher with the three-dose vaccination schedule compared to the two-dose schedule. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFRs) compared to baseline were 1.9-fold for Serotype 1 (ST1) to 3.2-fold Serotype 2 (ST2) across all age groups in the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule. The highest GMFRs were reported in the 5 to 11 years old age group  with GMFR levels at 2.8-fold (ST1) to 6.6-fold (ST2).These results further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants.No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are pleased with these antibody persistence data that further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule in our ongoing Phase 3 study and the acceptable safety and tolerability profiles of our vaccine candidate. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing a high unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many in the Northern Hemisphere  and each new report of positive data takes us a step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children who could benefit from it.”Earlier this year  Pfizer and Valneva initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA152. Approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio). Enrollment is ongoing in Europe and the United States and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023. To learn more  visit www.pfizerclinicaltrials.com/nct05477524. To achieve the required pediatric safety database  Pfizer and Valneva are planning to initiate a complementary Phase 3 clinical study in early December 2022 to collect additional VLA15 safety data in participants 5 to 17 years of age.“Rates of Lyme disease continue to increase globally  underscoring the importance of a vaccine that may help protect both adults and children ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “These six-month antibody persistence data are encouraging  and we hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 studies will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date.”Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Despite challenging market conditions  including an inflationary environment  Vantiva has increased its adjusted EBITDA by €14 million. The margin dilution in the quarter came mostly from a higher share of Connected Home division in the group’s adjusted EBITDA.Adjusted EBITA more than doubled to €21 million (versus €9 million in Q3 2021) thanks to improved growth and performance.Free cash flow before financial and tax was positive at €10 million and showed a total €21 million improvement in the quarter. This is largely due to a higher adjusted EBITDA and lower restructuring  pensions and other costs.At the end of Q3  Vantiva held a cash position of €83 million  and did not have any drawings on its available $125m credit line. Total net debt amounted to €369 million in nominal terms.The group confirms its full year 2022 guidance  and management remains confident to meet 2023 forecasts.Luis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:“Our Q3 results confirm the soundness of our strategy and the positive outcome of the transformation plan executed over recent years. We are leading the industry in many areas  but most importantly  our speed  proximity to our customers and partners  and operational agility in front of supply challenges  are allowing us to keep serving our customers with the best products and leading technologies.Connected Home division showed strong business in the quarter  reaching €1.6bn in revenues for the first 9 months. This is a strong quarter from a business point of view  with several highly relevant new product launches with key customers such as Vodafone  DTAG and others  and our technological leadership demonstrated by the very first fiber Wifi7 product in the market. All this demonstrates that we are staying on the right track to keep developing our market leadership.We will continue to apply a strict execution discipline while looking to new business opportunities  and I am confident that our team is fully equipped for taking up the challenges ahead of us. Based on the current results achieved under challenging market conditions  I am confident in our future plans.”V antiva performance in Q3The group’s growth has been fueled by higher volumes  adjusted prices to recover cost evolution  and improved product mix at Connected Home division. Supply Chain Solutions’ performance has been impacted by lower demand in its DVD activity  but with a strong Q3 2021 base of comparison.Adjusted EBITDA improvement stems from volume effects  better pass through of additional costs versus last year  and the strict cost control in place.Vantiva Q3 revenues totaled €765 million  up 45% (+27.1% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €584 million in the quarter  an increase of 77% (+54.3% at constant exchange rate).Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €181m  down 8.6% (-18.2% at constant exchange rate).The group’s adjusted EBITDA reached €50 million in the quarter  a €14 million improvement over last year. The margin dilution  from 6.8% to 6.5%  came from the higher contribution of Connected Home division in the group’s adjusted EBITDA.Connected Home contributed €33 million (versus €16 million last year) to adjusted EBITDA and Supply Chain €25 million (versus €29 million last year).FCF before financial and tax in the quarter was €10 million  showing a €21 millionIncrease.Q3 and 9M resultsQ3 9M In € million  continuing operations 2022 2021 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate 20222021 Actual Change Change at Constant Rate Revenues 765 528 45.0% 27.1% 1 958 1 585 23.5% 11.0% o/w CH 584 330 77.0% 54.3% 1 481 1 100 34.6% 20.3% o/w SCS 181 198 -8.6% -18.2% 476 481 -0.9% -9.4% Adjusted EBITDA 50 36 39.9% 25.5% 123 86 42.1% 27.8% As a % of revenues 6.5% 6.8% 6.3% 5.4% o/w CH 33 16 nm 83.2% 103 72 42.7% 29.9% As a % of revenues 5.7% 4.9% 6.9% 6.5% o/w SCS 25 29 -14.0% -21.5% 40 39 2.7% -6.5% As a % of revenues 13.7% 14.6% 8.4% 8.1% Adjusted EBITA 21 9 nm na 43 11 nm na Free Cash Flow before financial & tax 10 -11 -26 -261includes IFRS 16 see appendixConnected HomeConnected Home represented 76% of Vantiva revenues in Q3 (versus 63% in Q3 21)  out of which 71% was Broadband and 29% was Video (respectively 58% and 42% in Q3 21).

The division has shown the very first Wi-Fi7 product in the industry at the Amsterdam Broadband World Forum  preparing the next evolution of gateways for the next three years.Demand in North America and LATAM remains strong  while we see some slowdown in Asia and Europe.Revenue growth has been supported by better supply and pricing support from our customers to mitigate the impact of increased costs.Components availability has improved  and logistic bottlenecks have eased  but some key components are still scarce  and this has continued to limit the group’s ability to fully satisfy the demand.The division continues to invest in promising projects  and it operates with a very efficient cost base.Adjusted EBITDA reached €33 million in the quarter versus €16 million last year  showing a margin improvement of 72 basis points at 5.7%. This increase reflects the group’s efficiency plans  higher volume  improved mix of products and pass through actions to mitigate the additional cost impact.It is worth noticing that the division has increased its margin (in %) despite the mechanical negative impact of the pass through actions which inflated revenues without contributing to the margin.Supply Chain S olutionsSCS represented 24% of Vantiva revenues in Q3 (versus 37% in Q3 21).Demand for DVDs was down in the quarter  considering that Q3 21 was abnormally strong in the context of Covid and due to an unexpected manufacturing orders reduction from one of our clients.The division continues to adapt its manufacturing and distribution footprint to the changing environment.Vinyl demand has been strong and is still growing.Vantiva already has active contracts with 2 of the 3 global musical groups and may start business in 2023 with a 3rd.One challenge is to put in place the manufacturing capacity which should progressively improve as of 2023.The Fulfillment business division continues to add new contracts contributing to our diversification objective.In this context of lower volume  the adjusted EBITDA margin has shown resilience at 13.7%  down only 87 basis points.The contribution to adjusted EBITDA has decreased from €29 million to €25 million for Q3 2022.Group FCF before f inancial and taxGroup FCF  before financial and tax  was positive at €10 million in the quarter  showing a €21 million improvement coming notably from adjusted EBITDA and lower pension costs and others.Capex was up €2 million while restructuring costs were down €8 million  working capital deteriorated by €6 million and pensions costs & others were down €11 million.Cash positionAt the end of September  the company held a cash position of €83 million before taking into account the undrawn $125m credit line .OutlookBusiness in Q4 should remain on the same trend as for the first 9 months  with good demand for Connected Home products  especially for Broadband  and declining demand for DVDs and lack of production capacity for vinyl.Against this background  the group confirms its guidance for full year 2022  and also for 2023.€ (€ vs $:1.15) 2022e 2023e Adjusted EBITDA >140m >140m Adjusted EBITA 38-48m 29-39m FCF before financial and tax 62-72m 43-63mIndicative TimetableVantiva FY 2022 results March 9th  2023AppendixDebt details€ millionLine Characteristics Nominal IFRS amount Nominal Rate IFRS Rate Barclays Cash: Euribor 3M + 2.50% & PIK 250 243 6.5% 10.9% Angelo Gordon Cash: Euribor 3M + 4.00% & PIK 125 118 10.0% 15.7% Wells Fargo 8.75% 0 0 8.8% 8.8% Operating Lease 76 76 10.4% 10.4% Capital Lease 1 1 2.8% 2.8% Other 1 1 0.0% 0.0% Total Debt 452 437 8.1% 12.1% Cash & Cash Equivalents 83 83 Net Debt 369 355IFRS 16 impactActual Q3 22 (incl IFRS 16) Actual Q3 22(excl.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today reported antibody persistence data six months after the completion of a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) vaccination schedule with their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15 in both children and adults. This is the first time antibody persistence data are reported in pediatric populations for this vaccine candidate.Following positive immunogenicity and safety data for Phase 2 study VLA15-221 in April 20221  Valneva and Pfizer evaluated the persistence of antibodies six months after the Month 0-2-6 and the Month 0-6 vaccination schedule with VLA15 in healthy adults and pediatric participants (5 to 65 years of age). Data were collected in 96 healthy adults and 81 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule and in 84 healthy adults and 78 pediatric participants (5-17 years of age) for the Month 0-6 schedule.As observed in previous clinical studies with VLA15  antibody levels declined over time in all study groups but remained above baseline  confirming their persistence six months after completion of both vaccination schedules. Overall  antibody levels remained higher with the three-dose vaccination schedule compared to the two-dose schedule. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFRs) compared to baseline were 1.9-fold for Serotype 1 (ST1) to 3.2-fold Serotype 2 (ST2) across all age groups in the Month 0-2-6 vaccination schedule. The highest GMFRs were reported in the 5 to 11 years old age group  with GMFR levels at 2.8-fold (ST1) to 6.6-fold (ST2).Story continuesThese results further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants.No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are pleased with these antibody persistence data that further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule in our ongoing Phase 3 study and the acceptable safety and tolerability profiles of our vaccine candidate. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing a high unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many in the Northern Hemisphere  and each new report of positive data takes us a step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children who could benefit from it.”Earlier this year  Pfizer and Valneva initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA152. Approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio). Enrollment is ongoing in Europe and the United States and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023. To learn more  visit www.pfizerclinicaltrials.com/nct05477524. To achieve the required pediatric safety database  Pfizer and Valneva are planning to initiate a complementary Phase 3 clinical study in early December 2022 to collect additional VLA15 safety data in participants 5 to 17 years of age.“Rates of Lyme disease continue to increase globally  underscoring the importance of a vaccine that may help protect both adults and children ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “These six-month antibody persistence data are encouraging  and we hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 studies will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date.”Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Van Lanschot Kempen believe s this increase i s necessary in developed countries to achieve the Paris climate goals.The analysis shows that the impact of higher carbon prices and the scope of emissions coverage is not fully priced into markets – creating opportunities for investors who are allocating to the transition economy.Applying an appropriate sustainable benchmark for a global equity portfolio could lower the carbon-transition price risk by 70-80% for global equities and by 90% for European equities.The sensitivity of equity markets to carbon pricing risk has increased over the past 12 months due to rising energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Van Lanschot Kempen has updated its model on the impact of a shock increase in carbon prices globally - implemented through a carbon tax or through emissions trading scheme (ETS). The analysis focuses on how responses to climate change can be integrated into investment analysis in order to protect and enhance the portfolios of long-term investors.Van Lanschot Kempen’s analysis models a worst-case scenario but expects the impact to be spread over a number of years.Maarten Edixhoven  Chair of the Management Board of Van Lanschot Kempen  said. “The current energy crisis has raised concerns that meeting global climate goals has become less urgent. However  nature is telling us that it is still a high priority by the number of huge environmental impacts we are seeing. We think the focus on reducing carbon emissions will – and should - only get stronger in the medium term.“As an entrepreneurial wealth manager with a strong focus on sustainability we aim to act as a guide to our clients in the current climate and energy transition. Reducing the carbon-transition risk in clients’ portfolios is essential in this respect. Also  we are seeking out opportunities to invest in the transition to a sustainable economy  in both investment and non-investment related services to our clients. We’ve reallocated to lower carbon or climate transition tilted assets and we’re investing in green technologies in both private and public markets.”Current carbon price must rise to meet Paris objectives and geopolitical energy security risksThe war in Ukraine and Europe’s urgent need to reduce reliance on Russian gas imports have accelerated the need to provide affordable financing for green energy solutions. At COP27  the IMF called for a $75/ton carbon price2  but several institutions  such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)  now estimate that a carbon price of more than $100 would be required to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement3. According to the World Bank  just 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions are covered by a carbon pricing mechanism4. The IMF estimates that the global average carbon emission price is currently no more than $5 (per tCO2e)5.Also  the need for energy independence - which mirrors the broader trend of deglobalisation - increases the likelihood of carbon emission prices increasing rapidly in the coming years and being applied to a greater number of high emitting companies.See attachment for entire message.Media Relations: +31 20 354 45 85; mediarelations@vanlanschotkempen.comInvestor Relations: +31 20 354 45 90; investorrelations@vanlanschotkempen.comAbout Van Lanschot KempenVan Lanschot Kempen  a wealth manager active in Private Banking  Professional Solutions  Investment Management and Investment Banking  with the aim of preserving and creating wealth  in a sustainable way  for both its clients and the society of which it is part.

His appointment will commence with immediate effect. Both Michel and Anne worked and collaborated closely together alongside the medical and scientific teams throughout the processes of the merger between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic  from when the discussions between the two companies started in May 2022. Michel will serve as CMO whilst BioSenic selects a permanent CMO from the list of candidates it is currently compiling. The new CMO will be selected for his/her expertise and experience in both autoimmunity and cell therapy.“Now the merger is complete  BioSenic is fully focused on combining its clinical development pipelines from its cell therapy and autoimmune platforms. Michel’s experience working within the clinical development team throughout the merger makes him the ideal candidate to drive the cell therapy platform ALLOB to the end of its phase IIb trial and start the phase III trial for our autoimmune platform  the following successful conclusion of the previous phase II trial. His years of expertise both in phase II and III clinical trials will be critical in this period for BioSenic ” said Prof. François Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. “Michel’s experience means he will be best placed to prepare BioSenic to take full advantage of the results of the ALLOB phase IIb trial following completion  as well as conduct the most thorough preparation of the phase III trial for our autoimmune platform. These clinical developments will be key value creation milestones for BioSenic in the first half of 2023. This late-stage clinical progression will enable BioSenic to start the process of engaging with industrial partners to co-develop late-stage clinical projects and to look at other segments of interest in autoimmune diseases and cancer. I would like to thank Anne Leselbaum for her dedicated efforts during the merger until its completion.”Story continuesMichel has been selected as interim CMO primarily for his previous achievements for MedSenic. He has acquired considerable knowledge of clinical development  specifically in phase II and III. In Michel’s career  he has designed and managed over 50 international phase II and III clinical studies and has extensive experience in working within clinical guidelines for  and interacting with regulatory agencies including the FDA and EMA. Michel has also acquired experience in a number of therapeutic target areas including cardiovascular diseases  inflammation and auto-immunity. Michel has also gained wider expertise in innovative drug development  including launching start-ups  filing patents  and raising funds for both private and public companies. Michel wrote the French adaption of ‘The Investigator's Guide to Clinical Research’  a manual for investigators and health professionals involved in conducting clinical research  investigator financial disclosure  noncompliance issues  the FDA audit process and data collection technologies.As Michel has been instrumental in bringing together the clinical pipelines of Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic during the merger process  he has gained full working knowledge of the current clinical progress of the cell therapy platform ALLOB and has extensive working knowledge of the autoimmune platform using arsenic trioxide (ATO)  and specifically its clinical development in cGvHD (chronic Graft vs Host Disease).Michel will be immediately responsible for continued progression of both BioSenic assets:The ALLOB MSC platform using cells with immune privilege  anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to differentiate into bone tissues when injected into the specific bone sites to be regenerated or repaired. The phase IIb trial of ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in H1 2023. Michel will progress this trial to the intermediary analysis stage. This includes overall responsibility for liaising with the CRO nominated for the trial  and liaising with investigators in the thirty-five trial centers across seven EU countries.For the autoimmune ATO platform using ATO  Michel will also be focused on the start of the phase III trial in cGvHD  and will oversee the commencement of recruitment for the trial in a US center  to be selected shortly.“BioSenic  through its merger  has acquired two platforms in cell therapy and autoimmune diseases. This has created an opportunity to cross-pollinate the experiences of both teams to drive through clinical development on our varied pipeline quickly. As CMO  I will now be responsible for driving through clinical candidates that can affect a wide spread of patients suffering from a range of conditions and make a meaningful difference to the lives of large numbers of patients ” said Michel Wurm MD  CMO  BioSenic. “A successful conclusion of the phase IIb trial for ALLOB and the start of the phase III trial for the autoimmune platform will be major milestones for BioSenic as well. This will include further investigation of the medical characteristics and mechanisms of action of the therapies. I will be determined to enable BioSenic to recruit and progress this trial quickly and reduce analysis time and increase the clarity of results. This will move us towards the market as quickly as possible.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

His appointment will commence with immediate effect. Both Michel and Anne worked and collaborated closely together alongside the medical and scientific teams throughout the processes of the merger between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic  from when the discussions between the two companies started in May 2022. Michel will serve as CMO whilst BioSenic selects a permanent CMO from the list of candidates it is currently compiling. The new CMO will be selected for his/her expertise and experience in both autoimmunity and cell therapy.“Now the merger is complete  BioSenic is fully focused on combining its clinical development pipelines from its cell therapy and autoimmune platforms. Michel’s experience working within the clinical development team throughout the merger makes him the ideal candidate to drive the cell therapy platform ALLOB to the end of its phase IIb trial and start the phase III trial for our autoimmune platform  the following successful conclusion of the previous phase II trial. His years of expertise both in phase II and III clinical trials will be critical in this period for BioSenic ” said Prof. François Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. “Michel’s experience means he will be best placed to prepare BioSenic to take full advantage of the results of the ALLOB phase IIb trial following completion  as well as conduct the most thorough preparation of the phase III trial for our autoimmune platform. These clinical developments will be key value creation milestones for BioSenic in the first half of 2023. This late-stage clinical progression will enable BioSenic to start the process of engaging with industrial partners to co-develop late-stage clinical projects and to look at other segments of interest in autoimmune diseases and cancer. I would like to thank Anne Leselbaum for her dedicated efforts during the merger until its completion.”Michel has been selected as interim CMO primarily for his previous achievements for MedSenic. He has acquired considerable knowledge of clinical development  specifically in phase II and III. In Michel’s career  he has designed and managed over 50 international phase II and III clinical studies and has extensive experience in working within clinical guidelines for  and interacting with regulatory agencies including the FDA and EMA. Michel has also acquired experience in a number of therapeutic target areas including cardiovascular diseases  inflammation and auto-immunity. Michel has also gained wider expertise in innovative drug development  including launching start-ups  filing patents  and raising funds for both private and public companies. Michel wrote the French adaption of ‘The Investigator's Guide to Clinical Research’  a manual for investigators and health professionals involved in conducting clinical research  investigator financial disclosure  noncompliance issues  the FDA audit process and data collection technologies.As Michel has been instrumental in bringing together the clinical pipelines of Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic during the merger process  he has gained full working knowledge of the current clinical progress of the cell therapy platform ALLOB and has extensive working knowledge of the autoimmune platform using arsenic trioxide (ATO)  and specifically its clinical development in cGvHD (chronic Graft vs Host Disease).Michel will be immediately responsible for continued progression of both BioSenic assets:The ALLOB MSC platform using cells with immune privilege  anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to differentiate into bone tissues when injected into the specific bone sites to be regenerated or repaired. The phase IIb trial of ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in H1 2023. Michel will progress this trial to the intermediary analysis stage. This includes overall responsibility for liaising with the CRO nominated for the trial  and liaising with investigators in the thirty-five trial centers across seven EU countries.For the autoimmune ATO platform using ATO  Michel will also be focused on the start of the phase III trial in cGvHD  and will oversee the commencement of recruitment for the trial in a US center  to be selected shortly.“BioSenic  through its merger  has acquired two platforms in cell therapy and autoimmune diseases. This has created an opportunity to cross-pollinate the experiences of both teams to drive through clinical development on our varied pipeline quickly. As CMO  I will now be responsible for driving through clinical candidates that can affect a wide spread of patients suffering from a range of conditions and make a meaningful difference to the lives of large numbers of patients ” said Michel Wurm MD  CMO  BioSenic. “A successful conclusion of the phase IIb trial for ALLOB and the start of the phase III trial for the autoimmune platform will be major milestones for BioSenic as well. This will include further investigation of the medical characteristics and mechanisms of action of the therapies. I will be determined to enable BioSenic to recruit and progress this trial quickly and reduce analysis time and increase the clarity of results. This will move us towards the market as quickly as possible.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)° is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

Firstly  through the scale of the changes in the market  with the sale of pre-registered vehicles  Aramis Group’s longstanding business line in France and Belgium  virtually disappearing in just a few months due to a shortage of available vehicles. Secondly  through the continued trend for very sharp price rises that began in 2021 and tensions surrounding B2B sourcing channels  particularly for the most recent used vehicles. In this context  Aramis Group successfully continued moving forward with its strategy for growth  opening two new refurbishing centers  entering two new geographies  and rolling out a number of value-creating innovations for its customers  such as the extension of the 24-hour delivery service to include new geographies. In addition  our teams have been able to remarkably maintain their strong focus on customer satisfaction  offering quality vehicles at the right price  enabling us to achieve our objectives for growth on the refurbished vehicle segment. They have shown an outstanding level of responsiveness to redirect sourcing flows towards the private owners channel  thanks in particular to the tools and features developed by our data experts to support efficient purchasing and inventory management. The staff in the refurbishing centers were also a key factor behind our success this year  supporting the very strong growth in the volumes of vehicles to be refurbished  while respecting our high standards of quality. Despite limited visibility and a still uncertain market for 2023  Aramis Group is still effectively positioned to continue growing  and is confident in the ability of its teams to pursue the roadmap that will enable it to become the preferred platform for Europeans to buy a used car online”.MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN 2022Despite a challenging macroeconomic context  Aramis Group made major progress in 2022  with both rolling out operational initiatives and deploying its strategy to become Europe’s preferred platform for buying used cars online.The Group has built its growth strategy around three pillars: 1/ organic growth  driven by the increase in the volumes of refurbished vehicles sold in the geographies where it is present; 2/ external growth  through international development  acquiring carefully selected firms; 3/ the ramping up of additional product lines and increased penetration for its services business.In terms of the first pillar  FY 2022 was marked in particular by the opening and gradual ramping up of two new refurbishing centers: one in Antwerp  Belgium  inaugurated in November 2021  the other in Nemours  France  inaugurated in June 2022. These centers  whose ramp-up was adapted in 2022 in line with the effective level of demand  are enabling Aramis Group to look ahead to the future with confidence in terms of its internal production capacity for refurbished vehicles  supporting its ambition for growth.For the second pillar  the last few weeks saw the completion of a business combination project that began more than two years ago. On October 3  Aramis Group finalized its acquisition of Onlinecars  the market leader for online used vehicle sales in Austria (€168 million of revenues for the 12-month period ended September 30  2022). This operation  based on a valuation multiple similar to those from Aramis Group’s previous acquisitions  will open up a number of synergies  particularly in terms of sourcing.On October 31  Aramis Group was also able to acquire Brumbrum  the only fully online distributor of used vehicles in Italy (€19 million of revenues for the 12-month period ended September 30  2022)  under extremely attractive financial conditions  following Cazoo’s strategic review of its activities in continental Europe. This operation has enabled the Group to add a new highly strategic country to its portfolio  as Italy is the fourth largest European country in terms of used vehicle sales and the Stellantis Group has a market share of over 40% in this country.Lastly  on the third pillar  significant progress was made with the financing offers in 2022. On the one hand  the increased digitalization of customer financing files has made it possible to significantly accelerate the timeframes for acceptance by the Group’s financial partners. On the other hand  a new partnership set up with Santander in Spain is enabling Aramis Group to capture a larger share of the financing-related value creation in exchange for contributing a certain amount of business.2022 FULL-YEAR ACTIVITYFor the year ended September 30  2022  the Group recorded €1 768.9 million of revenues  up +40.0% year-on-year on a reported basis and +29.2% pro forma. In a market environment that gradually deteriorated during the year  Aramis Group was able to maintain its growth  while limiting the negative impact on its margins  thanks to a solid performance on the refurbished vehicle segment. This segment  which is the Group’s strategic priority and represented 85% of its B2C volumes for the full year  offset the sharp contraction in volumes in the pre-registered vehicle segment due to the very limited availability of new vehicles.Overview of volumes and revenues2022 full-year B2C volumesIn units Pro forma Reported basis FY 2022 FY 2021 Change (%) FY 2022 FY 2021 Change (%) Refurbished cars 69 384 50 125 +38.4% 69 384 44 276 +56.7% Pre-registered cars 12 347 30 280 -59.2% 12 347 30 280 -59.2% Total Volumes B2C 81 731 80 405 +1.6% 81 731 74 556 +9.6%2022 full-year revenuesBy segmentIn millions of euros Pro forma Reported basis FY 2022 FY 2021 Change(%) FY 2022 FY 2021 Change (%) Refurbished cars 1 215.0 712.7 +70.5% 1 215.0 629.0 +93.2% Pre-registered cars 245.3 470.2 -47.8% 245.3 470.2 -47.8% Total B2C 1 460.3 1 182.9 +23.4% 1 460.3 1 099.2 +32.8% Total B2B 217.9 114.5 +90.3% 217.9 100.4 +117.0% Total Services 90.7 71.3 +27.2% 90.7 64.2 +41.2% Revenues 1 768.9 1 368.7 +29.2% 1 768.9 1 263.8 +40.0%By countryIn millions of euros Pro forma Reported basis FY 2022 FY 2021 Change (%) FY 2022 FY 2021 Change (%) France 725.7 680.9 +6.6% 725.7 680.9 +6.6% Belgium 240.8 201.3 +19.6% 240.8 201.3 +19.6% Spain 369.5 206.7 +78.8% 369.5 206.7 +78.8% UK 432.8 279.8 +54.7% 432.8 174.9 +147.5% Revenues 1 768.9 1 368.7 +29.2% 1 768.9 1 263.8 +40.0%Analysis of revenues by segmentB2C – sales of cars to private customers (83% of revenues)Revenues for the B2C segment – corresponding to sales of refurbished and pre-registered cars to private customers – totaled €1 460.3 million for FY 2022  up +32.8% from FY 2021 on a reported basis and +23.4% pro forma.In the B2C business  refurbished car sales came to €1 215.0 million  with +93.2% growth on a reported basis and +70.5% pro forma compared with 2021. 69 384 vehicles were delivered  with a +56.7% increase on a reported basis and +38.4% pro forma (in line with the guidance: around +40%). For comparison  over the same period and for the Group’s geographies  the overall used vehicle market contracted by -9%  with Aramis Group outperforming by 47 points  once again highlighting the success of its value proposition. This trend was supported by the opening and ramping up of new refurbishing centers  guaranteeing customers a wide range of quality vehicles at attractive prices  despite the aging trend for the overall fleet linked to its limited renewal due to the shortage of new vehicles.Pre-registered car sales came to €245.3 million  down -47.8% versus 2021. 12 347 units were able to be sold in 2022  down -59.2% due to the extreme difficulties experienced with sourcing this type of vehicle  once again linked to the major disruption affecting production lines for new cars.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (12% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment climbed to €217.9 million in 2022  driven by very strong growth of +117.0% on a reported basis and +90.3% pro forma. This growth reflects the increase in prices and in the sourcing of vehicles from private owners  some of which are resold to professionals (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km).Services (5% of revenues)Revenues from services reached €90.7 million of revenues in 2022  up +41.2% on a reported basis and +27.2% pro forma. In particular  the penetration rate for financing solutions picked up in the fourth quarter  reaching over 50% at the consolidated level in September.INCOME STATEMENTThe income statement for FY 2022 highlights three key developments: 1/ a significant increase in consolidated revenues  driven by the price effect and the robust development of refurbished vehicle sales; 2/ the resilience of the gross profit generated per unit of vehicle sold  against a backdrop of inflation and inventory adjustments  confirming the robustness of the Group’s vertically integrated business model;3/ profitability affected by the sudden collapse in the volumes of pre-registered vehicles sold  the Group’s longstanding business line  as well as by non-recurring costs linked to the earnouts paid  in particular with the departure of the founders of Clicars  the Group's Spanish subsidiary.Condensed income statementIn millions of euros Pro forma Reported basis FY 2022 FY 2021 Change (%) FY 2022 FY 2021 Change (%) Revenues 1 768.9 1 368.7 +29.2% 1 768.9 1 263.8 +40.0% Gross margin 175.1 185.3 -5.5% 175.1 173.0 +1.2% Gross profit per B2C vehicle sold - GPU (€) 2 142 2 292 -6.6% 2 142 2 307 -7.2% Adjusted EBITDA -10.7 37.2 - -10.7 32.6 - Operating income -51.8 -7.5 - -51.8 -9.7 - Net profit (loss) -60.2 -15.5 - -60.2 -15.7 -Gross profitAt September 30  2022  the gross profit represented €175.1 million  up +1.2% on a reported basis and down -5.5% pro forma compared with FY 2021. The gross profit per unit (GPU)  i.e. generated per B2C vehicle sold  came to €2 142  in line with the Group’s target average levels and significantly higher than the levels recorded by its main European peers  reflecting its unparalleled expertise and the relevance of its vertical integration in the value chain.The change in the GPU compared with 2021 is linked to a country mix effect for 38% and operational factors for 62%  more specifically a contraction in the “metal margin” (i.e. the margin generated on the sale of the cars themselves)  partially offset by the improvement in the “services margin” (i.e. the margin generated on the sale of additional services). The main factors behind the lower metal margin include the impact of inflation on prices of the spare parts required for refurbishing  the gradual ramping up of the two new refurbishing centers  and the consequences of Aramis Group’s decision to adjust inventories to adapt to the new market conditions.For reference  since its IPO  Aramis Group has calculated its GPU with a methodology that allows it to be compared to its US peers. The indicator therefore includes all of the costs of goods sold (COGS)  relating in particular to the acquisition price of cars  their refurbishing (notably the salaries of the teams working in the centers  the cost of spare parts  the cost of energy supplies  other overheads and rent for the centers) and the various logistics flows  as well as after-sales and administration costs. Under IFRS  i.e. excluding lease charges  Aramis Group’s GPU for FY 2022 represents €2 170.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA came to -€10.7 million at September 30  2022 (in line with the guidance: -€10 million to-€12 million). The reduced profitability compared with FY 2021 reflects the contraction in the GPU and the decrease in the Group’s overall level of business in terms of volumes  which prevented the effective absorption of sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A).Sales  general and administrative costs (including the correction of the lease charges recognized in the GPU to be able to calculate the adjusted EBITDA in IFRS format) totaled €185.7 million for FY 2022  up +25.5% pro forma compared with 2021.This amount includes €39.0 million of marketing costs  up +22.1% pro forma from 2021. Personnel expenses represent €86.1 million  up +27.6% on a pro forma basis. Vehicle delivery costs are up +17.3% pro forma to €30.3 million. Lastly  other SG&A costs totaled €30.3 million  with a +32.8% increase pro forma (including €12.2 million of income linked to the restatement of lease charges as explained above).In accordance with its commitments  Aramis Group stabilized its SG&A in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half  in particular by adjusting its marketing expenses in line with the current market context.Operating incomeOperating income for 2022 came to -€51.8 million. This amount includes €16.2 million of personnel expenses relating to acquisitions  €0.7 million of personnel expenses relating to share-based payments  €2.1 million of transaction-related costs  €10.6 million for the IFRS 16 lease amortization charge  and finally €11.6 million of depreciation charges.Net profit (loss)The net loss for FY 2022 came to -€60.2 million. It includes -€5.5 million of financial income and expenses and a -€3.0 million tax expense.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL STRUCTUREAt September 30  2022  Aramis Group’s balance sheet shows a very moderate level of debt. Cash consumption for the year is linked mainly to the financing of working capital requirements (primarily the inventory of vehicles to be sold and trade receivables following a new agreement signed with a financial partner)  the investments in new refurbishing capacity and the digital ecosystem  as well as the earnouts paid  particularly following the departure in the second quarter of the 2022 calendar year of the founders of Clicars  the Group’s Spanish subsidiary  in accordance with the contractual agreements set up when Aramis Group entered this company’s capital in 2017.Inventory and operating working capital requirementsIn millions of euros Sep 30  2022 Sep 30  2021 Change (€M) Inventories 184.8 173.8 11.0 Trade receivables 36.1 23.7 12.4 Other current assets (excl. non-operational items) 27.6 23.1 4.5 Trade payables 50.2 46.6 3.5 Other current liabilities (excl. non-operational items) 46.3 44.9 1.4 Other items 2.3 0.7 1.6 Operating working capital requirements 149.8 128.5 21.3Inventory represented €184.8 million at September 30  2022. The year-on-year increase is very limited  representing just +€11 million  whereas revenues are up +€400 million (+29.2%) pro forma for the same period. In line with its commitments  Aramis Group has carried out extensive work in the last few months to rationalize its inventory  with a view to improving its rotation times and bringing its overall stock levels more in line with current market conditions.The level of operating working capital requirements at September 30  2022 therefore represents 31 days of revenues  compared with 34 days one year ago.Cash positionIn millions of euros Sep 30  2022 Net cash at period-start 102.0 Adjusted EBITDA -10.7 Change in operating working capital requirements -21.3 Personnel expenses relating to acquisitions -37.3 Other operation-related cash flow -0.2 Subtotal -69.4 Capex -25.2 Other investment-related cash flow -0.3 Subtotal -25.5 Capital increase/ decrease +0.1 Interest paid -2.0 Lease charges (IFRS 16 - interest and capital) -13.0 Other financing-related cash flow (excl. issuing and repayment of borrowings) -1.2 Subtotal -16.2 Other financing-related cash flow without any impact on cash -9.3 Net debt at period-end 18.4Cash consumption relating to operations over the period totaled €69.4 million  mainly including €10.7 million linked to the loss on adjusted EBITDA  €21.3 million for the change in operating working capital requirements  and €37.3 million for the earnouts mentioned previously.Cash consumption relating to investments came to €25.5 million  corresponding primarily to tangible and intangible capital expenditure  which remain effectively under control at around 1.4% of full-year revenues.Lastly  financing-related cash consumption (excluding issuing and repayment of borrowings) totaled €16.2 million  including €13 million relating to lease charges (IFRS 16).In addition  various non-cash accounting effects contributed €9.3 million to the change in net debt.In view of these elements  net debt at September 30  2022 represented €18.4 million.As agreed with its main shareholder Stellantis  Aramis Group renegotiated its credit lines to further strengthen the financing of its growth and international expansion strategy. In addition to setting up a line to finance the acquisition of Onlinecars  another line was set up with Stellantis with a view to supporting the Group’s growth. These fixed-rate lines  set up at levels reflecting Stellantis’ financing conditions  without any covenants and repayable at maturity after four and five years  offer a major competitive advantage for Aramis Group in terms of financial flexibility. The €200 million revolving credit facility (RCF)  which was set up in 2021 with a pool of banks and was subject to various covenants  was canceled.At September 30  2022  the Group had €255 million of credit lines that could be used without any conditions  with €66 million drawn down (including the €27.2 million required for the payment for the acquisition of Onlinecars  which was effectively signed and paid on October 3  2022).OUTLOOK FOR 2023Due to the macroeconomic  geopolitical and industry environment  visibility is currently limited on Aramis Group’s markets.In the pre-registered vehicle segment  there will continue to be uncertainty in 2023 surrounding the outcome of the semiconductor crisis and the conflict in Ukraine  which are affecting supply chains and the rate at which new vehicle production is normalizing. Aramis Group’s ability to source this type of vehicle depends on it.In the refurbished vehicle segment  demand is gradually being more affected by the slowdown in European household consumption  against a backdrop of high inflation. For the past few months  this has been reflected in a downward trend for the overall used vehicle market  with the latest statistics showing a -13% contraction on average in the third calendar quarter of 2022 compared with the same period the previous year  in the geographies where Aramis Group is present  compared with just -3% in the first quarter of the 2022 calendar year.Regarding the outlook for 2023  except in the event of a further deterioration in the macroeconomic environment  Aramis Group expects to see positive organic growth in its volumes of B2C refurbished vehicles sold  combined with a gradual improvement in its adjusted EBITDA during the year  excluding restructuring costs.Over the longer term  Aramis Group still firmly believes that its very strong value proposition offers it major potential for market share gains. More than ever  the automotive sector faces growing demand from consumers for cleaner vehicles at reasonable prices. Moreover  extending a vehicle’s lifecycle  through regular technical checks and refurbishing  makes it possible to offer reliable used cars at lower prices for consumers  reconciling their right to individual mobility and their growing concerns for the environment.***Status of the statutory auditors’ procedures:During its meeting on December 1  2022  Aramis Group’s Board of Directors approved the consolidated and parent company financial statements for FY 2022  ended September 30  2022. The audit procedures on these accounts have been completed. The statutory auditors’ certification report is currently being issued.Next financial information:2023 first-quarter activity: January 25  2023 (after market close)About Aramis Group – www.aramis.groupAramis Group is the European leader for B2C online used car sales and operates in six countries.

With co-administration of BRIVIACT® 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was doubled. Intake of BRIVIACT® with alcohol is not recommended. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with rifampicin  a strong enzyme-inducer (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased BRIVIACT® area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of BRIVIACT® for patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Other strong enzyme-inducers (such as St John´s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) may also decrease the systemic exposure of BRIVIACT®. Therefore  starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g.  lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and BRIVIACT® may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro studies have also shown that BRIVIACT® has inhibitory effects on OAT3. BRIVIACT® 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. BRIVIACT® plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required. Effects on ability to drive and use machines BRIVIACT®  has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of BRIVIACT®  on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects. The most frequently reported adverse reactions with BRIVIACT® (reported by >10% of patients) were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at higher incidences with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions (≥1% to <10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia has been reported in 0.5% (6/1 099) BRIVIACT® patients and 0% (0/459) placebo-treated patients. Four of these patients had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline  and experienced additional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of BRIVIACT®. None of the six cases were severe  required any specific treatment  led to BRIVIACT® discontinuation or had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3 % (3/1099) of BRIVIACT® treated patients and 0.7 % (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of BRIVIACT® in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt  however both were reported in the long-term open-label extension studies. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of BRIVIACT® patients (9/3022) during clinical development. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients assessed from 6 years onwards (more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. No clinical data are available in neonates. Overdose There is limited clinical experience with BRIVIACT® overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness were reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of BRIVIACT®. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the post-marketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since less than 10% of BRIVIACT® is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance BRIVIACT® clearance.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/briviact-epar-product-information_en.pdfAbout BRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) CV in the U.S.5BRIVIACT was approved in the U.S. in 2016 as an add-on therapy for adult patients with partial-onset seizures. BRIVIACT was approved as monotherapy for adults in September 2017  and as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients four years of age and older with partial-onset seizures in 2018. In August 2021  BRIVIACT was approved for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients as young as one month of age. BRIVIACT is available in three formulations: oral tablets  oral solution  and intravenous (IV) injection. More information is available at [email protected]: FDA-Approved Drugs .BRIVIACT IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSuicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs  including BRIVIACT  increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation.

Advise patients to report these symptoms immediately to a healthcare provider. Hypersensitivity: BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients.BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with all antiepileptic drugs  BRIVIACT should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials  the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) were somnolence and sedation  dizziness  fatigue  and nausea and vomiting symptoms. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients were generally similar to those in adult patients. Adverse reactions with BRIVIACT injection in adult and pediatric patients were generally similar to those observed with BRIVIACT tablets. Other adverse events that occurred in adult patients who received BRIVIACT injection included dysgeusia  euphoric mood  feeling drunk  and infusion site pain.BRIVIACT is a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information and visit www.BRIVIACThcp.com .About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IV 6FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved in the US for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. FINTEPLA is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients two years of age and older.In the United States  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.Please see full Prescribing Information   including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.Key Safety Information about FINTEPLA in the U.S.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring : Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStiripentol Plus Clobazam: Coadministration of FINTEPLA with stiripentol plus clobazam  with or without valproate  increases fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol plus clobazam  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (maximum daily dosage of 17 mg).Strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of FINTEPLA with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations  which may lower the efficacy of FINTEPLA. It is recommended to avoid coadministration of strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6 or CYP3A inducers. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed; however  do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration of FINTEPLA with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors; however  do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA of 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .Key Safety Information about FINTEPLA®▼ in EU7Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertensionBecause of reported cases of valvular heart disease that may have been caused by fenfluramine at higher doses used to treat adult obesity  cardiac monitoring must be performed using echocardiography. In the controlled clinical studies of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome  no valvular heart disease was observed.Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline prior to initiating treatment and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension.Echocardiogram monitoring should be conducted every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  a follow-up echocardiogram should be considered at an earlier timeframe to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities on the echocardiogram are observed  it is recommended to evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver  and cardiologist.If treatment is stopped because of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease  appropriate monitoring and follow-up should be provided in accordance with local guidelines for the treatment of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease.With past use in higher doses to treat adult obesity  fenfluramine was reported to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was not observed in the clinical programme  but because of the low incidence of this disease  the clinical trial experience with fenfluramine is inadequate to determine if fenfluramine increases the risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with Dravet syndrome.If echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  a repeat echocardiogram should be performed as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as ""intermediate probability"" by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines  it should lead to a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer  and cardiologist. If the echocardiogram finding  after confirmation  suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension  as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped.Decreased appetite and weight lossFenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss. An additive effect on decreased appetite can occur when fenfluramine is combined with other anti-epileptic medicines  for example stiripentol. The decrease in weight appears to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight gain over time while continuing treatment. The patient's weight should be monitored. A benefit risk evaluation should be undertaken prior to commencing treatment with fenfluramine in patients with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.Fintepla controlled access programmeA controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla.SomnolenceFenfluramine can cause somnolence. Other central nervous system depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate the somnolence effect of fenfluramine.Suicidal behaviour and ideationSuicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with anti-epileptic medicines that did not include fenfluramine has shown a small increased risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known  and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for fenfluramine. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge.Serotonin syndromeAs with other serotonergic agents  serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents (including SSRIs  SNRIs  tricyclic antidepressants  or triptans); with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems.Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular aberrations (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhoea).If concomitant treatment with fenfluramine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the serotonergic systems is clinically warranted  careful observation of the patient is advised  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.Increased seizure frequencyAs with other anti-epileptic medicines  a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment with fenfluramine  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative.CyproheptadineCyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  patients should be monitored for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced.GlaucomaFenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if there is ocular pain and another cause cannot be determined.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducersCo-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers may decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations.An increase in fenfluramine dosage should be considered when co-administered with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer; the maximum daily dose should not be exceeded.ExcipientsThis medicinal product contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).

VIMPAT® is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy and in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults  adolescents and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. Lacosamide therapy can be initiated with either oral administration (either tablets or syrup) or IV administration (solution for infusion). The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. A loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician determines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic effect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the potential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and Central Nervous System (CNS) adverse reactions. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions such as status epilepticus. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. Use of a loading dose is not recommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and paediatric patients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment  a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal disease  a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed with caution. In paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose is recommended. A maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for paediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and for adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Based on data in adults  in paediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic impairment  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. Lacosamide should be administered to adult and paediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more with mild to moderate hepatic impairment a loading dose of 200mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Lacosamide is not recommended for use in children below the age of 4 years in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and below the age of 2 years in the treatment of partial-onset seizures as there are limited data on safety and efficacy in these age groups. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients; known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal products in several indications. Therefore  patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. Dose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischaemia/infarction  heart failure  structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or patients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction  including antiarrhythmics and sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products  as well as in elderly patients. In these patients it should be considered to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) before a lacosamide dose increase above 400mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. In the placebo-controlled clinical studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients  atrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported; however both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. In post-marketing experience  AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been reported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions  ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In rare cases  these events have led to asystole  cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow  rapid or irregular pulse  palpitations  shortness of breath  feeling lightheaded  fainting). Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls. Therefore  patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine. New onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and paediatric patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS)  in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type  the observed benefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another seizure type. The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in paediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal and generalised seizures may coexist have not been determined. VIMPAT® syrup contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Vimpat Syrup contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect. The syrup contains aspartame (E951)  a source of phenylalanine  which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks of age. Vimpat syrup contains propylene glycol (E1520). VIMPAT® syrup contains 1.42 mg sodium per ml  equivalent to 0.07 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. VIMPAT® solution for infusion contains 59.8 mg sodium per vial  equivalent to 3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Lacosamide may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision. Accordingly  patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥10%) are dizziness  headache  nausea and diplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. Incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. Other common adverse reactions (≥1% - <10%) are depression  confusional state  insomnia  balance disorder  myoclonic seizures  ataxia  memory impairment  cognitive disorder  somnolence  tremor  nystagmus  hypoesthesia  dysarthria  disturbance in attention  paraesthesia  vision blurred  vertigo  tinnitus  vomiting  constipation  flatulence  dyspepsia  dry mouth  diarrhoea  pruritus  rash  muscle spasms  gait disturbance  asthenia  fatigue  irritability  feeling drunk  injection site pain or discomfort (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  irritation (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  fall  and skin laceration and contusion. The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block  syncope  bradycardia) may occur. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms  DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. These reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be associated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is suspected  lacosamide should be discontinued. The safety profile of lacosamide in adjunctive therapy in paediatric patients with partial- onset seizures was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. The additional adverse reactions observed in the paediatric population were pyrexia  nasopharyngitis  pharyngitis  decreased appetite  abnormal behaviour and lethargy. Somnolence was reported more frequently in the paediatric population (≥ 1/10) compared to the adult population (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information. Date of revision: October 2022. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/vimpat-epar-product-information_en.pdfAbout VIMPAT (lacosamide) CV in the U.S 9VIMPAT® was approved in the U.S. in 2008 as an add-on therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adult patients with epilepsy. VIMPAT was approved as monotherapy for adults in August 2014  and as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients four years of age and older with partial-onset seizures in 2017. In 2020  it was approved adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) in patients four years of age and older and VIMPAT injection for intravenous use in children four years of age and older. In October 2021  VIMPAT received an expanded indication to treat partial-onset seizures in patients as young as one month of age. VIMPAT is available in three formulations: oral tablets  oral solution  and intravenous (IV) injection.VIMPAT IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONVIMPAT® is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older. VIMPAT is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older.VIMPAT is associated with important warnings and precautions including suicidal behavior and ideation  dizziness and ataxia  cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities  syncope  and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity.Partial-Onset SeizuresIn the adult adjunctive placebo-controlled trials for partial-onset seizures  the most common adverse reactions (≥10% and greater than placebo) were dizziness  headache  nausea  and diplopia. In the adult monotherapy clinical trial  adverse reactions were generally similar to those observed and attributed to drug in adjunctive placebo-controlled trials  with the exception of insomnia (observed at a higher rate of ≥2%).Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic SeizuresIn the adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled trial for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures  the adverse reactions were generally similar to those that occurred in the partial-onset seizures trials. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were dizziness  somnolence  headache  and nausea.Pediatric PatientsAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies for partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age and for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for patients 4 to less than 17 years of age were similar to those seen in adult patients.InjectionIn adult adjunctive therapy clinical trials for partial-onset seizures  adverse reactions with intravenous administration generally were similar to those that occurred with the oral formulation  although intravenous administration was associated with local adverse reactions such as injection site pain or discomfort (2.5%)  irritation (1%)  and erythema (0.5%). When administering a loading dose  the incidence of CNS adverse reactions  such as dizziness  somnolence  and paresthesia  may be higher with 15-minute administration than over a 30- to 60-minute period. The adverse reactions associated with VIMPAT injection in adult patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures are expected to be similar to those seen in adults with partial- onset seizures. The adverse reactions associated with VIMPAT injection in pediatric patients are expected to be similar to those noted in adults. Infusion times less than 30 minutes were not adequately studied in pediatric patients.VIMPAT is a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information and visit www.VIMPAThcp.com.About NAYZILAM® (midazolam) nasal spray  CIV in the U.S.10NAYZILAM is a benzodiazepine indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent  stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e.  seizure clusters  acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.NAYZILAM IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION [FDA Approved Only]CONTRAINDICATIONSNAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with acute narrow-angle glaucoma.RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDSConcomitant use of benzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  and opioids may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.ABUSE  MISUSE  AND ADDICTIONThe use of benzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  exposes users to risks of abuse  misuse  and addiction  which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications  alcohol  and/or illicit substances  which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing NAYZILAM and throughout treatment  assess each patient's risk for abuse  misuse  and addiction.DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS AFTER USE OF NAYZILAM MORE FREQUENTLY THAN RECOMMENDEDThe continued use of benzodiazepines may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Although NAYZILAM is indicated only for intermittent use  if used more frequently than recommended  abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of NAYZILAM may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions  which can be life-threatening. For patients using NAYZILAM more frequently than recommended  to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions  use a gradual taper to discontinue NAYZILAM.Risks of Cardiorespiratory Adverse ReactionsSerious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. Warn patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression  cardiac and respiratory arrest.Respiratory depression was observed with the administration of NAYZILAM during clinical trials. Cardiac or respiratory arrest caused by NAYZILAM was not reported during clinical trials.Central Nervous System Depression from Concomitant Use with Other Central Nervous System Depressants  or Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 InhibitorsDrug products containing midazolam  including NAYZILAM  have a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect.Risks from Concomitant Use with Other CNS DepressantsNAYZILAM may cause an increased CNS-depressant effect when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants (e.g.  opioids). Warn patients and caregivers that the use of NAYZILAM in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs may increase the risk of hypoventilation  airway obstruction  desaturation  or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect.Risks from Concomitant Use with Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 InhibitorsConcomitant use of NAYZILAM with moderate or strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors may result in prolonged sedation because of a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. Caution patients against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness  such as operating machinery  driving a motor vehicle or riding a bicycle until they have completely returned to their level of baseline functioning.Suicidal Behavior and IdeationAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including NAYZILAM  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Monitor patients treated with NAYZILAM for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behavior  and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Advise patients and caregivers to be alert for these behavioral changes and to immediately report them to the healthcare provider.Impaired Cognitive FunctionMidazolam  including NAYZILAM  is associated with a high incidence of partial or complete impairment of recall for several hours following an administered dose. Counsel patients on when they can engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness  operate hazardous machinery  or drive a motor vehicle after taking NAYZILAM.GlaucomaBenzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  can increase intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. NAYZILAM may be used in patients with open-angle glaucoma only if they are receiving appropriate therapy. NAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn the randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial  the most common adverse reactions (≥5% in any NAYZILAM treatment group) were somnolence  headache  nasal discomfort  throat irritation  and rhinorrhea.NAYZILAM is a Schedule IV controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information .For additional medical information about NAYZILAM  patient assistance  or any other information please visit our website or call ucbCARES® at 1-844-599-2273.ReferencesMeyer AC  Dua T  Ma J  et al.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.
