14129,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biosenic-appoints-michel-wurm-m-060000173.html,BioSenic appoints Michel Wurm  M.D. as Chief Medical Officer,REGULATED INFORMATION Appointment to further integrate BioSenic‚Äôs both cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms under the responsibility of a new CMO...,BioSenicREGULATED INFORMATIONAppointment to further integrate BioSenic‚Äôs both cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms under the responsibility of a new CMO and cross-pollinate the experiences of both teams to accelerate clinical progressionMont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  December 02  2022  7am CET ‚Äì BIOSENIC (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the company specializing in serious autoimmune /inflammatory diseases and cell repair  today announces it has appointed Michel Wurm  MD  as interim Chief Medical Officer (CMO)  responsible for the development of both of BioSenic‚Äôs cell therapy and autoimmune disease platforms.Michel Wurm replaces Anne Leselbaum as interim CMO and as an independent consultant. His appointment will commence with immediate effect. Both Michel and Anne worked and collaborated closely together alongside the medical and scientific teams throughout the processes of the merger between Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic  from when the discussions between the two companies started in May 2022. Michel will serve as CMO whilst BioSenic selects a permanent CMO from the list of candidates it is currently compiling. The new CMO will be selected for his/her expertise and experience in both autoimmunity and cell therapy.‚ÄúNow the merger is complete  BioSenic is fully focused on combining its clinical development pipelines from its cell therapy and autoimmune platforms. Michel‚Äôs experience working within the clinical development team throughout the merger makes him the ideal candidate to drive the cell therapy platform ALLOB to the end of its phase IIb trial and start the phase III trial for our autoimmune platform  the following successful conclusion of the previous phase II trial. His years of expertise both in phase II and III clinical trials will be critical in this period for BioSenic ‚Äù said Prof. Fran√ßois Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. ‚ÄúMichel‚Äôs experience means he will be best placed to prepare BioSenic to take full advantage of the results of the ALLOB phase IIb trial following completion  as well as conduct the most thorough preparation of the phase III trial for our autoimmune platform. These clinical developments will be key value creation milestones for BioSenic in the first half of 2023. This late-stage clinical progression will enable BioSenic to start the process of engaging with industrial partners to co-develop late-stage clinical projects and to look at other segments of interest in autoimmune diseases and cancer. I would like to thank Anne Leselbaum for her dedicated efforts during the merger until its completion.‚ÄùStory continuesMichel has been selected as interim CMO primarily for his previous achievements for MedSenic. He has acquired considerable knowledge of clinical development  specifically in phase II and III. In Michel‚Äôs career  he has designed and managed over 50 international phase II and III clinical studies and has extensive experience in working within clinical guidelines for  and interacting with regulatory agencies including the FDA and EMA. Michel has also acquired experience in a number of therapeutic target areas including cardiovascular diseases  inflammation and auto-immunity. Michel has also gained wider expertise in innovative drug development  including launching start-ups  filing patents  and raising funds for both private and public companies. Michel wrote the French adaption of ‚ÄòThe Investigator's Guide to Clinical Research‚Äô  a manual for investigators and health professionals involved in conducting clinical research  investigator financial disclosure  noncompliance issues  the FDA audit process and data collection technologies.As Michel has been instrumental in bringing together the clinical pipelines of Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic during the merger process  he has gained full working knowledge of the current clinical progress of the cell therapy platform ALLOB and has extensive working knowledge of the autoimmune platform using arsenic trioxide (ATO)  and specifically its clinical development in cGvHD (chronic Graft vs Host Disease).Michel will be immediately responsible for continued progression of both BioSenic assets:The ALLOB MSC platform using cells with immune privilege  anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to differentiate into bone tissues when injected into the specific bone sites to be regenerated or repaired. The phase IIb trial of ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in H1 2023. Michel will progress this trial to the intermediary analysis stage. This includes overall responsibility for liaising with the CRO nominated for the trial  and liaising with investigators in the thirty-five trial centers across seven EU countries.For the autoimmune ATO platform using ATO  Michel will also be focused on the start of the phase III trial in cGvHD  and will oversee the commencement of recruitment for the trial in a US center  to be selected shortly.‚ÄúBioSenic  through its merger  has acquired two platforms in cell therapy and autoimmune diseases. This has created an opportunity to cross-pollinate the experiences of both teams to drive through clinical development on our varied pipeline quickly. As CMO  I will now be responsible for driving through clinical candidates that can affect a wide spread of patients suffering from a range of conditions and make a meaningful difference to the lives of large numbers of patients ‚Äù said Michel Wurm MD  CMO  BioSenic. ‚ÄúA successful conclusion of the phase IIb trial for ALLOB and the start of the phase III trial for the autoimmune platform will be major milestones for BioSenic as well. This will include further investigation of the medical characteristics and mechanisms of action of the therapies. I will be determined to enable BioSenic to recruit and progress this trial quickly and reduce analysis time and increase the clarity of results. This will move us towards the market as quickly as possible.‚ÄùAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

His years of expertise both in phase II and III clinical trials will be critical in this period for BioSenic ‚Äù said Prof. Fran√ßois Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic. ‚ÄúMichel‚Äôs experience means he will be best placed to prepare BioSenic to take full advantage of the results of the ALLOB phase IIb trial following completion  as well as conduct the most thorough preparation of the phase III trial for our autoimmune platform. These clinical developments will be key value creation milestones for BioSenic in the first half of 2023. This late-stage clinical progression will enable BioSenic to start the process of engaging with industrial partners to co-develop late-stage clinical projects and to look at other segments of interest in autoimmune diseases and cancer. I would like to thank Anne Leselbaum for her dedicated efforts during the merger until its completion.‚ÄùMichel has been selected as interim CMO primarily for his previous achievements for MedSenic. He has acquired considerable knowledge of clinical development  specifically in phase II and III. In Michel‚Äôs career  he has designed and managed over 50 international phase II and III clinical studies and has extensive experience in working within clinical guidelines for  and interacting with regulatory agencies including the FDA and EMA. Michel has also acquired experience in a number of therapeutic target areas including cardiovascular diseases  inflammation and auto-immunity. Michel has also gained wider expertise in innovative drug development  including launching start-ups  filing patents  and raising funds for both private and public companies. Michel wrote the French adaption of ‚ÄòThe Investigator's Guide to Clinical Research‚Äô  a manual for investigators and health professionals involved in conducting clinical research  investigator financial disclosure  noncompliance issues  the FDA audit process and data collection technologies.As Michel has been instrumental in bringing together the clinical pipelines of Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic during the merger process  he has gained full working knowledge of the current clinical progress of the cell therapy platform ALLOB and has extensive working knowledge of the autoimmune platform using arsenic trioxide (ATO)  and specifically its clinical development in cGvHD (chronic Graft vs Host Disease).Michel will be immediately responsible for continued progression of both BioSenic assets:The ALLOB MSC platform using cells with immune privilege  anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to differentiate into bone tissues when injected into the specific bone sites to be regenerated or repaired. The phase IIb trial of ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report important interim results in H1 2023. Michel will progress this trial to the intermediary analysis stage. This includes overall responsibility for liaising with the CRO nominated for the trial  and liaising with investigators in the thirty-five trial centers across seven EU countries.For the autoimmune ATO platform using ATO  Michel will also be focused on the start of the phase III trial in cGvHD  and will oversee the commencement of recruitment for the trial in a US center  to be selected shortly.‚ÄúBioSenic  through its merger  has acquired two platforms in cell therapy and autoimmune diseases. This has created an opportunity to cross-pollinate the experiences of both teams to drive through clinical development on our varied pipeline quickly. As CMO  I will now be responsible for driving through clinical candidates that can affect a wide spread of patients suffering from a range of conditions and make a meaningful difference to the lives of large numbers of patients ‚Äù said Michel Wurm MD  CMO  BioSenic. ‚ÄúA successful conclusion of the phase IIb trial for ALLOB and the start of the phase III trial for the autoimmune platform will be major milestones for BioSenic as well. This will include further investigation of the medical characteristics and mechanisms of action of the therapies. I will be determined to enable BioSenic to recruit and progress this trial quickly and reduce analysis time and increase the clarity of results. This will move us towards the market as quickly as possible.‚ÄùAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by Bone Therapeutics with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a proprietary BioSenic scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  the Company has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB continues to be evaluated for other orthopedic indications including spinal fusion  osteotomy  maxillofacial and dental  and should be of value in new indications when cells will be further adapted or transformed with additional targeting properties.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE)¬∞ is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comFor Belgian Media and Investor Enquiries:BepublicBert BouserieTel: +32 (0)488 40 44 77bert.bouserie@bepublicgroup.beInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Media and Investor Enquiries:NewCap MediaAnnie-Florence LoyerTel: +33 (0)1 44 71 00 12afloyer@newcap.frFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

Almost half of the nearly 2 000 firms surveyed said the 2021 tax season was better than the year prior  and nearly 80% said that advances in technology led to a reduction in the number of hours spent per tax return. Firms using a cloud-based tax compliance solution reported higher revenue growth than traditional firms (7% to 4%  respectively). Innovative and early-adopter firms were also 13% more likely to add services.Jason Marx  President and CEO of Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting North America  said:‚ÄúIn a world that‚Äôs embracing digital transformation  firms that prioritize the adoption of integrated  cloud-based technology will continue to drive a competitive advantage. Future-focused firms must implement and fully leverage strategic technology plans that optimize their processes  unlock their data  free up staff time and empower their people to go beyond traditional compliance to deliver the value-added advisory services clients want.‚ÄùIn 2022  the top challenges firms faced varied by sizeIn 2020  firms of all sizes were mired in navigating the daily challenges of a global pandemic. In 2021  firms grappled with rapid legislative changes and finding ways to work effectively with the IRS. In 2022  the most pressing challenges firms face varied  based on firm size.In 2022  half of this year's survey respondents reported late or unprepared clients to be a top challenge.to be a top challenge. Only two challenges ‚Äì economic uncertainty and keeping track of new or changing regulations and standards ‚Äì were expressed as a top five challenge faced by firms of all sizes.‚Äì were expressed as a top five challenge faced by firms of all sizes.

Midsize and large firms are trying to keep current with technology and learn to use their technology more effectively.2023 goals: Firms are prioritizing revenue growth  efficiency and client engagementFirms of all sizes ranked growing revenue/profit as their top goal for 2023  followed by improving customer engagement. Additionally  85% reported that their clients want strategic tax planning and advisory services. Given that recruiting and retaining talent emerged as a top-five challenge among mid-sized and large firms  it‚Äôs not surprising that improving operational workflows and employee effectiveness ranked #3 and #4 on the overall list of firm goals for 2023  followed by investments in new technologies that support remote work.Future-focused firms are using technology to deliver new services while driving staff efficiency and engagementWhile the global COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the pace of digital transformation within the tax and accounting industry  the majority of firms indicated that investments in integrated  cloud-based technology are paying off  and most said that the pace of technological change is ‚Äúabout right.‚Äù78% of firms are leveraging technology to help employees expand skillsets  while 64% are using it to improve staff engagement and moraleof firms are leveraging technology to help employees expand skillsets  while are using it to improve staff engagement and morale 77% said that technology is helping them reduce the number of hours worked  per client  and per returnsaid that technology is helping them reduce the number of hours worked  per client  and per return 73% said technology is helping improve average client response time and 72+% said technology is helping them recruit and retain clientssaid technology is helping improve average client response time and 72+% said technology is helping them recruit and retain clients 62% said technology is helping them add new servicesNotably  the survey also revealed that less than 20% of firms feel they are using their tech stack to its fullest potential ‚Äì despite two-thirds reporting that technology improves their ability to compete.
