14170,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://news.satnews.com/2022/12/03/astrocast-partners-with-avirtech-for-satiot-smart-farming-solutions/,Astrocast partners with Avirtech for SatIoT smart farming solutions – SatNews - SatNews,Astrocast partners with Avirtech for SatIoT smart farming solutions – SatNews  SatNews,Astrocast and Avirtech have announced a smart farming partnership.Astrocast is providing Avirtech with Satellite IoT (SatIoT) connectivity solutions for their BIOTA intelligent farm control system  which includes integrating its technology into Avirtech’s Avirlink to enable plantation owners to make legacy sensors smart by recording and controlling information remotely over long distances.This partnership and technology integration provides Avirtech the capability to offer clients connectivity in areas with limited or no terrestrial/cellular connectivity  such as mountainous areas. Access to SatIoT connectivity in these kinds of regions allows plantation owners to better track and understand plantation health. Using sensors that are connected to the cloud  and IoT-based digital agriculture  helps users develop a connected plantation that is led by data-driven farming – tracking factors such as weather  temperature  humidity  rainfall data  water level  water quality and soil moisture.Randy Ferixsen  CEO  Avirtech  said  “Many plantations are in remote areas where fixed line  terrestrial and cellular connectivity is not ubiquitous. This is not ideal for farmers and plantation owners – who are trying to adopt Agriculture 4.0 and develop digital agriculture ecosystems that make use of IoT (internet of things) and analytics from field-based  integrated sensor solutions. Access to Astrocast’s SatIoT connectivity  and integrating its communication modules into our devices  is enabling us to provide clients with the connectivity options required in these kinds of challenging regions. It now means that plantation owners can remotely measure an area’s microclimate  for example  and gather accurate sensor-led information that informs predictions and forecasts about potential upcoming changes to plantations. With this  plantation owners can make smarter management decisions and take more control of their crops and yield.” “Only 15% of the world has access to terrestrial networks. This collaboration between Astrocast and Avirtech allows its agricultural clients and plantation owners to access to digital ecosystems in remote farming areas  using sensors to monitor and control plantations. By deploying Avirtech’s technology  enabled with SatIoT connectivity  plantation owners can improve the efficiency of their farms  increase output  increase productivity and improve sustainable development goals ” said Fabien Jordan  CEO and Co-Founder  Astrocast. “Traditionally  a lack of weather-based information  informing smart nursery plantation management  has made it difficult for farmers and plantation owners to maintain their operations. Agriculture-based IoT solutions from firms  like Avirtech  can simplify processes and deliver the data and transformation needed by this vital industry to cut costs  cut waste and improve sustainability – all while improving production returns.” Bidirectional IoT has a vital role to play here too. The ability to send commands back to assets  rather than just receive data  is powerful. It enables an array of new use cases  including remote management of equipment. Farmers can command silos to release food  open gates or manage irrigation systems  without any need for expensive and often hard-to-source human interaction. With information seamlessly integrated with existing analytics  AI  or machine learning solutions  organisations have the power to use this data to improve understanding  and direct actions of remote assets. In any remote IoT deployment  device size  power consumption and reliability are priority concerns. Astrocast’s small-sized devices offer low power consumption and long battery life (up to 10 years). These considerations become vital as organizations such as Avirtech embark upon deploying strategic SatIoT initiatives for clients. Further  by combining good-quality battery technology with an intelligent approach to data transmission  the lifecycle of IoT solutions can be significantly extended.Astrocast SA operates a smallsat IoT network  offering services in industries such as Agriculture and Livestock  Maritime  Environment and Utilities  to name but a few. The Astrocast network enables companies to monitor  track  and communicate with remote assets from anywhere in the world. It relies on superior L-band spectrum through a strategic alliance with Thuraya. In partnership with Airbus  CEA/LETI and ESA  Astrocast developed Astronode S  an ultra-low power and miniaturized module compatible with inexpensive L-band patch antennas. Founded in 2014  Astrocast develops and tests all its products in-house  from the satellites to the modules. Astrocast is listed on Euronext Growth Oslo.Avirtech provides crop intelligence  including plantation control systems for monitoring site conditions through aerial and ground information  such as topography  crop health  soil quality  rainfall and farm operations activity  and other processes necessary for production cycles. Avirtech’s solutions provide optimization for crop yield and reduce cost for plantation. Through precision agriculture and enabling data-driven insights  Avirtech accelerates the digitalization of plantations to solve workforce shortages and improve long-term sustainability. Avirtech solutions tri-prong approach includes remote sensing for plantations using drones  detailed insights using ground sensors  and precision spraying for crop protection.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.37,0.22,0.42,True,English,"['SatIoT smart farming solutions', 'Astrocast partners', 'Avirtech', 'SatNews', 'BIOTA intelligent farm control system', 'inexpensive L-band patch antennas', 'field-based, integrated sensor solutions', 'smart nursery plantation management', 'superior L-band spectrum', 'potential upcoming changes', 'smarter management decisions', 'sustainable development goals', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'farm operations activity', 'machine learning solutions', 'long battery life', 'smallsat IoT network', 'new use cases', 'Agriculture-based IoT solutions', 'strategic SatIoT initiatives', 'smart farming partnership', 'accurate sensor-led information', 'good-quality battery technology', 'IoT-based digital agriculture', 'remote IoT deployment', 'low power consumption', 'The Astrocast network', 'digital agriculture ecosystems', 'plantation control systems', 'SatIoT) connectivity solutions', 'remote farming areas', 'intelligent approach', 'remote management', 'digital ecosystems', 'data-driven farming', 'long distances', 'strategic alliance', 'SatIoT connectivity', 'remote areas', 'Satellite IoT', 'Bidirectional IoT', 'plantation owners', 'plantation health', 'connected plantation', 'terrestrial/cellular connectivity', 'mountainous areas', 'water level', 'water quality', 'soil moisture', 'Randy Ferixsen', 'fixed line', 'connectivity options', 'Fabien Jordan', 'vital industry', 'production returns', 'vital role', 'open gates', 'human interaction', 'direct actions', 'remote assets', 'device size', 'priority concerns', 'Astronode S', 'ultra-low power', 'miniaturized module', 'crop intelligence', 'site conditions', 'crop health', 'soil quality', 'production cycles', 'precision agriculture', 'weather-based information', 'ground information', 'technology integration', 'communication modules', 'challenging regions', 'terrestrial networks', 'existing analytics', 'small-sized devices', 'other processes', 'crop yield', 'data transmission', 'legacy sensors', 'Many plantations', 'Astrocast SA', 'agricultural clients', 'rainfall data', 'Avirtech', 'Avirlink', 'capability', 'limited', 'Access', 'kinds', 'cloud', 'users', 'factors', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'CEO', 'farmers', 'internet', 'things', 'microclimate', 'example', 'predictions', 'forecasts', 'crops', 'world', 'collaboration', 'efficiency', 'farms', 'output', 'productivity', 'Founder', 'lack', 'firms', 'transformation', 'costs', 'waste', 'sustainability', 'commands', 'array', 'equipment', 'silos', 'food', 'need', 'source', 'organisations', 'understanding', 'reliability', '10 years', 'considerations', 'organizations', 'lifecycle', 'services', 'industries', 'Livestock', 'Maritime', 'Environment', 'Utilities', 'companies', 'Thuraya', 'Airbus', 'CEA/LETI', 'products', 'house', 'satellites', 'aerial', 'topography', 'optimization', 'enablin']",2022-12-03,2022-12-04,news.satnews.com
