Holders of ordinary shares who have validly submitted US dollars  euros or pounds sterling currency elections by November 25  2022 will be entitled to a dividend of US$0.25  €0.2398 or 20.61p per ordinary share  respectively.Absent any valid election to the contrary  persons holding their ordinary shares through Euroclear Nederland will receive their dividends in euros at the euro rate per ordinary share shown above. Absent any valid election to the contrary  shareholders (both holding in certificated and uncertificated form (CREST members)) and persons holding their shares through the Shell Corporate Nominee will receive their dividends in pounds sterling  at the pound sterling rate per ordinary share shown above.Euro and pounds sterling dividends payable in cash have been converted from US dollars based on an average of market exchange rates over the three dealing days from November 30 to December 2  2022. This dividend will be payable on December 19  2022 to those members whose names were on the Register of Members on November 11  2022.Taxation - cash dividendWith Shell’s tax residence moved to the UK  dividends paid to shareholders on their ordinary shares will not attract Dutch dividend withholding tax. This means that holders of the former A shares receive their dividends in full as Dutch dividend withholding tax is no longer withheld on these dividends. Holders of the former B shares receive their dividends directly from Shell as these dividends will no longer be paid through the Dividend Access Mechanism.Story continuesIf you are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividends you should consult your tax advisor.NoteA different currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately holding through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker  financial intermediary  bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.EnquiriesShell Media RelationsInternational +44 (0) 207 934 5550Americas +1 832 337 4355CAUTIONARY NOTEThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  December 5  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

14196,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/sponsored/4060880/fidelity-engage-reasons-positive-sustainable-stocks-2023,Industry Voice: Reasons to be positive on sustainable stocks in 2023,Investment Week provides the latest investment news  analysis and opinion for wealth managers and the UK funds industry,"This has been a tough year for sustainable equities. After two years of extraordinary returns  a combination of increasing interest rates which has pressured valuations of higher-quality stock and the war in Ukraine sending oil prices and energy stocks soaring had made 2022 challenging for sustainable stocks. However  we see reasons to be more positive going into 2023.Whilst fluctuations in valuation and sentiment drive short-term returns  company earnings matter far more for long-term returns  and this is where we choose to focus our efforts. The five key themes the fund is invested in (clean energy  financial inclusion  health care Innovation  improving resource intensity  and infrastructure decarbonisation) remain as powerful growth drivers as ever  giving us great confidence in the long-term earnings potential of the companies we invest in. It is important not to lose sight of these powerful structural drivers in times of higher volatility  like we see today.What could surprise markets in 2023?One risk we are paying close attention to for 2023 is labour availability and wage inflation. The labour market has proved much tighter than most expected this year  which has translated into higher wage inflation and lower profit margins for employers. Although announcements of hiring freezes or layoffs are now (sadly) a daily event  without a significant improvement in labour availability next year  we think persistent labour inflation could cause margins to surprise negatively in 2023.The silver lining here is that the best way to tackle labour availability and cost is by investing in productivity. We think companies have been under-investing for decades  with capex and R&D spending fall from 70% of cash use in 1990 to 40% today  contributing to the problem we find ourselves in today. While the market expects companies to tighten their belts on capital spending into 2023  we think that capital expenditure could surprise positively  particularly in areas that relate to efficiency  such as robotics and automation. The reshoring trend  as companies localise supply chains  also boosts the prospects of higher capital spending over the coming years.Share of total S&P 500 cash use - Companies now spend the most on buybacks and dividendsWe expect the pressures of higher inflation and interest rates to weigh on the more cyclical areas of growth and we are therefore shifting the fund's exposure to more secular growth areas which we expect to perform better in 2023. For example  we have reduced exposure to areas such as US housing  which will likely suffer from a sharp slowdown in demand as mortgage costs rise. The good news is that we see a number of end-markets with an improving growth outlook - something that will likely be in short supply in 2023. The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act in the US will spark significant growth in decarbonisation investments in the US  to which the fund has significant exposure through stocks such as Quanta Services  SolarEdge and Orsted.Positioning for what lies ahead in 2023In what has been a challenging year for the market as a whole  our exposure to US healthcare insurance (UnitedHealth and Cigna have both delivered positive share price performance YTD) has been very positive  along with names exposed to the growth in US infrastructure spending (such as Quanta Services and WW Grainger). Meanwhile  our interest rate sensitive names (emerging market banks like Bank Rakyat and HDFC  as well as German stock exchange Deutsche Boerse) have benefitted significantly from higher interest rates.Looking to 2023  we expect to be even more discerning on both valuations and the cyclicality the businesses we own or look to add. Whilst we have sympathy with the view that most of the pain is behind us when it comes to the effect of rising interest rates on valuations  we still think that many high-growth parts of the market look expensive  particularly those unsupported by strong cash flow generation. We will remain focussed on finding companies with strong secular growth potential driven by the five key trends we invest behind  but that also produce significant cash for (ideally for reinvestment into the business at high returns)  and trade at valuations that make sense even in this higher rate environment.Sustainability considerationsSustainability is at the centre of every investment we make. We combine a best-in-class approach (companies that operate their businesses in a sustainable fashion with strong governance) with an impact approach (companies whose products and services have the potential to make significantly positive contributions to the environment and society). This leaves us with a portfolio of 40-60 high-quality stocks that all make a significant contribution to a wide range of challenges facing us today such as decarbonising our energy supply  improving healthcare outcomes  improving energy efficiency  and bringing millions of under-served people into the formal banking and insurance market. Crucially  given our focus on companies with strong financial and valuation profiles  these are stocks we think have to potential to deliver this positive impact whilst also delivering good financial returns for shareholders.We would expect the focus in 2023 to be on particularly on stocks involved in clean energy and improving resource intensity and productivity. With spiking energy costs globally  companies that can deliver low-cost energy  or offer products that can improve energy efficiency are likely to be in high demand  even against a backdrop of slowing growth. We think these categories  which represent close to 50% of the fund  will be interesting areas to watch in 2023.Find out more about the Fidelity Sustainable Global Equity FundThis post is funded by Fidelity InternationalImportant informationThis content is for investment professionals only and should not be relied upon by private investors.The value of investments can go down as well as up and clients may not get back the amount invested.

14197,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-control-55-deutsche-050951662.html,Institutional investors control 55% of Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 3.2%,Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1)  it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 55% ownership. That is ,To get a sense of who is truly in control of Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1)  it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 55% ownership. That is  the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result  institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 3.2% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 32%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Börse  beginning with the chart below.See our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Deutsche Börse?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors  so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register  especially if they are growing.Deutsche Börse already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deutsche Börse's earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company  so they can collectively wield significant power. Deutsche Börse is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Massachusetts Financial Services Company is the largest shareholder with 5.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile  the second and third largest shareholders  hold 3.9% and 3.6%  of the shares outstanding  respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register  suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock  so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Deutsche BörseThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries  but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However  on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We note our data does not show any board members holding shares  personally. It is unusual not to have at least some personal holdings by board members  so our data might be flawed. A good next step would be to check how much the CEO is paid.General Public OwnershipWith a 45% ownership  the general public  mostly comprising of individual investors  have some degree of sway over Deutsche Börse. While this group can't necessarily call the shots  it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company  there are other factors that are even more important. To that end  you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Deutsche Börse .Ultimately the future is most important.

These antibody levels confirm the antibody persistence profile observed in an earlier study3. The antibody persistence was similar in older adults aged ≥65 years  who retained neutralizing antibody titers comparable to younger adults throughout the follow-up. These results follow completion of the pivotal study VLA1553-301  for which a seroresponse rate of 96% six months after vaccination1 was reported. The study will continue to monitor antibody persistence on an annual basis.No safety concerns were identified for the duration of the follow-up study  confirming the safety profile observed in previous studies.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are excited about these twelve-month data which are in line with what we saw from our previous read out at month 6  and strengthen the possibilities of inducing a long-lasting antibody response with our chikungunya vaccine candidate. We are looking forward to completing the BLA rolling submission to the FDA and potentially to changing people’s lives. If our investigational vaccine is approved  we are confident that it can help address this major  growing and unmet public health threat.”Valneva expects to finalize its BLA submission with the FDA by the end of 2022. Once completed  and if the FDA accepts the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility along with the action due date upon which it will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in 2023. Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas4 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission5. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  if approved  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20326.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15537. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20198  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 trial VLA1553-303VLA1553-303 is a single-arm  open label Phase 3 trial evaluating antibody persistence in 363 participants aged 18 years or above who were immunized with VLA1553 during the pivotal trial VLA1553-301. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies annually from 1 to 5 years after the single immunization with VLA1553. Study VLA1553-303 collected long-term safety by following-up any Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding study and collecting new-onset SAE. When participants joined the follow-up study  no AESI was ongoing.Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04546724).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Media & Investors ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  PhDVP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development  clinical trials  and regulatory review of VLA1553.

Positive contribution from existing contract deployments offset delays in some retail deals and locker installations in the residential sector  both in the US. Revenue for the 9M 2022 was down -1.8% organically.Strong Q4 expectations reiterated across Solutions  not fully offsetting the weak Q3 US lockers performanceOn a reported basis  Group FY 2022 r evenue and current EBIT 2 are expected to grow over last year level benefiting from a favourable forex contribution thanks to the Group’s significant and growing US presence.O rganic growth in revenue for the FY 2022 is now expected at above 1% 3   compared to above 2% previously 4 . Whilst the Group maintains its expectations for a strong Q4 performance across Solutions  a weaker Q3 from Parcel Lockers and the uncertain level of backlog reduction in Q4 (backlog level is up over +40% compared to 9M 2021) have led to a cautious approach to the full year outlook.FY 2022 current EBIT2 guidance4 is now expected at a low to mid-single digit year-on-year organic decline compared to a previous guidance of a low to mid-single digit organic growth. H2 2022 EBIT margin is still expected to show a significant improvement against H1 2022 level  however  lower than expected Q3 organic revenue organic growth has also led to an updated EBIT4 guidance as it carries a direct impact on the operating profitability level.Story continuesParis  5 December 2022 Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 third quarter and nine-month consolidated sales (period ended on 31 October 2022).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  stated: “With strong growth in subscription-related revenue and a very attractive level in Annual Recurring Revenue  we are pleased with the Q3 performance of our Software business as this further confirms the strength of our product offering. The solid performance of our SaaS platform is complemented by a seventh consecutive quarter of resilience for our Mail-Related Solutions  which posted a marginal organic decline. Parcel Locker Solutions  which has been impacted by US projects postponement to 2023 with retailers  remains very dynamic with strong bookings achieved in Q3. Given the more challenging macro environment  it is important to stress the relevance of our offer and the resilience of our recurring business model. All our Solutions enable organizations to achieve significant time and costs savings while providing their customers with a superior experience.

On a reported basis  Group sales went up 5.6% compared to 9M 2021  including a positive currency impact of +6.7% and a negative scope effect of -2.2%. In details  changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic business in the Nordics and the Shipping activities in France (both in June 2022).

Growth in subscription-related revenue remains solid  at +2.9% on an organic basis in the 9M 2022  representing 71% of the Major Operations sales compared to 70% in 9M 2021  a further confirmation of the recurring nature of Quadient’s business model.Sales in North America (59% of Major Operations) were up 3.0% organically  to €442 million. Double digit organic increase from Intelligent Communication Automation as well as organic growth from Mail-Related Solutions with strong hardware sales were the main contributors to this positive performance. Parcel Locker Solutions reported an organic decline in the region due to a combination in the US of weaker installation in the residential market impacted by construction delays  some retail deals being postponed into 2023 and the high comparison basis from the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (36% of Major Operations) were down 3.2% organically to €267 million  mostly driven by a small organic decline in Mail-Related Solutions and  to a lesser extent  by lower revenue from Intelligent Communication Automation software license sales  as the Group continues to shift its business model to SaaS subscriptions. Parcel Locker Solutions benefited from a strong acceleration in organic growth  mostly driven by the ongoing deployment of the recently signed contracts in the region  as well as the initial contribution from the roll-out of the UK open network.Sales from the International segment (5% of Major Operations) were up 5.2% organically to €40 million  with positive contribution from both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation reached €166 million in the 9M 2022  up +12.7% on a reported basis and 5.2% organically. The penetration of the SMB segment accelerated in the quarter  with the Account Payable (AP) and Account Receivable (AR) offer remaining very strong  (up c. 65% compared to Q3 2021)  supported by a good level of cross-selling from Mail-Related Solutions sales organization. Performance was also well oriented in the enterprise segment.Growth in subscription-related revenue continued to be solid at +17.8% organically in Q3 2022 after +16.9% in H1 2022. (+17.2% organically in the 9M 2022). Subscription-related revenue now represents 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 67% in the 9M 2021  further evidence of the successful shift in business model  from license sales to SaaS. Licenses sales were consequently down 43.1% organically in the 9M 2022.Annual recurring revenue reached €179 million at the end of 9M 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 20215 (a 22% annualized organic increase). Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 79% at the end of the 9M 2022 Lastly  professional services were slightly down organically (-2.8%) due to the evolution in product mix.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €518 million in the 9M 2022  up 7.8% on a reported basis and only down -0.4% organically compared to the 9M 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+2.8% organic growth in 9M 2021 compared to 9M 2020). The resilient trend seen in recent quarters continues for Mail-Related Solutions supported by the positive organic contribution from North America  while decline from the Main European countries remained limited.Of note  the strong performance continued in hardware sales (+3.5% organic growth in the 9M 2022) despite the very demanding comparison basis (+17.6% in the 9M 2021) and some supply chain issues which drove delays in product deliveries and led to a high level of backlog at the end of the period (over +20% compared to 9M 2021). Innovation  leading to positive product placement and continuous upgrade of the installed base  as well as the benefit from price increases were the main drivers behind this remarkable performance.Subscription-related revenue (71% of total sales) proved resilient with a limited organic decline of -1.9% in the 9M 2022. This performance was largely explained by the resilience of the installed base and the largely indexed multi-year contracts associated with it  whilst volume-based revenue remain steady.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €65 million in the 9M 2022  a 4.8% increase on a reported basis and a -1.8% organic decline compared to the 9M 2021.Volatility in lockers hardware sales remains high with a -14.2% organic decline in Q3 2022. This follows a strong Q2 up 25.1% on an organic basis and a very weak Q1  down -47.7% organically  due to the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021. Overall  hardware sales were down -18.0% organically in the 9M 2022. The weaker Q3 performance was due to fewer installations in the period  mostly explained by longer lead-time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting the delivery of the lockers. Growth was also impacted by the postponement of some US retail projects to 2023.Subscription-related revenues were up 8.7% organically thanks to the continuous roll-out of existing contracts  especially in Europe with accelerating trends in France and the UK  while the usage rate continues to trend higher  reaching 57% at the end of the period. Subscription-related revenue accounted for 61% of total revenue in the 9M 2022. Total number of installed lockers surpassed 17 300 at the end of the period.Whilst some retail deals in the US are being delayed into 2023  the attractiveness of the business model (automation of the first and last mile delivery) remains unchanged both in terms of cost savings and environmental benefits  as evidenced by the continuous high level of booking leading to a significant increase of over +65% in the backlog at the end of October 2022 compared to a year ago. Two third of this backlog relating to an increased mix of new builds impacted by increased construction lead times versus existing building. Therefore  a catch up in installations is expected in 2023 and 2024.Q4 performance is expected to show a significant year-over-year improvement supported by the deployment of existing contracts and the contribution of recent deals signed.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €45 million in the 9M 2022  up 2.0% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 28.5% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in 2021 and the prorata temporis impact of the divestments of the Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and of the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022. Additional Operations accounted for less than 6% of total sales in the 9M 2022.Q3 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €270 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 8.8% on a reported basis and 1.0% on an organic basis compared to the third quarter of 2021. Subscription-related revenue organic growth in Q3 was up +2.8%  confirming the solid trend seen year-to-date.Major Operations sales stood at €257 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 0.9% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.2% organic growth in the quarter  with positive contribution from both Intelligent Communication Automation growing at a double-digit pace and Mail-Related Solutions posting organic growth. International increased slightly at +0.5% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained -3.5% organic decline mostly due to a weaker contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up 6.3% organically to €58 million  the double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue more than offsetting the still sharp decline in license. Mail-Related Solutions sales remained resilient  at €176 million  only down by -0.6% on an organic basis despite supply chain issues. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €22 million in the third quarter of 2022  a -0.2% organic change compared to Q3 2021  mainly due to longer lead time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting lockers installations. Delays in some retail deals in the US are also having a negative impact on the Solution organic growth in the short term.Additional Operations sales stood at €13 million in the third quarter of 2022  down by -19.4% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 2.7% on an organic basis.STRONG Q4 EXPECTATIONS REITERATED ACROSS SOLUTIONS  NOT FULLY OFFSETTING THE WEAK Q3 US LOCKERS PERFORMANCEOn a reported basis  Group FY 2022 revenue and current EBIT are expected to grow over last year level benefiting from a favourable forex contribution thanks to the Group’s significant and growing US presence.2022 Guidance updated4The Group maintains its expectations for both a strong Q4 performance across Solutions and a step up in profitability in H2 2022 compared to H1 2022 . Intelligent Communication Automation delivered a solid Q3 performance in terms of subscription-related revenue growth and the positive trend is expected to continue  supported by strong Annual Recurring Revenue level. After another solid quarter for Mail-Related Solutions  innovation and new product launches continue to drive solid demand and therefore the Group expects this positive trend to continue in Q4. After a disappointing Q3 for Parcel Locker Solutions in the US  the deployment of existing contracts and the contribution of recent deals are expected to support a return to strong growth. Considering the weaker Q3 from Parcel Lockers and the uncertain level of backlog reduction in Q4  and despite unchanged expectations for a strong Q4 across Solutions  the Group now expects full-year 2022 organic sales growth at over 1% compared to 2% previously.H2 2022 current EBIT2 margin is still expected to show a significant improvement against H1 2022 level thanks toi) further price increases and more favorable supply chain costs comparison basisii) higher profitability from the growing installed base for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  andiii) still high profitability of Mail-Related Solutions.However  lower than expected Q3 organic revenue growth and the impact from salary inflation and investments into new product launches weighing on margins as seen in H1 2022  are leading to a more cautious approach for the operating profitability of the Group. Consequently  Group current EBIT2 is now expected to decline organically year-on-year by a low to mid-single digit  compared to a low to mid-single digit organic growth previously.2021-2023 outlook confirmedThe Group confirmed the 2021-2023 outlook with both sales and current EBIT6 organic growth CAGR over the period i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.Q3 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSYayPay by Quadient Listed a Technology Leader in the 2022 SPARK Matrix for Accounts Receivable ApplicationsOn 26 October 2022  Quadient announced that its cloud-based solution YayPay by Quadient was listed as a 2022 Technology Leader by Quadrant Knowledge Solutions in the SPARK Matrix™ analysis of the global accounts receivable applications market.The 2022 Quadrant Knowledge Solutions SPARK Matrix: Accounts Receivable Applications includes a detailed analysis of global market dynamics  major trends  vendor landscape and competitive positioning.

14222,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valneva-reports-positive-12-month-060000162.html,Valneva Reports Positive 12-Month Antibody Persistence Data for Single-Shot Chikungunya Vaccine Candidate,Primary endpoint met with 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after single-dose vaccinationAntibody levels remained stable from month 6 to month 12No safety...,"VALNEVAPrimary endpoint met with 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after single-dose vaccinationAntibody levels remained stable from month 6 to month 12No safety concern identified during follow-up  confirming the safety profile observed in earlier studiesValneva currently on track to complete rolling submission for Biologics License Application (BLA) with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by end of 2022Saint-Herblain (France)  December 5  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported positive antibody persistence data twelve months after vaccination with a single dose of its chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553.Following positive immunogenicity and safety data for Phase 3 study VLA1553-301 in March 20221  Valneva set up a dedicated antibody persistence trial (VLA1553-303) to monitor a subset of participants for a period of at least five years and confirm the anticipated long-term durability of the antibody response after a single vaccination.The antibody persistence trial enrolled 363 healthy adult participants and followed them from month 6 after vaccination to month 12. 99% of participants retained neutralizing antibody titers above the seroresponse threshold of 1502 12 months after the single-dose vaccination. These antibody levels confirm the antibody persistence profile observed in an earlier study3. The antibody persistence was similar in older adults aged ≥65 years  who retained neutralizing antibody titers comparable to younger adults throughout the follow-up. These results follow completion of the pivotal study VLA1553-301  for which a seroresponse rate of 96% six months after vaccination1 was reported. The study will continue to monitor antibody persistence on an annual basis.No safety concerns were identified for the duration of the follow-up study  confirming the safety profile observed in previous studies.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are excited about these twelve-month data which are in line with what we saw from our previous read out at month 6  and strengthen the possibilities of inducing a long-lasting antibody response with our chikungunya vaccine candidate. We are looking forward to completing the BLA rolling submission to the FDA and potentially to changing people’s lives. If our investigational vaccine is approved  we are confident that it can help address this major  growing and unmet public health threat.”Story continuesValneva expects to finalize its BLA submission with the FDA by the end of 2022. Once completed  and if the FDA accepts the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility along with the action due date upon which it will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in 2023. Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas4 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission5. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  if approved  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20326.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15537. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20198  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 trial VLA1553-303VLA1553-303 is a single-arm  open label Phase 3 trial evaluating antibody persistence in 363 participants aged 18 years or above who were immunized with VLA1553 during the pivotal trial VLA1553-301. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies annually from 1 to 5 years after the single immunization with VLA1553. Study VLA1553-303 collected long-term safety by following-up any Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding study and collecting new-onset SAE. When participants joined the follow-up study  no AESI was ongoing.Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04546724).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The Agency endorsed the strategy of an adaptive design and validated the choice of two dual primary endpoints: the modified Rankin Scale as an ordinal scale in 7 categories from 0 to 6 and the binary endpoint defined as severe disability or death  i.e.  mRS 4-6 (versus mRS 0-3).Other key features of the study design were also endorsed  such as the two futility interim analyses proposed with their go/no go rules  the prespecified analysis in the promising subgroup of patients with thrombectomy and the adaptive reassessment of the sample size at the second futility analysis. Although CHMP recommendations were issued to further detail some analyses  the statistical methodology was therefore endorsed on its general principles.In addition  the CHMP agreed that reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are not requested to support a future MAA  considering glenzocimab profile and safety results on previous nonclinical studies.As reminder  the positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial evaluating glenzocimab in combination with the reference treatment (thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) demonstrated glenzocimab very favorable safety profile by meeting the main criterion of the trial as well as by showing a significant reduction in the number of intracerebral hemorrhages and mortality in the group treated with glenzocimab.Glenzocimab was granted PRIME designation in July 2022  and frequent interactions with the EMA will be planned under the PRIME scheme to optimize the development plan and facilitate quicker access for patients of the drug candidate. To date  the ACTISAVE study has enrolled more than 180 patients. A first futility analysis is planned after 200-300 patients will have been recruited  treated  and monitored for 90 days to confirm safety and ascertain that preliminary results are aligned with the initial trial assumptions.Dr. Yannick PLETAN  Chief Medical Officer of Acticor Biotech comments: “It is presumably the first time that such an adaptive protocol is developed and regulatorily endorsed in acute ischemic stroke. It testifies to the urgent need to develop innovative designs to support the rapid advent of novel solutions to cure that terrible condition. We’re very proud that glenzocimab can benefit from this recognition.”Pr Jean-Marie GROUIN  Expert Statistician  added: “The adaptive design proposed in ACTISAVE study optimizes the chances of proving glenzocimab efficacy for the benefit of patients who suffer from this dramatic condition.”Laurie Jullien  Head of Regulatory Affairs of Acticor Biotech concluded: “This new interaction with the EMA paves the way of a reinforced dialogue to build an efficient development up to the marketing authorization application. We look forward to having additional consultations in 2023 under the PRIME scheme and discuss further our proposed registration strategy. “About ACTISAVEACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients. In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

Subscription-related revenue now represents 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 67% in the 9M 2021  further evidence of the successful shift in business model  from license sales to SaaS. Licenses sales were consequently down 43.1% organically in the 9M 2022.Annual recurring revenue reached €179 million at the end of 9M 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 20215 (a 22% annualized organic increase). Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 79% at the end of the 9M 2022 Lastly  professional services were slightly down organically (-2.8%) due to the evolution in product mix.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €518 million in the 9M 2022  up 7.8% on a reported basis and only down -0.4% organically compared to the 9M 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+2.8% organic growth in 9M 2021 compared to 9M 2020). The resilient trend seen in recent quarters continues for Mail-Related Solutions supported by the positive organic contribution from North America  while decline from the Main European countries remained limited.Of note  the strong performance continued in hardware sales (+3.5% organic growth in the 9M 2022) despite the very demanding comparison basis (+17.6% in the 9M 2021) and some supply chain issues which drove delays in product deliveries and led to a high level of backlog at the end of the period (over +20% compared to 9M 2021). Innovation  leading to positive product placement and continuous upgrade of the installed base  as well as the benefit from price increases were the main drivers behind this remarkable performance.Subscription-related revenue (71% of total sales) proved resilient with a limited organic decline of -1.9% in the 9M 2022. This performance was largely explained by the resilience of the installed base and the largely indexed multi-year contracts associated with it  whilst volume-based revenue remain steady.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €65 million in the 9M 2022  a 4.8% increase on a reported basis and a -1.8% organic decline compared to the 9M 2021.Volatility in lockers hardware sales remains high with a -14.2% organic decline in Q3 2022. This follows a strong Q2 up 25.1% on an organic basis and a very weak Q1  down -47.7% organically  due to the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021. Overall  hardware sales were down -18.0% organically in the 9M 2022. The weaker Q3 performance was due to fewer installations in the period  mostly explained by longer lead-time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting the delivery of the lockers. Growth was also impacted by the postponement of some US retail projects to 2023.Subscription-related revenues were up 8.7% organically thanks to the continuous roll-out of existing contracts  especially in Europe with accelerating trends in France and the UK  while the usage rate continues to trend higher  reaching 57% at the end of the period. Subscription-related revenue accounted for 61% of total revenue in the 9M 2022. Total number of installed lockers surpassed 17 300 at the end of the period.Whilst some retail deals in the US are being delayed into 2023  the attractiveness of the business model (automation of the first and last mile delivery) remains unchanged both in terms of cost savings and environmental benefits  as evidenced by the continuous high level of booking leading to a significant increase of over +65% in the backlog at the end of October 2022 compared to a year ago. Two third of this backlog relating to an increased mix of new builds impacted by increased construction lead times versus existing building. Therefore  a catch up in installations is expected in 2023 and 2024.Q4 performance is expected to show a significant year-over-year improvement supported by the deployment of existing contracts and the contribution of recent deals signed.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €45 million in the 9M 2022  up 2.0% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 28.5% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in 2021 and the prorata temporis impact of the divestments of the Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and of the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022. Additional Operations accounted for less than 6% of total sales in the 9M 2022.Q3 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €270 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 8.8% on a reported basis and 1.0% on an organic basis compared to the third quarter of 2021. Subscription-related revenue organic growth in Q3 was up +2.8%  confirming the solid trend seen year-to-date.Major Operations sales stood at €257 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 0.9% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.2% organic growth in the quarter  with positive contribution from both Intelligent Communication Automation growing at a double-digit pace and Mail-Related Solutions posting organic growth. International increased slightly at +0.5% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained -3.5% organic decline mostly due to a weaker contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up 6.3% organically to €58 million  the double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue more than offsetting the still sharp decline in license. Mail-Related Solutions sales remained resilient  at €176 million  only down by -0.6% on an organic basis despite supply chain issues. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €22 million in the third quarter of 2022  a -0.2% organic change compared to Q3 2021  mainly due to longer lead time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting lockers installations. Delays in some retail deals in the US are also having a negative impact on the Solution organic growth in the short term.Additional Operations sales stood at €13 million in the third quarter of 2022  down by -19.4% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 2.7% on an organic basis.STRONG Q4 EXPECTATIONS REITERATED ACROSS SOLUTIONS  NOT FULLY OFFSETTING THE WEAK Q3 US LOCKERS PERFORMANCEOn a reported basis  Group FY 2022 revenue and current EBIT are expected to grow over last year level benefiting from a favourable forex contribution thanks to the Group’s significant and growing US presence.2022 Guidance updated4The Group maintains its expectations for both a strong Q4 performance across Solutions and a step up in profitability in H2 2022 compared to H1 2022 .

14240,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/12/05/irelands-top-firms-focusing-more-on-esg-issues/,Ireland’s top firms focusing more on ESG issues,Spencer Stuart report shows ESG increasingly important for listed firms,Ireland’s biggest companies are increasingly prioritising environmental  social and governance (ESG) issues  recognising it as a key performance indicator  a new study has indicated.According to US recruitment firm Spencer Stuart  some 40 per cent of top Iseq-listed companies now have specifically dedicated ESG or sustainability committees.The 2022 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index analyses board governance practices in the Iseq 20 index  which comprises the 20 largest companies trading on the Euronext Dublin exchange by trading volume and market capitalisation.It found that 50 per cent of Iseq 20 companies now included ESG metrics in remuneration policies for executive directors  while a further 15 per cent of companies have indicated they would be revising their policies to include ESG metrics by the end of this year.READ MOREThe study also found that two-thirds of these companies now have an executive specifically dedicated to leading sustainability. Of the eight boards with an ESG or sustainability committee  five were newly-established in 2021 or early 2022.“While ESG has been an established part of the board agenda for a while  the year-on-year changes in the data reflect a significant growth in the efforts being made to address ESG  and specifically sustainability at a board level ” said Spencer Stuart’s managing partner Ruth Curran.“Critically  we’re seeing that awareness and understanding of sustainability issues is now a core competency for boards ” she said.“ Companies are bringing fresh talent into both their executive and non-executive director roles and linking executive remuneration to delivery in this area. This is a trend we expect to continue in the coming years. This will be critical to delivering genuine ESG impact.”The report also highlighted an increase in the appointment of new directors  reflecting what it described as “the refresh in board approaches in the past 12 months”. It said 85 per cent of Iseq 20 companies appointed at least one new director to the board during the survey period  a notable increase from the 55 per cent of boards recording a new director a year earlier.In terms of broader board diversification  the proportion of women directors across the Iseq 20 rose by 10 per cent from last year. Women  it said  now represented 33 per cent of all board members  with each board in the Iseq 20 having at least one woman  and 55 per cent of boards having at least 30 per cent women.,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,neutral,0.05,0.92,0.03,True,English,"['top firms', 'ESG issues', 'Ireland', '2022 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index', 'key performance indicator', 'US recruitment firm', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'broader board diversification', 'top Iseq-listed companies', 'genuine ESG impact', 'executive director roles', 'one new director', 'board governance practices', '30 per cent women', 'Iseq 20 index', 'one woman', 'board agenda', 'board level', 'board approaches', 'board members', '40 per cent', '50 per cent', '15 per cent', 'new directors', '85 per cent', '55 per cent', '33 per cent', 'trading volume', 'market capitalisation', 'established part', 'significant growth', 'managing partner', 'Ruth Curran', 'core competency', 'fresh talent', 'coming years', 'past 12 months', 'survey period', 'women directors', 'executive directors', 'executive remuneration', 'biggest companies', 'new study', '20 largest companies', 'year changes', 'last year', 'ESG) issues', 'ESG metrics', 'sustainability committees', 'sustainability issues', 'remuneration policies', 'notable increase', 'Iseq 20 companies', 'eight boards', 'social', 'The', 'READ', 'two-thirds', 'data', 'efforts', 'awareness', 'understanding', 'delivery', 'area', 'trend', 'report', 'appointment', 'refresh', 'terms', 'proportion', '10']",2022-12-05,2022-12-05,irishtimes.com

Once PE has its claws into a football club it will invest for eventual sale.,Normally  at this time of the year  football talk is all about high-profile transfers as clubs seek to secure their place in the top divisions  or bolster Champions League prospects.The Qatar World Cup  a shop window for the globe's best players  has changed this dynamic. Instead of player deals  it is the leading European clubs exciting financial interest. Both Manchester United and Liverpool notionally are up for sale.The share register of Britain's most successful club  Manchester City  is also reshaping. On the Continent  big changes look to be afoot at Paris Saint-Germain  Juventus is embroiled in an accounting scandal and could be up for sale and Barcelona has mortgaged future earnings to private equity (PE).Own goal: Once private equity has its claws into a football club it will invest for eventual saleSports franchises will never quite be like other businesses. Huge investment is required in a concentrated pool of human capital in the shape of the players. Values are distorted by the desire of wealthy individuals for trophy assets. Nevertheless  there is a creeping financialisation in train.Manchester United and Juventus are both public companies  quoted on the Nasdaq in New York and Euronext respectively  even though the majority of shares are controlled by powerful families. That means they are meant to play by the rules of those markets  which explains last month's resignation of most of the Juventus board.The biggest change is the growing involvement of PE. The barbarians are at the gate. Todd Boehley  owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers  secured control of Chelsea with backing from Clearlake Capital. At Liverpool  RedBird Capital Partners has already acquired a minority stake in a club controlled by John Henry's Fenway Sports Group.Henry now wants to cash in  which may mean further PE ownership. RedBird also paid £1billion for control of AC Milan.If you thought that Manchester City is safely in the hands of the rulers of Abu Dhabi  think again. It has just let American private equity in with Silicon Valley outfit Silver Lake scooping up an 18 per cent stake sold by China Media Group.PE has enormous sums to invest. Contrary to what Barcelona and Real Madrid (which has taken on £317m of financing from Sixth Street Capital) may think  it is seldom a benign owner.The objective is to install its own management  identify new streams of income  cut costs and sell the enterprise quickly.The most stunning example of private equity ownership in sport was the stewardship of CVC at Formula 1. It bought the franchise from Bernie Ecclestone  invested heavily in digital transformation and emerged clutching a £3.75billion profit when it sold on to John Malone's Liberty Media.Once PE has its claws into a football club it will invest for eventual sale. PSG  for instance  might get the new stadium it requires but would have to pawn branding  digital rights and streaming.There should be no doubt as to what the ultimate goals of PE are in football. It would favour the American closed-league model  where it can control every aspect of the enterprise from player remuneration to the number of games played.Anyone who thought the European Super League is dead  think again.
