Holders of ordinary shares who have validly submitted US dollars  euros or pounds sterling currency elections by November 25  2022 will be entitled to a dividend of US$0.25  €0.2398 or 20.61p per ordinary share  respectively.Absent any valid election to the contrary  persons holding their ordinary shares through Euroclear Nederland will receive their dividends in euros at the euro rate per ordinary share shown above. Absent any valid election to the contrary  shareholders (both holding in certificated and uncertificated form (CREST members)) and persons holding their shares through the Shell Corporate Nominee will receive their dividends in pounds sterling  at the pound sterling rate per ordinary share shown above.Euro and pounds sterling dividends payable in cash have been converted from US dollars based on an average of market exchange rates over the three dealing days from November 30 to December 2  2022. This dividend will be payable on December 19  2022 to those members whose names were on the Register of Members on November 11  2022.Taxation - cash dividendWith Shell’s tax residence moved to the UK  dividends paid to shareholders on their ordinary shares will not attract Dutch dividend withholding tax. This means that holders of the former A shares receive their dividends in full as Dutch dividend withholding tax is no longer withheld on these dividends. Holders of the former B shares receive their dividends directly from Shell as these dividends will no longer be paid through the Dividend Access Mechanism.Story continuesIf you are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividends you should consult your tax advisor.NoteA different currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately holding through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker  financial intermediary  bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.EnquiriesShell Media RelationsInternational +44 (0) 207 934 5550Americas +1 832 337 4355CAUTIONARY NOTEThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  December 5  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

These antibody levels confirm the antibody persistence profile observed in an earlier study3. The antibody persistence was similar in older adults aged ≥65 years  who retained neutralizing antibody titers comparable to younger adults throughout the follow-up. These results follow completion of the pivotal study VLA1553-301  for which a seroresponse rate of 96% six months after vaccination1 was reported. The study will continue to monitor antibody persistence on an annual basis.No safety concerns were identified for the duration of the follow-up study  confirming the safety profile observed in previous studies.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are excited about these twelve-month data which are in line with what we saw from our previous read out at month 6  and strengthen the possibilities of inducing a long-lasting antibody response with our chikungunya vaccine candidate. We are looking forward to completing the BLA rolling submission to the FDA and potentially to changing people’s lives. If our investigational vaccine is approved  we are confident that it can help address this major  growing and unmet public health threat.”Valneva expects to finalize its BLA submission with the FDA by the end of 2022. Once completed  and if the FDA accepts the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility along with the action due date upon which it will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in 2023. Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas4 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission5. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  if approved  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20326.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15537. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20198  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 trial VLA1553-303VLA1553-303 is a single-arm  open label Phase 3 trial evaluating antibody persistence in 363 participants aged 18 years or above who were immunized with VLA1553 during the pivotal trial VLA1553-301. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies annually from 1 to 5 years after the single immunization with VLA1553. Study VLA1553-303 collected long-term safety by following-up any Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding study and collecting new-onset SAE. When participants joined the follow-up study  no AESI was ongoing.Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04546724).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to commercialize three vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease and the chikungunya virus.Media & Investors ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  PhDVP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development  clinical trials  and regulatory review of VLA1553.

Whilst the Group maintains its expectations for a strong Q4 performance across Solutions  a weaker Q3 from Parcel Lockers and the uncertain level of backlog reduction in Q4 (backlog level is up over +40% compared to 9M 2021) have led to a cautious approach to the full year outlook.FY 2022 current EBIT2 guidance4 is now expected at a low to mid-single digit year-on-year organic decline compared to a previous guidance of a low to mid-single digit organic growth. H2 2022 EBIT margin is still expected to show a significant improvement against H1 2022 level  however  lower than expected Q3 organic revenue organic growth has also led to an updated EBIT4 guidance as it carries a direct impact on the operating profitability level.Story continuesParis  5 December 2022 Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 third quarter and nine-month consolidated sales (period ended on 31 October 2022).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  stated: “With strong growth in subscription-related revenue and a very attractive level in Annual Recurring Revenue  we are pleased with the Q3 performance of our Software business as this further confirms the strength of our product offering. The solid performance of our SaaS platform is complemented by a seventh consecutive quarter of resilience for our Mail-Related Solutions  which posted a marginal organic decline. Parcel Locker Solutions  which has been impacted by US projects postponement to 2023 with retailers  remains very dynamic with strong bookings achieved in Q3. Given the more challenging macro environment  it is important to stress the relevance of our offer and the resilience of our recurring business model. All our Solutions enable organizations to achieve significant time and costs savings while providing their customers with a superior experience. I am proud of the integrated and balanced portfolio of solutions we have built and confident in our ability to deliver a strong level of organic growth in Q4.”SOLID GROWTH ON A REPORTED BASIS  ORGANIC TREND IN LINE WITH H1Group sales stood at €793 million in the 9M 2022. On a reported basis  Group sales went up 5.6% compared to 9M 2021  including a positive currency impact of +6.7% and a negative scope effect of -2.2%. In details  changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic business in the Nordics and the Shipping activities in France (both in June 2022). Group sales were up 0.8% organic basis in the 9M 2022.Consolidated salesIn € million 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 749 689 +8.6% +0.7% Intelligent Communication Automation 166 147 +12.7% +5.2% Mail-Related Solutions 518 481 +7.8% (0.4)% Parcel Locker Solutions 65 62 +4.8% (1.8)% Additional Operations 45 62 (28.5)% +2.0% Group total 793 752 +5.6% +0.8%In € million 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change Organic change(1) Major Operations 749 689 +8.6% +0.7% North America 442 378 +17.0% +3.0% Main European countries(a) 267 274 (2.5)% (3.2)% International(b) 40 38 +5.7% +5.2% Additional Operations 45 62 (28.5)% +2.0% Group total 793 752 +5.6% +0.8% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan and of Intelligent Communication Automation outside of North America and the Main European countries.Major OperationsSales from Major Operations reached €749 million (94% of total sales) in the 9M 2022  an 8.6% increase on a reported basis and a 0.7% year-over-year organic growth  which represents a small improvement compared to H1 2022. Growth in subscription-related revenue remains solid  at +2.9% on an organic basis in the 9M 2022  representing 71% of the Major Operations sales compared to 70% in 9M 2021  a further confirmation of the recurring nature of Quadient’s business model.Sales in North America (59% of Major Operations) were up 3.0% organically  to €442 million. Double digit organic increase from Intelligent Communication Automation as well as organic growth from Mail-Related Solutions with strong hardware sales were the main contributors to this positive performance. Parcel Locker Solutions reported an organic decline in the region due to a combination in the US of weaker installation in the residential market impacted by construction delays  some retail deals being postponed into 2023 and the high comparison basis from the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (36% of Major Operations) were down 3.2% organically to €267 million  mostly driven by a small organic decline in Mail-Related Solutions and  to a lesser extent  by lower revenue from Intelligent Communication Automation software license sales  as the Group continues to shift its business model to SaaS subscriptions. Parcel Locker Solutions benefited from a strong acceleration in organic growth  mostly driven by the ongoing deployment of the recently signed contracts in the region  as well as the initial contribution from the roll-out of the UK open network.Sales from the International segment (5% of Major Operations) were up 5.2% organically to €40 million  with positive contribution from both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation reached €166 million in the 9M 2022  up +12.7% on a reported basis and 5.2% organically. The penetration of the SMB segment accelerated in the quarter  with the Account Payable (AP) and Account Receivable (AR) offer remaining very strong  (up c. 65% compared to Q3 2021)  supported by a good level of cross-selling from Mail-Related Solutions sales organization. Performance was also well oriented in the enterprise segment.Growth in subscription-related revenue continued to be solid at +17.8% organically in Q3 2022 after +16.9% in H1 2022. (+17.2% organically in the 9M 2022). Subscription-related revenue now represents 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 67% in the 9M 2021  further evidence of the successful shift in business model  from license sales to SaaS. Licenses sales were consequently down 43.1% organically in the 9M 2022.Annual recurring revenue reached €179 million at the end of 9M 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 20215 (a 22% annualized organic increase). Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 79% at the end of the 9M 2022 Lastly  professional services were slightly down organically (-2.8%) due to the evolution in product mix.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €518 million in the 9M 2022  up 7.8% on a reported basis and only down -0.4% organically compared to the 9M 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+2.8% organic growth in 9M 2021 compared to 9M 2020). The resilient trend seen in recent quarters continues for Mail-Related Solutions supported by the positive organic contribution from North America  while decline from the Main European countries remained limited.Of note  the strong performance continued in hardware sales (+3.5% organic growth in the 9M 2022) despite the very demanding comparison basis (+17.6% in the 9M 2021) and some supply chain issues which drove delays in product deliveries and led to a high level of backlog at the end of the period (over +20% compared to 9M 2021). Innovation  leading to positive product placement and continuous upgrade of the installed base  as well as the benefit from price increases were the main drivers behind this remarkable performance.Subscription-related revenue (71% of total sales) proved resilient with a limited organic decline of -1.9% in the 9M 2022. This performance was largely explained by the resilience of the installed base and the largely indexed multi-year contracts associated with it  whilst volume-based revenue remain steady.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €65 million in the 9M 2022  a 4.8% increase on a reported basis and a -1.8% organic decline compared to the 9M 2021.Volatility in lockers hardware sales remains high with a -14.2% organic decline in Q3 2022. This follows a strong Q2 up 25.1% on an organic basis and a very weak Q1  down -47.7% organically  due to the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021. Overall  hardware sales were down -18.0% organically in the 9M 2022. The weaker Q3 performance was due to fewer installations in the period  mostly explained by longer lead-time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting the delivery of the lockers. Growth was also impacted by the postponement of some US retail projects to 2023.Subscription-related revenues were up 8.7% organically thanks to the continuous roll-out of existing contracts  especially in Europe with accelerating trends in France and the UK  while the usage rate continues to trend higher  reaching 57% at the end of the period. Subscription-related revenue accounted for 61% of total revenue in the 9M 2022. Total number of installed lockers surpassed 17 300 at the end of the period.Whilst some retail deals in the US are being delayed into 2023  the attractiveness of the business model (automation of the first and last mile delivery) remains unchanged both in terms of cost savings and environmental benefits  as evidenced by the continuous high level of booking leading to a significant increase of over +65% in the backlog at the end of October 2022 compared to a year ago. Two third of this backlog relating to an increased mix of new builds impacted by increased construction lead times versus existing building. Therefore  a catch up in installations is expected in 2023 and 2024.Q4 performance is expected to show a significant year-over-year improvement supported by the deployment of existing contracts and the contribution of recent deals signed.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €45 million in the 9M 2022  up 2.0% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 28.5% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in 2021 and the prorata temporis impact of the divestments of the Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and of the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022. Additional Operations accounted for less than 6% of total sales in the 9M 2022.Q3 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €270 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 8.8% on a reported basis and 1.0% on an organic basis compared to the third quarter of 2021. Subscription-related revenue organic growth in Q3 was up +2.8%  confirming the solid trend seen year-to-date.Major Operations sales stood at €257 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 0.9% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.2% organic growth in the quarter  with positive contribution from both Intelligent Communication Automation growing at a double-digit pace and Mail-Related Solutions posting organic growth. International increased slightly at +0.5% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained -3.5% organic decline mostly due to a weaker contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up 6.3% organically to €58 million  the double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue more than offsetting the still sharp decline in license. Mail-Related Solutions sales remained resilient  at €176 million  only down by -0.6% on an organic basis despite supply chain issues. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €22 million in the third quarter of 2022  a -0.2% organic change compared to Q3 2021  mainly due to longer lead time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting lockers installations. Delays in some retail deals in the US are also having a negative impact on the Solution organic growth in the short term.Additional Operations sales stood at €13 million in the third quarter of 2022  down by -19.4% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 2.7% on an organic basis.STRONG Q4 EXPECTATIONS REITERATED ACROSS SOLUTIONS  NOT FULLY OFFSETTING THE WEAK Q3 US LOCKERS PERFORMANCEOn a reported basis  Group FY 2022 revenue and current EBIT are expected to grow over last year level benefiting from a favourable forex contribution thanks to the Group’s significant and growing US presence.2022 Guidance updated4The Group maintains its expectations for both a strong Q4 performance across Solutions and a step up in profitability in H2 2022 compared to H1 2022 . Intelligent Communication Automation delivered a solid Q3 performance in terms of subscription-related revenue growth and the positive trend is expected to continue  supported by strong Annual Recurring Revenue level. After another solid quarter for Mail-Related Solutions  innovation and new product launches continue to drive solid demand and therefore the Group expects this positive trend to continue in Q4. After a disappointing Q3 for Parcel Locker Solutions in the US  the deployment of existing contracts and the contribution of recent deals are expected to support a return to strong growth. Considering the weaker Q3 from Parcel Lockers and the uncertain level of backlog reduction in Q4  and despite unchanged expectations for a strong Q4 across Solutions  the Group now expects full-year 2022 organic sales growth at over 1% compared to 2% previously.H2 2022 current EBIT2 margin is still expected to show a significant improvement against H1 2022 level thanks toi) further price increases and more favorable supply chain costs comparison basisii) higher profitability from the growing installed base for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  andiii) still high profitability of Mail-Related Solutions.However  lower than expected Q3 organic revenue growth and the impact from salary inflation and investments into new product launches weighing on margins as seen in H1 2022  are leading to a more cautious approach for the operating profitability of the Group. Consequently  Group current EBIT2 is now expected to decline organically year-on-year by a low to mid-single digit  compared to a low to mid-single digit organic growth previously.2021-2023 outlook confirmedThe Group confirmed the 2021-2023 outlook with both sales and current EBIT6 organic growth CAGR over the period i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.Q3 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSYayPay by Quadient Listed a Technology Leader in the 2022 SPARK Matrix for Accounts Receivable ApplicationsOn 26 October 2022  Quadient announced that its cloud-based solution YayPay by Quadient was listed as a 2022 Technology Leader by Quadrant Knowledge Solutions in the SPARK Matrix™ analysis of the global accounts receivable applications market.The 2022 Quadrant Knowledge Solutions SPARK Matrix: Accounts Receivable Applications includes a detailed analysis of global market dynamics  major trends  vendor landscape and competitive positioning.

14222,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valneva-reports-positive-12-month-060000162.html,Valneva Reports Positive 12-Month Antibody Persistence Data for Single-Shot Chikungunya Vaccine Candidate,Primary endpoint met with 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after single-dose vaccinationAntibody levels remained stable from month 6 to month 12No safety...,"VALNEVAPrimary endpoint met with 99% seroresponse rate 12 months after single-dose vaccinationAntibody levels remained stable from month 6 to month 12No safety concern identified during follow-up  confirming the safety profile observed in earlier studiesValneva currently on track to complete rolling submission for Biologics License Application (BLA) with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by end of 2022Saint-Herblain (France)  December 5  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported positive antibody persistence data twelve months after vaccination with a single dose of its chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553.Following positive immunogenicity and safety data for Phase 3 study VLA1553-301 in March 20221  Valneva set up a dedicated antibody persistence trial (VLA1553-303) to monitor a subset of participants for a period of at least five years and confirm the anticipated long-term durability of the antibody response after a single vaccination.The antibody persistence trial enrolled 363 healthy adult participants and followed them from month 6 after vaccination to month 12. 99% of participants retained neutralizing antibody titers above the seroresponse threshold of 1502 12 months after the single-dose vaccination. These antibody levels confirm the antibody persistence profile observed in an earlier study3. The antibody persistence was similar in older adults aged ≥65 years  who retained neutralizing antibody titers comparable to younger adults throughout the follow-up. These results follow completion of the pivotal study VLA1553-301  for which a seroresponse rate of 96% six months after vaccination1 was reported. The study will continue to monitor antibody persistence on an annual basis.No safety concerns were identified for the duration of the follow-up study  confirming the safety profile observed in previous studies.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are excited about these twelve-month data which are in line with what we saw from our previous read out at month 6  and strengthen the possibilities of inducing a long-lasting antibody response with our chikungunya vaccine candidate. We are looking forward to completing the BLA rolling submission to the FDA and potentially to changing people’s lives. If our investigational vaccine is approved  we are confident that it can help address this major  growing and unmet public health threat.”Story continuesValneva expects to finalize its BLA submission with the FDA by the end of 2022. Once completed  and if the FDA accepts the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility along with the action due date upon which it will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in 2023. Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan to support the label extension in this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas4 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after three to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. It is estimated that over three quarters of the world’s population live in areas at-risk of CHIKV transmission5. High risk areas of infection are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are currently endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 100 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  if approved  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20326.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15537. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20198  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 trial VLA1553-303VLA1553-303 is a single-arm  open label Phase 3 trial evaluating antibody persistence in 363 participants aged 18 years or above who were immunized with VLA1553 during the pivotal trial VLA1553-301. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies annually from 1 to 5 years after the single immunization with VLA1553. Study VLA1553-303 collected long-term safety by following-up any Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) from the preceding study and collecting new-onset SAE. When participants joined the follow-up study  no AESI was ongoing.Additional information  including a detailed description of the trial design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04546724).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The Agency endorsed the strategy of an adaptive design and validated the choice of two dual primary endpoints: the modified Rankin Scale as an ordinal scale in 7 categories from 0 to 6 and the binary endpoint defined as severe disability or death  i.e.  mRS 4-6 (versus mRS 0-3).Other key features of the study design were also endorsed  such as the two futility interim analyses proposed with their go/no go rules  the prespecified analysis in the promising subgroup of patients with thrombectomy and the adaptive reassessment of the sample size at the second futility analysis. Although CHMP recommendations were issued to further detail some analyses  the statistical methodology was therefore endorsed on its general principles.In addition  the CHMP agreed that reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are not requested to support a future MAA  considering glenzocimab profile and safety results on previous nonclinical studies.As reminder  the positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial evaluating glenzocimab in combination with the reference treatment (thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) demonstrated glenzocimab very favorable safety profile by meeting the main criterion of the trial as well as by showing a significant reduction in the number of intracerebral hemorrhages and mortality in the group treated with glenzocimab.Glenzocimab was granted PRIME designation in July 2022  and frequent interactions with the EMA will be planned under the PRIME scheme to optimize the development plan and facilitate quicker access for patients of the drug candidate. To date  the ACTISAVE study has enrolled more than 180 patients. A first futility analysis is planned after 200-300 patients will have been recruited  treated  and monitored for 90 days to confirm safety and ascertain that preliminary results are aligned with the initial trial assumptions.Dr. Yannick PLETAN  Chief Medical Officer of Acticor Biotech comments: “It is presumably the first time that such an adaptive protocol is developed and regulatorily endorsed in acute ischemic stroke. It testifies to the urgent need to develop innovative designs to support the rapid advent of novel solutions to cure that terrible condition. We’re very proud that glenzocimab can benefit from this recognition.”Pr Jean-Marie GROUIN  Expert Statistician  added: “The adaptive design proposed in ACTISAVE study optimizes the chances of proving glenzocimab efficacy for the benefit of patients who suffer from this dramatic condition.”Laurie Jullien  Head of Regulatory Affairs of Acticor Biotech concluded: “This new interaction with the EMA paves the way of a reinforced dialogue to build an efficient development up to the marketing authorization application. We look forward to having additional consultations in 2023 under the PRIME scheme and discuss further our proposed registration strategy. “About ACTISAVEACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients. In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

Double digit organic increase from Intelligent Communication Automation as well as organic growth from Mail-Related Solutions with strong hardware sales were the main contributors to this positive performance. Parcel Locker Solutions reported an organic decline in the region due to a combination in the US of weaker installation in the residential market impacted by construction delays  some retail deals being postponed into 2023 and the high comparison basis from the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (36% of Major Operations) were down 3.2% organically to €267 million  mostly driven by a small organic decline in Mail-Related Solutions and  to a lesser extent  by lower revenue from Intelligent Communication Automation software license sales  as the Group continues to shift its business model to SaaS subscriptions. Parcel Locker Solutions benefited from a strong acceleration in organic growth  mostly driven by the ongoing deployment of the recently signed contracts in the region  as well as the initial contribution from the roll-out of the UK open network.Sales from the International segment (5% of Major Operations) were up 5.2% organically to €40 million  with positive contribution from both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation reached €166 million in the 9M 2022  up +12.7% on a reported basis and 5.2% organically. The penetration of the SMB segment accelerated in the quarter  with the Account Payable (AP) and Account Receivable (AR) offer remaining very strong  (up c. 65% compared to Q3 2021)  supported by a good level of cross-selling from Mail-Related Solutions sales organization. Performance was also well oriented in the enterprise segment.Growth in subscription-related revenue continued to be solid at +17.8% organically in Q3 2022 after +16.9% in H1 2022. (+17.2% organically in the 9M 2022). Subscription-related revenue now represents 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 67% in the 9M 2021  further evidence of the successful shift in business model  from license sales to SaaS. Licenses sales were consequently down 43.1% organically in the 9M 2022.Annual recurring revenue reached €179 million at the end of 9M 2022  up from €145 million at the end of 20215 (a 22% annualized organic increase). Also illustrating the shift in revenue model  the share of SaaS customers reached 79% at the end of the 9M 2022 Lastly  professional services were slightly down organically (-2.8%) due to the evolution in product mix.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales stood at €518 million in the 9M 2022  up 7.8% on a reported basis and only down -0.4% organically compared to the 9M 2021 despite a relatively high comparison basis (+2.8% organic growth in 9M 2021 compared to 9M 2020). The resilient trend seen in recent quarters continues for Mail-Related Solutions supported by the positive organic contribution from North America  while decline from the Main European countries remained limited.Of note  the strong performance continued in hardware sales (+3.5% organic growth in the 9M 2022) despite the very demanding comparison basis (+17.6% in the 9M 2021) and some supply chain issues which drove delays in product deliveries and led to a high level of backlog at the end of the period (over +20% compared to 9M 2021). Innovation  leading to positive product placement and continuous upgrade of the installed base  as well as the benefit from price increases were the main drivers behind this remarkable performance.Subscription-related revenue (71% of total sales) proved resilient with a limited organic decline of -1.9% in the 9M 2022. This performance was largely explained by the resilience of the installed base and the largely indexed multi-year contracts associated with it  whilst volume-based revenue remain steady.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €65 million in the 9M 2022  a 4.8% increase on a reported basis and a -1.8% organic decline compared to the 9M 2021.Volatility in lockers hardware sales remains high with a -14.2% organic decline in Q3 2022. This follows a strong Q2 up 25.1% on an organic basis and a very weak Q1  down -47.7% organically  due to the high comparison base linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021. Overall  hardware sales were down -18.0% organically in the 9M 2022. The weaker Q3 performance was due to fewer installations in the period  mostly explained by longer lead-time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting the delivery of the lockers. Growth was also impacted by the postponement of some US retail projects to 2023.Subscription-related revenues were up 8.7% organically thanks to the continuous roll-out of existing contracts  especially in Europe with accelerating trends in France and the UK  while the usage rate continues to trend higher  reaching 57% at the end of the period. Subscription-related revenue accounted for 61% of total revenue in the 9M 2022. Total number of installed lockers surpassed 17 300 at the end of the period.Whilst some retail deals in the US are being delayed into 2023  the attractiveness of the business model (automation of the first and last mile delivery) remains unchanged both in terms of cost savings and environmental benefits  as evidenced by the continuous high level of booking leading to a significant increase of over +65% in the backlog at the end of October 2022 compared to a year ago. Two third of this backlog relating to an increased mix of new builds impacted by increased construction lead times versus existing building. Therefore  a catch up in installations is expected in 2023 and 2024.Q4 performance is expected to show a significant year-over-year improvement supported by the deployment of existing contracts and the contribution of recent deals signed.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €45 million in the 9M 2022  up 2.0% year-over-year on an organic basis but down 28.5% on a reported basis. This decline is mainly due to the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in 2021 and the prorata temporis impact of the divestments of the Graphics activities in the Nordic countries and of the Shipping Solutions which both took place in June 2022. Additional Operations accounted for less than 6% of total sales in the 9M 2022.Q3 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €270 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 8.8% on a reported basis and 1.0% on an organic basis compared to the third quarter of 2021. Subscription-related revenue organic growth in Q3 was up +2.8%  confirming the solid trend seen year-to-date.Major Operations sales stood at €257 million in the third quarter of 2022  up 0.9% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. North America enjoyed a solid 4.2% organic growth in the quarter  with positive contribution from both Intelligent Communication Automation growing at a double-digit pace and Mail-Related Solutions posting organic growth. International increased slightly at +0.5% organically while Main European Countries posted a contained -3.5% organic decline mostly due to a weaker contribution from Mail-Related Solutions.Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up 6.3% organically to €58 million  the double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue more than offsetting the still sharp decline in license. Mail-Related Solutions sales remained resilient  at €176 million  only down by -0.6% on an organic basis despite supply chain issues. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €22 million in the third quarter of 2022  a -0.2% organic change compared to Q3 2021  mainly due to longer lead time for new constructions in the residential sector in the US impacting lockers installations. Delays in some retail deals in the US are also having a negative impact on the Solution organic growth in the short term.Additional Operations sales stood at €13 million in the third quarter of 2022  down by -19.4% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 2.7% on an organic basis.STRONG Q4 EXPECTATIONS REITERATED ACROSS SOLUTIONS  NOT FULLY OFFSETTING THE WEAK Q3 US LOCKERS PERFORMANCEOn a reported basis  Group FY 2022 revenue and current EBIT are expected to grow over last year level benefiting from a favourable forex contribution thanks to the Group’s significant and growing US presence.2022 Guidance updated4The Group maintains its expectations for both a strong Q4 performance across Solutions and a step up in profitability in H2 2022 compared to H1 2022 . Intelligent Communication Automation delivered a solid Q3 performance in terms of subscription-related revenue growth and the positive trend is expected to continue  supported by strong Annual Recurring Revenue level. After another solid quarter for Mail-Related Solutions  innovation and new product launches continue to drive solid demand and therefore the Group expects this positive trend to continue in Q4. After a disappointing Q3 for Parcel Locker Solutions in the US  the deployment of existing contracts and the contribution of recent deals are expected to support a return to strong growth. Considering the weaker Q3 from Parcel Lockers and the uncertain level of backlog reduction in Q4  and despite unchanged expectations for a strong Q4 across Solutions  the Group now expects full-year 2022 organic sales growth at over 1% compared to 2% previously.and a .

Of the eight boards with an ESG or sustainability committee  five were newly-established in 2021 or early 2022.“While ESG has been an established part of the board agenda for a while  the year-on-year changes in the data reflect a significant growth in the efforts being made to address ESG  and specifically sustainability at a board level ” said Spencer Stuart’s managing partner Ruth Curran.“Critically  we’re seeing that awareness and understanding of sustainability issues is now a core competency for boards ” she said.“ Companies are bringing fresh talent into both their executive and non-executive director roles and linking executive remuneration to delivery in this area. This is a trend we expect to continue in the coming years. This will be critical to delivering genuine ESG impact.”The report also highlighted an increase in the appointment of new directors  reflecting what it described as “the refresh in board approaches in the past 12 months”. It said 85 per cent of Iseq 20 companies appointed at least one new director to the board during the survey period  a notable increase from the 55 per cent of boards recording a new director a year earlier.In terms of broader board diversification  the proportion of women directors across the Iseq 20 rose by 10 per cent from last year. Women  it said  now represented 33 per cent of all board members  with each board in the Iseq 20 having at least one woman  and 55 per cent of boards having at least 30 per cent women.,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,neutral,0.05,0.92,0.03,True,English,"['top firms', 'ESG issues', 'Ireland', '2022 Ireland Spencer Stuart Board Index', 'key performance indicator', 'US recruitment firm', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'broader board diversification', 'top Iseq-listed companies', 'genuine ESG impact', 'executive director roles', 'one new director', 'board governance practices', '30 per cent women', 'Iseq 20 index', 'one woman', 'board agenda', 'board level', 'board approaches', 'board members', '40 per cent', '50 per cent', '15 per cent', 'new directors', '85 per cent', '55 per cent', '33 per cent', 'trading volume', 'market capitalisation', 'established part', 'significant growth', 'managing partner', 'Ruth Curran', 'core competency', 'fresh talent', 'coming years', 'past 12 months', 'survey period', 'women directors', 'executive directors', 'executive remuneration', 'biggest companies', 'new study', '20 largest companies', 'year changes', 'last year', 'ESG) issues', 'ESG metrics', 'sustainability committees', 'sustainability issues', 'remuneration policies', 'notable increase', 'Iseq 20 companies', 'eight boards', 'social', 'The', 'READ', 'two-thirds', 'data', 'efforts', 'awareness', 'understanding', 'delivery', 'area', 'trend', 'report', 'appointment', 'refresh', 'terms', 'proportion', '10']",2022-12-05,2022-12-06,irishtimes.com

(""Touchstone"" or the ""Company"") (TSX:TXP)(LSE:TXP) announces that the Company launched a private placement in Canada (the ""Canadian Private Placement"") at 5 p.m. EST on December 5  2022 to raise a minimum of C$7.5 million (approximately US$5.5 million and £4.5 million) up to a maximum of C$10 million (approximately US$7.4 million and £6.1 million) at a price of C$0.90 (approximately 54.5 pence) per Common Share (as defined below) of no par value (the ""Canadian Placement Shares"").Touchstone Exploration  Inc.   Tuesday  December 6  2022  Press release pictureThe Company further announces a proposed placing in the UK (the ""UK Placing"") to raise approximately US$5.5 million (approximately £4.5 million and C$7.4 million) through the issue of Common Shares (as defined below) of no par value (the ""UK Placing Shares"") with institutional and other investors in the United Kingdom at a price of 54.5 pence per UK Placing Share (approximately C$0.90) (the ""Placing Price"").Story continuesThe Canadian Private Placement and the UK Placing (collectively  the ""Fundraise"") are expected to raise aggregate gross proceeds of between US$11 million (approximately £9 million and C$14.9 million) and US$13 million (approximately £10.6 million and C$17.5 million) to allow Touchstone to accelerate its Ortoire exploration and development program.In the event of excess demand  the Company reserves the right to increase the size of the UK Placing and/or the Placing Price. The UK Placing is being completed by way of an accelerated book building process (the ""Bookbuild"") and UK Placees (as defined below) will be subscribing for Common Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement. Shore Capital and Canaccord (each as defined below) are acting as Joint Bookrunners in connection with the UK Placing.The Bookbuild in respect of the Canadian Private Placement and the UK Placing is expected to close on or around 3.00 p.m. London Time (10.00 a.m. EST) on December 6  2022 but the timing of the closing of the Bookbuild for the UK Placing is at the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and the Company.Background to the Fundraise and Use of ProceedsIn recent years  the Company has been focusing on its successful exploration and development program on the Ortoire block  onshore in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Touchstone 80% working interest)  which has identified significant natural gas discoveries at the Coho and Cascadura projects and an oil discovery at Royston.Touchstone recently completed the development of its facility at Coho and announced initial natural gas production on October 10  2022  with the Coho-1 well delivering average net natural gas sales of 7.3 MMcf/d (approximately 1 212 boe/d) over 19 operational days in October.On August 16  2022  the Company received a Certificate of Environmental Clearance (""CEC"") to conduct development operations within the Cascadura area of the Ortoire block from the Trinidad and Tobago Environmental Management Authority. The CEC approved the construction of a multi-well surface production facility with a designed production capacity of 200 MMcf/d of natural gas  5 000 bbls/d of associated liquids and 200 bbls/d of produced water  with a storage capacity of 8 800 barrels of liquids on the Cascadura A wellsite. In addition to the facility  the CEC includes the drilling of up to eight wells on two additional well pads (Cascadura B and C) and the establishment of associated pipelines and infrastructure within the Ortoire block.Construction of the Cascadura surface facility and associated infrastructure required to bring production online from the two existing Cascadura wells is in progress. Once production at Cascadura is online  which the Company anticipates will be by the end of the first quarter of 2023  initial gross aggregate natural gas and associated liquids production from the Cascadura-1ST1 and Cascadura Deep-1 wells  based on previous well tests  has been forecasted at approximately 11 500 boe/d (9 200 boe/d net).In addition to the development of the Cascadura facility  the Company has a portfolio of further exploration and development drilling targets at the Ortoire block. In order to allow the Company to continue to accelerate these prospective exploration  development and production opportunities while the Company's cash balance and cash flows from operations are being allocated towards the Cascadura facility construction  Touchstone is seeking to complete the Canadian Private Placement and the UK Placing in order to side track Royston-1ST1 to drill and test the intermediate and subthrust sheets of the Herrera Formation. Net proceeds will also be applied to bring forward the drilling and potential completion of the Cascadura-2 development well.The funds raised will strengthen the Company's balance sheet and the Company also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds for working capital purposes as it continues constructing the Cascadura facility.Details of the UK PlacingThe UK Placing is being completed within the Company's existing share issuance authorities. Shore Capital and Corporate Limited and Shore Capital Stockbrokers Limited (together  ""Shore Capital"") and Canaccord Genuity Limited (""Canaccord"") (Shore Capital and Canaccord together  the ""Joint Bookrunners"") will be conducting an accelerated book building process  in respect of the UK Placing. The book will open with immediate effect. Shore Capital and Canaccord have entered into an agreement with Touchstone (the ""Placing Agreement"") under which  subject to the conditions set out therein  Shore Capital and Canaccord will agree to use their respective reasonable endeavours to procure subscribers for the UK Placing Shares at the Placing Price. The UK Placing is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement  including the completion of the Canadian Private Placement. Members of the public are not entitled to participate in the UK Placing.

The number of UK Placing Shares to be allotted and issued by the Company pursuant to the UK Placing will be determined at the close of the Bookbuild. It is envisaged that the Bookbuild will close no later than 3.00 p.m. (London Time) on December 6  2022 but the timing of the closing of the Bookbuild and allocations are at the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and the Company. Details of the final number of UK Placing Shares and the Placing Price will be announced as soon as practicable after the closing of the Bookbuild. The UK Placing is not being underwritten. The UK Placing is conditional upon the completion of the Canadian Private Placement and the admission to trading and settlement of the Canadian Placement Shares. The Placing Price for UK Placees (as defined below) pursuant to the UK Placing has been translated at a fixed exchange rate of £1.00 to C$1.65 such that it will be the same price in pounds sterling equivalent as for placees participating in the Canadian Private Placement.Details of the Canadian Private PlacementThe Canadian Private Placement is separate to and is being managed distinctly from the UK Placing. UK investors are not entitled to participate in the Canadian Private Placement. The placement of the Canadian Placement Shares in Canada is not conditional upon the completion of the UK Placing nor on the admission to trading and settlement of the UK Placing Shares.Admission and SettlementApplication will be made for the Canadian Placement Shares and the UK Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (""Admission"") and the Toronto Stock Exchange (the ""TSX"").

The change in the index will come into force on December 19th ,By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Porsche (ETR:P911_p) preferred stock edged back up toward a record high in early trade in Frankfurt on Tuesday  after market operator Deutsche Boerse said it will join the benchmark DAX index later this month.The sports car maker has enjoyed a strong start to life as a separately listed company  despite the headwinds from the surge in energy costs at its factories and lingering problems with supply chains. It's risen nearly 30% since being spun off by its parent company Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) at the end of September  with investors happy to pay a premium price for a company that has enjoyed historically high profit margins.With a market value of over 88 billion euros (€1=$1.0495)  Porsche is now worth more than Mercedes Benz (ETR:MBGn) and is worth twice as much as Ferrari (NYSE:RACE)  against which it was benchmarked during the IPO process.The change in the index will come into force on December 19th  Deutsche Boerse said. The DAX's composition is reviewed every three months and selection is based on free float market capitalization.Porsche will replace sportswear maker Puma (ETR:PUMG)  which has had a wretched time this year due to a sudden slowdown in demand as the pandemic-era boom in athletic wear faded sharply. Puma stock is down by over 50% and to make matters worse  it recently lost its chief executive Bjørn Gulden to cross-town rival Adidas (ETR:ADSGN).As such  the rebalancing will tilt the benchmark index of Europe's largest economy even further back toward the automotive sector. In addition to Porsche  Volkswagen and its rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW (ETR:BMWG)  the index also includes Daimler Truck Holding (ETR:DTGGe)  tiremaker Continental (ETR:CONG) and Porsche Automobil Holding (ETR:PSHG_p)  the vehicle through which the descendants of founder Ferdinand Porsche control both the sports car maker and its parent.The next review of the DAX is scheduled to take place on March 3  Deutsche Boerse said.Story continuesBy 03:40 ET (08:40 GMT)  Porsche stock was up 1.1%  while Puma stock was up 1.0%.Related ArticlesPorsche up on DAX promotion; Puma shrugs off exclusionUK watchdog moots tougher checks on financial marketingStocks slip  dollar up as data challenges Fed pause hopes,neutral,0.05,0.9,0.04,mixed,0.22,0.05,0.73,True,English,"['DAX promotion', 'Porsche', 'Puma', 'exclusion', 'chief executive Bjørn Gulden', 'free float market capitalization', 'Daimler Truck Holding', 'sports car maker', 'high profit margins', 'Porsche Automobil Holding', 'founder Ferdinand Porsche', 'benchmark DAX index', 'market operator', 'market value', 'sportswear maker', 'record high', 'benchmark index', 'Geoffrey Smith', 'Investing.com', 'preferred stock', 'early trade', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'strong start', 'energy costs', 'lingering problems', 'supply chains', 'premium price', '88 billion euros', 'Mercedes Benz', 'IPO process', 'The DAX', 'wretched time', 'sudden slowdown', 'pandemic-era boom', 'athletic wear', 'town rival', 'largest economy', 'automotive sector', 'next review', 'DAX promotion', 'UK watchdog', 'tougher checks', 'financial marketing', 'data challenges', 'Porsche stock', 'Puma stock', 'ETR:CONG', 'parent company', 'Frankfurt', 'Tuesday', 'life', 'headwinds', 'surge', 'factories', 'Volkswagen', 'VOWG_p', 'end', 'September', 'investors', 'MBGn', 'Ferrari', 'NYSE', 'RACE', 'change', 'force', 'December', 'composition', 'selection', 'PUMG', 'demand', 'matters', 'Adidas', 'ADSGN', 'rebalancing', 'Europe', 'addition', 'rivals', 'Mercedes-Benz', 'BMW', 'tiremaker', 'Continental', 'PSHG_p', 'vehicle', 'place', 'March', 'Story', '08:40 GMT', 'Articles', 'exclusion', 'Stocks', 'Fed', '03:40']",2022-12-06,2022-12-06,finance.yahoo.com

Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Financial Officer Peter Bühler  and other members of the Company’s senior leadership team will highlight Valneva’s core near- and mid-term value drivers  including its early- and late-stage development pipeline and commercial vaccine business.Presentations will begin at 10am Eastern Time. The event will also be webcast live and archived on the Events and Presentations page in the Investors section of Valneva’s website. A live Q&A session will follow the formal presentations with opportunity for virtual attendees to participate. To register for the event  please click here .Valneva will highlight its late-stage clinical and select preclinical vaccine candidates:VLA15  a Lyme Borreliosis (Lyme disease) vaccine candidate that is partnered with Pfizer for global development and commercialization  currently enrolling a pivotal Phase 3 studyVLA1553  a chikungunya virus vaccine candidate for which rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) is nearing completionVLA1554  a proprietary recombinant protein subunit candidate comprised of stabilized pre-fusion F peptide as a potential prophylactic vaccine against the respiratory pathogen human metapneumovirus (hMPV)VLA2112  a recombinant protein subunit candidate comprised of a mix of relevant antigens as a potential second-generation prophylactic vaccine against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)Valneva will also provide a detailed overview of its current commercial products and the factors driving continued recovery and potential growth of this part of the business as the COVID-19 pandemic slows  followed by a brief financial overview.Story continuesThomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  said  “As we look ahead over the next 12 to 36 months  we anticipate substantial growth for Valneva  driven by the potential commercialization of two additional vaccine products. This key strengthening of our commercial portfolio  combined with initiatives designed to fuel our current and future R&D pipeline  is part of a broader vision to transform Valneva into a globally recognized leader in the vaccines industry. To achieve this vision  we will continue to rely on our core strengths in vaccine development and manufacturing  as well as our experience and track record for bringing new vaccines from discovery and early development to commercialization.”Select Investor Day Highlights:VLA15  Lyme diseaseVLA15 is the only Lyme vaccine program in advanced clinical development worldwide. It leverages an established mechanism of action against Lyme borreliosis infection by targeting the six most prevalent serotypes of the Borrelia outer surface protein A (OspA). Pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies showed that VLA15 was protective against tick-transmitted Borrelia infection  and in clinical studies in more than 1000 adults and children (age ≥5 years)  VLA15 was generally well tolerated and showed strong immunogenicity including anamnestic response to a booster dose twelve months after primary vaccination1. Recently reported antibody persistence results from study VLA15-221 in adults and children further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule  which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants. Antibody levels remained above baseline six months after completing primary vaccination  and no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up2. Pfizer and Valneva are currently executing the Phase 3 field efficacy study for VLA15 called VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists)3. Enrollment completion is anticipated in the second quarter 2023. Pending successful Phase 3  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.VLA1553  chikungunya virusVLA1553 is a live-attenuated vaccine candidate targeting long-lasting immunity against mosquito-transmitted chikungunya virus infection with a single shot. It is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate to successfully complete pivotal Phase 3 studies and the first for which a regulatory filing process has been initiated with the U.S. FDA4. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. may be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)  which Valneva intends to monetize upon receipt. The pivotal Phase 3 study of VLA1553 met its primary efficacy endpoint  with a seroresponse rate (SRR) that exceeded the threshold established with the FDA based on an immunological surrogate of protection  including in older adults (age ≥65 years)5. The high SRR was maintained after six months6 and  as recently reported  after twelve months7  further highlighting the potential for long-lasting immunity from a single shot of VLA1553.While completion of the BLA submission is expected by year end  Valneva is focused on pre-commercial and market access preparations. Upon potential approval  the Company expects to market VLA1553 globally across multiple market segments  leveraging its existing commercial infrastructure  which spans North America  Europe  the Nordics and other key territories  as well as its strategic partner in Brazil  Instituto Butantan  who will market in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where chikungunya is currently endemic8.The recommendation process is ongoing with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  which governs vaccine policy in the U.S. This is a well-defined process and the ACIP vote on the specific recommendation(s) for VLA1553 is tentatively scheduled for the February 2024 meeting  pending approval by the FDA. In parallel  market access for ACIP-recommended vaccines is improving. Recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act now requires that the 49 million-and-growing population of Americans enrolled in Medicare Part D be covered without cost sharing for all ACIP-recommended vaccines. This is important as the number of outbound travelers to chikungunya endemic countries is projected to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels by 2025 according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)9.VLA1554  human metapneumovirusValneva’s hMPV vaccine program leverages recent advances in the development of vaccines against related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)  where discovery of the pre-fusion form of the F protein  which mediates viral entry into human cells  led to major recent breakthroughs. Valneva successfully generated a stabilized pre-fusion F protein antigen  which forms the basis of the proprietary vaccine candidate VLA1554. In key pre-clinical studies  low doses of the vaccine candidate generated hMPV-neutralizing responses that protected mice from challenge with hMPV virus. Adjuvant evaluation is currently in progress.VLA2112  Epstein-Barr virusValneva’s EBV vaccine candidate is based on adjuvanted  subunit viral glycoproteins designed to elicit high titers of EBV-neutralizing antibodies and block EBV infection of both B cells and epithelial cells. Vaneva is utilizing structural information to design potently immunogenic antigens. Evaluation of external and internal antigens is ongoing  with the ultimate vaccine candidate comprised of an adjuvanted combination of antigens that best neutralizes EBV infection.Commercial portfolioValneva’s current commercial portfolio includes proprietary travelers’ vaccines IXIARO® and DUKORAL®  for which Valneva owns global rights  as well as a number of vaccines that Valneva markets on behalf of third parties in select markets  leveraging its commercial infrastructure. Since 2016  Valneva has established a strong track record of adding additional third-party products to its portfolio  most recently adding VBI Vaccines’ PreHevbri® in 202210. The portfolio also includes VLA2001  the Company’s vaccine against COVID-19  for which the Company is now solely focused on deploying remaining vaccine inventory. In parallel  the current shelf-life of VLA2001 was recently extended to 18 months and the Company is continuing to work to gradually extend the shelf-life to at least 24 months.Financial OverviewValneva remains well capitalized to execute on its strategic objectives  with €261 million in cash at the end of September 2022  excluding an additional €102.9 million in gross proceeds from a recent follow-on Global Offering. The Company reiterates its 2022 financial guidance  which includes total revenues of €340 million to €360 million and lowered R&D expenses of €95 million to €110 million (previously €120 million to €135 million)11.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

(Photo: Business Wire)SKOKIE  Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW) unveiled a new  landmark vision today for Westfield Old Orchard that will create a North Shore destination unlike anything else in Chicagoland  featuring best-in-class retail  modern residences  chef-led dining  entertainment  gourmet markets  and upscale health and wellness amenities.The development plans also feature a park and event space designed as the center’s focal point and social gathering place. Under a canopy of native trees and plants  paved pathways will wind through lush landscaping and comfortable seating  leading to an open-air plaza where local events  concerts  farmer’s markets  and festivals can take place.Geoff Mason  executive vice president of operating management and development for URW in the U.S.  said: “Westfield Old Orchard already provides an exceptional experience for our customers  local residents  and our office workers. Our bold new vision for the center will dramatically enhance its offering and further establish it as the preeminent live  work  shop  and play destination on the North Shore. By creatively unlocking the potential of the center  this development will bring new life  energy and choices to Old Orchard and provide experiences that are even more engaging and meaningful for the local community.”Sustainability will be central to the development  with the project serving as an example of URW’s broader strategy to create unique  sustainable places where people connect through meaningful shared experiences. Innovative  sustainable building strategies that incorporate renewable energy  natural materials  biophilic design  and biodiversity will be introduced  enhancing Old Orchard’s contribution to the environmental  social  and economic vitality of Skokie and the North Shore.The multi-phase development began earlier this fall with the modernization of the existing shopping center  starting with enhancements to the common areas as well as the opening of a slate of new restaurants  health and wellness amenities  and luxury retailers – including Bloomies  Bloomingdale’s new curated shopping concept – and Louis Vuitton  as well as the return of Barnes & Noble  a long-time center favorite.Redevelopment at the center will continue in 2023 with the former Lord & Taylor space. It will be completely reimagined and redesigned  offering new luxury home furnishings  top fashion  and entertainment options to shoppers. Development of the new residences  eateries  wellness facilities  and outdoor amenities is expected to begin in 2024  and will open in phases starting in 2026.Mayor George VanDusen said: “For decades  Westfield Old Orchard has been a key economic and employment driver for Skokie and the region. Westfield and URW’s commitment to significantly invest and transform Old Orchard continues both this important economic growth and the Village’s long-standing  collaborative partnership with property ownership. The Village Board’s action earlier this year to designate Old Orchard as one of over 200 Illinois Business Districts has resulted in Westfield’s financial commitment of over $100 million to transform Old Orchard. I applaud Westfield’s focus on sustainability with this new vision  as is consistent with the Village’s recently approved comprehensive Environmental Sustainability Plan. The additional announcements and developments at Old Orchard in the coming year will further strengthen this tremendous community and regional asset.”More detailed plans for the development will be unveiled in early 2024  and community input will be encouraged.Mason added: “We are at the very start of this project  but already incredibly excited about working with the Village of Skokie and the local community to take one of the most desirable destinations on the North Shore and enhance it—creating a place that can become the residential  commercial  and cultural heart of the community.”About Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 80 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

The pod features a modern design that perfectly suits the authority’s needs in highly secure environments.The travel industry and border security agencies have recognized the need to improve efficiency and overall traveler experience at border entry and exit points.

Thales biometric pods can be set at any borders checkpoint (airports  seaports  etc.) managing both the first traveler enrolment upon arrival and quick biometric checks whenever required (upon territory exit  internal flights etc).“The combination of biometric patterns applied to contactless authentication  is a sought-after solution for many stakeholders to address security  operational and convenience challenges. Thales relies on its in-house biometrics  border and smart travel expertise to design  develop and deliver top tier responsible biometric solutions to meet users’ expectations and authorities’ requirements”  said Youzec Kurp  VP Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and “deep tech” innovations – connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies – to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

It leverages an established mechanism of action against Lyme borreliosis infection by targeting the six most prevalent serotypes of the Borrelia outer surface protein A (OspA). Pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies showed that VLA15 was protective against tick-transmitted Borrelia infection  and in clinical studies in more than 1000 adults and children (age ≥5 years)  VLA15 was generally well tolerated and showed strong immunogenicity including anamnestic response to a booster dose twelve months after primary vaccination1. Recently reported antibody persistence results from study VLA15-221 in adults and children further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule  which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants. Antibody levels remained above baseline six months after completing primary vaccination  and no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up2. Pfizer and Valneva are currently executing the Phase 3 field efficacy study for VLA15 called VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists)3. Enrollment completion is anticipated in the second quarter 2023. Pending successful Phase 3  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.VLA1553  chikungunya virusVLA1553 is a live-attenuated vaccine candidate targeting long-lasting immunity against mosquito-transmitted chikungunya virus infection with a single shot. It is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate to successfully complete pivotal Phase 3 studies and the first for which a regulatory filing process has been initiated with the U.S. FDA4. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. may be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)  which Valneva intends to monetize upon receipt. The pivotal Phase 3 study of VLA1553 met its primary efficacy endpoint  with a seroresponse rate (SRR) that exceeded the threshold established with the FDA based on an immunological surrogate of protection  including in older adults (age ≥65 years)5. The high SRR was maintained after six months6 and  as recently reported  after twelve months7  further highlighting the potential for long-lasting immunity from a single shot of VLA1553.While completion of the BLA submission is expected by year end  Valneva is focused on pre-commercial and market access preparations. Upon potential approval  the Company expects to market VLA1553 globally across multiple market segments  leveraging its existing commercial infrastructure  which spans North America  Europe  the Nordics and other key territories  as well as its strategic partner in Brazil  Instituto Butantan  who will market in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where chikungunya is currently endemic8.The recommendation process is ongoing with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  which governs vaccine policy in the U.S. This is a well-defined process and the ACIP vote on the specific recommendation(s) for VLA1553 is tentatively scheduled for the February 2024 meeting  pending approval by the FDA. In parallel  market access for ACIP-recommended vaccines is improving. Recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act now requires that the 49 million-and-growing population of Americans enrolled in Medicare Part D be covered without cost sharing for all ACIP-recommended vaccines. This is important as the number of outbound travelers to chikungunya endemic countries is projected to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels by 2025 according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)9.VLA1554  human metapneumovirusValneva’s hMPV vaccine program leverages recent advances in the development of vaccines against related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)  where discovery of the pre-fusion form of the F protein  which mediates viral entry into human cells  led to major recent breakthroughs. Valneva successfully generated a stabilized pre-fusion F protein antigen  which forms the basis of the proprietary vaccine candidate VLA1554. In key pre-clinical studies  low doses of the vaccine candidate generated hMPV-neutralizing responses that protected mice from challenge with hMPV virus. Adjuvant evaluation is currently in progress.VLA2112  Epstein-Barr virusValneva’s EBV vaccine candidate is based on adjuvanted  subunit viral glycoproteins designed to elicit high titers of EBV-neutralizing antibodies and block EBV infection of both B cells and epithelial cells. Vaneva is utilizing structural information to design potently immunogenic antigens. Evaluation of external and internal antigens is ongoing  with the ultimate vaccine candidate comprised of an adjuvanted combination of antigens that best neutralizes EBV infection.Commercial portfolioValneva’s current commercial portfolio includes proprietary travelers’ vaccines IXIARO® and DUKORAL®  for which Valneva owns global rights  as well as a number of vaccines that Valneva markets on behalf of third parties in select markets  leveraging its commercial infrastructure. Since 2016  Valneva has established a strong track record of adding additional third-party products to its portfolio  most recently adding VBI Vaccines’ PreHevbri® in 202210. The portfolio also includes VLA2001  the Company’s vaccine against COVID-19  for which the Company is now solely focused on deploying remaining vaccine inventory. In parallel  the current shelf-life of VLA2001 was recently extended to 18 months and the Company is continuing to work to gradually extend the shelf-life to at least 24 months.Financial OverviewValneva remains well capitalized to execute on its strategic objectives  with €261 million in cash at the end of September 2022  excluding an additional €102.9 million in gross proceeds from a recent follow-on Global Offering. The Company reiterates its 2022 financial guidance  which includes total revenues of €340 million to €360 million and lowered R&D expenses of €95 million to €110 million (previously €120 million to €135 million)11.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

All sub-units are now up and running  a few weeks ahead of schedule.Global Bioenergies announces that its first commercial production unit is now fully operational. All units (biological isobutene production  purification  condensation and packaging) have been validated and are now in operation.Frédéric Ollivier  Global Bioenergies’ Chief Technical Officer  said: “An industrial project is invariably an adventure. This is especially so in these troubled times. Nevertheless  we were able to successfully build and commission the unit in very good conditions. We are now producing about 1 tonne of isobutene per week. I would like to congratulate the entire Global Bioenergies team  who made this success possible.”Global Bioenergies plans to sell purified isobutene for use in cosmetics and high value-added fuel applications that can cover what remains a very high production cost.Global Bioenergies will also convert some of the isobutene produced  via an established chain of tollers  into cosmetic-grade isododecane for sale to major cosmetic companies under the trademark Isonaturane® 12. The scale-up of this downstream chain was executed in parallel to the start of operations at the Pomacle unit.Daphne Galvez  Global Bioenergies’ Head of Sales  said: “We will produce Isonaturane® 12 by campaigns. The first batch  which will be delivered in a few months  has already been sold in full  and our commercial discussions are now focusing on subsequent batches.”Marc Delcourt  Global Bioenergies’ Chief Executive Officer  said: “The primary purpose of this unit is to generate revenue. Its second purpose is to pave the way in commercial  technical and regulatory terms for the 2025 launch of a new unit destined to produce 2 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST® in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane® 12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint.

But rather than celebrate those achievements  the group is leveraging the impact of its annual Wishes film to drive awareness around the Human Papilloma Virus.Despite the fact that 80% of all adults will contract HPV at some point in their lives  for far too long cancers related to this virus have been hidden  shushed  stigmatized. They have therefore become a pervasive silent killer.This is a particularly personal theme for Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun as he was diagnosed and treated for HPV-related cancer earlier this year.HPV is linked to a significant rise in cancers in both men and women  despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine. While some countries have made vaccination of young people against the virus a top priority  awareness remains relatively low across the wider population.Joining Maurice and Arthur in this year’s Wishes is a special guest  who also went through HPV-related cancer  to encourage everyone at Publicis  and hopefully beyond  to protect themselves and their loved ones from this preventable illness. Click here to view this year’s Wishes.Publicis Groupe’s 2023 Wishes film was created by Le Truc  in partnership with Prodigious.About HPVHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common group of viruses that is linked to several types of cancer  including nearly 100% of cervical cancers  90% of anal cancers and 60% of oropharyngeal cancers (cancers of the back of the throat). Most people  up to 80% of adults—regardless of ethnicity  race or gender—will be exposed to some type of HPV in their lifetime. HPV is very easily transmitted between people because there are few signs or symptoms. There currently is no treatment for the virus itself. The only reliable method of protection against it is vaccination  which can prevent the most common types of infection. Education and raising awareness is the first step to reducing risk. The earlier you get the vaccine  the more you’re protected. Vaccination is available until the age of 45 in certain countries  including the U.S. and Australia.
