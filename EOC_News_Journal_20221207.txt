Tuesday  December 6  2022  Press release pictureThe Company further announces a proposed placing in the UK (the ""UK Placing"") to raise approximately US$5.5 million (approximately ¬£4.5 million and C$7.4 million) through the issue of Common Shares (as defined below) of no par value (the ""UK Placing Shares"") with institutional and other investors in the United Kingdom at a price of 54.5 pence per UK Placing Share (approximately C$0.90) (the ""Placing Price"").Story continuesThe Canadian Private Placement and the UK Placing (collectively  the ""Fundraise"") are expected to raise aggregate gross proceeds of between US$11 million (approximately ¬£9 million and C$14.9 million) and US$13 million (approximately ¬£10.6 million and C$17.5 million) to allow Touchstone to accelerate its Ortoire exploration and development program.In the event of excess demand  the Company reserves the right to increase the size of the UK Placing and/or the Placing Price. The UK Placing is being completed by way of an accelerated book building process (the ""Bookbuild"") and UK Placees (as defined below) will be subscribing for Common Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement. Shore Capital and Canaccord (each as defined below) are acting as Joint Bookrunners in connection with the UK Placing.The Bookbuild in respect of the Canadian Private Placement and the UK Placing is expected to close on or around 3.00 p.m. London Time (10.00 a.m. EST) on December 6  2022 but the timing of the closing of the Bookbuild for the UK Placing is at the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and the Company.Background to the Fundraise and Use of ProceedsIn recent years  the Company has been focusing on its successful exploration and development program on the Ortoire block  onshore in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Touchstone 80% working interest)  which has identified significant natural gas discoveries at the Coho and Cascadura projects and an oil discovery at Royston.Touchstone recently completed the development of its facility at Coho and announced initial natural gas production on October 10  2022  with the Coho-1 well delivering average net natural gas sales of 7.3 MMcf/d (approximately 1 212 boe/d) over 19 operational days in October.On August 16  2022  the Company received a Certificate of Environmental Clearance (""CEC"") to conduct development operations within the Cascadura area of the Ortoire block from the Trinidad and Tobago Environmental Management Authority. The CEC approved the construction of a multi-well surface production facility with a designed production capacity of 200 MMcf/d of natural gas  5 000 bbls/d of associated liquids and 200 bbls/d of produced water  with a storage capacity of 8 800 barrels of liquids on the Cascadura A wellsite. In addition to the facility  the CEC includes the drilling of up to eight wells on two additional well pads (Cascadura B and C) and the establishment of associated pipelines and infrastructure within the Ortoire block.Construction of the Cascadura surface facility and associated infrastructure required to bring production online from the two existing Cascadura wells is in progress. Once production at Cascadura is online  which the Company anticipates will be by the end of the first quarter of 2023  initial gross aggregate natural gas and associated liquids production from the Cascadura-1ST1 and Cascadura Deep-1 wells  based on previous well tests  has been forecasted at approximately 11 500 boe/d (9 200 boe/d net).In addition to the development of the Cascadura facility  the Company has a portfolio of further exploration and development drilling targets at the Ortoire block. In order to allow the Company to continue to accelerate these prospective exploration  development and production opportunities while the Company's cash balance and cash flows from operations are being allocated towards the Cascadura facility construction  Touchstone is seeking to complete the Canadian Private Placement and the UK Placing in order to side track Royston-1ST1 to drill and test the intermediate and subthrust sheets of the Herrera Formation. Net proceeds will also be applied to bring forward the drilling and potential completion of the Cascadura-2 development well.The funds raised will strengthen the Company's balance sheet and the Company also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds for working capital purposes as it continues constructing the Cascadura facility.Details of the UK PlacingThe UK Placing is being completed within the Company's existing share issuance authorities. Shore Capital and Corporate Limited and Shore Capital Stockbrokers Limited (together  ""Shore Capital"") and Canaccord Genuity Limited (""Canaccord"") (Shore Capital and Canaccord together  the ""Joint Bookrunners"") will be conducting an accelerated book building process  in respect of the UK Placing.

This key strengthening of our commercial portfolio  combined with initiatives designed to fuel our current and future R&D pipeline  is part of a broader vision to transform Valneva into a globally recognized leader in the vaccines industry. To achieve this vision  we will continue to rely on our core strengths in vaccine development and manufacturing  as well as our experience and track record for bringing new vaccines from discovery and early development to commercialization.‚ÄùSelect Investor Day Highlights:VLA15  Lyme diseaseVLA15 is the only Lyme vaccine program in advanced clinical development worldwide. It leverages an established mechanism of action against Lyme borreliosis infection by targeting the six most prevalent serotypes of the Borrelia outer surface protein A (OspA). Pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies showed that VLA15 was protective against tick-transmitted Borrelia infection  and in clinical studies in more than 1000 adults and children (age ‚â•5 years)  VLA15 was generally well tolerated and showed strong immunogenicity including anamnestic response to a booster dose twelve months after primary vaccination1. Recently reported antibody persistence results from study VLA15-221 in adults and children further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule  which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants. Antibody levels remained above baseline six months after completing primary vaccination  and no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up2. Pfizer and Valneva are currently executing the Phase 3 field efficacy study for VLA15 called VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists)3. Enrollment completion is anticipated in the second quarter 2023. Pending successful Phase 3  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.VLA1553  chikungunya virusVLA1553 is a live-attenuated vaccine candidate targeting long-lasting immunity against mosquito-transmitted chikungunya virus infection with a single shot. It is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate to successfully complete pivotal Phase 3 studies and the first for which a regulatory filing process has been initiated with the U.S. FDA4. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. may be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)  which Valneva intends to monetize upon receipt. The pivotal Phase 3 study of VLA1553 met its primary efficacy endpoint  with a seroresponse rate (SRR) that exceeded the threshold established with the FDA based on an immunological surrogate of protection  including in older adults (age ‚â•65 years)5. The high SRR was maintained after six months6 and  as recently reported  after twelve months7  further highlighting the potential for long-lasting immunity from a single shot of VLA1553.While completion of the BLA submission is expected by year end  Valneva is focused on pre-commercial and market access preparations. Upon potential approval  the Company expects to market VLA1553 globally across multiple market segments  leveraging its existing commercial infrastructure  which spans North America  Europe  the Nordics and other key territories  as well as its strategic partner in Brazil  Instituto Butantan  who will market in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where chikungunya is currently endemic8.The recommendation process is ongoing with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  which governs vaccine policy in the U.S. This is a well-defined process and the ACIP vote on the specific recommendation(s) for VLA1553 is tentatively scheduled for the February 2024 meeting  pending approval by the FDA. In parallel  market access for ACIP-recommended vaccines is improving. Recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act now requires that the 49 million-and-growing population of Americans enrolled in Medicare Part D be covered without cost sharing for all ACIP-recommended vaccines. This is important as the number of outbound travelers to chikungunya endemic countries is projected to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels by 2025 according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)9.VLA1554  human metapneumovirusValneva‚Äôs hMPV vaccine program leverages recent advances in the development of vaccines against related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)  where discovery of the pre-fusion form of the F protein  which mediates viral entry into human cells  led to major recent breakthroughs. Valneva successfully generated a stabilized pre-fusion F protein antigen  which forms the basis of the proprietary vaccine candidate VLA1554. In key pre-clinical studies  low doses of the vaccine candidate generated hMPV-neutralizing responses that protected mice from challenge with hMPV virus. Adjuvant evaluation is currently in progress.VLA2112  Epstein-Barr virusValneva‚Äôs EBV vaccine candidate is based on adjuvanted  subunit viral glycoproteins designed to elicit high titers of EBV-neutralizing antibodies and block EBV infection of both B cells and epithelial cells. Vaneva is utilizing structural information to design potently immunogenic antigens. Evaluation of external and internal antigens is ongoing  with the ultimate vaccine candidate comprised of an adjuvanted combination of antigens that best neutralizes EBV infection.Commercial portfolioValneva‚Äôs current commercial portfolio includes proprietary travelers‚Äô vaccines IXIARO¬Æ and DUKORAL¬Æ  for which Valneva owns global rights  as well as a number of vaccines that Valneva markets on behalf of third parties in select markets  leveraging its commercial infrastructure. Since 2016  Valneva has established a strong track record of adding additional third-party products to its portfolio  most recently adding VBI Vaccines‚Äô PreHevbri¬Æ in 202210. The portfolio also includes VLA2001  the Company‚Äôs vaccine against COVID-19  for which the Company is now solely focused on deploying remaining vaccine inventory. In parallel  the current shelf-life of VLA2001 was recently extended to 18 months and the Company is continuing to work to gradually extend the shelf-life to at least 24 months.Financial OverviewValneva remains well capitalized to execute on its strategic objectives  with ‚Ç¨261 million in cash at the end of September 2022  excluding an additional ‚Ç¨102.9 million in gross proceeds from a recent follow-on Global Offering. The Company reiterates its 2022 financial guidance  which includes total revenues of ‚Ç¨340 million to ‚Ç¨360 million and lowered R&D expenses of ‚Ç¨95 million to ‚Ç¨110 million (previously ‚Ç¨120 million to ‚Ç¨135 million)11.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Under a canopy of native trees and plants  paved pathways will wind through lush landscaping and comfortable seating  leading to an open-air plaza where local events  concerts  farmer‚Äôs markets  and festivals can take place.Geoff Mason  executive vice president of operating management and development for URW in the U.S.  said: ‚ÄúWestfield Old Orchard already provides an exceptional experience for our customers  local residents  and our office workers. Our bold new vision for the center will dramatically enhance its offering and further establish it as the preeminent live  work  shop  and play destination on the North Shore. By creatively unlocking the potential of the center  this development will bring new life  energy and choices to Old Orchard and provide experiences that are even more engaging and meaningful for the local community.‚ÄùSustainability will be central to the development  with the project serving as an example of URW‚Äôs broader strategy to create unique  sustainable places where people connect through meaningful shared experiences.

Development of the new residences  eateries  wellness facilities  and outdoor amenities is expected to begin in 2024  and will open in phases starting in 2026.Mayor George VanDusen said: ‚ÄúFor decades  Westfield Old Orchard has been a key economic and employment driver for Skokie and the region. Westfield and URW‚Äôs commitment to significantly invest and transform Old Orchard continues both this important economic growth and the Village‚Äôs long-standing  collaborative partnership with property ownership. The Village Board‚Äôs action earlier this year to designate Old Orchard as one of over 200 Illinois Business Districts has resulted in Westfield‚Äôs financial commitment of over $100 million to transform Old Orchard. I applaud Westfield‚Äôs focus on sustainability with this new vision  as is consistent with the Village‚Äôs recently approved comprehensive Environmental Sustainability Plan. The additional announcements and developments at Old Orchard in the coming year will further strengthen this tremendous community and regional asset.‚ÄùMore detailed plans for the development will be unveiled in early 2024  and community input will be encouraged.Mason added: ‚ÄúWe are at the very start of this project  but already incredibly excited about working with the Village of Skokie and the local community to take one of the most desirable destinations on the North Shore and enhance it‚Äîcreating a place that can become the residential  commercial  and cultural heart of the community.‚ÄùAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is an owner  developer and operator of sustainable  high-quality real estate assets in the most dynamic cities in Europe and the United States.The Group operates 80 shopping centres in 12 countries  including 45 which carry the iconic Westfield brand.

Valneva‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Financial Officer Peter B√ºhler  and other members of the Company‚Äôs senior leadership team will highlight Valneva‚Äôs core near- and mid-term value drivers  including its early- and late-stage development pipeline and commercial vaccine business.Presentations will begin at 10am Eastern Time.

This key strengthening of our commercial portfolio  combined with initiatives designed to fuel our current and future R&D pipeline  is part of a broader vision to transform Valneva into a globally recognized leader in the vaccines industry. To achieve this vision  we will continue to rely on our core strengths in vaccine development and manufacturing  as well as our experience and track record for bringing new vaccines from discovery and early development to commercialization.‚ÄùSelect Investor Day Highlights:VLA15  Lyme diseaseVLA15 is the only Lyme vaccine program in advanced clinical development worldwide. It leverages an established mechanism of action against Lyme borreliosis infection by targeting the six most prevalent serotypes of the Borrelia outer surface protein A (OspA). Pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies showed that VLA15 was protective against tick-transmitted Borrelia infection  and in clinical studies in more than 1000 adults and children (age ‚â•5 years)  VLA15 was generally well tolerated and showed strong immunogenicity including anamnestic response to a booster dose twelve months after primary vaccination1. Recently reported antibody persistence results from study VLA15-221 in adults and children further validate the use of the three-dose vaccination schedule  which is also included in the Phase 3 protocols for all participants. Antibody levels remained above baseline six months after completing primary vaccination  and no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no safety concerns were observed in this six-month observational follow up2. Pfizer and Valneva are currently executing the Phase 3 field efficacy study for VLA15 called VALOR (Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists)3. Enrollment completion is anticipated in the second quarter 2023. Pending successful Phase 3  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.VLA1553  chikungunya virusVLA1553 is a live-attenuated vaccine candidate targeting long-lasting immunity against mosquito-transmitted chikungunya virus infection with a single shot. It is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate to successfully complete pivotal Phase 3 studies and the first for which a regulatory filing process has been initiated with the U.S. FDA4. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. may be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)  which Valneva intends to monetize upon receipt. The pivotal Phase 3 study of VLA1553 met its primary efficacy endpoint  with a seroresponse rate (SRR) that exceeded the threshold established with the FDA based on an immunological surrogate of protection  including in older adults (age ‚â•65 years)5. The high SRR was maintained after six months6 and  as recently reported  after twelve months7  further highlighting the potential for long-lasting immunity from a single shot of VLA1553.While completion of the BLA submission is expected by year end  Valneva is focused on pre-commercial and market access preparations. Upon potential approval  the Company expects to market VLA1553 globally across multiple market segments  leveraging its existing commercial infrastructure  which spans North America  Europe  the Nordics and other key territories  as well as its strategic partner in Brazil  Instituto Butantan  who will market in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where chikungunya is currently endemic8.The recommendation process is ongoing with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  which governs vaccine policy in the U.S. This is a well-defined process and the ACIP vote on the specific recommendation(s) for VLA1553 is tentatively scheduled for the February 2024 meeting  pending approval by the FDA. In parallel  market access for ACIP-recommended vaccines is improving. Recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act now requires that the 49 million-and-growing population of Americans enrolled in Medicare Part D be covered without cost sharing for all ACIP-recommended vaccines. This is important as the number of outbound travelers to chikungunya endemic countries is projected to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels by 2025 according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)9.VLA1554  human metapneumovirusValneva‚Äôs hMPV vaccine program leverages recent advances in the development of vaccines against related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)  where discovery of the pre-fusion form of the F protein  which mediates viral entry into human cells  led to major recent breakthroughs. Valneva successfully generated a stabilized pre-fusion F protein antigen  which forms the basis of the proprietary vaccine candidate VLA1554. In key pre-clinical studies  low doses of the vaccine candidate generated hMPV-neutralizing responses that protected mice from challenge with hMPV virus. Adjuvant evaluation is currently in progress.VLA2112  Epstein-Barr virusValneva‚Äôs EBV vaccine candidate is based on adjuvanted  subunit viral glycoproteins designed to elicit high titers of EBV-neutralizing antibodies and block EBV infection of both B cells and epithelial cells. Vaneva is utilizing structural information to design potently immunogenic antigens. Evaluation of external and internal antigens is ongoing  with the ultimate vaccine candidate comprised of an adjuvanted combination of antigens that best neutralizes EBV infection.Commercial portfolioValneva‚Äôs current commercial portfolio includes proprietary travelers‚Äô vaccines IXIARO¬Æ and DUKORAL¬Æ  for which Valneva owns global rights  as well as a number of vaccines that Valneva markets on behalf of third parties in select markets  leveraging its commercial infrastructure. Since 2016  Valneva has established a strong track record of adding additional third-party products to its portfolio  most recently adding VBI Vaccines‚Äô PreHevbri¬Æ in 202210. The portfolio also includes VLA2001  the Company‚Äôs vaccine against COVID-19  for which the Company is now solely focused on deploying remaining vaccine inventory. In parallel  the current shelf-life of VLA2001 was recently extended to 18 months and the Company is continuing to work to gradually extend the shelf-life to at least 24 months.Financial OverviewValneva remains well capitalized to execute on its strategic objectives  with ‚Ç¨261 million in cash at the end of September 2022  excluding an additional ‚Ç¨102.9 million in gross proceeds from a recent follow-on Global Offering. The Company reiterates its 2022 financial guidance  which includes total revenues of ‚Ç¨340 million to ‚Ç¨360 million and lowered R&D expenses of ‚Ç¨95 million to ‚Ç¨110 million (previously ‚Ç¨120 million to ‚Ç¨135 million)11.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

But rather than celebrate those achievements  the group is leveraging the impact of its annual Wishes film to drive awareness around the Human Papilloma Virus.Despite the fact that 80% of all adults will contract HPV at some point in their lives  for far too long cancers related to this virus have been hidden  shushed  stigmatized. They have therefore become a pervasive silent killer.This is a particularly personal theme for Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun as he was diagnosed and treated for HPV-related cancer earlier this year.HPV is linked to a significant rise in cancers in both men and women  despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine. While some countries have made vaccination of young people against the virus a top priority  awareness remains relatively low across the wider population.Joining Maurice and Arthur in this year‚Äôs Wishes is a special guest  who also went through HPV-related cancer  to encourage everyone at Publicis  and hopefully beyond  to protect themselves and their loved ones from this preventable illness. Click here to view this year‚Äôs Wishes.Publicis Groupe‚Äôs 2023 Wishes film was created by Le Truc  in partnership with Prodigious.About HPVHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common group of viruses that is linked to several types of cancer  including nearly 100% of cervical cancers  90% of anal cancers and 60% of oropharyngeal cancers (cancers of the back of the throat). Most people  up to 80% of adults‚Äîregardless of ethnicity  race or gender‚Äîwill be exposed to some type of HPV in their lifetime. HPV is very easily transmitted between people because there are few signs or symptoms. There currently is no treatment for the virus itself. The only reliable method of protection against it is vaccination  which can prevent the most common types of infection. Education and raising awareness is the first step to reducing risk. The earlier you get the vaccine  the more you‚Äôre protected. Vaccination is available until the age of 45 in certain countries  including the U.S. and Australia.

14330,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://delano.lu/article/esg-challenges-the-need-for-qu,ESG challenges: the need for quality data and clear regulations,At this week‚Äôs Kneip Insight 2022 conference  experts talked about the importance of data standardisation  data quality  and upcoming challenges and developments in the fund industry.,‚ÄúThe importance of data quality is really going up dramatically ‚Äù stated Stephan Leithner  Deutsche B√∂rse executive board member  during his keynote. Deutsche B√∂rse acquired Luxembourg-based fund data manager Kneip earlier this year  which will help the company build a ‚Äúgolden data hub‚Äù that will centralise and process data  he argued.‚ÄúThe asset management industry has an enormous amount of data that is everyday increasing. And at the same time  there are multiple sources ‚Äù Leithner said during the conference on Wednesday. ‚ÄúSo that creates naturally a challenge around having the right quality  and that is most exemplified around ESG.‚ÄùESG challenges‚ÄúThere are numerous challenges to be dealt with ‚Äù said Magdalena Kuper  head of sustainability at the German investment funds association BVI  during a panel on ESG and technology. These challenges include unclear regulatory concepts relevant to the implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation  a lack of clarity of what ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù investments actually mean  what determines a positive contribution to an environmental or social objective  and what requirements must be met for the ‚Äúno significant harm‚Äù assessment.Another major challenge relates to the lack of reliable and comparable ESG data. Magdalena Kuper   head of sustainability   BVIThere‚Äôs also uncertainty surrounding the classification of Article 9 products  added Kuper. According to the SFDR  an Article 9 fund has a sustainable investment or a reduction in carbon emissions as its objective. ‚ÄúWe currently see in the market major reshuffling of products that have been initially assigned to Article 9 stages back to Article 8. And this seems to be mostly related to the persisting uncertainty about what level of commitment in terms of sustainable investment needs to be made in an Article 9 product.‚Äù‚ÄúAnother major challenge relates to the lack of reliable and comparable ESG data ‚Äù continued Kuper. This is a particularly relevant challenge with regards to taxonomy disclosures. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also major uncertainty as to which data that is available to the market actually meets these requirements.‚ÄùElisa Alonso Sanz  chief operating officer at ABN AMRO Investment Solutions and a speaker on a panel dedicated to the future of fund data  echoed this view. ‚ÄúIn Europe  we have different regulators with different demands. Of course  taxonomy regulations are deployed all over Europe  but we really need to have a common denominator across ESG data because otherwise  we are comparing pears and apples.‚Äù Knowing regulators‚Äô requirements around ESG data is important.The need for standardisation‚ÄúThe Esma [European Securities and Markets Authority] consultation published last week concerns the use of ESG or sustainability-related terms in the fund name ‚Äù mentioned Kuper. ‚ÄúIt touches really upon marketing of products by using ESG-related terms in the fund name.‚Äù What is seen now is that national authorities take different approaches towards authorising funds that use ESG  green or impact-related terms in their funds. ‚ÄúIt would be very helpful to have a clear approach at the European level in order to end this fragmentation.‚ÄùEsma is now discussing a ‚Äúcertain minimum proportion‚Äù--50%--of sustainable investments that would allow a fund to use the term ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù in their name. However  it still isn‚Äôt clear what a sustainable investment actually is  or how realistic it is for a fund to attain this proportion. ‚ÄúThis is something that needs to be first sorted out by the [European] Commission. Then as a subsequent step  we can assess whether or not we can have this threshold of 50%  and whether or not it‚Äôs realistic.‚ÄùBeware of risks related to greenwashingThe moderator of the ESG and technology panel  Kneip strategy director Mario Mantrisi  also broached the subject of reputational risks related to greenwashing. ‚ÄúWhat would be your advice?‚Äù he asked the panellists.‚ÄúFirst  be conservative ‚Äù answered Rick Lacaille  executive VP and global head of ESG initiatives at State Street. ‚ÄúThe obvious thing is being cautious in an environment where greenwashing risk--and the accusation of it--is a big one. So be pretty cautious  and obviously  be mindful of the regulations in the place you‚Äôre operating.‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre going to control greenwashing  which is a kind of enterprise-level risk  you want to make sure it kind of percolates throughout the entire organisation in a consistent way. Rick Lacaille   executive VP and global head of ESG initiatives   State Street‚ÄúBut above all  be very clear about your desire to communicate with your end investors and distributors and what‚Äôs actually happening  and why you think it‚Äôs important ‚Äù said Lacaille. He gave an example: if it‚Äôs important to focus on an issue like inclusion and diversity when analysing securities in a particular industry  ‚Äúarticulate why that‚Äôs valuable to driving long-run value for stakeholders  and what sort of measures and how you‚Äôre building that into your investment process.‚Äù‚ÄúYou have to be super careful to make sure that you‚Äôre actually delivering on the promise that you‚Äôve made ‚Äù Lacaille cautioned. It‚Äôs also important to ensure that all teams--from the front office to the compliance team--are looking at the same data. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to control greenwashing  which is a kind of enterprise-level risk  you want to make sure it kind of percolates throughout the entire organisation in a consistent way.‚ÄùLooking aheadLacaille anticipated that in five years  the investment practice will be for all funds to embed sustainability. The investment industry itself is changing  he noted. People who are entering the industry now consider sustainability to be ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Unfortunately  the fund industry tends to be backward looking: things that perform well attract more money  but if they do badly  people retreat. However  for the mainstream  sustainability ‚Äúmay not be the dominant feature  but it‚Äôs becoming a normal part of investment.‚ÄùData integrity and transformationThe need for data integrity  privacy and standardisation was highlighted during the panel dedicated to the future of fund data. During the panel on global distribution growth  speakers covered the importance of transforming data into digestible pieces of information  as well as the necessity of regulation to protect end-investors and the need for transparency  particularly with regards to ESG.Delano and its sister publication Paperjam were media partners of the conference.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - The global wheat market has perhaps never faced more uncertainty than in 2022  with Russia's invasion of fellow grain exporter Ukraine early in the year.Chicago wheat futures are still elevated versus most years  though they are slipping significantly versus prices elsewhere and against competing grains  even as supplies remain tight.Numbers could change in Friday's update from the U.S. Department of Agriculture  but its estimates last month implied stocks-to-use among major wheat exporters hitting 15-year lows by mid-2023  meaning the fundamental narrative has not greatly shifted in recent months.However  world wheat futures are falling. Most-active CBOT wheat settled at $7.29 per bushel Tuesday after hitting a 14-month low. Paris-based Euronext wheat for March delivery on Tuesday slipped below 300 euros per tonne for the first time since early March. It had traded over 400 euros back in May.That means more than just the Ukraine war premium has been removed from Chicago wheat  which averaged over $7.70 per bushel in January  the month before the invasion.The market sensed escalating tension at the time  but wheat traders were unprepared for the Feb. 24 invasion  as evidenced by the unprecedented run-up in futures. By the first week in March  most-active CBOT wheat had surged more than 50% within 10 sessions.Swings in CBOT wheat futures over the last 50 yearsTo put that in context  the previous biggest 10-session run in percentage terms was around 35% in August 1973  and a near 32% spike was observed in August 2010. The steepest 10-session losses were all near 22%  occurring in 1974  2008 and July 2022.Through Tuesday  CBOT wheat's 10-session decline totaled 11%  almost a record for the time of year.Most-active CBOT wheat reached an official all-time high of $13.63-1/2 per bushel on March 8  narrowly topping the 2008 record  though the 2008 build-up was more gradual than in 2022.LOW SUPPLIES  LOW PARTICIPATIONHeading into 2022  exportable global wheat stocks were already razor thin. USDA's February projection showed stocks-to-use among key suppliers at an all-time low by mid-2022  so the Ukraine invasion was a particular shock for the market.Before February  Ukraine accounted for near 10% of the world's wheat exports  but that is estimated near 5% now. Top exporter Russia's wheat shipments have been much better than a year ago  helping to keep a lid on prices  though Ukraine's volume last month was down 20% on the year.Uncertainties with Ukraine did not attract participants to the market this year  as open interest in both CBOT wheat futures and options has hovered at more than decade lows. The late February invasion had no meaningful impact on that trend.CBOT wheat trading volumes were moderately impacted. Average monthly volume in March was 4% above the five-year normal  but it was below normal in every other month in 2022. The biggest departure was 43% in April  then volumes stayed around 30% below average for the following four months before improving later in the year.Mild volumes and interest mean that changes in speculative positioning have been very slow  though money managers have built their most bearish CBOT wheat view since May 2019. Through November  funds' average 2022 weekly buying or selling in wheat was the lightest since 2008.WEAK WHEATCBOT wheat is particularly weak against competitors. Front-month December contracts are in delivery  but on a second-month basis  European wheat's premium versus Chicago reached 45 euros per tonne this week  the largest since May 2012.Second-month Kansas City wheat is just over a dollar per bushel more expensive than Chicago  which has been the case throughout the last month. But before November  the K.C. premium had not consistently maintained those levels since 2014.In 2014  the U.S. hard red winter (HRW) wheat crop  reflected by K.C. futures  took a sharp downturn coming out of the winter  resulting in very poor yields. The current HRW crop is in terrible condition  but general global wheat supplies were building in a strong way in 2014  which is not the expected outcome this year.CBOT wheat usually sits at a premium to CBOT corn  but it has lost significant ground to its yellow grain competitor. Most-active wheat's premium to corn on Tuesday slipped below 92 cents per bushel  its lowest since July 2021. It had opened the month above $1.20.But the new level is closer to ""normal"" compared with most of this year. Wheat's premium to corn averaged $3 per bushel from March through July  which had not been seen since 2008. Historically  something around $1 or just above has been a more long-term sustainable level.Wheat's losses against corn come as corn also hits multi-month lows. Most-active corn futures Tuesday dropped to the lowest levels since August  settling at $6.37-1/4 per bushel. That is down nearly 9% since the start of November  the most for the period in 11 years.Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical ...","Leniolisib was well tolerated and significant improvement over placebo was notable in the co-primary endpoints  reflecting a favorable impact on patients' immune dysregulation and deficiencyThe peer-reviewed publication heightens international understanding of APDS  a rare and recently characterized immunodeficiencyLEIDEN  Netherlands  Dec. 7  2022 /CNW/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(Euronext: OCI) today announced that construction is starting on what currently will be the largest blue ammonia facility to come onstream in Texas  wholly owned by OCI N.V. Today‚Äôs groundbreaking puts the project on track‚Ä¶,AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OCI N.V. (Euronext: OCI) today announced that construction is starting on what currently will be the largest blue ammonia facility to come onstream in Texas  wholly owned by OCI N.V. Today‚Äôs groundbreaking puts the project on track for production to begin as scheduled in 2025. The project also received its air permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) on 1 December 2022  another significant milestone.The project‚Äôs site is adjacent to OCI‚Äôs existing integrated 1.4 million metric ton per year methanol-ammonia production facility in Beaumont and 1.8 million metric ton per year 50%-owned methanol joint venture  Natgasoline  and leverages the significant and growing capabilities that exist in Southeast Texas for blue and green ammonia and hydrogen production. The area already has extensive existing hydrogen pipeline delivery infrastructure  hydrogen storage capability and industrial customers. South East Texas also has a wealth of companies leading in energy technology integration  deployment  operations  and maintenance  and a skilled labor force in clean energy.Nassef Sawiris  Executive Chair of OCI N.V. said: ‚ÄúWe are delighted that OCI is expanding its already significant presence in South-East Texas  a region which  as a clean energy leader and with its strategic location  plays a key role in the growing low-to-zero carbon hydrogen industry and is one of the best places globally to invest in this area. We look forward to continuing our partnerships with Jefferson County  the City of Beaumont  Beaumont ISD  the special districts  and the State of Texas.‚ÄùAhmed El-Hoshy  Chief Executive Officer of OCI N.V.  commented: ‚ÄúThe potential for clean ammonia to solve many of our global problems has become increasingly clear. It is not only an essential fertilizer that ensures food security for over 4 billion people  low-carbon ammonia is a clean fuel that provides an ideal solution available today for hard-to-abate sectors such as power and shipping. This world-scale facility will be a significant part of that  resulting in a very significant reduction in carbon emissions equivalent to taking almost half a million cars off the road permanently. The potential here is great and I‚Äôm delighted that breaking ground today signifies we‚Äôre on track to deliver on that.‚ÄùOCI will upgrade ‚Äúover-the-fence‚Äù blue hydrogen to produce blue ammonia  where over 95% of carbon emissions will be captured and sequestered. This allows OCI to materially reduce the carbon intensity of its products for downstream customers along the value chain  resulting in carbon footprint reductions across a wide range of industries including transportation  power  manufacturing and agriculture.The ammonia plant uses KBR technology and the EP (‚ÄúEngineering and Procurement‚Äù) contract was awarded to Maire Tecnimont in March 2022.Blue ammonia is produced from hydrogen derived from natural gas where the CO 2 by-product is captured and sequestered. Green ammonia is produced from hydrogen based on renewable sources such as wind and solar rather than fossil fuels. This project has been designed to transition from blue to green ammonia production in the future as green hydrogen becomes available at larger scale.OCI is also continuing its investments in the future talent of the area. OCI recently announced a $200k donation to the Beaumont Independent School District to develop opportunities to expand STEM education for students  continuing its long-term partnership with the school district.About OCI N.V.OCI N.V. (Euronext: OCI) is a leading global producer and distributor of hydrogen-based products providing low carbon fertilizers  fuels  and feedstock to agricultural  transportation  and industrial customers around the world.

Bureau Veritas conducted this independent assurance against the framework of ISO:26000 ‚Äì Guidance on Social Responsibility.Based on an intensive review over two weeks  Bureau Veritas concluded ‚Äúnothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the use of International Standard ISO 26000 does not adhere to the recommendations and guidelines there included. Likewise  nothing makes or has made us think that information analyzed during this assurance exercise is somehow incorrect or misleading‚Äù.The main findings of the review are:Management team is highly aware of social responsibility matters. The company has taken serious steps towards inclusion  diversity  and non-discrimination  which is highly valued by employees. The company shows maturity in the way of managing relevant matters and employees‚Äô expectations.It is important to highlight initiatives such as volunteering and mental health programs  as well as the fact that employees are aware of the consultation and claims mechanisms available in the company.Nothing has led Bureau Veritas to believe that labor or human rights are not respected at Teleperformance Colombia.From a general perspective  Bureau Veritas considers the following opportunities for improvement: document the due diligence exercise related to human rights: work hand-in-hand with other areas in order to boost a socially responsible conduct in all processes and in the company as a whole; transfer the good practices management systems in place to the social responsibility management system and hold more accountability meetings at national level.‚ÄùIn the spirit of transparency  the Bureau Veritas summary report (as received by Teleperformance) is accessible on Teleperformance by clicking here.About Teleperformance GroupTeleperformance (TEP ‚Äì ISIN: FR0000051807 ‚Äì Reuters: TEPRF.PA - Bloomberg: TEP FP)  the global leader in outsourced customer and citizen experience management and related digital services  serves as a strategic partner to the world‚Äôs largest companies in many industries.

Akka Arrh is based on an arcade prototype that was released in 1982 to a small test market. Unfortunately  the project was scrapped because players found the game too difficult. Due to its exceptionally short production run  only three Akka Arrh cabinets are still known to exist. Now  players have the chance to experience not just one of Atari‚Äôs rarest games  but one of the rarest games of the arcade era!Jeff Minter has a storied career that includes the creation of nearly 100 games spanning almost every generation of console.

The company has helped eliminate or reduce water and wastewater bills for eligible residents across the country through a number of programs amounting to more than $9 million in funding to date.‚ÄúThe last few years have been challenging for people everywhere. Following an unprecedented pandemic  inflation is resulting in rising costs for almost everything ‚Äù said Karine Rouge  CEO of Municipal Water for Veolia North America. ‚ÄúThis is particularly difficult for working families who may be struggling just to keep up with basic needs like water. Water is an essential resource and we must do our part to help those who need it most.‚ÄùThe company has facilitated bill relief through multiple programs aimed at helping families.The company has helped reduce or eliminate $2.5 million in payments in 2022 for customers as part of LIHWAP  a federally funded program administered by individual states to help low-income households with past due water bills. Individual customers can apply for up to $2 500 to pay down their water debt. Customers can visit their respective state LIHWAP websites  local social service agencies or call their local customer service center for more information.Earlier this year  Veolia also worked closely with regulators in select states to forgive water bills that were in arrears totaling over $6.8 million. Eligible customers in this program received a one-time automatic credit on their bills  further relieving the financial pressures faced by working families.Veolia Cares is a non-profit organization that has granted nearly $50 000  year-to-date  to customers who need temporary assistance with their water bills. Eligible households may have their water bills reduced once per year. To learn more  visit: cares.veolia.org.‚ÄúWe encourage customers who may need help to take advantage of these programs if they have not done so already. While water bills are often the smallest part of a household budget  every little bit helps ‚Äù said Rouge.By the end of 2022  these initiatives are expected to reach nearly $10 million across the company‚Äôs footprint  reflecting Veolia‚Äôs renewed commitment to the communities it serves.About Veolia: Veolia Group aims to be the benchmark company for ecological transformation.

That‚Äôs according to a new poll from the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council that involved more than 1 300 people who work for or support life science companies. The poll  taken earlier this fall  shows 57 percent of workers say they primarily drive alone  versus taking another form of transportation  compared with 44 percent in 2019. Only 16 percent said they ride the bus or subway  and 9 percent say they take commuter rail  compared with 26 percent and 15 percent  respectively  three years ago. MassBio said workers are driving more and using public transportation less frequently because of a lack of reliability and flexibility seen among the various MBTA bus and train lines.

Having won the ‚ÄúGold‚Äù medal in 2021 with a score of 71/100  this year the Group has been given the highest level of recognition awarded by EcoVadis  to move up to among the top 1% of the most exemplary companies.EcoVadis  the internationally recognised rating agency has a presence in 160 countries  with a global network of 75 000 companies that it surveys each year  assessing the level of maturity of policies and actions that have been implemented based on 21 challenges  and four themes: Environment  where JCDecaux obtained its best score of 90/100 (i.e. 20 points more than last year)  Social and Human rights and Responsible Procurement  where the Group obtained the same scores as in 2021 with respectively 80/100 and 70/100  and Ethics  where JCDecaux gained 10 points on last year‚Äôs score to obtain 70/100.Since 1964  JCDecaux has been designing  installing and maintaining light infrastructure (bus shelters  city information panels  automatic public toilets  self-service bicycles  etc.) in the public space and public mobility thanks to financing generated by advertising.

While we had already demonstrated JCDecaux‚Äôs place among the most responsible companies when we first won the EcoVadis award in 2021 with a ‚ÄúGold‚Äù medal  we are very proud to have been given the ‚ÄúPlatinum‚Äù medal this year  the highest accolade given by EcoVadis  clearly outperforming the sector average.

Hauck has built a career on breaking new ground and thinking outside the box. Now  this philosophy is given free rein at Singapore‚Äôs most eagerly awaited hotel.Any hotel is only as good as the people who bring it to life  says Hauck. Mondrian has given me the freedom to do something truly innovative and really cast the net wide in taking a new approach to assembling a team. It‚Äôs all about creating a place for individuals and personalities with a lot to offer but who may not fit in to a conventional hotel. They might be misfits in a sense  but they‚Äôll fit in here.‚ÄúHere‚Äù is Duxton Hill  Singapore‚Äôs happening precinct non-pareil  home to the latest addition to the Mondrian family of hotels  joining the brand‚Äôs properties in Los Angeles  New York  Miami  London  Cannes  Doha and Seoul. Since its launch in LA in 1996 by Ian Schrager  Mondrian Hotels have been brought to life by the quality of their people and a commitment to creativity  art and the unexpected.Hauck has begun the hiring process by staring at a blank canvas and painting in bold and unexpected strokes. He has already assembled a core team of over 70 people  ensuring there‚Äôs a solid backbone of experienced industry operators to which he has added rebels  dreamers and outsiders  creating a fresh perspective for the hotel  a new energy and a collective entrepreneurial spirit.Mondrian Singapore Duxton‚Äôs ‚ÄòUnexpected Talents‚Äô‚Äî Photo by AccorAvatar of Hauck‚Äôs approach is full body-tattooed Ah Seng  who has turned his life around since leaving prison and has always dreamt of having his own restaurant.

Or take Raymond Leong  64  senior sales manager of an events and cruise company  laid off during the pandemic  who reinvented himself as a Grab driver  now hired as a quality and training manager  a job he always aspired to doing.Unexpected talents with diverse backgrounds can be found everywhere. An elderly cleaner who has three diplomas in marketing repurposed as public area supervisor and director of inspiration. An executive assistant who had been enjoying a retirement baking sourdough bread but got bored  after a career in strategic brand planning for brands that are household names. Social media and visual marketing tyros  fresh graduates  a former Olympian athlete  a luxury fashion expert and award-winning bartenders. These are among the passionate and talented characters given another chance to find their calling.But how to find them? Hauck‚Äôs team can be seen handing out ‚ÄòWe like your style‚Äô cards to begin a conversation. My motto is chase talent  don‚Äôt wait  he says. From tattoo conventions to alternative gigs  from art happenings to theatre and sport  it‚Äôs about casting the net wide and knowing true talent when you see it.

For additional details on the study  see article in The Lancet.1About BE COMPLETEBE COMPLETE was a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFŒ±i).2 All enrolled study participants had a history of inadequate response (lack of efficacy after at least three months of therapy at an approved dose) or intolerance to treatment with one or two TNFŒ±i for either psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. For additional details on the study  see article in The Lancet.2About Psoriatic ArthritisPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a serious  highly heterogeneous  chronic  systemic inflammatory condition affecting both the joints and skin  with a prevalence of 0.02 percent to 0.25 percent of the population  and 6 percent to 41 percent of patients with psoriasis.3 Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness  skin plaques  swollen toes and fingers (dactylitis)  and inflammation of the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone (enthesitis).4About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.5 6 In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.6 7 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.

(NYSE: CLF)  the largest flat-rolled steel company in North America  have executed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for 180 megawatts (MW) of the 200-MW Headwaters III Wind Farm in Randolph County. This PPA is included in the announcement EDPR issued on Tuesday  November 15  2022. Headwaters III  located approximately 70 miles east of Indianapolis along the Ohio border  is anticipated to be operational in 2025 and will annually power the equivalent of more than 54 000 average Indiana homes.EDPR NA has developed and will construct  own  and operate Headwaters III Wind Farm  which is an extension of the operational 200-MW Headwaters I Wind Farm and the 198-MW Headwaters II Wind Farm in Randolph County. The project will create hundreds of jobs during peak construction and will employ local team members to operate and perform routine maintenance on the wind farm. Additional economic benefits in the form of landowner payments  local government payments  and an increase of money spent at businesses in the vicinity of the project will be disbursed as a result of the wind farm‚Äôs entrance into Winchester and projected 30-year lifespan. Headwaters III will save approximately 355 million gallons of water a year  which is the amount of water that would be needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the wind farm. The project will produce clean energy while minimizing impacts on wildlife  habitat  and other environmental resources.Cleveland-Cliffs and EDP Renewables‚Äô Headwaters III Wind Farm partnership will mutually benefit both parties  affording Cleveland-Cliffs the opportunity to advance its environmental and social sustainability goals  and enabling EDPR NA to expand its portfolio in Indiana  where it reinforces and maintains its position as the top producer of wind energy in the state.‚ÄúA key priority of Cleveland-Cliffs‚Äô greenhouse gas reduction strategy revolves around the efficient use of energy and clean energy. We are committed to the greening of the grid through renewable energy projects such as the Headwaters III Wind Farm ‚Äù said Lourenco Goncalves  Chairman  President and CEO of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. ‚ÄúThis project is another step towards achieving Cleveland-Cliffs‚Äô emission reduction goal of 25% by 2030 and will advance our portfolio of renewable energy initiatives that are additive to the power grid.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are excited to begin our partnership with Cleveland-Cliffs to supply clean energy to support the production of American-made steel for a major American manufacturer. We look forward to the eventual operations of this third phase of the Headwaters Wind Farm  also made possible by our supportive partners in the Randolph County community ‚Äù said Sandhya Ganapathy  EDP Renewables North America CEO. ‚ÄúThis power purchase agreement underscores EDP Renewables‚Äô sustained commitment to bringing more renewable projects to Indiana  a state that is a key contributor to clean energy buildouts and our overall commitment to the energy transition.‚ÄùEDP Renewables is a renewable energy leader in Indiana  with 1 400 MW of installed capacity that generates electricity equivalent to the consumption of more than 372 000 average Indiana homes.

This will enable Venator to deliver superior product data on the carbon footprint of its products to its customers and enables Venator to assess its portfolio and production network in terms of CO2 emissions and take action to reduce their PCF (Product Carbon Footprint). Venator produces a broad range of pigments and additives that bring colour and vibrancy to buildings  protect and extend product life  and reduce energy consumption.From October 2022 until March 2023  Venator works with Atos using this digital solution that calculates product carbon footprints (PCF) for the chemical industry to gather key insights in line with its existing ERP and data landscape.The PCF calculation tool (SCOTT) and methodology developed by BASF is based on Life Cycle Assessment methodology and calculates cradle-to-gate PCF. Atos was selected as a partner to develop and distribute a software platform to make this tool and methodology available to the industry. The methodology is based on ISO14067:2018 for the carbon footprint of products  which builds on the principles and requirements of the ISO standards 14040:2006 and 14044:2006.Rob Portsmouth  Senior Vice President  Sustainability at Venator  said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre acutely aware that what we do today will impact the world tomorrow. Working in a sustainable way is central to our business. We‚Äôre proud of our progress but we know we can go further. Working with Atos to automate the carbon footprint calculation of our products is a big step forward. It will help Venator achieve our ambitions by identifying improvements needed to make our business and our product portfolio even more sustainable. Providing product carbon footprint data will also help our customers make more informed choices.‚Äù‚ÄúOur collaboration has shown that Venator is in a very good position to build an automated PCF with their excellent data and ERP process foundation.‚Äù said Stuart Lemmon  Head of Net Zero Transformation Practice  at Atos. ‚ÄúWith this project  Venator will be able to have a clear  transparent  and comparable PCF for the products in the scope. They will also be able to gain valuable insights into internal and external supply chain dependencies  supported by the graph visualization  which can help them in developing sustainability commitments which span the entire supply chain.‚ÄùBoth companies see this digital solution as important for the chemical industry sector to drive the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions towards net zero  and an excellent example of how digital technology can be leveraged to monitor and manage greenhouse gas emissions.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 112 000 employees and annual revenue of c. ‚Ç¨ 11 billion.

They are successful properties combining yields and potential for value creation. This acquisition has a transformative effect for MRM  increasing the value of its portfolio by more than 50%  with potential for improvement in profitability and changing its shareholding structure  while also keeping the Company‚Äôs net debt at a controlled level.Fran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors  comments: ‚ÄúThe finalisation of this major acquisition  which has a significant structural effect on MRM  marks a real change of dimension for the Company. It has increased the value of its portfolio by more than 50%  while also keeping debt at a controlled level. We are delighted to count Altarea  a leading name in the real estate sector  as one of our shareholders. This attests to its confidence in our Company‚Äôs ability to create value.‚ÄùFran√ßois Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  adds: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that all stages leading to the acquisition of two shopping centres from Altarea have been completed successfully and on schedule. This acquisition has a structural effect and open up new opportunities for growth with the rollout of our proactive asset management policy on the basis of a larger portfolio. In the medium term  we are aiming for annualised net rents in excess of ‚Ç¨16 million and an improvement in our profitability thanks to better absorption of our fixed costs.‚ÄùRodrigo Clare  Altarea‚Äôs representative on MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors  states: ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to be able to support MRM in its strategic development thanks to the agreement reached with the Company and its main shareholder  SCOR SE. With its experienced team  MRM has the strengths required to make the most of its retail asset portfolio through dynamic management and know-how to adapt to changing consumer trends.‚ÄùAcquisition processThe final stage of the acquisition by MRM of the Assets Sold from Altarea was achieved today  with the settlement-delivery and admission to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris of the new MRM shares issued within the framework of its capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders in the amount of ‚Ç¨29 million  with SCOR SE subscribing to ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨4 million  carried out on 5 December 2022.Overall  the acquisition of the Assets Sold entailed (i) a capital increase of the Company by means of a contribution in kind reserved for Altarea in the amount of ‚Ç¨21 million1 and (ii) the above-mentioned capital increase of the Company with preferential subscription rights for shareholders. Representing a total of ‚Ç¨50 million  the two capital increases were carried out at a unit subscription price equal to MRM‚Äôs replacement NAV per share as at 30 June 2022  i.e. ‚Ç¨48.92. SCOR SE subscribed to an amount of ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨25 million. The remainder of the acquisition price was financed by means of a ‚Ç¨42 million bank loan with a pool of banks comprising Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel  LCL and BRED Banque Populaire. Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel acted as agent and co-arranger  and LCL acted as co-arranger.This financing structure has enabled MRM to maintain a net LTV ratio of less than 45%  compared with 40.7% as at 30 June 2022.Significant increase in the size of MRM‚Äôs portfolioThe acquisition of the Carrefour shopping centre in Flins-sur-Seine  Yvelines  and the Carrefour shopping centre in Ollioules  Var  has resulted in a change of dimension for MRM. As well as establishing its presence in two fast-growing regions  this acquisition has increased the size of its portfolio by 52% from ‚Ç¨163.0 million to ‚Ç¨247.3 million  on the basis of values excluding transfer taxes as at 30 June 2022.This extension of the portfolio is reflected by the sharp rise in MRM‚Äôs annualised net rents from ‚Ç¨9.5 million to ‚Ç¨15.0 million2. The target of annualised net rents of ‚Ç¨10.0 million prior to the acquisition has therefore been increased to more than ‚Ç¨16.0 million. MRM expects the increase in its rental income to have a positive impact on its net operating cash flow generation and is hoping to improve its profitability in the medium term thanks to better absorption of its fixed costs.Positioned as market leaders within their catchment areas and with physical occupancy rates2 of 97% and 92% respectively  the Flins-sur-Seine and Ollioules shopping centres3 present much higher net rental yields than those generated by MRM‚Äôs portfolio prior to the acquisition. Furthermore  the two properties offer potential for value creation that will enable MRM to roll out its asset management expertise (refurbishment  partial redevelopment  proactive rental management  changes in the retailer mix) across a wider portfolio.Enhanced shareholding structure and changes in governanceFollowing the issuing of new shares in relation to the two capital increases carried out within the framework of the acquisition  SCOR SE and Altarea hold stakes4 of 56.63% and 15.94% respectively. The Company‚Äôs free float stands at 27.35%.MRM also reiterates that Altarea was appointed as a board member at the combined general meeting of 16 November 2022. As of this date  the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors comprises:Fran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Board member;SCOR SE  Board member  represented by Karina Leli√®vre;Altarea  Board member  represented by Rodrigo Clare;Brigitte Gauthier-Darcet  independent Board member;Val√©rie Ohannessian  independent Board member; andKarine Tr√©baticky  Board member.Resumption of the liquidity agreementThe liquidity agreement administered by Invest Securities  which was suspended after close of trading on 15 November 2022 within the framework of the launch of the Company‚Äôs capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders  will resume before market opening tomorrow  Thursday 8 December 2022.Ordinary general meeting of 14 December 2022At its combined general meeting of 16 November 2022  the Company failed to reach the quorum required for the first convening of the meeting to be able to validly deliberate on the sixth resolution of the ordinary part of the meeting.Another ordinary general meeting was therefore convened at 3.00 p.m. on 14 December 2022 at the Company‚Äôs head office for shareholders to vote on the sixth resolution (Notice of Second Convocation published in the Bulletin des Annonces L√©gales Obligatoires on 25 November 2022 n¬∞ 141 - Announcement n¬∞ 2204498 and in the ACTU-JURIDIQUE.FR legal notices on 25 November 2022).# # #MRM‚Äôs advisors for the whole transaction are Gimar & Co (financial advisor)  De Pardieu Brocas Maffei (legal advisor) and Lasaygues (notary).# # #About MRMMRM is a listed real estate investment company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.) (PRNewswire)The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The LME is now facing regulatory investigations  as well as lawsuits from investors  and its nickel market has yet to return to normal.Yet while the crisis has thrown the LME‚Äôs future into question  it remains a vital cog at the center of the metals trade as the home of global benchmark prices for some of the world‚Äôs key industrial commodities.ICE remains interested in the LME and may make another attempt in the future as the outcome of the investigations and lawsuits over the nickel crisis becomes clearer  one of the people said.Never miss a story. Subscribe today.The LME has said it intends to publish the conclusions of an independent investigation into the nickel crisis this month  while the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England are also conducting reviews. Meanwhile  Elliott Investment Management and Jane Street are together seeking $471 million in damages from the exchange  and a group of other hedge funds and proprietary traders is also taking legal action that could be a prelude to further claims.Spokespeople for HKEX  ICE and CME all declined to comment.It was ICE that kicked off a bidding war for the LME just over a decade ago with an unsolicited approach to the LME ‚Äì then owned by its members ‚Äì that ended with the metals exchange being sold to HKEX for $2.2 billion.Under Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sprecher  ICE has led the consolidation of the exchanges industry over the past two decades  with acquisitions including London‚Äôs International Petroleum Exchange  the New York Board of Trade and NYSE Euronext.It‚Äôs far from clear whether HKEX would be willing to sell the LME  even if the nickel lawsuits go against it. A sale would be an embarrassing retreat ten years after former CEO Charles Li trumpeted the acquisition of the LME as an opportunity to bring together the historic exchange with HKEX‚Äôs China expertise.Asked if he would consider selling the LME  HKEX CEO Nicolas Aguzin told Bloomberg TV in October: ‚ÄúA lot of the manufacturers and producers of some of these base metals are in China. There is a natural fit in terms of the connectivity. The key thing is how do we get the most out of that advantage of being uniquely positioned as HKEX as part of China?

(NYSE: CLF)   the largest flat-rolled steel company in North America ,Winchester  Indiana  Dec. 07  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EDP Renewables SA (EDPR)   through its fully owned subsidiary EDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)   and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF)   the largest flat-rolled steel company in North America  have executed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for 180 megawatts (MW) of the 200-MW Headwaters III Wind Farm in Randolph County. This PPA is included in the announcement EDPR issued on Tuesday  November 15  2022. Headwaters III  located approximately 70 miles east of Indianapolis along the Ohio border  is anticipated to be operational in 2025 and will annually power the equivalent of more than 54 000 average Indiana homes.EDPR NA has developed and will construct  own  and operate Headwaters III Wind Farm  which is an extension of the operational 200-MW Headwaters I Wind Farm and the 198-MW Headwaters II Wind Farm in Randolph County. The project will create hundreds of jobs during peak construction and will employ local team members to operate and perform routine maintenance on the wind farm. Additional economic benefits in the form of landowner payments  local government payments  and an increase of money spent at businesses in the vicinity of the project will be disbursed as a result of the wind farm's entrance into Winchester and projected 30-year lifespan. Headwaters III will save approximately 355 million gallons of water a year  which is the amount of water that would be needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the wind farm. The project will produce clean energy while minimizing impacts on wildlife  habitat  and other environmental resources.Cleveland-Cliffs and EDP Renewables' Headwaters III Wind Farm partnership will mutually benefit both parties  affording Cleveland-Cliffs the opportunity to advance its environmental and social sustainability goals  and enabling EDPR NA to expand its portfolio in Indiana  where it reinforces and maintains its position as the top producer of wind energy in the state.‚ÄúA key priority of Cleveland-Cliffs' greenhouse gas reduction strategy revolves around the efficient use of energy and clean energy. We are committed to the greening of the grid through renewable energy projects such as the Headwaters III Wind Farm ‚Äù said Lourenco Goncalves  Chairman  President and CEO of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. ‚ÄúThis project is another step towards achieving Cleveland-Cliffs' emission reduction goal of 25% by 2030 and will advance our portfolio of renewable energy initiatives that are additive to the power grid.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are excited to begin our partnership with Cleveland-Cliffs to supply clean energy to support the production of American-made steel for a major American manufacturer. We look forward to the eventual operations of this third phase of the Headwaters Wind Farm  also made possible by our supportive partners in the Randolph County community ‚Äù said Sandhya Ganapathy  EDP Renewables North America CEO. ‚ÄúThis power purchase agreement underscores EDP Renewables' sustained commitment to bringing more renewable projects to Indiana  a state that is a key contributor to clean energy buildouts and our overall commitment to the energy transition.‚ÄùEDP Renewables is a renewable energy leader in Indiana  with 1 400 MW of installed capacity that generates electricity equivalent to the consumption of more than 372 000 average Indiana homes. The company's operating renewable energy portfolio comprises six phases of the Meadow Lake Wind Farm (White and Benton Counties)  two phases of the Headwaters Wind Farm (Randolph County)  and the Riverstart Solar Park (Randolph County). EDPR NA is currently constructing the 202-MW Indiana Crossroads II Wind Farm (White County)  which it will own and operate  and is actively building the 200-MW Indiana Crossroads Solar Park  which it will transfer ownership upon the completion of construction. EDPR NA also developed and constructed the 102-MW Rosewater Wind Farm (White County) and the 302-MW Indiana Crossroads I Wind Farm (White County)  both now fully operational and under new ownership. Indiana is a vital market in EDPR NA's portfolio  and the company continues to seek other development opportunities within the state to grow its presence further and continue to bring more economic benefits to Indiana communities.About EDP Renewables North AmericaEDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)  its affiliates  and its subsidiaries develop  construct  own  and operate wind farms and solar parks throughout North America.

In the medium term  we are aiming for annualised net rents in excess of ‚Ç¨16 million and an improvement in our profitability thanks to better absorption of our fixed costs.‚ÄùRodrigo Clare  Altarea‚Äôs representative on MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors  states: ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to be able to support MRM in its strategic development thanks to the agreement reached with the Company and its main shareholder  SCOR SE. With its experienced team  MRM has the strengths required to make the most of its retail asset portfolio through dynamic management and know-how to adapt to changing consumer trends.‚ÄùAcquisition processThe final stage of the acquisition by MRM of the Assets Sold from Altarea was achieved today  with the settlement-delivery and admission to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris of the new MRM shares issued within the framework of its capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders in the amount of ‚Ç¨29 million  with SCOR SE subscribing to ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨4 million  carried out on 5 December 2022.Overall  the acquisition of the Assets Sold entailed (i) a capital increase of the Company by means of a contribution in kind reserved for Altarea in the amount of ‚Ç¨21 million1 and (ii) the above-mentioned capital increase of the Company with preferential subscription rights for shareholders. Representing a total of ‚Ç¨50 million  the two capital increases were carried out at a unit subscription price equal to MRM‚Äôs replacement NAV per share as at 30 June 2022  i.e. ‚Ç¨48.92. SCOR SE subscribed to an amount of ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨25 million. The remainder of the acquisition price was financed by means of a ‚Ç¨42 million bank loan with a pool of banks comprising Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel  LCL and BRED Banque Populaire. Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel acted as agent and co-arranger  and LCL acted as co-arranger.This financing structure has enabled MRM to maintain a net LTV ratio of less than 45%  compared with 40.7% as at 30 June 2022.Significant increase in the size of MRM‚Äôs portfolioThe acquisition of the Carrefour shopping centre in Flins-sur-Seine  Yvelines  and the Carrefour shopping centre in Ollioules  Var  has resulted in a change of dimension for MRM. As well as establishing its presence in two fast-growing regions  this acquisition has increased the size of its portfolio by 52% from ‚Ç¨163.0 million to ‚Ç¨247.3 million  on the basis of values excluding transfer taxes as at 30 June 2022.This extension of the portfolio is reflected by the sharp rise in MRM‚Äôs annualised net rents from ‚Ç¨9.5 million to ‚Ç¨15.0 million2. The target of annualised net rents of ‚Ç¨10.0 million prior to the acquisition has therefore been increased to more than ‚Ç¨16.0 million. MRM expects the increase in its rental income to have a positive impact on its net operating cash flow generation and is hoping to improve its profitability in the medium term thanks to better absorption of its fixed costs.Positioned as market leaders within their catchment areas and with physical occupancy rates2 of 97% and 92% respectively  the Flins-sur-Seine and Ollioules shopping centres3 present much higher net rental yields than those generated by MRM‚Äôs portfolio prior to the acquisition. Furthermore  the two properties offer potential for value creation that will enable MRM to roll out its asset management expertise (refurbishment  partial redevelopment  proactive rental management  changes in the retailer mix) across a wider portfolio.Enhanced shareholding structure and changes in governanceFollowing the issuing of new shares in relation to the two capital increases carried out within the framework of the acquisition  SCOR SE and Altarea hold stakes4 of 56.63% and 15.94% respectively. The Company‚Äôs free float stands at 27.35%.MRM also reiterates that Altarea was appointed as a board member at the combined general meeting of 16 November 2022. As of this date  the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors comprises:Fran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Board member;SCOR SE  Board member  represented by Karina Leli√®vre;Altarea  Board member  represented by Rodrigo Clare;Brigitte Gauthier-Darcet  independent Board member;Val√©rie Ohannessian  independent Board member; andKarine Tr√©baticky  Board member.Resumption of the liquidity agreementThe liquidity agreement administered by Invest Securities  which was suspended after close of trading on 15 November 2022 within the framework of the launch of the Company‚Äôs capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders  will resume before market opening tomorrow  Thursday 8 December 2022.Ordinary general meeting of 14 December 2022At its combined general meeting of 16 November 2022  the Company failed to reach the quorum required for the first convening of the meeting to be able to validly deliberate on the sixth resolution of the ordinary part of the meeting.Another ordinary general meeting was therefore convened at 3.00 p.m. on 14 December 2022 at the Company‚Äôs head office for shareholders to vote on the sixth resolution (Notice of Second Convocation published in the Bulletin des Annonces L√©gales Obligatoires on 25 November 2022 n¬∞ 141 - Announcement n¬∞ 2204498 and in the ACTU-JURIDIQUE.FR legal notices on 25 November 2022).# # #MRM‚Äôs advisors for the whole transaction are Gimar & Co (financial advisor)  De Pardieu Brocas Maffei (legal advisor) and Lasaygues (notary).# # #About MRMMRM is a listed real estate investment company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

All EU access for UK clearers is due to end in June 2025 but the draft law now casts doubt on this  industry officials say.""We fully respect the right and capacity of the United Kingdom to do what it wants to do around its financial industry  in its interests  so I think there is a healthy respect and understanding of why we are doing it "" Ms McGuinness said. ""We don't underestimate how big a change this "" she said.The London Stock Exchange Group  whose LCH arm clears the bulk of euro interest rate swaps being targeted by the EU law  said it welcomed the acknowledgement of the importance of continued access for EU firms to UK clearing houses to hedge their risks in all currencies.The second draft law on insolvency aims to increase clarity and predictability for investors in one EU state who want to invest in a company in another member country on how would they get money back if the firm went bust.The third draft law seeks to simplify how companies list to save about ‚Ç¨100m annually in compliance fees.‚Ä¢ Bloomberg and Reuters",negative,0.02,0.1,0.87,mixed,0.37,0.13,0.5,True,English,"['London financial centre', 'Euronext boss', 'Brexit', 'The London Stock Exchange Group', 'euro interest rate swaps', 'EU financial services commissioner', 'largest exchange group', 'Stock market listings', 'dominant financial centre', 'largest financial centre', 'combined market capitalisation', 'initial shares sales', 'three draft laws', 'first draft law', 'second draft law', 'third draft law', 'one EU state', 'Euronext chief executive', 'financial industry', 'EU law', 'primary listings', 'European Union', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'United Kingdom', 'Mr Boujnah', 'Universal Music', 'capital markets', 'Mairead McGuinness', 'EU access', 'industry officials', 'healthy respect', 'Ms McGuinness', 'LCH arm', 'continued access', 'EU firms', 'member country', 'compliance fees', 'UK capital', 'UK clearers', 'Dublin trading', 'less reliance', 'post-Brexit London', 'boss', 'swipe', 'everybody', 'France', 'Britain', 'money', 'hands', 'Paris', 'turnover', 'exchanges', 'Ryanair', 'Allfunds', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Milan', 'Lisbon', 'Oslo', 'departure', 'trillions', 'euros', 'derivatives', 'capacity', 'June', 'doubt', 'right', 'interests', 'understanding', 'bulk', 'acknowledgement', 'importance', 'houses', 'risks', 'currencies', 'insolvency', 'clarity', 'predictability', 'investors', 'company', 'companies', 'Bloomberg', 'Reuters']",2022-12-07,2022-12-07,irishexaminer.com

(Euronext: OCI) today announced that construction is starting on what currently will be the largest blue ammonia facility to come onstream in Texas  wholly owned by OCI N.V. Today‚Äôs groundbreaking puts the project on track for production to begin as scheduled in 2025. The project also received its air permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) on 1 December 2022  another significant milestone.The project‚Äôs site is adjacent to OCI‚Äôs existing integrated 1.4 million metric ton per year methanol-ammonia production facility in Beaumont and 1.8 million metric ton per year 50%-owned methanol joint venture  Natgasoline  and leverages the significant and growing capabilities that exist in Southeast Texas for blue and green ammonia and hydrogen production. The area already has extensive existing hydrogen pipeline delivery infrastructure  hydrogen storage capability and industrial customers. South East Texas also has a wealth of companies leading in energy technology integration  deployment  operations  and maintenance  and a skilled labor force in clean energy.Story continuesNassef Sawiris  Executive Chair of OCI N.V. said: ""We are delighted that OCI is expanding its already significant presence in South-East Texas  a region which  as a clean energy leader and with its strategic location  plays a key role in the growing low-to-zero carbon hydrogen industry and is one of the best places globally to invest in this area. We look forward to continuing our partnerships with Jefferson County  the City of Beaumont  Beaumont ISD  the special districts  and the State of Texas.""Ahmed El-Hoshy  Chief Executive Officer of OCI N.V.  commented: ""The potential for clean ammonia to solve many of our global problems has become increasingly clear. It is not only an essential fertilizer that ensures food security for over 4 billion people  low-carbon ammonia is a clean fuel that provides an ideal solution available today for hard-to-abate sectors such as power and shipping. This world-scale facility will be a significant part of that  resulting in a very significant reduction in carbon emissions equivalent to taking almost half a million cars off the road permanently. The potential here is great and I‚Äôm delighted that breaking ground today signifies we‚Äôre on track to deliver on that.""OCI will upgrade ""over-the-fence"" blue hydrogen to produce blue ammonia  where over 95% of carbon emissions will be captured and sequestered. This allows OCI to materially reduce the carbon intensity of its products for downstream customers along the value chain  resulting in carbon footprint reductions across a wide range of industries including transportation  power  manufacturing and agriculture.The ammonia plant uses KBR technology and the EP (""Engineering and Procurement"") contract was awarded to Maire Tecnimont in March 2022.Blue ammonia is produced from hydrogen derived from natural gas where the CO 2 by-product is captured and sequestered. Green ammonia is produced from hydrogen based on renewable sources such as wind and solar rather than fossil fuels. This project has been designed to transition from blue to green ammonia production in the future as green hydrogen becomes available at larger scale.OCI is also continuing its investments in the future talent of the area. OCI recently announced a $200k donation to the Beaumont Independent School District to develop opportunities to expand STEM education for students  continuing its long-term partnership with the school district.About OCI N.V.OCI N.V. (Euronext: OCI) is a leading global producer and distributor of hydrogen-based products providing low carbon fertilizers  fuels  and feedstock to agricultural  transportation  and industrial customers around the world. OCI‚Äôs production capacity spans four continents and comprises approximately 16.2 million metric tons per year of hydrogen-based products including nitrogen fertilizers  methanol  biofuels  diesel exhaust fluid  melamine  and other products.
