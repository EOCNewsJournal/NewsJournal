Dec 6 (Reuters) - The global wheat market has perhaps never faced more uncertainty than in 2022  with Russia's invasion of fellow grain exporter Ukraine early in the year.Chicago wheat futures are still elevated versus most years  though they are slipping significantly versus prices elsewhere and against competing grains  even as supplies remain tight.Numbers could change in Friday's update from the U.S. Department of Agriculture  but its estimates last month implied stocks-to-use among major wheat exporters hitting 15-year lows by mid-2023  meaning the fundamental narrative has not greatly shifted in recent months.However  world wheat futures are falling. Most-active CBOT wheat settled at $7.29 per bushel Tuesday after hitting a 14-month low. Paris-based Euronext wheat for March delivery on Tuesday slipped below 300 euros per tonne for the first time since early March. It had traded over 400 euros back in May.That means more than just the Ukraine war premium has been removed from Chicago wheat  which averaged over $7.70 per bushel in January  the month before the invasion.The market sensed escalating tension at the time  but wheat traders were unprepared for the Feb. 24 invasion  as evidenced by the unprecedented run-up in futures. By the first week in March  most-active CBOT wheat had surged more than 50% within 10 sessions.Swings in CBOT wheat futures over the last 50 yearsTo put that in context  the previous biggest 10-session run in percentage terms was around 35% in August 1973  and a near 32% spike was observed in August 2010. The steepest 10-session losses were all near 22%  occurring in 1974  2008 and July 2022.Through Tuesday  CBOT wheat's 10-session decline totaled 11%  almost a record for the time of year.Most-active CBOT wheat reached an official all-time high of $13.63-1/2 per bushel on March 8  narrowly topping the 2008 record  though the 2008 build-up was more gradual than in 2022.LOW SUPPLIES  LOW PARTICIPATIONHeading into 2022  exportable global wheat stocks were already razor thin. USDA's February projection showed stocks-to-use among key suppliers at an all-time low by mid-2022  so the Ukraine invasion was a particular shock for the market.Before February  Ukraine accounted for near 10% of the world's wheat exports  but that is estimated near 5% now. Top exporter Russia's wheat shipments have been much better than a year ago  helping to keep a lid on prices  though Ukraine's volume last month was down 20% on the year.Uncertainties with Ukraine did not attract participants to the market this year  as open interest in both CBOT wheat futures and options has hovered at more than decade lows. The late February invasion had no meaningful impact on that trend.CBOT wheat trading volumes were moderately impacted. Average monthly volume in March was 4% above the five-year normal  but it was below normal in every other month in 2022. The biggest departure was 43% in April  then volumes stayed around 30% below average for the following four months before improving later in the year.Mild volumes and interest mean that changes in speculative positioning have been very slow  though money managers have built their most bearish CBOT wheat view since May 2019. Through November  funds' average 2022 weekly buying or selling in wheat was the lightest since 2008.WEAK WHEATCBOT wheat is particularly weak against competitors. Front-month December contracts are in delivery  but on a second-month basis  European wheat's premium versus Chicago reached 45 euros per tonne this week  the largest since May 2012.Second-month Kansas City wheat is just over a dollar per bushel more expensive than Chicago  which has been the case throughout the last month. But before November  the K.C. premium had not consistently maintained those levels since 2014.In 2014  the U.S. hard red winter (HRW) wheat crop  reflected by K.C. futures  took a sharp downturn coming out of the winter  resulting in very poor yields. The current HRW crop is in terrible condition  but general global wheat supplies were building in a strong way in 2014  which is not the expected outcome this year.CBOT wheat usually sits at a premium to CBOT corn  but it has lost significant ground to its yellow grain competitor. Most-active wheat's premium to corn on Tuesday slipped below 92 cents per bushel  its lowest since July 2021. It had opened the month above $1.20.But the new level is closer to ""normal"" compared with most of this year. Wheat's premium to corn averaged $3 per bushel from March through July  which had not been seen since 2008. Historically  something around $1 or just above has been a more long-term sustainable level.Wheat's losses against corn come as corn also hits multi-month lows. Most-active corn futures Tuesday dropped to the lowest levels since August  settling at $6.37-1/4 per bushel. That is down nearly 9% since the start of November  the most for the period in 11 years.Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical ...","Leniolisib was well tolerated and significant improvement over placebo was notable in the co-primary endpoints  reflecting a favorable impact on patients' immune dysregulation and deficiencyThe peer-reviewed publication heightens international understanding of APDS  a rare and recently characterized immunodeficiencyLEIDEN  Netherlands  Dec. 7  2022 /CNW/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

While we had already demonstrated JCDecaux‚Äôs place among the most responsible companies when we first won the EcoVadis award in 2021 with a ‚ÄúGold‚Äù medal  we are very proud to have been given the ‚ÄúPlatinum‚Äù medal this year  the highest accolade given by EcoVadis  clearly outperforming the sector average.

Breaks Ground on 1.1 mtpa Blue Ammonia Site in Texas  USA,AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OCI N.V. (Euronext: OCI) today announced that construction is starting on what currently will be the largest blue ammonia facility to come onstream in Texas  wholly owned by OCI N.V. Today‚Äôs groundbreaking puts the project on track‚Ä¶,AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OCI N.V. (Euronext: OCI) today announced that construction is starting on what currently will be the largest blue ammonia facility to come onstream in Texas  wholly owned by OCI N.V. Today‚Äôs groundbreaking puts the project on track for production to begin as scheduled in 2025. The project also received its air permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) on 1 December 2022  another significant milestone.The project‚Äôs site is adjacent to OCI‚Äôs existing integrated 1.4 million metric ton per year methanol-ammonia production facility in Beaumont and 1.8 million metric ton per year 50%-owned methanol joint venture  Natgasoline  and leverages the significant and growing capabilities that exist in Southeast Texas for blue and green ammonia and hydrogen production. The area already has extensive existing hydrogen pipeline delivery infrastructure  hydrogen storage capability and industrial customers. South East Texas also has a wealth of companies leading in energy technology integration  deployment  operations  and maintenance  and a skilled labor force in clean energy.Nassef Sawiris  Executive Chair of OCI N.V. said: ‚ÄúWe are delighted that OCI is expanding its already significant presence in South-East Texas  a region which  as a clean energy leader and with its strategic location  plays a key role in the growing low-to-zero carbon hydrogen industry and is one of the best places globally to invest in this area. We look forward to continuing our partnerships with Jefferson County  the City of Beaumont  Beaumont ISD  the special districts  and the State of Texas.‚ÄùAhmed El-Hoshy  Chief Executive Officer of OCI N.V.  commented: ‚ÄúThe potential for clean ammonia to solve many of our global problems has become increasingly clear. It is not only an essential fertilizer that ensures food security for over 4 billion people  low-carbon ammonia is a clean fuel that provides an ideal solution available today for hard-to-abate sectors such as power and shipping. This world-scale facility will be a significant part of that  resulting in a very significant reduction in carbon emissions equivalent to taking almost half a million cars off the road permanently. The potential here is great and I‚Äôm delighted that breaking ground today signifies we‚Äôre on track to deliver on that.‚ÄùOCI will upgrade ‚Äúover-the-fence‚Äù blue hydrogen to produce blue ammonia  where over 95% of carbon emissions will be captured and sequestered. This allows OCI to materially reduce the carbon intensity of its products for downstream customers along the value chain  resulting in carbon footprint reductions across a wide range of industries including transportation  power  manufacturing and agriculture.The ammonia plant uses KBR technology and the EP (‚ÄúEngineering and Procurement‚Äù) contract was awarded to Maire Tecnimont in March 2022.Blue ammonia is produced from hydrogen derived from natural gas where the CO 2 by-product is captured and sequestered. Green ammonia is produced from hydrogen based on renewable sources such as wind and solar rather than fossil fuels. This project has been designed to transition from blue to green ammonia production in the future as green hydrogen becomes available at larger scale.OCI is also continuing its investments in the future talent of the area. OCI recently announced a $200k donation to the Beaumont Independent School District to develop opportunities to expand STEM education for students  continuing its long-term partnership with the school district.About OCI N.V.OCI N.V. (Euronext: OCI) is a leading global producer and distributor of hydrogen-based products providing low carbon fertilizers  fuels  and feedstock to agricultural  transportation  and industrial customers around the world. OCI‚Äôs production capacity spans four continents and comprises approximately 16.2 million metric tons per year of hydrogen-based products including nitrogen fertilizers  methanol  biofuels  diesel exhaust fluid  melamine  and other products.

Bureau Veritas conducted this independent assurance against the framework of ISO:26000 ‚Äì Guidance on Social Responsibility.Based on an intensive review over two weeks  Bureau Veritas concluded ‚Äúnothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the use of International Standard ISO 26000 does not adhere to the recommendations and guidelines there included. Likewise  nothing makes or has made us think that information analyzed during this assurance exercise is somehow incorrect or misleading‚Äù.The main findings of the review are:Management team is highly aware of social responsibility matters. The company has taken serious steps towards inclusion  diversity  and non-discrimination  which is highly valued by employees. The company shows maturity in the way of managing relevant matters and employees‚Äô expectations.It is important to highlight initiatives such as volunteering and mental health programs  as well as the fact that employees are aware of the consultation and claims mechanisms available in the company.Nothing has led Bureau Veritas to believe that labor or human rights are not respected at Teleperformance Colombia.From a general perspective  Bureau Veritas considers the following opportunities for improvement: document the due diligence exercise related to human rights: work hand-in-hand with other areas in order to boost a socially responsible conduct in all processes and in the company as a whole; transfer the good practices management systems in place to the social responsibility management system and hold more accountability meetings at national level.‚ÄùIn the spirit of transparency  the Bureau Veritas summary report (as received by Teleperformance) is accessible on Teleperformance by clicking here.About Teleperformance GroupTeleperformance (TEP ‚Äì ISIN: FR0000051807 ‚Äì Reuters: TEPRF.PA - Bloomberg: TEP FP)  the global leader in outsourced customer and citizen experience management and related digital services  serves as a strategic partner to the world‚Äôs largest companies in many industries.

Coming to PC  PlayStation 4|5  Xbox X|S  Nintendo Switch  and Atari VCS in early 2023  Akka Arrh is another great addition to Atari‚Äôs growing portfolio of new retro-infused titles.A chaotic explosion of synthwave madness  Akka Arrh completely encapsulates creator Jeff Minter‚Äôs sense of humor  his love of psychedelic color and light  and his ability to create pure arcade bliss. A frenzied kaleidoscope of neon insanity  Akka Arrh brings back the arcade experience with a vengeance.Watch the Akka Arrh reveal trailer:YouTube | DownloadAkka Arrh combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade cabinet with the unique creative vision of Jeff Minter. Akka Arrh is based on an arcade prototype that was released in 1982 to a small test market. Unfortunately  the project was scrapped because players found the game too difficult. Due to its exceptionally short production run  only three Akka Arrh cabinets are still known to exist. Now  players have the chance to experience not just one of Atari‚Äôs rarest games  but one of the rarest games of the arcade era!Jeff Minter has a storied career that includes the creation of nearly 100 games spanning almost every generation of console. Among the two dozen titles he created for Atari and Atari hardware are Tempest 2000  Tempest 3000  and Tempest 4000‚Ñ¢. Akka Arrh embodies his signature psychedelic style and ability to craft a uniquely chaotic but extremely fun arcade experience.Key Features of Akka Arrh:A Whirlwind of Electrifying Color: From the mind of Jeff Minter  players will experience a cascade of words  color  shapes and sound flows as they mount the Akka Arrh and fend off attackers. An explosion of dazzling neon graphics  Akka Arrh is a visually stunning  action-packed arcade shooter.Ready  Aim  Fire!: Akka Arrh shares the name with the game‚Äôs titular star cannon  in which players control from a fixed turret called the Sentinel. Featuring fast-paced wave-shooter action  players will prevent enemies from penetrating the Sentinel‚Äôs perimeter  zooming into close range combat and beat them back if they penetrate their defenses.Mystifying Modes to Master: With two modes of play  pilots can start from the beginning and battle their way through 50 unique levels  or pick up where they left off to power through to the end.Accessibility is Key: Though Llamasoft is known for mind-blowing and vivid visual effects  not everyone is able to enjoy them.

The company has helped eliminate or reduce water and wastewater bills for eligible residents across the country through a number of programs amounting to more than $9 million in funding to date.‚ÄúThe last few years have been challenging for people everywhere. Following an unprecedented pandemic  inflation is resulting in rising costs for almost everything ‚Äù said Karine Rouge  CEO of Municipal Water for Veolia North America. ‚ÄúThis is particularly difficult for working families who may be struggling just to keep up with basic needs like water. Water is an essential resource and we must do our part to help those who need it most.‚ÄùThe company has facilitated bill relief through multiple programs aimed at helping families.The company has helped reduce or eliminate $2.5 million in payments in 2022 for customers as part of LIHWAP  a federally funded program administered by individual states to help low-income households with past due water bills. Individual customers can apply for up to $2 500 to pay down their water debt. Customers can visit their respective state LIHWAP websites  local social service agencies or call their local customer service center for more information.Earlier this year  Veolia also worked closely with regulators in select states to forgive water bills that were in arrears totaling over $6.8 million. Eligible customers in this program received a one-time automatic credit on their bills  further relieving the financial pressures faced by working families.Veolia Cares is a non-profit organization that has granted nearly $50 000  year-to-date  to customers who need temporary assistance with their water bills. Eligible households may have their water bills reduced once per year. To learn more  visit: cares.veolia.org.‚ÄúWe encourage customers who may need help to take advantage of these programs if they have not done so already. While water bills are often the smallest part of a household budget  every little bit helps ‚Äù said Rouge.By the end of 2022  these initiatives are expected to reach nearly $10 million across the company‚Äôs footprint  reflecting Veolia‚Äôs renewed commitment to the communities it serves.About Veolia: Veolia Group aims to be the benchmark company for ecological transformation.

That‚Äôs according to a new poll from the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council that involved more than 1 300 people who work for or support life science companies. The poll  taken earlier this fall  shows 57 percent of workers say they primarily drive alone  versus taking another form of transportation  compared with 44 percent in 2019. Only 16 percent said they ride the bus or subway  and 9 percent say they take commuter rail  compared with 26 percent and 15 percent  respectively  three years ago. MassBio said workers are driving more and using public transportation less frequently because of a lack of reliability and flexibility seen among the various MBTA bus and train lines. One-third of the workers said they do not work from home at all  presumably because many of them work in labs  while two-thirds work from home at least one day a week. ‚Äî JON CHESTOGet Innovation Beat Boston Globe tech reporters tell the story of the region's technology and innovation industry  highlighting key players  trends  and why they matter.

Hauck is assembling a team unlike any other to launch something special from Q1  2023. Hauck ha...,SINGAPORE - It‚Äôs hospitality  but not as you know it at Mondrian Duxton Singapore  where General Manager  maverick and all-round mischief-maker Robert C. Hauck is assembling a team unlike any other to launch something special from Q1  2023.Hauck has taken a unique approach to hiring under Mondrian‚Äôs ‚Äòunexpected talents‚Äô mantra  scouring the streets and hunting in all the right places for the cream of creative types and inspired individuals from both within and outside the industry to deliver a guest experience with a difference.Call him a conductor  a disruptor  or one who marches to a different drummer; just don‚Äôt call him conventional. Hauck has built a career on breaking new ground and thinking outside the box. Now  this philosophy is given free rein at Singapore‚Äôs most eagerly awaited hotel.Any hotel is only as good as the people who bring it to life  says Hauck. Mondrian has given me the freedom to do something truly innovative and really cast the net wide in taking a new approach to assembling a team. It‚Äôs all about creating a place for individuals and personalities with a lot to offer but who may not fit in to a conventional hotel. They might be misfits in a sense  but they‚Äôll fit in here.‚ÄúHere‚Äù is Duxton Hill  Singapore‚Äôs happening precinct non-pareil  home to the latest addition to the Mondrian family of hotels  joining the brand‚Äôs properties in Los Angeles  New York  Miami  London  Cannes  Doha and Seoul. Since its launch in LA in 1996 by Ian Schrager  Mondrian Hotels have been brought to life by the quality of their people and a commitment to creativity  art and the unexpected.Hauck has begun the hiring process by staring at a blank canvas and painting in bold and unexpected strokes. He has already assembled a core team of over 70 people  ensuring there‚Äôs a solid backbone of experienced industry operators to which he has added rebels  dreamers and outsiders  creating a fresh perspective for the hotel  a new energy and a collective entrepreneurial spirit.Mondrian Singapore Duxton‚Äôs ‚ÄòUnexpected Talents‚Äô‚Äî Photo by AccorAvatar of Hauck‚Äôs approach is full body-tattooed Ah Seng  who has turned his life around since leaving prison and has always dreamt of having his own restaurant. He has now been hired to be the manager of Bistro 126  Mondrian‚Äôs staff restaurant at their hip Shophouse office space. Or take Raymond Leong  64  senior sales manager of an events and cruise company  laid off during the pandemic  who reinvented himself as a Grab driver  now hired as a quality and training manager  a job he always aspired to doing.Unexpected talents with diverse backgrounds can be found everywhere. An elderly cleaner who has three diplomas in marketing repurposed as public area supervisor and director of inspiration. An executive assistant who had been enjoying a retirement baking sourdough bread but got bored  after a career in strategic brand planning for brands that are household names. Social media and visual marketing tyros  fresh graduates  a former Olympian athlete  a luxury fashion expert and award-winning bartenders. These are among the passionate and talented characters given another chance to find their calling.But how to find them? Hauck‚Äôs team can be seen handing out ‚ÄòWe like your style‚Äô cards to begin a conversation. My motto is chase talent  don‚Äôt wait  he says. From tattoo conventions to alternative gigs  from art happenings to theatre and sport  it‚Äôs about casting the net wide and knowing true talent when you see it. This will be the essence of what we are bringing to the market at Mondrian Singapore Duxton.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

We look forward to continuing to work with regulatory agencies to make bimekizumab available to people living with psoriatic arthritis as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of US  UCB.Data from BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE show that both studies met their primary and all ranked secondary endpoints.1 2 A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved improvements in joint symptoms at week 16 compared with placebo ‚Äì as measured by ACR50  the primary endpoint ‚Äì with a consistent clinical response observed in both biologic-na√Øve and TNFi-IR populations (p<0.0001 for each). In addition  at week 16  a significantly higher proportion of bimekizumab-treated patients compared with placebo achieved high levels of skin clearance ‚Äì as measured by PASI 90  a secondary endpoint ‚Äì with a consistent clinical response in both populations (p<0.0001 for each). The safety profile of bimekizumab was consistent with safety data seen in previous studies with no new observed safety signals.1 2Story continuesBimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Notes to editors:About BE OPTIMALBE OPTIMAL was a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  active reference (adalimumab)  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis  who are biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug na√Øve. For additional details on the study  see article in The Lancet.1About BE COMPLETEBE COMPLETE was a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFŒ±i).2 All enrolled study participants had a history of inadequate response (lack of efficacy after at least three months of therapy at an approved dose) or intolerance to treatment with one or two TNFŒ±i for either psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. For additional details on the study  see article in The Lancet.2About Psoriatic ArthritisPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a serious  highly heterogeneous  chronic  systemic inflammatory condition affecting both the joints and skin  with a prevalence of 0.02 percent to 0.25 percent of the population  and 6 percent to 41 percent of patients with psoriasis.3 Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness  skin plaques  swollen toes and fingers (dactylitis)  and inflammation of the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone (enthesitis).4About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.5 6 In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.6 7 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.ReferencesMcInnes I.B.

(NYSE: CLF)  the largest flat-rolled steel company in North America  have executed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for 180 megawatts (MW) of the 200-MW Headwaters III Wind Farm in Randolph County. This PPA is included in the announcement EDPR issued on Tuesday  November 15  2022. Headwaters III  located approximately 70 miles east of Indianapolis along the Ohio border  is anticipated to be operational in 2025 and will annually power the equivalent of more than 54 000 average Indiana homes.EDPR NA has developed and will construct  own  and operate Headwaters III Wind Farm  which is an extension of the operational 200-MW Headwaters I Wind Farm and the 198-MW Headwaters II Wind Farm in Randolph County. The project will create hundreds of jobs during peak construction and will employ local team members to operate and perform routine maintenance on the wind farm. Additional economic benefits in the form of landowner payments  local government payments  and an increase of money spent at businesses in the vicinity of the project will be disbursed as a result of the wind farm‚Äôs entrance into Winchester and projected 30-year lifespan. Headwaters III will save approximately 355 million gallons of water a year  which is the amount of water that would be needed by conventional generation sources to produce the same amount of capacity as the wind farm. The project will produce clean energy while minimizing impacts on wildlife  habitat  and other environmental resources.Cleveland-Cliffs and EDP Renewables‚Äô Headwaters III Wind Farm partnership will mutually benefit both parties  affording Cleveland-Cliffs the opportunity to advance its environmental and social sustainability goals  and enabling EDPR NA to expand its portfolio in Indiana  where it reinforces and maintains its position as the top producer of wind energy in the state.‚ÄúA key priority of Cleveland-Cliffs‚Äô greenhouse gas reduction strategy revolves around the efficient use of energy and clean energy.

They are successful properties combining yields and potential for value creation. This acquisition has a transformative effect for MRM  increasing the value of its portfolio by more than 50%  with potential for improvement in profitability and changing its shareholding structure  while also keeping the Company‚Äôs net debt at a controlled level.Fran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors  comments: ‚ÄúThe finalisation of this major acquisition  which has a significant structural effect on MRM  marks a real change of dimension for the Company. It has increased the value of its portfolio by more than 50%  while also keeping debt at a controlled level. We are delighted to count Altarea  a leading name in the real estate sector  as one of our shareholders. This attests to its confidence in our Company‚Äôs ability to create value.‚ÄùFran√ßois Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  adds: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that all stages leading to the acquisition of two shopping centres from Altarea have been completed successfully and on schedule. This acquisition has a structural effect and open up new opportunities for growth with the rollout of our proactive asset management policy on the basis of a larger portfolio. In the medium term  we are aiming for annualised net rents in excess of ‚Ç¨16 million and an improvement in our profitability thanks to better absorption of our fixed costs.‚ÄùRodrigo Clare  Altarea‚Äôs representative on MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors  states: ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to be able to support MRM in its strategic development thanks to the agreement reached with the Company and its main shareholder  SCOR SE. With its experienced team  MRM has the strengths required to make the most of its retail asset portfolio through dynamic management and know-how to adapt to changing consumer trends.‚ÄùAcquisition processThe final stage of the acquisition by MRM of the Assets Sold from Altarea was achieved today  with the settlement-delivery and admission to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris of the new MRM shares issued within the framework of its capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders in the amount of ‚Ç¨29 million  with SCOR SE subscribing to ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨4 million  carried out on 5 December 2022.Overall  the acquisition of the Assets Sold entailed (i) a capital increase of the Company by means of a contribution in kind reserved for Altarea in the amount of ‚Ç¨21 million1 and (ii) the above-mentioned capital increase of the Company with preferential subscription rights for shareholders. Representing a total of ‚Ç¨50 million  the two capital increases were carried out at a unit subscription price equal to MRM‚Äôs replacement NAV per share as at 30 June 2022  i.e. ‚Ç¨48.92. SCOR SE subscribed to an amount of ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨25 million. The remainder of the acquisition price was financed by means of a ‚Ç¨42 million bank loan with a pool of banks comprising Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel  LCL and BRED Banque Populaire. Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel acted as agent and co-arranger  and LCL acted as co-arranger.This financing structure has enabled MRM to maintain a net LTV ratio of less than 45%  compared with 40.7% as at 30 June 2022.Significant increase in the size of MRM‚Äôs portfolioThe acquisition of the Carrefour shopping centre in Flins-sur-Seine  Yvelines  and the Carrefour shopping centre in Ollioules  Var  has resulted in a change of dimension for MRM. As well as establishing its presence in two fast-growing regions  this acquisition has increased the size of its portfolio by 52% from ‚Ç¨163.0 million to ‚Ç¨247.3 million  on the basis of values excluding transfer taxes as at 30 June 2022.This extension of the portfolio is reflected by the sharp rise in MRM‚Äôs annualised net rents from ‚Ç¨9.5 million to ‚Ç¨15.0 million2. The target of annualised net rents of ‚Ç¨10.0 million prior to the acquisition has therefore been increased to more than ‚Ç¨16.0 million. MRM expects the increase in its rental income to have a positive impact on its net operating cash flow generation and is hoping to improve its profitability in the medium term thanks to better absorption of its fixed costs.Positioned as market leaders within their catchment areas and with physical occupancy rates2 of 97% and 92% respectively  the Flins-sur-Seine and Ollioules shopping centres3 present much higher net rental yields than those generated by MRM‚Äôs portfolio prior to the acquisition. Furthermore  the two properties offer potential for value creation that will enable MRM to roll out its asset management expertise (refurbishment  partial redevelopment  proactive rental management  changes in the retailer mix) across a wider portfolio.Enhanced shareholding structure and changes in governanceFollowing the issuing of new shares in relation to the two capital increases carried out within the framework of the acquisition  SCOR SE and Altarea hold stakes4 of 56.63% and 15.94% respectively. The Company‚Äôs free float stands at 27.35%.MRM also reiterates that Altarea was appointed as a board member at the combined general meeting of 16 November 2022. As of this date  the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors comprises:Fran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Board member;SCOR SE  Board member  represented by Karina Leli√®vre;Altarea  Board member  represented by Rodrigo Clare;Brigitte Gauthier-Darcet  independent Board member;Val√©rie Ohannessian  independent Board member; andKarine Tr√©baticky  Board member.Resumption of the liquidity agreementThe liquidity agreement administered by Invest Securities  which was suspended after close of trading on 15 November 2022 within the framework of the launch of the Company‚Äôs capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders  will resume before market opening tomorrow  Thursday 8 December 2022.Ordinary general meeting of 14 December 2022At its combined general meeting of 16 November 2022  the Company failed to reach the quorum required for the first convening of the meeting to be able to validly deliberate on the sixth resolution of the ordinary part of the meeting.Another ordinary general meeting was therefore convened at 3.00 p.m. on 14 December 2022 at the Company‚Äôs head office for shareholders to vote on the sixth resolution (Notice of Second Convocation published in the Bulletin des Annonces L√©gales Obligatoires on 25 November 2022 n¬∞ 141 - Announcement n¬∞ 2204498 and in the ACTU-JURIDIQUE.FR legal notices on 25 November 2022).# # #MRM‚Äôs advisors for the whole transaction are Gimar & Co (financial advisor)  De Pardieu Brocas Maffei (legal advisor) and Lasaygues (notary).# # #About MRMMRM is a listed real estate investment company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the positive results of a Phase 3 clinical trial of the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) inhibitor  in adult and adolescent patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  have been published in Blood 1 the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. Data from this study was previously announced on February 2  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.) (PRNewswire)The paper  entitled 'Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Phase 3 Trial of PI3KŒ¥ Inhibitor Leniolisib for Activated PI3KŒ¥ Syndrome'  outlined results from the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized clinical trial  which enrolled 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years or older. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 70 mg leniolisib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Improvement over placebo was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and increase in na√Øve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and correction of immunodeficiency in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between leniolisib and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (-0.38  -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of na√Øve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). Leniolisib was well tolerated  and fewer patients receiving leniolisib reported study treatment-related adverse events (mostly grades 1-2) compared to those receiving placebo (23.8% vs 30.0%).Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""Pharming continues to provide significant support for the immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation is dedicated to early diagnosis and finding meaningful treatments for primary immunodeficiency  and we are acutely aware of the challenges faced by people with APDS. The publication of study results in this patient population in such a distinguished and widely read journal advances these goals.""Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""As we continue to seek a better understanding of APDS as a recently characterized rare disease  we remain committed to sharing our findings with researchers and doctors around the world. With this commitment in mind  we are pleased the results of this Phase III clinical trial in leniolisib have been published in the flagship journal of the American Society of Hematology.The APDS patient population  and their families  have lived with unmet needs and without targeted therapies  and the publishing of this study is an integral step in improving the patient journey for this community. We are proud to share these results which demonstrated leniolisib to be a well-tolerated  targeted therapy for APDS. We thank all of our study participants and investigators for their efforts and the essential role they played in the development of leniolisib.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million. APDS is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.2 3 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.2 4 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.5 6 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.7 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.5-8 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K. PI3KŒ¥ is expressed predominately in hematopoietic cells and is essential to normal immune system function through conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Leniolisib inhibits the production of PIP3 and PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for immune diseases such as APDS. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study in patients with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

It is June 2025 ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI can only speak for my term here. Beyond my time here  what can happen? None of us can predict that.‚ÄúWe were extending equivalence  but only on the basis that we would move towards making sure we had oversight on clearing ‚Äù Ms McGuinness said. ‚ÄúSo I think the market knows. It knows what we want it to do.‚ÄùRead MoreYesterday  the Commission released a slew of amendments to existing laws that will force banks to move ‚Äúa portion‚Äù of euro-denominated derivatives contracts to Europe.The move will affect interest rate derivatives denominated in euro and Polish zloty  and credit default swaps - contracts where investors bet on companies or countries going bust.What we‚Äôre doing is in the interests of the European UnionBut it‚Äôs not clear what percentage or number of the contracts will be cleared in Europe. That will be decided by the EU‚Äôs markets regulator after the rules are adopted.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a figure and I think it‚Äôs better that we don‚Äôt have a figure ‚Äù Ms McGuinness said. ‚ÄúWe have an objective and we have a reason why we‚Äôre doing it  which is around strengthening our own infrastructure and around our own financial stability.‚ÄùChanges to the bloc‚Äôs clearing and listing regimes are a further step in building what it calls a capital markets union.Ms McGuinness said it‚Äôs not a bid to steal British business.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never framed what we are doing as taking from. I‚Äôve always said the objective is to strengthen the EU‚Äôs financial infrastructure. I think we‚Äôve moved on from earlier days of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs mine is mine‚Äô.‚ÄúWhen we look at our relationship with the United Kingdom  sanctions have unified a lot of countries  [and] brought together the UK and the European Union.‚ÄúI would hope there is an understanding in London that what we‚Äôre doing is in the interests of the European Union  and we fully respect the right and capacity of the United Kingdom to do what it needs to do around its financial industry  in its interests.‚ÄúI think there is a healthy respect for why we are doing this.‚Äù‚ÄãExpand Close Stephane Boujnah is chief executive officer of Euronext.

All of this is part of the same value chain.""Below is the translation in English of the original article in French.Special thanks go to the monthly magazine G√©om√®tre¬© as well as to Marielle Mayo.The Abode of Chaos  a metaverse in the makingLocated close to the French city of Lyon  The ""Abode of Chaos"" (Demeure du Chaos) and its open-air museum of contemporary art have been completely digitized in collaboration with a firm of land surveyors. The resulting data will serve as the basis for the creation of a metaverse in the form of an escape game...MARIELLE MAYOIn the hills just north of Lyon  nestled between the verdant Monts d'Or and the river Sa√¥ne  the village of Saint-Romain-au-Mont-d'Or offers a haven of tranquility. Upon arrival  you may be forgiven for experiencing a certain surprise when you discover  at the bend of a road lined with bourgeois sandstone houses  the blackened enclosure walls of the Abode of Chaos  entirely tagged with inscriptions and portraits‚Ä¶ street art style. Behind these walls  Thierry Ehrmann  an entrepreneur and an artist-sculptor has transformed the Domaine de la source  a 17th-century property  into an open-air museum of contemporary art where monumental sculptures  shipping containers  giant skulls  aircraft wrecks  and industrial machinery rub shoulders with hundreds of large-scale mural portraits  inscriptions and a plethora of esoteric formulas. Thanks to extensive work undertaken since 2020 by the multidisciplinary teams of land surveyors  TT G√©om√®tres Experts  this post-apocalyptic artworks has now been completely digitized.""Remarkable contemporary architecture""Founder of Groupe Serveur  a company specializing in databases  and of its subsidiary Artprice  a global player in art market information  Thierry Ehrmann has always been a digital pioneer and has been interested in computer-generated imagery since its origins. So  despite the somewhat daunting challenge  creating a virtual duplicate of the Abode of Chaos seemed a perfectly logical step. In the end  the various lockdowns associated with the Covid-19 crisis provided a perfect opportunity for the museum to close its doors and initiate the work. It also coincided with an initiative to obtain the ""Remarkable Contemporary Architecture"" label  which  apart from establishing a formal architectural analysis of the Abode  sought to obtain official cultural recognition as a way of protecting his ""great work"" in a long-standing legal dispute with the local municipality that began in 2004.With this in mind  Ehrmann approached architect Nicolas Detry  a specialist in the ""patrimoine martyr""  because  with its scarified walls  its bricked-up windows  its floor gutted by a meteorite  the old estate has been transformed into a 'total work of art'  drowned ""in a permanent state of war""  with certain installations recalling the attacks of September 11  2001  and major planet-damaging events such as oil spills  all surrounded by portraits and inscriptions echoing global news. Indeed  each of Ehrmann's interventions  as well as those of his guest artists  posit new traces of our tormented era. A formal architectural analysis of the site was therefore an important step in elucidating the artist's approach  and a highly detailed architectural survey of the property was an essential part of this process. ""We decided to digitize the entire site ‚Äì the 6 300 works of art  the sculptures  the volumes  the buildings  the plants  everything! ‚Äì using European heritage conservation standards  with surface and volume meshing for the whole space"" says Thierry Ehrmann. Nicolas Detry put him in contact with Philippe Barth√©lemy  head of the TTGE group's 3D Lab.The first meeting in July 2020 established the basis for a technical documentary project with a scientific digital dimension  geo-referenced and endowed with sub-centimeter resolution. ""I have been familiar with the most advanced 3D imaging systems for twenty years. What we needed was a team of top-level land surveyors! Their role as experts in collecting spatial data is vital in recreating virtual spaces that faithfully represent real spaces  and that is what we wanted!"" enthuses Thierry Ehrmann. The objective was to capture the singularity of each work  but also to create graphic illustrations allowing a better comprehension of the whole site  notably by highlighting certain recurring artistic/architectural features such as additions of materials (poured concrete  inclusions of meteorites in the facades  etc.) and the removal of certain materials. ""In the real world  I used a cherry-picker to 'sculpt' the thousands of square meters of the site's facades with a hammer and chisel""  explains the visual artist.The submission date for the base project was fixed for November 2020  and a tight schedule was drawn up for the data acquisition ‚Äì covering 7555 m2 out of the total 9000 m2 surface area ‚Äì as well as the processing and the calibrated colorization of all the different artistic and architectural initiatives. Philippe Barth√©lemy worked with a team of around fifteen TTGE employees  each with their area of expertise. ""We developed a specific and flexible methodology in order to manage the complexity and volume of the data produced during the acquisition process"" he explains. The mission included the creation of a polygonal geo-referenced map  Lidar data acquisition  and a high-resolution photogrammetric survey of the whole site  as well as all the calculations and processing required for the creation of a resized geo-referenced 3D digital twin. Ground data was acquired using a Z+F 3D laser scanner (Zoller & Fr√∂hlich) and a NavVis VLX mobile scanning system  with Lidar and photogrammetric surveys carried out using drones. ""The technical challenge was to work with heterogeneous acquisition data and merge the results to enhance the quality of the digital twin"" specifies the engineer.Beyond the purely technical challenge  this extraordinary project involved measuring artistic and architectural initiatives accurately and proposing modes of representation that serve as real tools for understanding and documenting the works. ""Land-surveying can be extremely useful in a wide variety of contexts as long as the teams adapt to the specific requirements of each site""  says Philippe Barth√©l√©my. So  while Nicolas Detry and historian/archaeologist Rapha√´lle Rivi√®re produced their historical and archeological analysis of the site  the team from TTGE provided site and elevation plans  architectural surveys and orthophotographs  3D models  longitudinal and transverse sections  heat maps using color gradients to highlight the additions and removal of materials  using different methods of illustration to compose eleven graphic plates to identify and highlight the major works. In short  the potential uses of digital data are numerous: measuring and documenting the evolution of the site  planning new projects  simulations  etc.TTGE also produced 37 000 360¬∞ panoramic shots and 18 000 360¬∞ 4K and 8K videos  the time-stamped and localized files corresponding respectively to 940 GB and 1.2 TB of data. All in all  the results of their work provided a perfect base for Thierry Ehrmann's latest project: ""The idea is to make a metaverse (editor's note: a virtual meta-universe) of the Abode""  he explains. As a first step  he asked TTGE's innovation center to develop an interface for the general public  allowing immersive visits in virtual and augmented reality. ""In this virtual environment  the public will be able to discover new aspects of the Abode  for example  by climbing safely onto the platform above the east wing  going inside certain works  and accessing the Abode's private areas. Everyone will also be able to access the historical documentation as well as the videos""  summarizes Thierry Ehrmann.A dynamic digital twinA smart navigation system should be launched in the first half of 2023. ""We see the metaverse as a dynamic digital twin  the challenge being to bring it to life and allow exchanges between the creator and his audience""  emphasizes Philippe Barthelemy. The recommendation engine's algorithms will guide the ""experiencer"" in an intimate discovery of the artist's approach and the connections between the works based on the experiencer's sensitivity to the history and/or the aesthetics of the works  the techniques used and the geo-political or esoteric messages  and it will offer him/her a tailor-made route through the collections. This is the first stone of a larger metaverse  which will also offer an ""agora"" to host thematic events and integrate art market-related activities initiated by Artprice  and notably an NFT Marketplace (as NFT technology allows the exchange of digital works associated with a cyber register [blockchain] that is deemed to hold unfalsifiable titles of ownership).An intelligent point becomes intelligible‚Ä¶All of this might seem far removed from the job of a land surveyor... But  for Philippe Barth√©l√©my  the advent of metaverses in the service of culture offers opportunities to a profession that will greatly benefit from the integration of new skills  particularly in AI  to position themselves in the market. ""The land surveyor has the expertise to certify a point in space. With the development of digital technology  almost infinite information fields can be associated with it. In the metaverse  our objective is to transform this 'intelligent' point into an 'intelligible' point by resorting to algorithms. All of this is part of the same value chain "" he concludes.KEY DATES & FIGURES:1999The Abode of Chaos becomes an open-air museum of contemporary art (Mus√©e l'Organe) created in 1999.

The transaction involves a bond with a volume of EUR 20 million  a term of two years and a coupon of 2.381%. Deutsche Bank acted as lead manager for this transaction  and Hengeler Mueller as legal advisor.‚ÄúDigitalisation is a central component of our KfWplus strategy adopted in April. It is therefore remarkable that KfW‚Äôs treasury and transaction management have implemented this pioneering electronic transaction via the D7 platform. As one of the world‚Äôs largest capital market issuers  innovation in the area of our refinancing is important to us in order to improve efficiency and reduce operating risks and transaction costs ‚Äù said Melanie Kehr  Member of the Executive Board of KfW Group.‚ÄúThis issue makes KfW a pioneer in its market segment and sends an important signal to market participants. The transaction ran smoothly and has paved the way for further issues from other issuers of fixed-income securities ‚Äù explained Tim Armbruster  Treasurer of KfW Group.In order to make even more effective use of the benefits of digitalisation  KfW is examining how further elements of the issuance process can be digitised. When using digital technologies  one of investors‚Äô main concerns should always be taken into account: the liquidity of bonds.Jens Hachmeister  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  says: ‚ÄúWith the digital post-trading platform D7  we are building a new infrastructure for future-ready markets worldwide. Like this  we offer our clients a significantly quicker and scalable solution for securities issuance. Following the successful launch of our structured products offering  we are now enhancing D7 to include the digital issuance of debt securities  such as commercial papers and straight bonds. We are thrilled that KfW is joining us on this journey. The outstanding market demand shows: the time to digitise financial markets is now.‚ÄùThe digital issuance of financial products via the D7 platform shortens the extensive and multi-day issuance process to just a few minutes. This saves time  manual effort and therefore processing costs. As a next step  Clearstream plans to enhance D7 with decentral capabilities and to offer it in further jurisdictions  e. g. Luxembourg  in line with the respective regulations and market interest. Like this  the central securities depository is creating a fully digital alternative to conventional securities issuance.Last year  the German legislator passed the Electronic Securities Act  which allows for the dematerialisation of a bond‚Äôs global note. The legislation gives bearer bond issuers the option to choose between conventional paper-based and electronic issuance. For the latter  an entry in an electronic securities register replaces the creation of a physical global note by the issuer.

For this reason  the shares of stock exchanges are similar to software companies. In addition  there is more trading in volatile times  which generally benefits stock exchange companies. Therefore  it is not surprising that this group of stocks has performed great over the past years.,"Tzido/iStock via Getty ImagesInvestment thesisDeutsche Borse Group (OTCPK:DBOEY) is the company behind the DAX index and the Xetra stock exchange  which many German investors are familiar with. Losing much money with the stock in the next few years is unlikely in my view. But  the valuation is too high  which makes the potential yield appear too low. However  for investors who want to park their money safely and are satisfied with a low dividend yield  the stock may be worth a second look.The business modelDeutsche B√∂rse is the German counterpart to Nasdaq (NDAQ) or London Stock Exchange (OTCPK:LDNXF). It operates major stock exchanges such as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  Xetra  and Tradegate. In addition to the traditional transaction business  the pre-trading business provides customers with all the necessary information in advance of a trade  such as analysis tools. The Post-Trading Business ensures smooth settlement and custody of securities. A subdivision of this is called Clearstream and is responsible for the settlement and custody of securities and ensures  among other things  that dividend payments are made to the relevant shareholders on the record date.The stock is one of the most successful German shares of the last 20 years. Even today  Germany is still a country with a relatively low proportion of shareholders  but this has risen sharply in recent decades  from which the company has been able to profit greatly.Data by YChartsRevenue distributionNet revenue 2022 YTD is ‚Ç¨3.2B  and 55% is recurring revenue. 52% comes from the trading & clearing segment. 24% from Securities Services. 15% Data & Analytics and 9% Fund Services.Investor presentationOverall  all areas are scalable and not very capital-intensive. For this reason  the shares of stock exchanges are similar to software companies. In addition  there is more trading in volatile times  which generally benefits stock exchange companies. Therefore  it is not surprising that this group of stocks has performed great over the past years.Data by YChartsRecent results & financialsIn the third quarter of 2022  revenue increased 30% YoY to ‚Ç¨1.09B  and earnings per share rose by 24% to ‚Ç¨2.15. Both results exceeded analysts' estimates. The company makes a distinction between structural and cyclical sales growth. The structural growth comes from new product innovations  for example  in the areas of index and analytics business  ESG  or fixed-income trading. Cyclical growth results from factors that cannot be directly influenced  such as high volatility in the market and the recent higher demand for currency- and inflation-hedged financial products. Structural growth has been 6% per year since 2019. Cyclical growth is only 1% per year. But this will be much better this year than in previous years  according to the company. It should benefit from higher volatility and rising interest rates.Higher volatility in 2022 has already compensated the cyclical net revenue decline in 2021. With higher interest rates  we now expect increasing cyclical net revenue and modest upside to expectations. Key areas of cyclical benefits include: Interest rates: fixed income derivatives (Trading & Clearing)net interest income (Securities Services)Volatility: index derivatives (Trading & Clearing) Investor presentationThe ""Trading and Clearing"" and ""Securities Services"" segments grew particularly strongly  by 31 and 38 percent  respectively. Trading and Clearing"" accounted for 52 percent of revenue and comprises securities trading and the settlement of investment instruments. The ""Securities Services"" segment includes the custody of these instruments and services for securities financing and the associated security management.""Data and Analytics"" contributed 15 percent of total revenue and grew 30 percent in the third quarter. This is the fastest growing area since 2019 and includes the most recurring revenue in percentage terms  currently at 94%.Management raises forecastsDue to the high volatility in the financial markets  the company adjusted its forecast for the 2022 financial year upward following the solid third quarter. The forecast for total revenue was raised from ‚Ç¨3.8B to ‚Ç¨4.1B  and EBITDA from ‚Ç¨2.2B to ‚Ç¨2.3B. Viewed over a more extended period  the development is very positive.Data by YChartsDividendThe following graph looks a bit chaotic at first sight because there are a few errors in it (the swings to zero for the dividend yield). But what you can see here is relatively simple. The dividend in Dollar or Euro has been rising for years  albeit rather slowly  but since the share price is growing even faster  the dividend yield is now only 1.88%. In 2015  it was 4%.Data by YChartsValuationThis raises the question of valuation because such a pattern is often seen when shares become more and more expensive over time  and the P/E ratio outruns the EPS. The company is currently valued at an enterprise value of $39.5B. The market cap is $33.3B  and the total debt is $5.1B.The P/E ratio will be 21 to 23 this year  depending on the last quarter's results. For next year  management estimates growth at 10%.This results in a P/E to growth ratio (PEG ratio) of more than two  which is rather expensive. Very cheap would be a PEG ratio below one. Generalizing the PEG ratio is difficult because you always have to consider other long-term factors. Since the dividend yield here is low and the long-term growth potential is difficult to assess  a PEG ratio of 2 is rather expensive.Data by YChartsI find it remarkable how strongly the stock has held up since a lot of money has flowed out of European and German stock markets. The German benchmark index is trading at a P/E ratio of under 10. But we see this pattern also with other shares of stock exchanges. These seem to get a higher P/E ratio attributed by the market generally.According to Fastgraphs  the long-term average P/E ratio is 20.6  and if the stock were to return to this average at the end of 2024  an annual return of 5.8% would be expected.fastgraphsRisksMore than 50% of the turnover still comes from how much is ultimately traded. Therefore  one of the most significant risks is that  in the long term  trading on German or European exchanges will decline. On the one hand  this can come from private investors who contribute a part but probably mainly from institutional investors who want to invest their money elsewhere. However  there is a lower limit here  as some government institutional investors have to invest their money in German government bonds  for example. However  as far as I know  there is no way to find out what percentage of the company's revenue comes from such institutional investors.There is also a risk that sales just stagnate. Then there is no reason the stock should trade at a P/E ratio of over 20 and would likely experience a general revaluation.Another risk is that the company's offerings are not unrivaled  but there are numerous exchanges in Europe. Euronext or London stock exchange are only two examples. But also in Germany  there are other stock exchanges such as the Munich Stock Exchange or Lang & Schwarz.ConclusionThe stock has performed exceptionally well over the last 20 years and will probably be able to expand its business in the coming years further. In the longer term  however  it is difficult to assess the potential for increasing revenue. Given this  the valuation is too high  and the dividend yield too low. However  if you want to park your money safely or are satisfied with only average annual returns  you should be fine here because of the high percentage of recurring income. If I owned the shares  I would sell and invest my money where the potential is higher.",negative,0.06,0.46,0.48,mixed,0.56,0.07,0.37,True,English,"['Solid Slow Grower', 'Deutsche Borse', 'DBOEY', 'cyclical net revenue decline', 'increasing cyclical net revenue', 'Deutsche B√∂rse', 'new product innovations', 'net interest income', 'fastest growing area', 'fixed income derivatives', 'rising interest rates', 'traditional transaction business', 'inflation-hedged financial products', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'cyclical sales growth', 'Deutsche Borse Group', 'associated security management', 'higher interest rates', 'recent higher demand', 'major stock exchanges', 'stock exchange companies', 'solid third quarter', 'many German investors', 'successful German shares', 'Xetra stock exchange', 'Securities Services"" segments', 'The Post-Trading Business', 'low dividend yield', 'Cyclical growth', 'cyclical benefits', 'German counterpart', 'low proportion', 'software companies', 'business model', 'pre-trading business', 'recent decades', 'financial markets', 'higher volatility', 'Revenue distribution', 'recurring revenue', 'total revenue', 'index derivatives', '9% Fund Services', 'Getty Images', 'Investment thesis', 'OTCPK:DBOEY', 'second look', 'necessary information', 'analysis tools', 'other things', 'record date', 'Investor presentation', 'volatile times', ""analysts' estimates"", 'modest upside', 'securities financing', 'percentage terms', 'extended period', 'following graph', 'first sight', 'P/E ratio', 'enterprise value', 'total debt', 'structural growth', 'Recent results', 'high volatility', 'potential yield', 'YCharts Dividend', 'analytics business', 'clearing segment', 'DAX index', '2022 financial year', 'past years', 'previous years', 'relevant shareholders', 'investment instruments', 'share price', 'market cap', 'smooth settlement', 'Key areas', 'fixed-income trading', 'securities trading', 'last 20 years', 'Tzido', 'iStock', 'company', 'money', 'next', 'view', 'Nasdaq', 'NDAQ', 'LDNXF', 'Tradegate', 'addition', 'customers', 'advance', 'custody', 'subdivision', 'payments', 'Germany', 'country', 'Data', 'YTD', 'reason', 'stocks', 'financials', 'earnings', 'distinction', 'example', 'ESG', 'factors', 'expectations', '38 percent', '52 percent', '15 percent', 'forecasts', 'EBITDA', 'development', 'errors', 'Dollar', 'Euro', 'Valuation', 'question', 'pattern', 'EPS', '2021', '31']",2022-12-08,2022-12-08,seekingalpha.com

What it does is operate  as this suggests  the stock market. The business has revenues in the billions  operates at appealing EBITDA/operating margins of around 53-55% on an EBITDA basis  and unlike some of its peers  pays a dividend of over 2% at the current valuation.,"Meinzahn/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesDear Readers At times  I make decent picks even in timing. While Deutsche B√∂rse (OTCPK:DBOEY) (OTCPK:DBOEF) wasn't the best-timed investment  even if it was decent in terms of timing  the real upside was in the fundamentals and the actual valuation you bought for. In this article  I'll get into Deutsche B√∂rse again and show you why my portfolio has outperformed. Not just because of this company - but because of investments like this company.Picking cheap  qualitative businesses at great valuation  when everyone else is calling them ""trash"" - there are far worse ways to go about investing  let me assure you.Let's look at what we have here.Deutsche B√∂rse - The ThesisA quick revisiting of the company first - it's been a while since we wrote about it  after all.Deutsche B√∂rse is a stock market operator. What it does is operate  as this suggests  the stock market. The business has revenues in the billions  operates at appealing EBITDA/operating margins of around 53-55% on an EBITDA basis  and unlike some of its peers  pays a dividend of over 2% at the current valuation.The company has an AA credit rating  and its subsidiary has an AA credit rating. Some actually claim that Deutsche B√∂rse goes back over 400 years to 1585  but the clear roots are the ""Frankfurter Wertpapierb√∂rse AG""  which was a German LLC that changed its name in late 1992.Its IPO is relatively fresh compared to that. It only went public back in 2001  and its argument was very simple - we offer digital/electronic trading. This eventually went on to almost replace floor trading  and it was known as Xetra back in 1997 - a name that still sticks today. You've probably heard of Xetra - that's that.Deutsche B√∂rse also has things within its portfolio that you might not know you're in contact with  but that you should be aware of. Things like Clearstream. This one is big. It's the leading European supplier of post-trading services (including things like dividend payouts) and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche B√∂rse. Its mission is to ensure effective cash and security delivery between parties and it manages/administers and keeps safe all of the securities it holds on behalf of its investor customers. So  that is also part of Deutsche B√∂rse. This is also the subsidiary that I was referring to  with AA credit from S&P Global.This combination of services gives it a distinct advantage over most of its competitors because its offerings are broad enough to cover the entire process chain. This means that European banks are customers of Deutsche B√∂rse  as many of their operations for investors are routed through Deutsche.This is obviously an attractive position to be in.How does a company like this grow and expand  given its name implying a heavy German-focus?Well  it can do so in one of several ways - market expansion to other countries  or service expansion to ancillary sectors.Deutsche B√∂rse does both.The company's focus has been the ""Europeanization"" of its operations. It sold the US subsidiary ISE to Nasdaq (NDAQ) and its stake in BATS Global back in 2016 and 2017  respectively. It's done a few M&As  such as Axioma  a risk management software provider which was spun into its index (DAX/STOXX) operations back in 2019.Today  the company makes money through the following segments:Eurex (Financial Derivatives)Clearstream (Post-trading)Xetra (Cash Equities)IFS (Investment Fund Servicing)IIS (Institutional Services)360T (Foreign Exchange)EEX (Commodities Trading)Qontigo (Index/Analytics)Most of the company's annual revenues still come from the Eurex and Clearstream segments - those two together are more than 50% of sales. This sort of company  because of this  makes money from pre- and post-trading services  as well as from trading/clearing itself.Deutsche B√∂rse IR (Deutsche B√∂rse IR)A stock market operator such as Deutsche sits in an essential monopoly position  given that order flows go where liquidity is most prevalent. While low-cost trading platforms do compete with Deutsche  they also require post-trading services and other technologies  all of which Deutsche provides. Monopolies are very attractive overall investments because they're...well  they're monopolies. Deutsche B√∂rse isn't going anywhere  and the fact that we're through Brexit now makes this even more attractive because it increases the importance of non-London markets like Amsterdam  Paris  Berlin  Brussels  and other exchanges.The company has averaged impressive revenue growth over time with around 6-8% on average  and sometimes in the double digits. Companies like this operate with extremely high margins of 82-93% gross  and as high as 50% pre-tax.Recent results mostly confirm the positives of this operator. A monopoly means just that - Deutsche B√∂rse can simply increase pricing where necessary to offset most pressures it may be experiencing. Despite market pressures  the company sees organic net revenue growth and double-digit EBITDA growth. Operating costs are up  but income and revenues are up more.Deutsche B√∂rse IR (Deutsche B√∂rse IR)The company also  despite ongoing market pressures  increased its outlook for the year due to tailwinds - one of the few companies in fact experiencing tailwinds here  with EBITDA of over ‚Ç¨2.3B on an annual basis. Here are the improvements YoY for the 9M22 period.Deutsche B√∂rse IR (Deutsche B√∂rse IR)Costs are of course up  driven both by increases in things like ISS  but also FX - but positives are simply far higher and better than any sort of input increases here. I also expect these positives to continue for the foreseeable future. The only thing that I as a shareholder hope for is that the company abandons its ventures into the crypto space - but this is so small of a segment that it really doesn't matter in the bigger picture.Deutsche B√∂rse EPS forecast (TIKR.com)The company's current yield is around 2.4-2.5% which is good. Current estimates are for continued GAAP increases until 2024  and stabilization/slight normalization until then. This should be enough to guarantee that the company continues its stable  growing trajectory until then and that shareholders are well-protected here.Deutsche B√∂rse - The ValuationThe company valuation remains appealing despite significant price improvements since my last article. The average valuation target from S&P Global comes to around ‚Ç¨193/share  which implies a nearly 12% upside from today's share price with 13 out of 19 analysts giving the company one or another bullish/""Buy"" rating.I own Deutsche - but I bought it significantly cheaper than it is today. There's still a slight upside to my price target  but it's no longer the double digits it once was - at least that's what I thought until I looked at it  and included the new forecasts and the new reality for this company. Deutsche has been able to retain its growth and margins without any issues despite the complex environment. This calls for a price target improvement for my thesis here.Still  I forecast Deutsche B√∂rse at no more than a sub-GDP lower range growth rate  up to slightly above GDP of around 1.8-2.1% for the terminal period  with around 4-6% range for the 2021-2025 period. The company has a WACC of around 7.72%  reflecting high expectations for its equity growth. Again  risks for this company are very low - but they do exist in the form of ""less growth"" than expected. If this happens  you might maintain your capital  but you'll have missed out on opportunity growth.Based on these relatively conservative growth range estimates  the implied equity value on a per-share basis for Deutsche comes in between ‚Ç¨185-‚Ç¨200  a significant improvement over the last DCF analysis I did. The company has advantages in the form of its market size  returns and margins  better coverage than any of its closest peers  and its future growth plans.I continue to call for a significant upside to Deutsche B√∂rse here - even if that upside isn't as massive as some investors might want.But what you get when you invest in Deutsche  like with some other of my investments  is safety. There is significant safety to be had here.I would argue that we're at the apex of what I would consider an acceptable valuation for investing in the company here. There is still an upside to be had  but I would suggest that only investors that truly want the safety this company offers and are willing to accept the lower yield  and the potential for only low-double-digit returns  do invest here.The realistic upside to a 22-23x P/E  which is where I consider the company's DBOEY ADR to be justified  is around 8-10%  which is the lowest acceptable RoR I'm willing to accept for an investment.For that reason  I'm still positive - but if the company were to climb up to say ‚Ç¨175/share  that's when I would cut my recommendation to ""Hold"".For that reason  here is my current thesis on Deutsche B√∂rse.ThesisDeutsche B√∂rse is a leading  European stock market operator with a compelling thesis and a very attractive portfolio. It's AA-rated and it owns some of the most significant processing assets in the European market. I view it as a timeless investment at the right price  and I bought in at below ‚Ç¨145/share  making me a long-term shareholder.The company's recent targets confirm the intact margin and decent upside  and I'm shifting my target to ‚Ç¨175 on a per share basis  which is the highest possible I would consider paying for the native.The company is a ""Buy""  but barely here.Remember  I'm all about:Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount  allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime.If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation  I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks  repeating #1.If the company doesn't go into overvaluation but hovers within a fair value  or goes back down to undervaluation  I buy more as time allows.I reinvest proceeds from dividends  savings from work  or other cash inflows as specified in #1.Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized):This company is overall qualitative.This company is fundamentally safe/conservative and well-run.This company pays a well-covered dividend.This company is currently cheap.This company has a realistic upside that is high enough  based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.The company fulfills 4 of my 5 criteria but cannot rightly be called ""cheap"".",neutral,0.07,0.93,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.14,0.46,True,English,"['Deutsche B√∂rse', 'DBOEF', 'Stock', 'Time', 'risk management software provider', 'Frankfurter Wertpapierb√∂rse AG', 'organic net revenue growth', 'Deutsche B√∂rse IR', 'impressive revenue growth', 'cheap, qualitative businesses', 'entire process chain', 'double-digit EBITDA growth', 'appealing EBITDA/operating margins', 'leading European supplier', 'S&P Global', 'Investment Fund Servicing', 'essential monopoly position', 'AA credit rating', 'low-cost trading platforms', 'attractive overall investments', 'stock market operator', 'attractive position', 'timed investment', 'EBITDA basis', 'European banks', 'BATS Global', 'high margins', 'market expansion', 'market pressures', 'Getty Images', 'Dear Readers', 'decent picks', 'real upside', 'actual valuation', 'worse ways', 'The Thesis', 'quick revisiting', 'current valuation', 'clear roots', 'German LLC', 'digital/electronic trading', 'floor trading', 'effective cash', 'security delivery', 'distinct advantage', 'heavy German-focus', 'several ways', 'other countries', 'service expansion', 'ancillary sectors', 'M&As', 'following segments', 'Financial Derivatives', 'Cash Equities', 'Foreign Exchange', 'Commodities Trading', 'order flows', 'other technologies', 'London markets', 'other exchanges', 'double digits', 'Recent results', 'most pressures', 'Operating costs', 'post-trading services', 'Institutional Services', 'owned subsidiary', 'investor customers', 'US subsidiary', 'DAX/STOXX) operations', 'annual revenues', 'Clearstream segments', 'Meinzahn', 'Editorial', 'times', 'timing', 'terms', 'fundamentals', 'article', 'portfolio', 'company', 'great', 'everyone', 'billions', 'peers', '400 years', 'name', 'IPO', 'argument', 'Xetra', 'things', 'contact', 'payouts', 'mission', 'parties', 'administers', 'securities', 'behalf', 'combination', 'competitors', 'offerings', 'investors', 'Europeanization', 'ISE', 'Nasdaq', 'NDAQ', 'stake', 'Axioma', 'index', 'money', 'Eurex', 'IFS', 'IIS', 'EEX', 'Qontigo', 'sales', 'sort', 'liquidity', 'Monopolies', 'fact', 'Brexit', 'importance', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Brussels', 'Companies', 'positives', 'pricing', 'income']",2022-12-08,2022-12-08,seekingalpha.com

The transaction involves a bond with a volume of EUR 20 million  a term of two years and a coupon of 2.381%. Deutsche Bank acted as lead manager for this transaction  and Hengeler Mueller as legal advisor.‚ÄúDigitalisation is a central component of our KfWplus strategy adopted in April. It is therefore remarkable that KfW‚Äôs treasury and transaction management have implemented this pioneering electronic transaction via the D7 platform. As one of the world‚Äôs largest capital market issuers  innovation in the area of our refinancing is important to us in order to improve efficiency and reduce operating risks and transaction costs ‚Äù said Melanie Kehr  Member of the Executive Board of KfW Group.‚ÄúThis issue makes KfW a pioneer in its market segment and sends an important signal to market participants. The transaction ran smoothly and has paved the way for further issues from other issuers of fixed-income securities ‚Äù explained Tim Armbruster  Treasurer of KfW Group.In order to make even more effective use of the benefits of digitalisation  KfW is examining how further elements of the issuance process can be digitised. When using digital technologies  one of investors‚Äô main concerns should always be taken into account: the liquidity of bonds.Jens Hachmeister  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  says: ‚ÄúWith the digital post-trading platform D7  we are building a new infrastructure for future-ready markets worldwide. Like this  we offer our clients a significantly quicker and scalable solution for securities issuance. Following the successful launch of our structured products offering  we are now enhancing D7 to include the digital issuance of debt securities  such as commercial papers and straight bonds. We are thrilled that KfW is joining us on this journey. The outstanding market demand shows: the time to digitise financial markets is now.‚ÄùThe digital issuance of financial products via the D7 platform shortens the extensive and multi-day issuance process to just a few minutes. This saves time  manual effort and therefore processing costs. As a next step  Clearstream plans to enhance D7 with decentral capabilities and to offer it in further jurisdictions  e. g. Luxembourg  in line with the respective regulations and market interest. Like this  the central securities depository is creating a fully digital alternative to conventional securities issuance.Last year  the German legislator passed the Electronic Securities Act  which allows for the dematerialisation of a bond‚Äôs global note. The legislation gives bearer bond issuers the option to choose between conventional paper-based and electronic issuance. For the latter  an entry in an electronic securities register replaces the creation of a physical global note by the issuer. With the D7 platform  Clearstream now offers the market the technical infrastructure for the issuance of electronic fixed-income products in line with the Electronic Securities Act.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.86,0.13,0.01,True,English,"['digital fixed-income bond', 'Clearstream D7', 'KfW', 'largest capital market segment', 'largest capital market issuers', 'digital post-trading platform D', 'Deutsche B√∂rse Group', 'German Electronic Securities Act', 'D7 digital post-trade platform', 'post-trade service provider', 'electronic securities register', 'central register security', 'structured products offering', 'outstanding market demand', 'central securities depository', 'electronic fixed-income products', 'bearer bond issuers', 'physical global note', 'pioneering electronic transaction', 'multi-day issuance process', 'New Digital Markets', 'digital fixed-income bond', 'conventional securities issuance', 'fixed-income securities', 'electronic issuance', 'Deutsche Bank', 'other issuers', 'German legislator', 'digital issuance', 'D7 platform', 'digital technologies', 'digital alternative', 'debt securities', 'central component', 'financial products', 'market participants', 'market interest', 'new infrastructure', 'conventional paper-based', 'future-ready markets', 'financial markets', 'looking step', 'fixed income', 'two years', 'lead manager', 'Hengeler Mueller', 'legal advisor', 'KfWplus strategy', 'operating risks', 'Melanie Kehr', 'Executive Board', 'important signal', 'Tim Armbruster', 'effective use', 'main concerns', 'Jens Hachmeister', 'scalable solution', 'successful launch', 'commercial papers', 'manual effort', 'next step', 'decentral capabilities', 'respective regulations', 'technical infrastructure', 'KfW Group', 'first issuer', 'transaction management', 'Issuer Services', 'straight bonds', 'transaction costs', 'Source', 'Clearstream', 'forward', 'digitalisation', 'volume', 'term', 'coupon', 'April', 'treasury', 'world', 'innovation', 'area', 'refinancing', 'order', 'efficiency', 'Member', 'way', 'issues', 'Treasurer', 'benefits', 'elements', 'account', 'liquidity', 'Head', 'clients', 'quicker', 'journey', 'time', 'extensive', 'minutes', 'jurisdictions', 'Luxembourg', 'line', 'dematerialisation', 'legislation', 'option', 'latter', 'entry', 'creation', '2.']",2022-12-08,2022-12-08,finextra.com

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (‚Ä¶,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland  & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today reported interim clinical outcomes from the first ten1 people treated to regulate blood pressure with implantable ARC Therapy  ONWARD‚Äôs targeted spinal cord stimulation technique. ARC Therapy immediately improved blood pressure levels for all participants; this benefit has been sustained for the duration of the current follow-up period. Participants have also reported improved quality of life  increased energy and vitality  and reduced dizziness.Aaron Phillips  PhD  Associate Professor  Physiology and Pharmacology  Biomedical Engineering  Cardiac Sciences  Clinical Neurosciences  Cumming School of Medicine  University of Calgary  and the Principal Investigator of the HEMO study  said: ‚ÄúLow blood pressure has long been a hidden complication of spinal cord injury that often goes unrecognized and leaves people feeling unwell. It also potentially predisposes them to cardiovascular disease. The results reported today with ARC Therapy are compelling and may open a new avenue to help people with spinal cord injury truly feel better  while also addressing heart health.‚ÄùThe interim outcomes reported today are from ten people with spinal cord injury who were treated at clinical centers in Canada and Switzerland. In addition to a sustained increase in blood pressure levels  participants who were taking an anti-hypotension drug prior to entering the study were able to significantly reduce or discontinue their medication. Participants also reported improved general well-being: Participants reported a reduction in orthostatic hypotension  including reduced dizziness and improved energy  and those prone to fainting or light-headedness prior to implant indicated that such incidents declined dramatically following treatment with ARC Therapy. Participants continue to be followed  in one case for as long as three years  and the therapy remains beneficial in all cases.Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD  said: ‚ÄúWe are excited by these highly promising outcomes  which reinforce our plan to further develop and bring ARC-IM to the market for this important indication. Today  there are limited and ineffective options for treating people with low blood pressure after spinal cord injury  and our therapy has the potential to address an issue that significantly impacts their quality of life.‚ÄùOver 40% of people with spinal cord injury  or approximately 262 000 people in the U.S. and Europe2  are estimated to experience hypotension  or low blood pressure. Hypotension may limit active participation in physical rehabilitation programs and facilitate the deterioration effects of immobilization and development of undesirable secondary medical complications.Based on the promising interim outcomes from these feasibility studies  ONWARD is preparing to initiate further clinical trials to include U.S. participants in 2023.About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for paraplegia (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for tetraplegia (paralysis of all four limbs). Treatments are urgently needed to restore movement and improve quality of life.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries. ONWARD‚Äôs work builds on more than a decade of basic science and preclinical research conducted at the world‚Äôs leading neuroscience laboratories. ONWARD‚Äôs ARC Therapy  which can be delivered by implantable (ARC-IM) or external (ARC-EX) systems  is designed to deliver targeted  programmed spinal cord stimulation to restore movement and other functions in people with spinal cord injury  ultimately improving their quality of life.ONWARD has received five Breakthrough Device Designations from the U.S. FDA encompassing both ARC-IM and ARC-EX.

CONTACT-01 is a phase III clinical trial evaluating Cabomety‚Ä¶,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) announced today that the CONTACT-01 study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) at the final analysis. CONTACT-01 is a phase III clinical trial evaluating Cabometyx¬Æ (cabozantinib) in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq¬Æ) versus docetaxel in patients with unmutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who experienced disease progression on or after treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy.Howard Mayer  M.D.  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Ipsen  said: ‚Äú The results from the CONTACT-01 clinical trial have shown the challenge of treating NSCLC patients after prior lines of treatment have failed. While the findings of the study have not met the primary endpoint in this setting  we remain confident in the clinical efficacy of cabozantinib alone and in combination with another treatment in existing indications in difficult-to-treat tumor types. We wish to thank the patients  their families and healthcare teams for their participation in this clinical trial.‚ÄùThe safety profile of the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab observed in the trial was consistent with the known safety profiles for each single agent  and no new safety signals were identified. Detailed findings from CONTACT-01 will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting.ENDSAbout CONTACT-01CONTACT-01 is a global  multicenter  randomized  phase 3  open-label study that enrolled 366 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of docetaxel. The study enrolled patients with both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC who progressed during or following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy administered either concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival  objective response rate and duration of response. Results from cohort 7 of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 trial informed the CONTACT-01 trial design. CONTACT-01 was sponsored by Roche and co-funded by Exelixis. Both Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) opted in to participate in the trial and are contributing to the funding for this study under the terms of the companies‚Äô respective collaboration agreements with Exelixis. More information about the trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About CABOMETYX¬Æ (cabozantinib)Cabometyx is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with targets including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)  c-MET and the TAM receptor family  which block the growth of cancer.Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

As of December 2022  all new cards issued are eco-designed and come with completely reimagined user kits that use considerably less paper. The new Ticket Restaurant card has also been conceived for easier use by workers with disabilities. These innovations join other features rolled out by Edenred recently such as QR code payment and complementary payments for amounts above available balances.Ticket Restaurant to become simpler and more inclusive for people with disabilitiesTo improve Ticket Restaurant accessibility for the visually impaired  Ticket Restaurant cards now include an ‚ÄúR‚Äù for ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù in braille on their front side  making it easier for users to identify the card in their wallet or pocket. The innovative new feature has been tested and approved by visually impaired users  who contributed to its development. It is a first in France for payment cards. These new cards simplify daily life for hundreds of thousands of people. The edenred.fr website is also being adapted as part of a digital accessibility initiative for the visually impaired.In 2017  Edenred France launched a partnership with Elioz Connect to make its Client Relations Center accessible to the hearing impaired. Users can contact a client relationship representative by phone or via their computer screen and  depending on their preferred mode of communication  have an interpreter translate the reply into sign language or transcribe it in real time.Eco-design embedded in the production process for Ticket Restaurant and Kad√©os solutionsEdenred‚Äôs new cards are now also eco-designed and made up of 85% recycled plastic. Ticket Restaurant cards in circulation will be renewed progressively as Edenred replaces expired cards with the new eco-designed versions. The eco-designed cards are 100% recyclable.Story continuesSince 2016  Edenred France has also offered a free service whereby beneficiaries can send in their expired Ticket Restaurant cards for recycling ‚Äì an unprecedented initiative in France.The market leader in France  Edenred also launched the first fully virtual  mobile-first Ticket Restaurant solution in 2021. The service can be used directly on a smartphone  delivering an optimal user experience while eliminating the production of plastic-based media.As of January 2023  Edenred will also use recycled plastic to produce Kad√©os gift cards. In doing so  the Group has the clear goal of driving environmental responsibility throughout the employee benefits market by applying an eco-design approach to its entire range of solutions.Edenred France has also redesigned the user kits that are sent out with cards to explain how each solution works. All employees receive these kits when they become Edenred beneficiaries. The redesigned kits are now lighter  fully recyclable and printed with 98% vegetable-based inks. They will be rolled out as of January 2023 and use 60% less paper than previous versions  saving 15 metric tons of paper per year (France only).Ilan Ouanounou  General Manager of Edenred France  said: ‚ÄúThe Ticket Restaurant and Kad√©os innovations we have announced today reaffirm Edenred‚Äôs technology leadership while stepping up our commitment to a more inclusive  accessible and environmentally friendly world of work.

They are successful properties combining yields and potential for value creation. This acquisition has a transformative effect for MRM  increasing the value of its portfolio by more than 50%  with potential for improvement in profitability and changing its shareholding structure  while also keeping the Company‚Äôs net debt at a controlled level.Fran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors  comments: ‚ÄúThe finalisation of this major acquisition  which has a significant structural effect on MRM  marks a real change of dimension for the Company. It has increased the value of its portfolio by more than 50%  while also keeping debt at a controlled level. We are delighted to count Altarea  a leading name in the real estate sector  as one of our shareholders. This attests to its confidence in our Company‚Äôs ability to create value.‚ÄùStory continuesFran√ßois Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  adds: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that all stages leading to the acquisition of two shopping centres from Altarea have been completed successfully and on schedule. This acquisition has a structural effect and open up new opportunities for growth with the rollout of our proactive asset management policy on the basis of a larger portfolio. In the medium term  we are aiming for annualised net rents in excess of ‚Ç¨16 million and an improvement in our profitability thanks to better absorption of our fixed costs.‚ÄùRodrigo Clare  Altarea‚Äôs representative on MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors  states: ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to be able to support MRM in its strategic development thanks to the agreement reached with the Company and its main shareholder  SCOR SE. With its experienced team  MRM has the strengths required to make the most of its retail asset portfolio through dynamic management and know-how to adapt to changing consumer trends.‚ÄùAcquisition processThe final stage of the acquisition by MRM of the Assets Sold from Altarea was achieved today  with the settlement-delivery and admission to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris of the new MRM shares issued within the framework of its capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders in the amount of ‚Ç¨29 million  with SCOR SE subscribing to ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨4 million  carried out on 5 December 2022.Overall  the acquisition of the Assets Sold entailed (i) a capital increase of the Company by means of a contribution in kind reserved for Altarea in the amount of ‚Ç¨21 million1 and (ii) the above-mentioned capital increase of the Company with preferential subscription rights for shareholders. Representing a total of ‚Ç¨50 million  the two capital increases were carried out at a unit subscription price equal to MRM‚Äôs replacement NAV per share as at 30 June 2022  i.e. ‚Ç¨48.92. SCOR SE subscribed to an amount of ‚Ç¨25 million and Altarea to ‚Ç¨25 million. The remainder of the acquisition price was financed by means of a ‚Ç¨42 million bank loan with a pool of banks comprising Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel  LCL and BRED Banque Populaire. Banque Europ√©enne du Cr√©dit Mutuel acted as agent and co-arranger  and LCL acted as co-arranger.This financing structure has enabled MRM to maintain a net LTV ratio of less than 45%  compared with 40.7% as at 30 June 2022.Significant increase in the size of MRM‚Äôs portfolioThe acquisition of the Carrefour shopping centre in Flins-sur-Seine  Yvelines  and the Carrefour shopping centre in Ollioules  Var  has resulted in a change of dimension for MRM. As well as establishing its presence in two fast-growing regions  this acquisition has increased the size of its portfolio by 52% from ‚Ç¨163.0 million to ‚Ç¨247.3 million  on the basis of values excluding transfer taxes as at 30 June 2022.This extension of the portfolio is reflected by the sharp rise in MRM‚Äôs annualised net rents from ‚Ç¨9.5 million to ‚Ç¨15.0 million2. The target of annualised net rents of ‚Ç¨10.0 million prior to the acquisition has therefore been increased to more than ‚Ç¨16.0 million. MRM expects the increase in its rental income to have a positive impact on its net operating cash flow generation and is hoping to improve its profitability in the medium term thanks to better absorption of its fixed costs.Positioned as market leaders within their catchment areas and with physical occupancy rates2 of 97% and 92% respectively  the Flins-sur-Seine and Ollioules shopping centres3 present much higher net rental yields than those generated by MRM‚Äôs portfolio prior to the acquisition. Furthermore  the two properties offer potential for value creation that will enable MRM to roll out its asset management expertise (refurbishment  partial redevelopment  proactive rental management  changes in the retailer mix) across a wider portfolio.Enhanced shareholding structure and changes in governanceFollowing the issuing of new shares in relation to the two capital increases carried out within the framework of the acquisition  SCOR SE and Altarea hold stakes4 of 56.63% and 15.94% respectively. The Company‚Äôs free float stands at 27.35%.MRM also reiterates that Altarea was appointed as a board member at the combined general meeting of 16 November 2022. As of this date  the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors comprises:Fran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Board member;SCOR SE  Board member  represented by Karina Leli√®vre;Altarea  Board member  represented by Rodrigo Clare;Brigitte Gauthier-Darcet  independent Board member;Val√©rie Ohannessian  independent Board member; andKarine Tr√©baticky  Board member.Resumption of the liquidity agreementThe liquidity agreement administered by Invest Securities  which was suspended after close of trading on 15 November 2022 within the framework of the launch of the Company‚Äôs capital increase with preferential subscription rights for shareholders  will resume before market opening tomorrow  Thursday 8 December 2022.Ordinary general meeting of 14 December 2022At its combined general meeting of 16 November 2022  the Company failed to reach the quorum required for the first convening of the meeting to be able to validly deliberate on the sixth resolution of the ordinary part of the meeting.Another ordinary general meeting was therefore convened at 3.00 p.m. on 14 December 2022 at the Company‚Äôs head office for shareholders to vote on the sixth resolution (Notice of Second Convocation published in the Bulletin des Annonces L√©gales Obligatoires on 25 November 2022 n¬∞ 141 - Announcement n¬∞ 2204498 and in the ACTU-JURIDIQUE.FR legal notices on 25 November 2022).# # #MRM‚Äôs advisors for the whole transaction are Gimar & Co (financial advisor)  De Pardieu Brocas Maffei (legal advisor) and Lasaygues (notary).# # #About MRMMRM is a listed real estate investment company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

The world's second largest wine and spirit company will invest approximately $250 million over five years to build a state-of-the-art  carbon neutral distillery  with related aging warehouses in Marion County  Kentucky for its fast-growing Jefferson's Bourbon brand. This investment will also include the build of a world class visitor center facility that will welcome whiskey aficionados on the historic South Trail of Kentucky Bourbon.Distillery Entry Rendering""American whiskey is an extremely vibrant spirits category  and our strategic investments over the last few years have proven successful "" said Alexandre Ricard  Chairman and CEO  Pernod Ricard. ""Our philosophy of partnering with entrepreneurial brand founders  while preserving the heritage and terroir associated with the brands they created  has made us an established player in premium American Whiskey. Jefferson's founder Trey Zoeller is no exception. This new investment will allow us to grow our share of category sales not only in the U.S.  but also in export markets "" Ricard said.Ann Mukherjee  Chairman and CEO  Pernod Ricard North America  said the new distillery will enable Jefferson's to efficiently keep up with very strong consumer demand while staying true to the company's longstanding commitment to sustainability. ""American whiskey is booming  and Jefferson's growth has been phenomenal "" Mukherjee said. ""We're very bullish on the brand's potential  and we're committed to making our new Jefferson's facility one of the most exemplary distilleries in the world in order to achieve it.Pernod Ricard has announced the intention for this new distillery to be carbon neutral once operational. The facility is also expected to be the first distillery of its size in the U.S. to achieve LEED certification  an internationally recognized sustainability framework for healthy  efficient  carbon and cost-saving environmentally friendly buildings. The distillery and warehouses will include such low carbon technologies as:Story continuesElectrode boilers powered by certified renewable electricity  enabling the distillery to not use fossil fuels during bourbon production.On site electric trucks and facility vehicles also powered by renewable electricity.Extensive use of solar and natural lighting throughout the property and facility.In addition  as part of Pernod Ricard's commitment to protect and nurture the terroir surrounding its facilities  Jefferson's will continue to partner with local farmers and suppliers to source ingredients and casks.""Our company is an agricultural company at its core and so it is vital that we lead the category forward - in partnership with our farmers and growers - and remain committed to the long-term sustainability of our people  our industry and our planet. This investment is the latest illustration of that belief "" said Mukherjee.Pernod Ricard's Irish Distillers and Chivas Brothers brand companies recently announced plans to invest in decarbonizing their distilleries and creating new carbon neutral facilities  following the example set by The Absolut Company  which has consistently set the industry standard for sustainable production. Pernod Ricard is on track to meet the ambitious targets set out in its 2030 global sustainability & responsibility roadmap  'Good Times from a Good Place ' which align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.According to Pierre Joncourt  SVP  Operations  Pernod Ricard North America  ""Construction of the new distillery ‚Äì which will have a 7.5 million proof gallon capacity -- is expected to begin in January 2023. Our target completion date for the distillery and related warehouses is 2025.""Founded in 1997 by Trey Zoeller and his father Chet  Jefferson's joined the Pernod Ricard portfolio in 2019 when the company acquired the brand's parent  Castle Brands. Known for his unrelenting thirst for adventure  as well as a decades-long passion for crafting the world's most unique expressions of bourbon  Trey Zoeller continues to guide Jefferson's in his role as Founder and Chief Strategist. Since the acquisition  Jefferson's U.S. sales have doubled.""For the last 25 years we have been sourcing  contract distilling and -- through Kentucky Artisan Distillery -- distilling ourselves "" Zoeller said. ""It is now time for us to take more control of our destiny. The carbon neutral  state-of-the-art distillery we are building would not be possible without Pernod Ricard's forward thinking  integrity  and commitment to Jefferson's and the Bourbon category's future.""Pernod Ricard USA's capital investment in the new distillery and visitor center is expected initially to add roughly 55 new company jobs in Kentucky while generating extra economic benefits for Kentucky-based businesses during the construction period. It is the latest in a series of moves made by Pernod Ricard to expand its investment in U.S. manufacturing and grow its share in the lucrative American spirits and wine market.In 2022  the company's Ft. Smith  Arkansas manufacturing plant has invested in new canning and bottling lines.In August 2019  Pernod Ricard acquired the TX Whiskey brand  based in Fort Worth  Texas. TX is known for its bourbon made from a proprietary yeast derived from the pecan tree  the official state tree of Texas.In July 2019  Pernod Ricard acquired a majority stake in Rabbit Hole Distillery  known for its super-premium bourbon and iconic distillery in Louisville  Kentucky.In 2016  the company bought a majority stake in Smooth Ambler  the award-winning West Virginia whiskey distiller. Pernod Ricard assumed full ownership of the brand late last year.""U.S. whiskey sales are expected to account for a significant amount of Pernod Ricard USA's total volumes within the next 5-10 years  and the U.S. whiskey export business also has enormous growth potential "" Craig Johnson  SVP American Whiskey Collective  said. ""To help achieve these ambitious performance goals  the American Whiskey Collective was created the result will be further accelerated growth from our 'new fashioned' whiskey portfolio  focused on pushing boundaries rather than adhering strictly to tradition "" said Johnson.ABOUT PERNOD RICARD USAPernod Ricard USA is the premium spirits and wine company in the U.S.  and the largest subsidiary of Paris  France-based Pernod Ricard SA.  the world's second largest spirits and wine company.

This technology breakthrough  ‚Ä¶,NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medidata  a Dassault Syst√®mes company  has been honored by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with its 2022 Innovation in Regulatory Science Award for Medidata Link. This technology breakthrough  based on Medidata‚Äôs Rave EDC (electronic data capture) allows sponsors and regulators to connect and analyze once-disparate data sources to bridge the gap between the clinical trial and real world information sources.The award ceremony in Washington  D.C. on December 6 will feature an address by Robert M. Califf  M.D.  Commissioner of the FDA and acceptance remarks by Medidata co-CEO Sastry Chilukuri.‚Äú The industry has been challenged to understand the full spectrum of a patient‚Äôs journey from before the clinical trial starts to long after completion. Medidata Link connects clinical trial data and real world data sources to tell a story from a patient‚Äôs historical diagnosis and treatment patterns to the progression of care post-trial ‚Äù said Sastry Chilukuri  Medidata co-CEO. ‚Äú We are honored to have this advancement recognized by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA.‚ÄùMedidata Link‚Äôs potential was especially apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic  when the technology was used to monitor the long-term safety of a top pharmaceutical company‚Äôs breakthrough investigational therapy. Medidata Link securely ingested personal identifiable information (PII) and leveraged de-identification technology from multiple tokenization vendors to enable long-term patient surveillance post-trial. This allowed the company to circumnavigate the slow turnaround times and high costs of traditional clinical approaches while garnering real-time efficacy analysis of their COVID-19 treatment.The Reagan-Udall Foundation embodies the FDA‚Äôs vision of collaborative innovation to address regulatory science challenges of the 21st century. This also assists in the creation of new  applied scientific knowledge  tools  standards  and approaches the FDA needs to evaluate products more effectively  predictably  and efficiently  and thereby enhance the ability to protect and promote the health of the American public.Medidata is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Syst√®mes  which with its 3DEXPERIENCE platform is positioned to lead the digital transformation of life sciences in the age of personalized medicine with the first end-to-end scientific and business platform  from research to commercialization.About MedidataMedidata is leading the digital transformation of life sciences  creating hope for millions of patients.

As a major player in the fashion  automotive  and furniture markets  Lectra contributes with boldness and passion to the Industry 4.0 revolution by providing software  equipment  data  and services to brands  manufacturers  and retailers.Founded in 2018  TextileGenesis provides a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that enables fashion brands and sustainable textile manufacturers to ensure a reliable  secure and fully digital mapping of their textiles  from the fiber to the consumer  and thereby guarantee their authenticity and origins. This solution ensures the traceability of TextileGenesis‚Äô customers' entire sustainable textile supply chain in order to meet the demands for transparency  driven by changes in legislation in a growing number of countries and by growing consumer awareness  thereby encouraging sustainable development.Its innovative traceability mechanism  which addresses both ends of the textile value chain  as well as its network of partners for material certification  and its technology platform guarantee the exchange and tracking of reliable and secure data throughout a material's life cycle.Several of the world's most prestigious fashion brands as well as leading sustainable fiber producers are already convinced of the value of TextileGenesis' innovative offer  which enables the connection of multiple actors of the sustainable fashion ecosystem on this platform.‚ÄúFashion is one of the most fragmented industries due to its long and complex value chain  which makes it opaque to brands  suppliers  subcontractors  and consumers‚Äù says Amit Gautam  founder of TextileGenesis. ‚ÄúToday  only 19% of fashion industry actors have visibility of their value chain  and this visibility is often partial. Many brands  especially those that have set ambitious sustainability goals  face a real challenge in terms of supply chain transparency. If they cannot track the life cycle of certified materials  they will not be able to justify the sustainability of their products ‚Äù he adds.Story continues‚ÄúHaving the highest ethical standards  guaranteeing the well-being of our employees  and preserving the environment are embedded in Lectra‚Äôs DNA and guide our daily decisions. Through our technology  acquisitions  and partnerships  we aim to empower our customers to work in a more socially and environmentally responsible way ‚Äù says Daniel Harari  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lectra. ‚ÄúWe look forward to joining forces with TextileGenesis' talented teams to accelerate the development of their sustainable material traceability solution and deepen our knowledge of the textile value chain in the fashion industry ‚Äù he concludes.At the beginning of January  Lectra will acquire 51% of TextileGenesis for 15.2 million euros. The acquisition of the remaining share capital and voting rights is expected to take place in two stages  in 2026 and 2028  for an amount that will be calculated based on a multiple of the 2025 and 2027 recurring revenues.About Lectra:As a major player in the fashion  automotive and furniture markets  Lectra contributes to the Industry 4.0 revolution with boldness and passion by providing best-in-class technologies.The Group offers industrial intelligence solutions - software  equipment  data and services - that facilitate the digital transformation of the companies it serves.

Is it time to revisit oil stocks? Here are 3 big plays,Wake up and smell the diesel.,Electric vehicles have become popular over the past few years. But EVs could take a significant hit based on what‚Äôs happening in Switzerland.According to a report in the Telegraph on Saturday  the country is considering emergency measures in case of an electricity supply shortage this winter.Switzerland ‚Äî the best country in the world according to a recent analysis from US News & World Report ‚Äî could shorten store operating hours  lower the thermostats at buildings  and limit the private use of electric cars to ‚Äúabsolutely necessary journeys.‚ÄùThese proposed measures haven‚Äôt been passed into law just yet.

As a major player in the fashion  automotive  and furniture markets  Lectra contributes with boldness and passion to the Industry 4.0 revolution by providing software  equipment  data  and services to brands  manufacturers  and retailers.Founded in 2018  TextileGenesis provides a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that enables fashion brands and sustainable textile manufacturers to ensure a reliable  secure and fully digital mapping of their textiles  from the fiber to the consumer  and thereby guarantee their authenticity and origins. This solution ensures the traceability of TextileGenesis‚Äô customers' entire sustainable textile supply chain in order to meet the demands for transparency  driven by changes in legislation in a growing number of countries and by growing consumer awareness  thereby encouraging sustainable development.Its innovative traceability mechanism  which addresses both ends of the textile value chain  as well as its network of partners for material certification  and its technology platform guarantee the exchange and tracking of reliable and secure data throughout a material's life cycle.Several of the world's most prestigious fashion brands as well as leading sustainable fiber producers are already convinced of the value of TextileGenesis' innovative offer  which enables the connection of multiple actors of the sustainable fashion ecosystem on this platform.‚ÄúFashion is one of the most fragmented industries due to its long and complex value chain  which makes it opaque to brands  suppliers  subcontractors  and consumers‚Äù says Amit Gautam  founder of TextileGenesis. ‚ÄúToday  only 19% of fashion industry actors have visibility of their value chain  and this visibility is often partial. Many brands  especially those that have set ambitious sustainability goals  face a real challenge in terms of supply chain transparency. If they cannot track the life cycle of certified materials  they will not be able to justify the sustainability of their products ‚Äù he adds.Story continues‚ÄúHaving the highest ethical standards  guaranteeing the well-being of our employees  and preserving the environment are embedded in Lectra‚Äôs DNA and guide our daily decisions. Through our technology  acquisitions  and partnerships  we aim to empower our customers to work in a more socially and environmentally responsible way ‚Äù says Daniel Harari  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lectra. ‚ÄúWe look forward to joining forces with TextileGenesis' talented teams to accelerate the development of their sustainable material traceability solution and deepen our knowledge of the textile value chain in the fashion industry ‚Äù he concludes.At the beginning of January  Lectra will acquire 51% of TextileGenesis for 15.2 million euros.

For more countries  head on over to Top 5 Semiconductor...,In this piece  we will take a look at the top ten semiconductor manufacturing countries in the world. For more countries  head on over to Top 5 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World.Semiconductor fabrication is one of the most lucrative yet one of the most difficult industries in the world. Chips are responsible for powering the information-driven  modern day economy. However  manufacturing them comes after decades have been spent on research and development and billions of dollars have been spent in capital expenditure to procure the right equipment. Sometimes  even this is not enough as chip manufacturers  also called fabs  are only a single player in a vast supporting ecosystem that ranges from the equipment needed to prepare and transform silicon into the wafers for fabrication to the actual testing of the chips once they have been 'printed' inside expensive machines.Therefore  chip production is concentrated in geographic pockets  with some countries having an edge over others since the supporting foundry ecosystem enables companies to set up facilities there much more easily. An example is the U.S. state of Arizona  which is known for hosting chipzilla Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s foundries and subsequently has a strong ecosystem that consists not only of companies that provide the necessary raw materials  but also universities that tailor their programs to meet Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s needs and ensure that it has a steady stream of engineers ready to build chips. The strength of the Arizonian ecosystem has also enticed the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) to build its new American chipmaking plant in the state as well  after scouting for multiple locations.As an estimate of the investment required to keep the foundries and ecosystem running  a brief look at the capital expenditure of the industry is relevant. According to the research firm IC Insights  worldwide semiconductor spending will sit at a whopping $185.5 billion next year. The spending has grown exponentially in just four decades  as in 1980 it had stood at a mere $14.7 billion.Moving towards units shipped  coverage from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) shows that by the end of 2021  global semiconductor sales had stood at a stunning $555 billion  growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.18% since 2001. The U.S. continued to dominate the market  as it held 46% of the overall pie  with South Korea coming in at second place with a 21% share and Japan and the European Union in third place with 9% market shares  each. Crucially  U.S. firms had also commanded half of the Chinese market  which was the largest in the world with and worth $192.4 billion. However  while American companies were the worldwide chip leaders  the Americas market is the third largest in the world and was valued at $121.5 billion last year.Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the WorldDragon Images/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe looked through the major semiconductor foundries all over the world and determined the countries (or special regions such as Taiwan) in which they are operating in. The regions are then ranked according to the number of fabs that are present in them  and the list is not exhaustive and it also includes plants that are under construction. Also  do check out 16 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap if you want to know about the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Some of the companies on that list include Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World10. State of IsraelNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 4The State of Israel is a Western Asian country that is also one of the most advanced nations in the world. Despite a population of a mere 9.6 million people  the country's economy is worth $497 billion which lends it a high GDP per capita of $52 173. Israel also boasts one of the largest startup ecosystems in the world and has the most NASDAQ listed companies after the U.S. and China as of 2016  indicating the strength of its business ecosystem. Additionally  the country also runs a current account surplus as of 2019  leaving it with little need to be dependent on foreign capital to fund its economy through loans.Owing to the fact that it is an economic and technology hub  the State of Israel also has four semiconductor foundries. Two of these belong to the U.S. chipmaking giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  and two below to Tower Semiconductor  but with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) being in the process of acquiring the Israeli chipmaker  soon all the chipmaking facilities in the country will come under chipzilla's umbrella.9. NetherlandsNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 4The Netherlands is a European country that is the largest constituent of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is one of the most liberal countries on Earth  and also one of the most densely populated regions as more than 500 people live in each square kilometer of the country. The country's GDP stood at a whopping $1.2 trillion in purchasing power parity terms this year  lending it a high GDP per capita of $69 715. The Netherlands is a net exporter and has a large current account surplus  which lends it credibility with global financial markets and lets it borrow trillions of dollars to fuel its growth and keep its credit outlook stable at the same time.Some of the largest multinational firms in the world are also located in the country  and one of the most crucial firms headquartered there is ASML. ASML  like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM)  is one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world. ASML is the only company in the world that is capable of manufacturing high end machines that print semiconductors. The chip industry's progress depends on these machines  and therefore they are always in high demand  even when the industry is facing a downturn as chipmakers are continuously planning for the future. Additionally  the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange is the oldest exchange in the world  since it was set up centuries ago in 1602. Chip manufacturing plants in the Netherlands belong to NXP and Philips  among others.8. MalaysiaNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 7Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country that gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957 and then united with three other colonies  including Singapore  to become Malaysia in 1963. However  Singapore was expelled from the union in 1967  with economic and political disagreements and racial tensions fueling the decision to prevent bloodshed. Malaysia's GDP is estimated to be worth more than a trillion dollars  and the country also runs a current account surplus. Malaysia exports semiconductors and natural resources  among other products.Seven chipmaking plants are located in the country  with four belonging to the German firms Infineon and Osram Licht. Another belongs to a Belgian firm and two belong to Malaysian entities.7. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 12The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a European country  which when combined with Ireland  is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. It has a unique and distinct history  which has seen it not only rule the world but have deep ties to the Roman Empire via its City of London financial hub which is part of Greater London. The U.K. has also pioneered many modern day inventions such as the automobile and the jet engine.The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is home to one of the most consequential semiconductor designers  Arm Ltd. Arm's products are at the heart of most of the world's smartphones and its designs are also used in data center chips. Chip fabrication facilities in the country are owned by Dutch and American firms  among others.6. Republic of Korea (ROK)Number of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 15The Republic of Korea (ROK)  also known as South Korea  is an East Asian country that became a republic in 1949. The country is one of the most prosperous nations in the world  with a $2.7 trillion GDP and a GDP per capita of $53 051. South Korea's exports stood at $644 billion in 2021  out of which integrated circuits  or semiconductors  formed the largest chunk as they accounted for more than 15% of the overall pie.The strength of its chip exports is unsurprising as some of the largest chip companies are located in the Republic of Korea (ROK). The country is home to two of the world's three largest memory manufacturers - SK Hynix and Samsung. The pair collectively controlled roughly two thirds of the global memory market as of September 2022. Samsung's chipmaking divisions are also responsible for manufacturing semiconductors for other companies  and Samsung Foundry is only of two companies in the world (the other being TSMC) that make chips for others with leading edge process technologies such as 5-nanometer and now 3-nanometer. Out of the 15 chipmaking fabs in South Korea  eight are owned by Samsung which also makes processors and graphics processing units (GPUs) for its own smartphone lineup. These are used in international variants of the devices that are sold outside the United States due to an agreement with the U.S. chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).As the demand for semiconductors grow around the world  companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are set to experience record profits in the long term.Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World.Suggested Articles:Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.29,0.11,0.6,True,English,"['Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries', 'World', 'U.S. chipmaking giant Intel Corporation', 'top ten semiconductor manufacturing countries', 'compounded annual growth rate', 'new American chipmaking plant', 'Top 5 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company', 'Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries', 'information-driven, modern day economy', 'U.S. firms', 'global semiconductor sales', 'The U.S.', 'necessary raw materials', 'current account surplus', 'largest startup ecosystems', 'U.S. state', 'worldwide semiconductor spending', 'Semiconductor Industry Association', 'worldwide chip leaders', 'major semiconductor foundries', '16 Largest Semiconductor Companies', 'chipzilla Intel Corporation', 'four semiconductor foundries', 'Western Asian country', 'World Dragon Images', 'vast supporting ecosystem', 'NASDAQ listed companies', 'chipmaking facilities', 'Tower Semiconductor', 'American companies', 'Semiconductor fabrication', 'largest constituent', 'liberal countries', 'chip manufacturers', 'chip production', 'difficult industries', 'capital expenditure', 'single player', 'actual testing', 'expensive machines', 'geographic pockets', 'foundry ecosystem', 'strong ecosystem', 'steady stream', 'Arizonian ecosystem', 'multiple locations', 'IC Insights', 'four decades', 'overall pie', 'South Korea', 'second place', 'European Union', 'third place', 'QUALCOMM Incorporated', 'advanced nations', '9.6 million people', 'high GDP', 'business ecosystem', 'little need', 'foreign capital', 'technology hub', 'Israeli chipmaker', 'The State', '9% market shares', 'Chinese market', 'Americas market', 'Market Cap', 'Planned Fabs', 'The Netherlands', 'European country', 'right equipment', 'brief look', 'research firm', 'special regions', 'piece', 'Chips', 'development', 'billions', 'dollars', 'silicon', 'wafers', 'edge', 'others', 'example', 'Arizona', 'INTC', 'universities', 'programs', 'needs', 'engineers', 'strength', 'NYSE', 'TSM', 'estimate', 'investment', 'units', 'coverage', 'stunning', 'CAGR', '21% share', 'Japan', 'half', 'Methodology', 'number', 'plants', 'construction', 'QCOM', 'Operational', 'population', 'mere', 'China', 'loans', 'economic', 'process', 'umbrella', 'Kingdom', 'Earth', '2021']",2022-12-08,2022-12-08,finance.yahoo.com

TuneCore is wholly owned by Believe  one of the world‚Äôs leading digital music companies.While the $3 billion figure represents a cumulative total of earnings from all TuneCore music creators - including artists ranging from hobbyists and nascent music creators to working professionals and even accomplished artists - the potential for success through an independent distributor has never been greater  with over 8 000 TuneCore artists earning over $10 000  thousands of artists earning between $50 000 and $100 000 and many taking home over $1 000 000. The huge payout to artists is aided by TuneCore‚Äôs direct deals with all digital service providers  which is a true differentiator in the market. The company also offers additional revenue streams for its artists via its Social Platforms and YouTube Content ID programs  with TuneCore‚Äôs music publishing division having paid artists close to $90 000 000 (since the launch of TuneCore Music Publishing Administration in 2011). By offering a wide array of resources to aid music creators at all stages of their careers  TuneCore has created a platform where artists receive not just world-class distribution services  but a support structure for long-term career growth.Self-releasing artists represent the fastest growing segment of the global music market  with all self-releasing artists growing from 1.7% of overall market share in 2015 to 5.3% in 2021 (source: MIDiA Research).Denis Ladegaillerie  Chief Executive Officer  Believe commented  ‚ÄúTuneCore is essential to Believe‚Äôs overarching mission  as well as key to the Group‚Äôs ecosystem  which is designed to support a wide range of artists at all stages of their careers  and across all demographics. The achievement of reaching $3 billion earned by self-releasing artists speaks volumes to the importance of supporting all creators equally . Which is why the whole artistic community must be nurtured without differentiation to allow the emergence of a new class of self-releasing artists that will be able to sustain themselves by making a living from their art. Not all artists aim at becoming superstars  but all top artists need a launchpad to blossom.‚ÄùAt last count  over 400 TuneCore artists have been upstreamed to Believe‚Äôs premium services levels  Label and Artist Solutions (LAS) as well as Artist Services (AS). By strengthening the connections between Believe and TuneCore  the Group has built an offering that fits artists‚Äô needs at all stages of their development  and has created an environment where music creators have the freedom to experiment with all music genres - from traditional to progressive styles. Italy‚Äôs La Sad is a brilliant example of this  with three solo acts from different backgrounds and genres  coming together to introduce a new sound for that market through TuneCore  and eventually upstreaming to Believe.Andreea Gleeson  Chief Executive Officer  TuneCore added  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to offer innovative technology-based services at affordable price points to all music creators  whether you‚Äôre a beginner or a top artist. Ed Sheeran  Lizzo  and Chance the Rapper all started their careers on TuneCore - in fact  the next Ed Sheeran  the next Lizzo and the next Chance could all very well be on our roster right now. Our goal is to give all self-releasing artists the freedom to create  test  perfect ‚Äì and earn money from ‚Äì their music  without restrictions. When you foster a space where creativity flows  artists are able to push boundaries and that‚Äôs where innovation lives ‚Äì artists collaborating to create new music  new sounds  and new genres.‚ÄùTuneCore and many of its artists share a passionately independent spirit. Atlanta-born  Los Angeles-based R&B artist Taner√©lle started her career in 2015 with the electro/dance-pop single ‚ÄúSiren‚Äù and has been gaining recognition ever since for her unique style of R&B that blends the hazy production of lo-fi hip-hop with lush soundscapes into an expressive  otherworldly style fitting of her Mama Saturn alter-ego. She has amassed more than 70 million streams on Spotify alone  has garnered media praise from major media outlets including MTV  Paper Magazine  Vibe & more  and her music has been featured on Spike Lee‚Äôs She‚Äôs Gotta Have It  Issa Rae‚Äôs Insecure & more  all without the support of the traditional label system. ‚ÄúBeing an independent artist has allowed me to evolve as a creative  a woman and an activist ‚Äù says Taner√©lle. ‚ÄúIt has allowed me to feel limitless and in control of my own voice and my own destiny. It‚Äôs more than anyone could ask for of this craft.‚ÄùAmong the new generation of artists who choose to retain control of their career and build their own team as an independent TuneCore artist  is country music sensation Maggie Baugh. As a teenager  Nashville-based country artist Maggie Baugh initially signed to a record label before carving a path for herself as a self-releasing artist. In 2021  her singles ‚ÄúDrinking To The Broken Hearts‚Äù and ‚ÄúThink About Me ‚Äù released through TuneCore  amassed over one million streams each on Spotify alone  and Baugh found herself repeatedly turning down label offers as her music went viral on social media. She has garnered media praise from People Magazine  American Songwriter  Taste of Country & more  and ‚ÄúThink About Me‚Äù closed out the year as number one on Spotify‚Äôs Fresh Finds Country: Best of 2021 playlist. Baugh commented  ""As an independent artist  we work hours upon hours to achieve our goals and dreams. We eat  breathe and sleep our careers. Of course  no one should work harder than the artist  but there is something to be said about having a fantastic team and a group of people behind you. I continue to stay independent after success because I want to find the right group of people who genuinely have my best interest at heart  who are willing to work their tails off with me  and are excited about what I‚Äôve got going on as an artist.‚ÄùAs TuneCore has continued to grow  so has the company‚Äôs international artist roster. As a result  artists around the world have opted to embrace careers as self-releasing artists. 34% of artists who generated more than $10 000 on Spotify live in countries outside the top ten music markets (source: Spotify) and TuneCore‚Äôs creators outside the US have grown to represent 60% of its new artists and labels. In Italy  renown rapper Vacca  known for his high-profile collaborations with artists like Styles P  previously released albums through EMI (2007‚Äôs Faccio quello che voglio)  UMG (2010‚Äôs Sporco  2011‚Äôs Pelleossa  2013's Pazienza)  and Sony Music (2015‚Äôs L‚Äôultimo tango)  before ultimately turning away from the traditional label system and returning to his independent roots. Vacca commented  ""The best moments of my career were when substantial income began to come from my catalog. At that time I began to really understand the greatness of TuneCore and the opportunity it was giving us independent artists. Because of TuneCore  we're able to directly manage our projects  our art  and consequently also our life.‚ÄùEarlier this year  to further democratize the music industry for self-releasing artists  TuneCore unveiled its new UNLIMITED pricing structure in 2022  giving artists the power to release an unlimited number of singles and albums for one flat annual rate and allowing them to create more music and experiment with different release strategies to advance their careers and feed their growing fanbases. In November 2021  TuneCore also launched Social Platforms   which allows artists to upload their music‚Äîfor no upfront cost‚Äîdirectly into the music libraries of social media platforms like TikTok  YouTube Shorts  Facebook and Instagram stories and Reels  where they are able to gain exposure while simultaneously earning money from their music.By providing an open platform  accessible technology solution for self-releasing artists to widely distribute and earn money from their music  Believe and TuneCore have helped to create a more sustainable and healthy industry where no step is skipped and artists can have the right environment at all stages of their careers to meet their ambitions.

It is June 2025 ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI can only speak for my term here. Beyond my time here  what can happen? None of us can predict that.‚ÄúWe were extending equivalence  but only on the basis that we would move towards making sure we had oversight on clearing ‚Äù Ms McGuinness said. ‚ÄúSo I think the market knows. It knows what we want it to do.‚ÄùRead MoreYesterday  the Commission released a slew of amendments to existing laws that will force banks to move ‚Äúa portion‚Äù of euro-denominated derivatives contracts to Europe.The move will affect interest rate derivatives denominated in euro and Polish zloty  and credit default swaps - contracts where investors bet on companies or countries going bust.What we‚Äôre doing is in the interests of the European UnionBut it‚Äôs not clear what percentage or number of the contracts will be cleared in Europe. That will be decided by the EU‚Äôs markets regulator after the rules are adopted.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a figure and I think it‚Äôs better that we don‚Äôt have a figure ‚Äù Ms McGuinness said. ‚ÄúWe have an objective and we have a reason why we‚Äôre doing it  which is around strengthening our own infrastructure and around our own financial stability.‚ÄùChanges to the bloc‚Äôs clearing and listing regimes are a further step in building what it calls a capital markets union.Ms McGuinness said it‚Äôs not a bid to steal British business.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never framed what we are doing as taking from. I‚Äôve always said the objective is to strengthen the EU‚Äôs financial infrastructure. I think we‚Äôve moved on from earlier days of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs mine is mine‚Äô.‚ÄúWhen we look at our relationship with the United Kingdom  sanctions have unified a lot of countries  [and] brought together the UK and the European Union.‚ÄúI would hope there is an understanding in London that what we‚Äôre doing is in the interests of the European Union  and we fully respect the right and capacity of the United Kingdom to do what it needs to do around its financial industry  in its interests.‚ÄúI think there is a healthy respect for why we are doing this.‚Äù‚ÄãExpand Close Stephane Boujnah is chief executive officer of Euronext.

There were various efforts designed to dampen the animal spirits in the Square Mile.These include the capping of banker bonuses  failed attempts by Deutsche Bourse to merge with the London Stock Exchange (LSE)  and Solvency II  which is now being dismantled.Ahead of its rivals: The UK remains the world's biggest location for foreign exchange with a 38 per cent market shareThe reality is that long after the Brexit referendum in 2016 and the UK's formal farewell to Brussels on January 31  2020  London's role as Europe's largest financial centre is remarkably intact.The UK remains the world's biggest location for foreign exchange with a 38 per cent market share. In the first half of this year the London Clearing House  owned by the LSE  traded ‚Ç¨191.3trillion (¬£164.7trilllion) of euro area swaps alone.Brussels aims to repatriate some interest rate contracts to Continental capitals. But even if this happens  it is estimated that no more than 20 per cent would move to the Eurex in Frankfurt.All of this provides context to comments by Euronext chief executive Stephane Boujnah who told Bloomberg that London is no longer Europe's largest financial centre.He argued it was simply the financial centre for Britain. He noted that while 'more money changes hands in London than Paris' each day turnover across all of Euronext's exchanges is double that of London.He points to the Dublin listing of Ryanair (the London listing was secondary) as well as Universal Music NV's Dutch float as quote evidence of City decline.Losing key listings in London is disappointing. Dealogic data shows that 2022 was a bad year for initial public offerings. Floats were 90 per cent down in New York and 80 per cent down in Europe.The LSE was the busiest of platforms with 41 debuts raising ¬£1billion. That is not a big number but it is more than twice the capital raised in Paris  which saw just two new listings.The narrative that the City has been overtaken by Paris  Amsterdam and other trading centres does not stand up to full scrutiny. As the Euronext boss conceded  in money terms  London is ahead of rivals.Adjusting for the value of suspended Russian stocks  the drop in the pound this year and other factors  claims for Euronext and Paris look less persuasive.Moreover  the bigger stock market transactions  conducted by London-based investment banks in Amsterdam  often go through Turquoise. Say it quietly ‚Äì but that is owned and operated by the LSE.Digestion reliefAfter months of uncertainty  a sigh of relief at GlaxoSmithKline  Haleon  Sanofi et al over the federal court ruling on the safety of ulcer drug Zantac.US Judge Robin Rosenberg's 300-page demolition of an action brought by 50 000 plaintiffs  claiming Zantac was responsible for causing five types of cancer  could not have been more definitive.The share prices of GSK and Haleon have been under a cloud since August  when the markets first wised up to the fact that the blockbuster drug might have had harmful side-effects. Morgan Stanley put the potential compensation bill at ¬£37.5billion.There is a quiet confidence that Rosenberg's forensic wrecking of the science put forward by claimants should serve the cause of the pharma companies well in still-to-be-heard hearings in Delaware.Precedent suggests that Delaware rarely challenges matters already heard by a federal judge.Of more concern might be the trial scheduled for February 13 in Oakland  California. The litigants there claim their clients are 'suffering from all types of cancer' and deserve justice. As BP and others could testify  outcomes from some state courts can be very quirky and costly.One cannot ignore the perceived health maladies suffered by some Zantac users. But as share price rises show  Judge Rosenberg has given big pharma the upper hand.Farewell FenwickThe disappearance of Fenwick from New Bond Street after 130 years denudes the West End of London of yet another landmark department store.The saving grace is that the cash from the sale gives its other emblematic luxury stores in Kingston  Brent Cross and its base in Newcastle better chances of survival.

With the development of digital technology  almost infinite information fields can be associated with it. In the metaverse  our objective is to transform this 'intelligent' point into an 'intelligible' point by resorting to algorithms.

The resulting data will serve as the basis for the creation of a metaverse in the form of an escape game...MARIELLE MAYOIn the hills just north of Lyon  nestled between the verdant Monts d'Or and the river Sa√¥ne  the village of Saint-Romain-au-Mont-d'Or offers a haven of tranquility. Upon arrival  you may be forgiven for experiencing a certain surprise when you discover  at the bend of a road lined with bourgeois sandstone houses  the blackened enclosure walls of the Abode of Chaos  entirely tagged with inscriptions and portraits‚Ä¶ street art style. Behind these walls  Thierry Ehrmann  an entrepreneur and an artist-sculptor has transformed the Domaine de la source  a 17th-century property  into an open-air museum of contemporary art where monumental sculptures  shipping containers  giant skulls  aircraft wrecks  and industrial machinery rub shoulders with hundreds of large-scale mural portraits  inscriptions and a plethora of esoteric formulas. Thanks to extensive work undertaken since 2020 by the multidisciplinary teams of land surveyors  TT G√©om√®tres Experts  this post-apocalyptic artworks has now been completely digitized.""Remarkable contemporary architecture""Founder of Groupe Serveur  a company specializing in databases  and of its subsidiary Artprice  a global player in art market information  Thierry Ehrmann has always been a digital pioneer and has been interested in computer-generated imagery since its origins. So  despite the somewhat daunting challenge  creating a virtual duplicate of the Abode of Chaos seemed a perfectly logical step. In the end  the various lockdowns associated with the Covid-19 crisis provided a perfect opportunity for the museum to close its doors and initiate the work. It also coincided with an initiative to obtain the ""Remarkable Contemporary Architecture"" label  which  apart from establishing a formal architectural analysis of the Abode  sought to obtain official cultural recognition as a way of protecting his ""great work"" in a long-standing legal dispute with the local municipality that began in 2004.With this in mind  Ehrmann approached architect Nicolas Detry  a specialist in the ""patrimoine martyr""  because  with its scarified walls  its bricked-up windows  its floor gutted by a meteorite  the old estate has been transformed into a 'total work of art'  drowned ""in a permanent state of war""  with certain installations recalling the attacks of September 11  2001  and major planet-damaging events such as oil spills  all surrounded by portraits and inscriptions echoing global news. Indeed  each of Ehrmann's interventions  as well as those of his guest artists  posit new traces of our tormented era. A formal architectural analysis of the site was therefore an important step in elucidating the artist's approach  and a highly detailed architectural survey of the property was an essential part of this process. ""We decided to digitize the entire site ‚Äì the 6 300 works of art  the sculptures  the volumes  the buildings  the plants  everything! ‚Äì using European heritage conservation standards  with surface and volume meshing for the whole space"" says Thierry Ehrmann. Nicolas Detry put him in contact with Philippe Barth√©lemy  head of the TTGE group's 3D Lab.The first meeting in July 2020 established the basis for a technical documentary project with a scientific digital dimension  geo-referenced and endowed with sub-centimeter resolution. ""I have been familiar with the most advanced 3D imaging systems for twenty years. What we needed was a team of top-level land surveyors! Their role as experts in collecting spatial data is vital in recreating virtual spaces that faithfully represent real spaces  and that is what we wanted!"" enthuses Thierry Ehrmann. The objective was to capture the singularity of each work  but also to create graphic illustrations allowing a better comprehension of the whole site  notably by highlighting certain recurring artistic/architectural features such as additions of materials (poured concrete  inclusions of meteorites in the facades  etc.) and the removal of certain materials. ""In the real world  I used a cherry-picker to 'sculpt' the thousands of square meters of the site's facades with a hammer and chisel""  explains the visual artist.The submission date for the base project was fixed for November 2020  and a tight schedule was drawn up for the data acquisition ‚Äì covering 7555 m2 out of the total 9000 m2 surface area ‚Äì as well as the processing and the calibrated colorization of all the different artistic and architectural initiatives. Philippe Barth√©lemy worked with a team of around fifteen TTGE employees  each with their area of expertise. ""We developed a specific and flexible methodology in order to manage the complexity and volume of the data produced during the acquisition process"" he explains. The mission included the creation of a polygonal geo-referenced map  Lidar data acquisition  and a high-resolution photogrammetric survey of the whole site  as well as all the calculations and processing required for the creation of a resized geo-referenced 3D digital twin. Ground data was acquired using a Z+F 3D laser scanner (Zoller & Fr√∂hlich) and a NavVis VLX mobile scanning system  with Lidar and photogrammetric surveys carried out using drones. ""The technical challenge was to work with heterogeneous acquisition data and merge the results to enhance the quality of the digital twin"" specifies the engineer.Beyond the purely technical challenge  this extraordinary project involved measuring artistic and architectural initiatives accurately and proposing modes of representation that serve as real tools for understanding and documenting the works. ""Land-surveying can be extremely useful in a wide variety of contexts as long as the teams adapt to the specific requirements of each site""  says Philippe Barth√©l√©my. So  while Nicolas Detry and historian/archaeologist Rapha√´lle Rivi√®re produced their historical and archeological analysis of the site  the team from TTGE provided site and elevation plans  architectural surveys and orthophotographs  3D models  longitudinal and transverse sections  heat maps using color gradients to highlight the additions and removal of materials  using different methods of illustration to compose eleven graphic plates to identify and highlight the major works. In short  the potential uses of digital data are numerous: measuring and documenting the evolution of the site  planning new projects  simulations  etc.TTGE also produced 37 000 360¬∞ panoramic shots and 18 000 360¬∞ 4K and 8K videos  the time-stamped and localized files corresponding respectively to 940 GB and 1.2 TB of data. All in all  the results of their work provided a perfect base for Thierry Ehrmann's latest project: ""The idea is to make a metaverse (editor's note: a virtual meta-universe) of the Abode""  he explains. As a first step  he asked TTGE's innovation center to develop an interface for the general public  allowing immersive visits in virtual and augmented reality. ""In this virtual environment  the public will be able to discover new aspects of the Abode  for example  by climbing safely onto the platform above the east wing  going inside certain works  and accessing the Abode's private areas. Everyone will also be able to access the historical documentation as well as the videos""  summarizes Thierry Ehrmann.A dynamic digital twinA smart navigation system should be launched in the first half of 2023. ""We see the metaverse as a dynamic digital twin  the challenge being to bring it to life and allow exchanges between the creator and his audience""  emphasizes Philippe Barthelemy. The recommendation engine's algorithms will guide the ""experiencer"" in an intimate discovery of the artist's approach and the connections between the works based on the experiencer's sensitivity to the history and/or the aesthetics of the works  the techniques used and the geo-political or esoteric messages  and it will offer him/her a tailor-made route through the collections. This is the first stone of a larger metaverse  which will also offer an ""agora"" to host thematic events and integrate art market-related activities initiated by Artprice  and notably an NFT Marketplace (as NFT technology allows the exchange of digital works associated with a cyber register [blockchain] that is deemed to hold unfalsifiable titles of ownership).An intelligent point becomes intelligible‚Ä¶All of this might seem far removed from the job of a land surveyor... But  for Philippe Barth√©l√©my  the advent of metaverses in the service of culture offers opportunities to a profession that will greatly benefit from the integration of new skills  particularly in AI  to position themselves in the market. ""The land surveyor has the expertise to certify a point in space. With the development of digital technology  almost infinite information fields can be associated with it.
