It is June 2025 ” she said. “I can only speak for my term here. Beyond my time here  what can happen? None of us can predict that.“We were extending equivalence  but only on the basis that we would move towards making sure we had oversight on clearing ” Ms McGuinness said. “So I think the market knows. It knows what we want it to do.”Read MoreYesterday  the Commission released a slew of amendments to existing laws that will force banks to move “a portion” of euro-denominated derivatives contracts to Europe.The move will affect interest rate derivatives denominated in euro and Polish zloty  and credit default swaps - contracts where investors bet on companies or countries going bust.What we’re doing is in the interests of the European UnionBut it’s not clear what percentage or number of the contracts will be cleared in Europe. That will be decided by the EU’s markets regulator after the rules are adopted.“I don’t have a figure and I think it’s better that we don’t have a figure ” Ms McGuinness said. “We have an objective and we have a reason why we’re doing it  which is around strengthening our own infrastructure and around our own financial stability.”Changes to the bloc’s clearing and listing regimes are a further step in building what it calls a capital markets union.Ms McGuinness said it’s not a bid to steal British business.“I’ve never framed what we are doing as taking from. I’ve always said the objective is to strengthen the EU’s financial infrastructure. I think we’ve moved on from earlier days of ‘what’s mine is mine’.“When we look at our relationship with the United Kingdom  sanctions have unified a lot of countries  [and] brought together the UK and the European Union.“I would hope there is an understanding in London that what we’re doing is in the interests of the European Union  and we fully respect the right and capacity of the United Kingdom to do what it needs to do around its financial industry  in its interests.“I think there is a healthy respect for why we are doing this.”​Expand Close Stephane Boujnah is chief executive officer of Euronext.

With the development of digital technology  almost infinite information fields can be associated with it. In the metaverse  our objective is to transform this 'intelligent' point into an 'intelligible' point by resorting to algorithms. All of this is part of the same value chain.""Below is the translation in English of the original article in French.Special thanks go to the monthly magazine Géomètre© as well as to Marielle Mayo.The Abode of Chaos  a metaverse in the makingLocated close to the French city of Lyon  The ""Abode of Chaos"" (Demeure du Chaos) and its open-air museum of contemporary art have been completely digitized in collaboration with a firm of land surveyors. The resulting data will serve as the basis for the creation of a metaverse in the form of an escape game...MARIELLE MAYOIn the hills just north of Lyon  nestled between the verdant Monts d'Or and the river Saône  the village of Saint-Romain-au-Mont-d'Or offers a haven of tranquility. Upon arrival  you may be forgiven for experiencing a certain surprise when you discover  at the bend of a road lined with bourgeois sandstone houses  the blackened enclosure walls of the Abode of Chaos  entirely tagged with inscriptions and portraits… street art style. Behind these walls  Thierry Ehrmann  an entrepreneur and an artist-sculptor has transformed the Domaine de la source  a 17th-century property  into an open-air museum of contemporary art where monumental sculptures  shipping containers  giant skulls  aircraft wrecks  and industrial machinery rub shoulders with hundreds of large-scale mural portraits  inscriptions and a plethora of esoteric formulas. Thanks to extensive work undertaken since 2020 by the multidisciplinary teams of land surveyors  TT Géomètres Experts  this post-apocalyptic artworks has now been completely digitized.""Remarkable contemporary architecture""Founder of Groupe Serveur  a company specializing in databases  and of its subsidiary Artprice  a global player in art market information  Thierry Ehrmann has always been a digital pioneer and has been interested in computer-generated imagery since its origins. So  despite the somewhat daunting challenge  creating a virtual duplicate of the Abode of Chaos seemed a perfectly logical step. In the end  the various lockdowns associated with the Covid-19 crisis provided a perfect opportunity for the museum to close its doors and initiate the work. It also coincided with an initiative to obtain the ""Remarkable Contemporary Architecture"" label  which  apart from establishing a formal architectural analysis of the Abode  sought to obtain official cultural recognition as a way of protecting his ""great work"" in a long-standing legal dispute with the local municipality that began in 2004.With this in mind  Ehrmann approached architect Nicolas Detry  a specialist in the ""patrimoine martyr""  because  with its scarified walls  its bricked-up windows  its floor gutted by a meteorite  the old estate has been transformed into a 'total work of art'  drowned ""in a permanent state of war""  with certain installations recalling the attacks of September 11  2001  and major planet-damaging events such as oil spills  all surrounded by portraits and inscriptions echoing global news. Indeed  each of Ehrmann's interventions  as well as those of his guest artists  posit new traces of our tormented era. A formal architectural analysis of the site was therefore an important step in elucidating the artist's approach  and a highly detailed architectural survey of the property was an essential part of this process. ""We decided to digitize the entire site – the 6 300 works of art  the sculptures  the volumes  the buildings  the plants  everything! – using European heritage conservation standards  with surface and volume meshing for the whole space"" says Thierry Ehrmann. Nicolas Detry put him in contact with Philippe Barthélemy  head of the TTGE group's 3D Lab.The first meeting in July 2020 established the basis for a technical documentary project with a scientific digital dimension  geo-referenced and endowed with sub-centimeter resolution. ""I have been familiar with the most advanced 3D imaging systems for twenty years. What we needed was a team of top-level land surveyors! Their role as experts in collecting spatial data is vital in recreating virtual spaces that faithfully represent real spaces  and that is what we wanted!"" enthuses Thierry Ehrmann. The objective was to capture the singularity of each work  but also to create graphic illustrations allowing a better comprehension of the whole site  notably by highlighting certain recurring artistic/architectural features such as additions of materials (poured concrete  inclusions of meteorites in the facades  etc.) and the removal of certain materials. ""In the real world  I used a cherry-picker to 'sculpt' the thousands of square meters of the site's facades with a hammer and chisel""  explains the visual artist.The submission date for the base project was fixed for November 2020  and a tight schedule was drawn up for the data acquisition – covering 7555 m2 out of the total 9000 m2 surface area – as well as the processing and the calibrated colorization of all the different artistic and architectural initiatives. Philippe Barthélemy worked with a team of around fifteen TTGE employees  each with their area of expertise. ""We developed a specific and flexible methodology in order to manage the complexity and volume of the data produced during the acquisition process"" he explains. The mission included the creation of a polygonal geo-referenced map  Lidar data acquisition  and a high-resolution photogrammetric survey of the whole site  as well as all the calculations and processing required for the creation of a resized geo-referenced 3D digital twin. Ground data was acquired using a Z+F 3D laser scanner (Zoller & Fröhlich) and a NavVis VLX mobile scanning system  with Lidar and photogrammetric surveys carried out using drones. ""The technical challenge was to work with heterogeneous acquisition data and merge the results to enhance the quality of the digital twin"" specifies the engineer.Beyond the purely technical challenge  this extraordinary project involved measuring artistic and architectural initiatives accurately and proposing modes of representation that serve as real tools for understanding and documenting the works. ""Land-surveying can be extremely useful in a wide variety of contexts as long as the teams adapt to the specific requirements of each site""  says Philippe Barthélémy. So  while Nicolas Detry and historian/archaeologist Raphaëlle Rivière produced their historical and archeological analysis of the site  the team from TTGE provided site and elevation plans  architectural surveys and orthophotographs  3D models  longitudinal and transverse sections  heat maps using color gradients to highlight the additions and removal of materials  using different methods of illustration to compose eleven graphic plates to identify and highlight the major works. In short  the potential uses of digital data are numerous: measuring and documenting the evolution of the site  planning new projects  simulations  etc.TTGE also produced 37 000 360° panoramic shots and 18 000 360° 4K and 8K videos  the time-stamped and localized files corresponding respectively to 940 GB and 1.2 TB of data. All in all  the results of their work provided a perfect base for Thierry Ehrmann's latest project: ""The idea is to make a metaverse (editor's note: a virtual meta-universe) of the Abode""  he explains. As a first step  he asked TTGE's innovation center to develop an interface for the general public  allowing immersive visits in virtual and augmented reality. ""In this virtual environment  the public will be able to discover new aspects of the Abode  for example  by climbing safely onto the platform above the east wing  going inside certain works  and accessing the Abode's private areas. Everyone will also be able to access the historical documentation as well as the videos""  summarizes Thierry Ehrmann.A dynamic digital twinA smart navigation system should be launched in the first half of 2023. ""We see the metaverse as a dynamic digital twin  the challenge being to bring it to life and allow exchanges between the creator and his audience""  emphasizes Philippe Barthelemy. The recommendation engine's algorithms will guide the ""experiencer"" in an intimate discovery of the artist's approach and the connections between the works based on the experiencer's sensitivity to the history and/or the aesthetics of the works  the techniques used and the geo-political or esoteric messages  and it will offer him/her a tailor-made route through the collections. This is the first stone of a larger metaverse  which will also offer an ""agora"" to host thematic events and integrate art market-related activities initiated by Artprice  and notably an NFT Marketplace (as NFT technology allows the exchange of digital works associated with a cyber register [blockchain] that is deemed to hold unfalsifiable titles of ownership).An intelligent point becomes intelligible…All of this might seem far removed from the job of a land surveyor... But  for Philippe Barthélémy  the advent of metaverses in the service of culture offers opportunities to a profession that will greatly benefit from the integration of new skills  particularly in AI  to position themselves in the market. ""The land surveyor has the expertise to certify a point in space. With the development of digital technology  almost infinite information fields can be associated with it. In the metaverse  our objective is to transform this 'intelligent' point into an 'intelligible' point by resorting to algorithms. All of this is part of the same value chain "" he concludes.KEY DATES & FIGURES:1999The Abode of Chaos becomes an open-air museum of contemporary art (Musée l'Organe) created in 1999.

Pisoni also offers digital printing services via its company Tendance Pixxl.Pisoni is the reference company in the south of France  a region that is renowned for its economic strength which exceeds the French average and which benefits from busy tourist traffic. Its assets are located in six departments - Alpes-Maritimes  Hérault  Var  Drôme  Bouches-du-Rhône  Alpes-de-Haute-Provence – and it has four local branches in Mouans-Sartoux  Six-Fours  Saint-Jean-de-Védas and Valence.As a player with strong local links  JCDecaux has partnerships in over 1000 'communities' (French regional administrative areas) and thanks to its acquisition of Pisoni is now strengthening its presence in the Mediterranean basin. With its quality assets  Pisoni and JCDecaux share the values of high standards and responsibility and together with the 200+ JCDecaux employees in the region  will work together in the service of cities  advertising partners and people.This acquisition will also enable JCDecaux to consolidate its national coverage in street furniture within the fragmented and highly competitive French media market. The complementary nature of the JCDecaux and Pisoni assets represents a genuine strength to offer local companies  both regional and national  ever-more efficient analogue and digital display solutions  with development to continue in line with a qualitative approach that monitors energy consumption  for both short and long-term campaigns (representing 50% of Pisoni’s revenue in 2021).Story continuesFully aware of the societal challenges faced today  Pisoni has adopted a sustainable development approach to protect the quality of urban life. The link-up with JCDecaux will enable it to continue to pursue its commitments and to benefit from best practices in terms of ESG.The acquisition of Pisoni is part of JCDecaux’s external growth strategy aimed at seizing relevant market opportunities as they arise.Christophe Ulivieri  Chairman of Pisoni  declared: “This deal represents a major turning point for the Pisoni teams  and confirms that our strategy addresses increasing market demand. We immediately hit it off with JCDecaux and found a genuine partner in this family-owned company  in which we have full confidence to continue to write our company’s story. We are delighted and proud to finalise our development projects alongside JCDecaux  which is the expert company in its sector  and we thank Largillière Finance for their excellent assistance in this process”.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “As a family-owned French company  pioneer of street furniture and leading employer in this sector in France and worldwide  JCDecaux is a reliable and committed partner in the transformation of cities.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland  & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today reported interim clinical outcomes from the first ten1 people treated to regulate blood pressure with implantable ARC Therapy  ONWARD’s targeted spinal cord stimulation technique. ARC Therapy immediately improved blood pressure levels for all participants; this benefit has been sustained for the duration of the current follow-up period. Participants have also reported improved quality of life  increased energy and vitality  and reduced dizziness.Aaron Phillips  PhD  Associate Professor  Physiology and Pharmacology  Biomedical Engineering  Cardiac Sciences  Clinical Neurosciences  Cumming School of Medicine  University of Calgary  and the Principal Investigator of the HEMO study  said: “Low blood pressure has long been a hidden complication of spinal cord injury that often goes unrecognized and leaves people feeling unwell. It also potentially predisposes them to cardiovascular disease. The results reported today with ARC Therapy are compelling and may open a new avenue to help people with spinal cord injury truly feel better  while also addressing heart health.”The interim outcomes reported today are from ten people with spinal cord injury who were treated at clinical centers in Canada and Switzerland. In addition to a sustained increase in blood pressure levels  participants who were taking an anti-hypotension drug prior to entering the study were able to significantly reduce or discontinue their medication. Participants also reported improved general well-being: Participants reported a reduction in orthostatic hypotension  including reduced dizziness and improved energy  and those prone to fainting or light-headedness prior to implant indicated that such incidents declined dramatically following treatment with ARC Therapy. Participants continue to be followed  in one case for as long as three years  and the therapy remains beneficial in all cases.Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD  said: “We are excited by these highly promising outcomes  which reinforce our plan to further develop and bring ARC-IM to the market for this important indication. Today  there are limited and ineffective options for treating people with low blood pressure after spinal cord injury  and our therapy has the potential to address an issue that significantly impacts their quality of life.”Over 40% of people with spinal cord injury  or approximately 262 000 people in the U.S. and Europe2  are estimated to experience hypotension  or low blood pressure. Hypotension may limit active participation in physical rehabilitation programs and facilitate the deterioration effects of immobilization and development of undesirable secondary medical complications.Based on the promising interim outcomes from these feasibility studies  ONWARD is preparing to initiate further clinical trials to include U.S. participants in 2023.About Spinal Cord InjurySpinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major unmet medical need for which there is no cure. Approximately 7 million people globally have a spinal cord injury  with over 650 000 in the U.S. and Europe alone. The quality of life of people with SCI can be poor  with paralysis and loss of sensation  issues with blood pressure control and trunk stability  increased potential for infection  incontinence  and loss of sexual function. Assistance is required for daily living activities. And SCI is costly  with the average lifetime cost for paraplegia (paralysis of the legs) of $2.5 million and $5 million for tetraplegia (paralysis of all four limbs).

CONTACT-01 is a phase III clinical trial evaluating Cabomety…,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) announced today that the CONTACT-01 study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) at the final analysis. CONTACT-01 is a phase III clinical trial evaluating Cabometyx® (cabozantinib) in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) versus docetaxel in patients with unmutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who experienced disease progression on or after treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy.Howard Mayer  M.D.  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Ipsen  said: “ The results from the CONTACT-01 clinical trial have shown the challenge of treating NSCLC patients after prior lines of treatment have failed. While the findings of the study have not met the primary endpoint in this setting  we remain confident in the clinical efficacy of cabozantinib alone and in combination with another treatment in existing indications in difficult-to-treat tumor types. We wish to thank the patients  their families and healthcare teams for their participation in this clinical trial.”The safety profile of the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab observed in the trial was consistent with the known safety profiles for each single agent  and no new safety signals were identified. Detailed findings from CONTACT-01 will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting.ENDSAbout CONTACT-01CONTACT-01 is a global  multicenter  randomized  phase 3  open-label study that enrolled 366 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of docetaxel. The study enrolled patients with both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC who progressed during or following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy administered either concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival  objective response rate and duration of response. Results from cohort 7 of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 trial informed the CONTACT-01 trial design. CONTACT-01 was sponsored by Roche and co-funded by Exelixis. Both Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) opted in to participate in the trial and are contributing to the funding for this study under the terms of the companies’ respective collaboration agreements with Exelixis. More information about the trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib)Cabometyx is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with targets including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)  c-MET and the TAM receptor family  which block the growth of cancer.Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The edenred.fr website is also being adapted as part of a digital accessibility initiative for the visually impaired.In 2017  Edenred France launched a partnership with Elioz Connect to make its Client Relations Center accessible to the hearing impaired. Users can contact a client relationship representative by phone or via their computer screen and  depending on their preferred mode of communication  have an interpreter translate the reply into sign language or transcribe it in real time.Eco-design embedded in the production process for Ticket Restaurant and Kadéos solutionsEdenred’s new cards are now also eco-designed and made up of 85% recycled plastic. Ticket Restaurant cards in circulation will be renewed progressively as Edenred replaces expired cards with the new eco-designed versions. The eco-designed cards are 100% recyclable.Story continuesSince 2016  Edenred France has also offered a free service whereby beneficiaries can send in their expired Ticket Restaurant cards for recycling – an unprecedented initiative in France.The market leader in France  Edenred also launched the first fully virtual  mobile-first Ticket Restaurant solution in 2021. The service can be used directly on a smartphone  delivering an optimal user experience while eliminating the production of plastic-based media.As of January 2023  Edenred will also use recycled plastic to produce Kadéos gift cards. In doing so  the Group has the clear goal of driving environmental responsibility throughout the employee benefits market by applying an eco-design approach to its entire range of solutions.Edenred France has also redesigned the user kits that are sent out with cards to explain how each solution works. All employees receive these kits when they become Edenred beneficiaries. The redesigned kits are now lighter  fully recyclable and printed with 98% vegetable-based inks. They will be rolled out as of January 2023 and use 60% less paper than previous versions  saving 15 metric tons of paper per year (France only).Ilan Ouanounou  General Manager of Edenred France  said: “The Ticket Restaurant and Kadéos innovations we have announced today reaffirm Edenred’s technology leadership while stepping up our commitment to a more inclusive  accessible and environmentally friendly world of work. Our solutions’ features are perfectly aligned with employee expectations  such as braille on all our cards  mobile payment and ordering via meal delivery platforms.

The world's second largest wine and spirit company will invest approximately $250 million over five years to build a state-of-the-art  carbon neutral distillery  with related aging warehouses in Marion County  Kentucky for its fast-growing Jefferson's Bourbon brand. This investment will also include the build of a world class visitor center facility that will welcome whiskey aficionados on the historic South Trail of Kentucky Bourbon.Distillery Entry Rendering""American whiskey is an extremely vibrant spirits category  and our strategic investments over the last few years have proven successful "" said Alexandre Ricard  Chairman and CEO  Pernod Ricard. ""Our philosophy of partnering with entrepreneurial brand founders  while preserving the heritage and terroir associated with the brands they created  has made us an established player in premium American Whiskey. Jefferson's founder Trey Zoeller is no exception. This new investment will allow us to grow our share of category sales not only in the U.S.  but also in export markets "" Ricard said.Ann Mukherjee  Chairman and CEO  Pernod Ricard North America  said the new distillery will enable Jefferson's to efficiently keep up with very strong consumer demand while staying true to the company's longstanding commitment to sustainability. ""American whiskey is booming  and Jefferson's growth has been phenomenal "" Mukherjee said. ""We're very bullish on the brand's potential  and we're committed to making our new Jefferson's facility one of the most exemplary distilleries in the world in order to achieve it.Pernod Ricard has announced the intention for this new distillery to be carbon neutral once operational. The facility is also expected to be the first distillery of its size in the U.S. to achieve LEED certification  an internationally recognized sustainability framework for healthy  efficient  carbon and cost-saving environmentally friendly buildings. The distillery and warehouses will include such low carbon technologies as:Story continuesElectrode boilers powered by certified renewable electricity  enabling the distillery to not use fossil fuels during bourbon production.On site electric trucks and facility vehicles also powered by renewable electricity.Extensive use of solar and natural lighting throughout the property and facility.In addition  as part of Pernod Ricard's commitment to protect and nurture the terroir surrounding its facilities  Jefferson's will continue to partner with local farmers and suppliers to source ingredients and casks.""Our company is an agricultural company at its core and so it is vital that we lead the category forward - in partnership with our farmers and growers - and remain committed to the long-term sustainability of our people  our industry and our planet. This investment is the latest illustration of that belief "" said Mukherjee.Pernod Ricard's Irish Distillers and Chivas Brothers brand companies recently announced plans to invest in decarbonizing their distilleries and creating new carbon neutral facilities  following the example set by The Absolut Company  which has consistently set the industry standard for sustainable production. Pernod Ricard is on track to meet the ambitious targets set out in its 2030 global sustainability & responsibility roadmap  'Good Times from a Good Place ' which align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.According to Pierre Joncourt  SVP  Operations  Pernod Ricard North America  ""Construction of the new distillery – which will have a 7.5 million proof gallon capacity -- is expected to begin in January 2023. Our target completion date for the distillery and related warehouses is 2025.""Founded in 1997 by Trey Zoeller and his father Chet  Jefferson's joined the Pernod Ricard portfolio in 2019 when the company acquired the brand's parent  Castle Brands. Known for his unrelenting thirst for adventure  as well as a decades-long passion for crafting the world's most unique expressions of bourbon  Trey Zoeller continues to guide Jefferson's in his role as Founder and Chief Strategist. Since the acquisition  Jefferson's U.S. sales have doubled.""For the last 25 years we have been sourcing  contract distilling and -- through Kentucky Artisan Distillery -- distilling ourselves "" Zoeller said. ""It is now time for us to take more control of our destiny. The carbon neutral  state-of-the-art distillery we are building would not be possible without Pernod Ricard's forward thinking  integrity  and commitment to Jefferson's and the Bourbon category's future.""Pernod Ricard USA's capital investment in the new distillery and visitor center is expected initially to add roughly 55 new company jobs in Kentucky while generating extra economic benefits for Kentucky-based businesses during the construction period. It is the latest in a series of moves made by Pernod Ricard to expand its investment in U.S. manufacturing and grow its share in the lucrative American spirits and wine market.In 2022  the company's Ft. Smith  Arkansas manufacturing plant has invested in new canning and bottling lines.In August 2019  Pernod Ricard acquired the TX Whiskey brand  based in Fort Worth  Texas. TX is known for its bourbon made from a proprietary yeast derived from the pecan tree  the official state tree of Texas.In July 2019  Pernod Ricard acquired a majority stake in Rabbit Hole Distillery  known for its super-premium bourbon and iconic distillery in Louisville  Kentucky.In 2016  the company bought a majority stake in Smooth Ambler  the award-winning West Virginia whiskey distiller. Pernod Ricard assumed full ownership of the brand late last year.""U.S. whiskey sales are expected to account for a significant amount of Pernod Ricard USA's total volumes within the next 5-10 years  and the U.S. whiskey export business also has enormous growth potential "" Craig Johnson  SVP American Whiskey Collective  said. ""To help achieve these ambitious performance goals  the American Whiskey Collective was created the result will be further accelerated growth from our 'new fashioned' whiskey portfolio  focused on pushing boundaries rather than adhering strictly to tradition "" said Johnson.ABOUT PERNOD RICARD USAPernod Ricard USA is the premium spirits and wine company in the U.S.  and the largest subsidiary of Paris  France-based Pernod Ricard SA.  the world's second largest spirits and wine company.

This technology breakthrough  …,NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medidata  a Dassault Systèmes company  has been honored by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with its 2022 Innovation in Regulatory Science Award for Medidata Link. This technology breakthrough  based on Medidata’s Rave EDC (electronic data capture) allows sponsors and regulators to connect and analyze once-disparate data sources to bridge the gap between the clinical trial and real world information sources.The award ceremony in Washington  D.C. on December 6 will feature an address by Robert M. Califf  M.D.  Commissioner of the FDA and acceptance remarks by Medidata co-CEO Sastry Chilukuri.“ The industry has been challenged to understand the full spectrum of a patient’s journey from before the clinical trial starts to long after completion. Medidata Link connects clinical trial data and real world data sources to tell a story from a patient’s historical diagnosis and treatment patterns to the progression of care post-trial ” said Sastry Chilukuri  Medidata co-CEO. “ We are honored to have this advancement recognized by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA.”Medidata Link’s potential was especially apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic  when the technology was used to monitor the long-term safety of a top pharmaceutical company’s breakthrough investigational therapy. Medidata Link securely ingested personal identifiable information (PII) and leveraged de-identification technology from multiple tokenization vendors to enable long-term patient surveillance post-trial. This allowed the company to circumnavigate the slow turnaround times and high costs of traditional clinical approaches while garnering real-time efficacy analysis of their COVID-19 treatment.The Reagan-Udall Foundation embodies the FDA’s vision of collaborative innovation to address regulatory science challenges of the 21st century. This also assists in the creation of new  applied scientific knowledge  tools  standards  and approaches the FDA needs to evaluate products more effectively  predictably  and efficiently  and thereby enhance the ability to protect and promote the health of the American public.Medidata is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dassault Systèmes  which with its 3DEXPERIENCE platform is positioned to lead the digital transformation of life sciences in the age of personalized medicine with the first end-to-end scientific and business platform  from research to commercialization.About MedidataMedidata is leading the digital transformation of life sciences  creating hope for millions of patients.

As a major player in the fashion  automotive  and furniture markets  Lectra contributes with boldness and passion to the Industry 4.0 revolution by providing software  equipment  data  and services to brands  manufacturers  and retailers.Founded in 2018  TextileGenesis provides a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that enables fashion brands and sustainable textile manufacturers to ensure a reliable  secure and fully digital mapping of their textiles  from the fiber to the consumer  and thereby guarantee their authenticity and origins. This solution ensures the traceability of TextileGenesis’ customers' entire sustainable textile supply chain in order to meet the demands for transparency  driven by changes in legislation in a growing number of countries and by growing consumer awareness  thereby encouraging sustainable development.Its innovative traceability mechanism  which addresses both ends of the textile value chain  as well as its network of partners for material certification  and its technology platform guarantee the exchange and tracking of reliable and secure data throughout a material's life cycle.Several of the world's most prestigious fashion brands as well as leading sustainable fiber producers are already convinced of the value of TextileGenesis' innovative offer  which enables the connection of multiple actors of the sustainable fashion ecosystem on this platform.“Fashion is one of the most fragmented industries due to its long and complex value chain  which makes it opaque to brands  suppliers  subcontractors  and consumers” says Amit Gautam  founder of TextileGenesis. “Today  only 19% of fashion industry actors have visibility of their value chain  and this visibility is often partial. Many brands  especially those that have set ambitious sustainability goals  face a real challenge in terms of supply chain transparency. If they cannot track the life cycle of certified materials  they will not be able to justify the sustainability of their products ” he adds.Story continues“Having the highest ethical standards  guaranteeing the well-being of our employees  and preserving the environment are embedded in Lectra’s DNA and guide our daily decisions. Through our technology  acquisitions  and partnerships  we aim to empower our customers to work in a more socially and environmentally responsible way ” says Daniel Harari  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lectra. “We look forward to joining forces with TextileGenesis' talented teams to accelerate the development of their sustainable material traceability solution and deepen our knowledge of the textile value chain in the fashion industry ” he concludes.At the beginning of January  Lectra will acquire 51% of TextileGenesis for 15.2 million euros. The acquisition of the remaining share capital and voting rights is expected to take place in two stages  in 2026 and 2028  for an amount that will be calculated based on a multiple of the 2025 and 2027 recurring revenues.About Lectra:As a major player in the fashion  automotive and furniture markets  Lectra contributes to the Industry 4.0 revolution with boldness and passion by providing best-in-class technologies.The Group offers industrial intelligence solutions - software  equipment  data and services - that facilitate the digital transformation of the companies it serves.

This solution ensures the traceability of TextileGenesis’ customers' entire sustainable textile supply chain in order to meet the demands for transparency  driven by changes in legislation in a growing number of countries and by growing consumer awareness  thereby encouraging sustainable development.Its innovative traceability mechanism  which addresses both ends of the textile value chain  as well as its network of partners for material certification  and its technology platform guarantee the exchange and tracking of reliable and secure data throughout a material's life cycle.Several of the world's most prestigious fashion brands as well as leading sustainable fiber producers are already convinced of the value of TextileGenesis' innovative offer  which enables the connection of multiple actors of the sustainable fashion ecosystem on this platform.“Fashion is one of the most fragmented industries due to its long and complex value chain  which makes it opaque to brands  suppliers  subcontractors  and consumers” says Amit Gautam  founder of TextileGenesis. “Today  only 19% of fashion industry actors have visibility of their value chain  and this visibility is often partial. Many brands  especially those that have set ambitious sustainability goals  face a real challenge in terms of supply chain transparency. If they cannot track the life cycle of certified materials  they will not be able to justify the sustainability of their products ” he adds.Story continues“Having the highest ethical standards  guaranteeing the well-being of our employees  and preserving the environment are embedded in Lectra’s DNA and guide our daily decisions. Through our technology  acquisitions  and partnerships  we aim to empower our customers to work in a more socially and environmentally responsible way ” says Daniel Harari  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lectra. “We look forward to joining forces with TextileGenesis' talented teams to accelerate the development of their sustainable material traceability solution and deepen our knowledge of the textile value chain in the fashion industry ” he concludes.At the beginning of January  Lectra will acquire 51% of TextileGenesis for 15.2 million euros. The acquisition of the remaining share capital and voting rights is expected to take place in two stages  in 2026 and 2028  for an amount that will be calculated based on a multiple of the 2025 and 2027 recurring revenues.About Lectra:As a major player in the fashion  automotive and furniture markets  Lectra contributes to the Industry 4.0 revolution with boldness and passion by providing best-in-class technologies.The Group offers industrial intelligence solutions - software  equipment  data and services - that facilitate the digital transformation of the companies it serves.

For more countries  head on over to Top 5 Semiconductor...,In this piece  we will take a look at the top ten semiconductor manufacturing countries in the world. For more countries  head on over to Top 5 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World.Semiconductor fabrication is one of the most lucrative yet one of the most difficult industries in the world. Chips are responsible for powering the information-driven  modern day economy. However  manufacturing them comes after decades have been spent on research and development and billions of dollars have been spent in capital expenditure to procure the right equipment. Sometimes  even this is not enough as chip manufacturers  also called fabs  are only a single player in a vast supporting ecosystem that ranges from the equipment needed to prepare and transform silicon into the wafers for fabrication to the actual testing of the chips once they have been 'printed' inside expensive machines.Therefore  chip production is concentrated in geographic pockets  with some countries having an edge over others since the supporting foundry ecosystem enables companies to set up facilities there much more easily. An example is the U.S. state of Arizona  which is known for hosting chipzilla Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s foundries and subsequently has a strong ecosystem that consists not only of companies that provide the necessary raw materials  but also universities that tailor their programs to meet Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s needs and ensure that it has a steady stream of engineers ready to build chips. The strength of the Arizonian ecosystem has also enticed the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) to build its new American chipmaking plant in the state as well  after scouting for multiple locations.As an estimate of the investment required to keep the foundries and ecosystem running  a brief look at the capital expenditure of the industry is relevant. According to the research firm IC Insights  worldwide semiconductor spending will sit at a whopping $185.5 billion next year. The spending has grown exponentially in just four decades  as in 1980 it had stood at a mere $14.7 billion.Moving towards units shipped  coverage from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) shows that by the end of 2021  global semiconductor sales had stood at a stunning $555 billion  growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.18% since 2001. The U.S. continued to dominate the market  as it held 46% of the overall pie  with South Korea coming in at second place with a 21% share and Japan and the European Union in third place with 9% market shares  each. Crucially  U.S. firms had also commanded half of the Chinese market  which was the largest in the world with and worth $192.4 billion. However  while American companies were the worldwide chip leaders  the Americas market is the third largest in the world and was valued at $121.5 billion last year.Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the WorldDragon Images/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe looked through the major semiconductor foundries all over the world and determined the countries (or special regions such as Taiwan) in which they are operating in. The regions are then ranked according to the number of fabs that are present in them  and the list is not exhaustive and it also includes plants that are under construction. Also  do check out 16 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap if you want to know about the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Some of the companies on that list include Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World10. State of IsraelNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 4The State of Israel is a Western Asian country that is also one of the most advanced nations in the world. Despite a population of a mere 9.6 million people  the country's economy is worth $497 billion which lends it a high GDP per capita of $52 173. Israel also boasts one of the largest startup ecosystems in the world and has the most NASDAQ listed companies after the U.S. and China as of 2016  indicating the strength of its business ecosystem. Additionally  the country also runs a current account surplus as of 2019  leaving it with little need to be dependent on foreign capital to fund its economy through loans.Owing to the fact that it is an economic and technology hub  the State of Israel also has four semiconductor foundries. Two of these belong to the U.S. chipmaking giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  and two below to Tower Semiconductor  but with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) being in the process of acquiring the Israeli chipmaker  soon all the chipmaking facilities in the country will come under chipzilla's umbrella.9. NetherlandsNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 4The Netherlands is a European country that is the largest constituent of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is one of the most liberal countries on Earth  and also one of the most densely populated regions as more than 500 people live in each square kilometer of the country. The country's GDP stood at a whopping $1.2 trillion in purchasing power parity terms this year  lending it a high GDP per capita of $69 715. The Netherlands is a net exporter and has a large current account surplus  which lends it credibility with global financial markets and lets it borrow trillions of dollars to fuel its growth and keep its credit outlook stable at the same time.Some of the largest multinational firms in the world are also located in the country  and one of the most crucial firms headquartered there is ASML. ASML  like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM)  is one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world. ASML is the only company in the world that is capable of manufacturing high end machines that print semiconductors. The chip industry's progress depends on these machines  and therefore they are always in high demand  even when the industry is facing a downturn as chipmakers are continuously planning for the future. Additionally  the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange is the oldest exchange in the world  since it was set up centuries ago in 1602. Chip manufacturing plants in the Netherlands belong to NXP and Philips  among others.8. MalaysiaNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 7Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country that gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957 and then united with three other colonies  including Singapore  to become Malaysia in 1963. However  Singapore was expelled from the union in 1967  with economic and political disagreements and racial tensions fueling the decision to prevent bloodshed. Malaysia's GDP is estimated to be worth more than a trillion dollars  and the country also runs a current account surplus. Malaysia exports semiconductors and natural resources  among other products.Seven chipmaking plants are located in the country  with four belonging to the German firms Infineon and Osram Licht. Another belongs to a Belgian firm and two belong to Malaysian entities.7. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandNumber of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 12The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a European country  which when combined with Ireland  is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. It has a unique and distinct history  which has seen it not only rule the world but have deep ties to the Roman Empire via its City of London financial hub which is part of Greater London. The U.K. has also pioneered many modern day inventions such as the automobile and the jet engine.The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is home to one of the most consequential semiconductor designers  Arm Ltd. Arm's products are at the heart of most of the world's smartphones and its designs are also used in data center chips. Chip fabrication facilities in the country are owned by Dutch and American firms  among others.6. Republic of Korea (ROK)Number of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4  2022: 15The Republic of Korea (ROK)  also known as South Korea  is an East Asian country that became a republic in 1949. The country is one of the most prosperous nations in the world  with a $2.7 trillion GDP and a GDP per capita of $53 051. South Korea's exports stood at $644 billion in 2021  out of which integrated circuits  or semiconductors  formed the largest chunk as they accounted for more than 15% of the overall pie.The strength of its chip exports is unsurprising as some of the largest chip companies are located in the Republic of Korea (ROK). The country is home to two of the world's three largest memory manufacturers - SK Hynix and Samsung. The pair collectively controlled roughly two thirds of the global memory market as of September 2022. Samsung's chipmaking divisions are also responsible for manufacturing semiconductors for other companies  and Samsung Foundry is only of two companies in the world (the other being TSMC) that make chips for others with leading edge process technologies such as 5-nanometer and now 3-nanometer. Out of the 15 chipmaking fabs in South Korea  eight are owned by Samsung which also makes processors and graphics processing units (GPUs) for its own smartphone lineup. These are used in international variants of the devices that are sold outside the United States due to an agreement with the U.S. chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).As the demand for semiconductors grow around the world  companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)  QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are set to experience record profits in the long term.Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World.Suggested Articles:Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.29,0.11,0.6,True,English,"['Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries', 'World', 'U.S. chipmaking giant Intel Corporation', 'top ten semiconductor manufacturing countries', 'compounded annual growth rate', 'new American chipmaking plant', 'Top 5 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries', 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company', 'Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries', 'information-driven, modern day economy', 'U.S. firms', 'global semiconductor sales', 'The U.S.', 'necessary raw materials', 'current account surplus', 'largest startup ecosystems', 'U.S. state', 'worldwide semiconductor spending', 'Semiconductor Industry Association', 'worldwide chip leaders', 'major semiconductor foundries', '16 Largest Semiconductor Companies', 'chipzilla Intel Corporation', 'four semiconductor foundries', 'Western Asian country', 'World Dragon Images', 'vast supporting ecosystem', 'NASDAQ listed companies', 'chipmaking facilities', 'Tower Semiconductor', 'American companies', 'Semiconductor fabrication', 'largest constituent', 'liberal countries', 'chip manufacturers', 'chip production', 'difficult industries', 'capital expenditure', 'single player', 'actual testing', 'expensive machines', 'geographic pockets', 'foundry ecosystem', 'strong ecosystem', 'steady stream', 'Arizonian ecosystem', 'multiple locations', 'IC Insights', 'four decades', 'overall pie', 'South Korea', 'second place', 'European Union', 'third place', 'QUALCOMM Incorporated', 'advanced nations', '9.6 million people', 'high GDP', 'business ecosystem', 'little need', 'foreign capital', 'technology hub', 'Israeli chipmaker', 'The State', '9% market shares', 'Chinese market', 'Americas market', 'Market Cap', 'Planned Fabs', 'The Netherlands', 'European country', 'right equipment', 'brief look', 'research firm', 'special regions', 'piece', 'Chips', 'development', 'billions', 'dollars', 'silicon', 'wafers', 'edge', 'others', 'example', 'Arizona', 'INTC', 'universities', 'programs', 'needs', 'engineers', 'strength', 'NYSE', 'TSM', 'estimate', 'investment', 'units', 'coverage', 'stunning', 'CAGR', '21% share', 'Japan', 'half', 'Methodology', 'number', 'plants', 'construction', 'QCOM', 'Operational', 'population', 'mere', 'China', 'loans', 'economic', 'process', 'umbrella', 'Kingdom', 'Earth', '2021']",2022-12-08,2022-12-09,finance.yahoo.com

As of December 2022  all new cards issued are eco-designed and come with completely reimagined user kits that use considerably less paper. The new Ticket Restaurant card has also been conceived for easier use by workers with disabilities. These innovations join other features rolled out by Edenred recently such as QR code payment and complementary payments for amounts above available balances.Ticket Restaurant to become simpler and more inclusive for people with disabilitiesTo improve Ticket Restaurant accessibility for the visually impaired  Ticket Restaurant cards now include an “R” for “restaurant” in braille on their front side  making it easier for users to identify the card in their wallet or pocket. The innovative new feature has been tested and approved by visually impaired users  who contributed to its development. It is a first in France for payment cards. These new cards simplify daily life for hundreds of thousands of people. The edenred.fr website is also being adapted as part of a digital accessibility initiative for the visually impaired.In 2017  Edenred France launched a partnership with Elioz Connect to make its Client Relations Center accessible to the hearing impaired. Users can contact a client relationship representative by phone or via their computer screen and  depending on their preferred mode of communication  have an interpreter translate the reply into sign language or transcribe it in real time.Eco-design embedded in the production process for Ticket Restaurant and Kadéos solutionsEdenred’s new cards are now also eco-designed and made up of 85% recycled plastic. Ticket Restaurant cards in circulation will be renewed progressively as Edenred replaces expired cards with the new eco-designed versions. The eco-designed cards are 100% recyclable.Since 2016  Edenred France has also offered a free service whereby beneficiaries can send in their expired Ticket Restaurant cards for recycling – an unprecedented initiative in France.The market leader in France  Edenred also launched the first fully virtual  mobile-first Ticket Restaurant solution in 2021. The service can be used directly on a smartphone  delivering an optimal user experience while eliminating the production of plastic-based media.As of January 2023  Edenred will also use recycled plastic to produce Kadéos gift cards. In doing so  the Group has the clear goal of driving environmental responsibility throughout the employee benefits market by applying an eco-design approach to its entire range of solutions.Edenred France has also redesigned the user kits that are sent out with cards to explain how each solution works. All employees receive these kits when they become Edenred beneficiaries. The redesigned kits are now lighter  fully recyclable and printed with 98% vegetable-based inks. They will be rolled out as of January 2023 and use 60% less paper than previous versions  saving 15 metric tons of paper per year (France only).Ilan Ouanounou  General Manager of Edenred France  said: “The Ticket Restaurant and Kadéos innovations we have announced today reaffirm Edenred’s technology leadership while stepping up our commitment to a more inclusive  accessible and environmentally friendly world of work. Our solutions’ features are perfectly aligned with employee expectations  such as braille on all our cards  mobile payment and ordering via meal delivery platforms.

The group's shareholders voted 99.99% in favour of the sale of the Engineering & Protection Systems division's activities  for an equity value of €27.4 million  to Pelican Venture  a company owned by the Gorgé family1.

TuneCore is wholly owned by Believe  one of the world’s leading digital music companies.While the $3 billion figure represents a cumulative total of earnings from all TuneCore music creators - including artists ranging from hobbyists and nascent music creators to working professionals and even accomplished artists - the potential for success through an independent distributor has never been greater  with over 8 000 TuneCore artists earning over $10 000  thousands of artists earning between $50 000 and $100 000 and many taking home over $1 000 000. The huge payout to artists is aided by TuneCore’s direct deals with all digital service providers  which is a true differentiator in the market. The company also offers additional revenue streams for its artists via its Social Platforms and YouTube Content ID programs  with TuneCore’s music publishing division having paid artists close to $90 000 000 (since the launch of TuneCore Music Publishing Administration in 2011). By offering a wide array of resources to aid music creators at all stages of their careers  TuneCore has created a platform where artists receive not just world-class distribution services  but a support structure for long-term career growth.Self-releasing artists represent the fastest growing segment of the global music market  with all self-releasing artists growing from 1.7% of overall market share in 2015 to 5.3% in 2021 (source: MIDiA Research).Denis Ladegaillerie  Chief Executive Officer  Believe commented  “TuneCore is essential to Believe’s overarching mission  as well as key to the Group’s ecosystem  which is designed to support a wide range of artists at all stages of their careers  and across all demographics. The achievement of reaching $3 billion earned by self-releasing artists speaks volumes to the importance of supporting all creators equally . Which is why the whole artistic community must be nurtured without differentiation to allow the emergence of a new class of self-releasing artists that will be able to sustain themselves by making a living from their art. Not all artists aim at becoming superstars  but all top artists need a launchpad to blossom.”At last count  over 400 TuneCore artists have been upstreamed to Believe’s premium services levels  Label and Artist Solutions (LAS) as well as Artist Services (AS). By strengthening the connections between Believe and TuneCore  the Group has built an offering that fits artists’ needs at all stages of their development  and has created an environment where music creators have the freedom to experiment with all music genres - from traditional to progressive styles. Italy’s La Sad is a brilliant example of this  with three solo acts from different backgrounds and genres  coming together to introduce a new sound for that market through TuneCore  and eventually upstreaming to Believe.Andreea Gleeson  Chief Executive Officer  TuneCore added  “We’re proud to offer innovative technology-based services at affordable price points to all music creators  whether you’re a beginner or a top artist. Ed Sheeran  Lizzo  and Chance the Rapper all started their careers on TuneCore - in fact  the next Ed Sheeran  the next Lizzo and the next Chance could all very well be on our roster right now. Our goal is to give all self-releasing artists the freedom to create  test  perfect – and earn money from – their music  without restrictions. When you foster a space where creativity flows  artists are able to push boundaries and that’s where innovation lives – artists collaborating to create new music  new sounds  and new genres.”TuneCore and many of its artists share a passionately independent spirit. Atlanta-born  Los Angeles-based R&B artist Tanerélle started her career in 2015 with the electro/dance-pop single “Siren” and has been gaining recognition ever since for her unique style of R&B that blends the hazy production of lo-fi hip-hop with lush soundscapes into an expressive  otherworldly style fitting of her Mama Saturn alter-ego. She has amassed more than 70 million streams on Spotify alone  has garnered media praise from major media outlets including MTV  Paper Magazine  Vibe & more  and her music has been featured on Spike Lee’s She’s Gotta Have It  Issa Rae’s Insecure & more  all without the support of the traditional label system. “Being an independent artist has allowed me to evolve as a creative  a woman and an activist ” says Tanerélle. “It has allowed me to feel limitless and in control of my own voice and my own destiny. It’s more than anyone could ask for of this craft.”Among the new generation of artists who choose to retain control of their career and build their own team as an independent TuneCore artist  is country music sensation Maggie Baugh. As a teenager  Nashville-based country artist Maggie Baugh initially signed to a record label before carving a path for herself as a self-releasing artist. In 2021  her singles “Drinking To The Broken Hearts” and “Think About Me ” released through TuneCore  amassed over one million streams each on Spotify alone  and Baugh found herself repeatedly turning down label offers as her music went viral on social media. She has garnered media praise from People Magazine  American Songwriter  Taste of Country & more  and “Think About Me” closed out the year as number one on Spotify’s Fresh Finds Country: Best of 2021 playlist. Baugh commented  ""As an independent artist  we work hours upon hours to achieve our goals and dreams. We eat  breathe and sleep our careers. Of course  no one should work harder than the artist  but there is something to be said about having a fantastic team and a group of people behind you. I continue to stay independent after success because I want to find the right group of people who genuinely have my best interest at heart  who are willing to work their tails off with me  and are excited about what I’ve got going on as an artist.”As TuneCore has continued to grow  so has the company’s international artist roster. As a result  artists around the world have opted to embrace careers as self-releasing artists. 34% of artists who generated more than $10 000 on Spotify live in countries outside the top ten music markets (source: Spotify) and TuneCore’s creators outside the US have grown to represent 60% of its new artists and labels. In Italy  renown rapper Vacca  known for his high-profile collaborations with artists like Styles P  previously released albums through EMI (2007’s Faccio quello che voglio)  UMG (2010’s Sporco  2011’s Pelleossa  2013's Pazienza)  and Sony Music (2015’s L’ultimo tango)  before ultimately turning away from the traditional label system and returning to his independent roots. Vacca commented  ""The best moments of my career were when substantial income began to come from my catalog. At that time I began to really understand the greatness of TuneCore and the opportunity it was giving us independent artists. Because of TuneCore  we're able to directly manage our projects  our art  and consequently also our life.”Earlier this year  to further democratize the music industry for self-releasing artists  TuneCore unveiled its new UNLIMITED pricing structure in 2022  giving artists the power to release an unlimited number of singles and albums for one flat annual rate and allowing them to create more music and experiment with different release strategies to advance their careers and feed their growing fanbases. In November 2021  TuneCore also launched Social Platforms   which allows artists to upload their music—for no upfront cost—directly into the music libraries of social media platforms like TikTok  YouTube Shorts  Facebook and Instagram stories and Reels  where they are able to gain exposure while simultaneously earning money from their music.By providing an open platform  accessible technology solution for self-releasing artists to widely distribute and earn money from their music  Believe and TuneCore have helped to create a more sustainable and healthy industry where no step is skipped and artists can have the right environment at all stages of their careers to meet their ambitions. Through the Group’s consistent efforts since its creation in 2005 to democratize the music business  by reducing industry gatekeeping and providing education and distribution resources for artists at every stage of their development  Believe and TuneCore continue to work towards creating a more equitable and diverse music ecosystem around the world.About Believe:Believe is one of the world’s leading digital music companies.

It is June 2025 ” she said. “I can only speak for my term here. Beyond my time here  what can happen? None of us can predict that.“We were extending equivalence  but only on the basis that we would move towards making sure we had oversight on clearing ” Ms McGuinness said. “So I think the market knows. It knows what we want it to do.”Read MoreYesterday  the Commission released a slew of amendments to existing laws that will force banks to move “a portion” of euro-denominated derivatives contracts to Europe.The move will affect interest rate derivatives denominated in euro and Polish zloty  and credit default swaps - contracts where investors bet on companies or countries going bust.What we’re doing is in the interests of the European UnionBut it’s not clear what percentage or number of the contracts will be cleared in Europe. That will be decided by the EU’s markets regulator after the rules are adopted.“I don’t have a figure and I think it’s better that we don’t have a figure ” Ms McGuinness said. “We have an objective and we have a reason why we’re doing it  which is around strengthening our own infrastructure and around our own financial stability.”Changes to the bloc’s clearing and listing regimes are a further step in building what it calls a capital markets union.Ms McGuinness said it’s not a bid to steal British business.“I’ve never framed what we are doing as taking from. I’ve always said the objective is to strengthen the EU’s financial infrastructure. I think we’ve moved on from earlier days of ‘what’s mine is mine’.“When we look at our relationship with the United Kingdom  sanctions have unified a lot of countries  [and] brought together the UK and the European Union.“I would hope there is an understanding in London that what we’re doing is in the interests of the European Union  and we fully respect the right and capacity of the United Kingdom to do what it needs to do around its financial industry  in its interests.“I think there is a healthy respect for why we are doing this.”​Expand Close Stephane Boujnah is chief executive officer of Euronext.

The transaction involves a bond with a volume of EUR 20 million  a term of two years and a coupon of 2.381%. Deutsche Bank acted as lead manager for this transaction  and Hengeler Mueller as legal advisor.“Digitalisation is a central component of our KfWplus strategy adopted in April. It is therefore remarkable that KfW’s treasury and transaction management have implemented this pioneering electronic transaction via the D7 platform. As one of the world’s largest capital market issuers  innovation in the area of our refinancing is important to us in order to improve efficiency and reduce operating risks and transaction costs ” said Melanie Kehr  Member of the Executive Board of KfW Group.“This issue makes KfW a pioneer in its market segment and sends an important signal to market participants. The transaction ran smoothly and has paved the way for further issues from other issuers of fixed-income securities ” explained Tim Armbruster  Treasurer of KfW Group.In order to make even more effective use of the benefits of digitalisation  KfW is examining how further elements of the issuance process can be digitised. When using digital technologies  one of investors’ main concerns should always be taken into account: the liquidity of bonds.Jens Hachmeister  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  says: “With the digital post-trading platform D7  we are building a new infrastructure for future-ready markets worldwide. Like this  we offer our clients a significantly quicker and scalable solution for securities issuance. Following the successful launch of our structured products offering  we are now enhancing D7 to include the digital issuance of debt securities  such as commercial papers and straight bonds. We are thrilled that KfW is joining us on this journey. The outstanding market demand shows: the time to digitise financial markets is now.”The digital issuance of financial products via the D7 platform shortens the extensive and multi-day issuance process to just a few minutes. This saves time  manual effort and therefore processing costs. As a next step  Clearstream plans to enhance D7 with decentral capabilities and to offer it in further jurisdictions  e. g. Luxembourg  in line with the respective regulations and market interest. Like this  the central securities depository is creating a fully digital alternative to conventional securities issuance.Last year  the German legislator passed the Electronic Securities Act  which allows for the dematerialisation of a bond’s global note. The legislation gives bearer bond issuers the option to choose between conventional paper-based and electronic issuance. For the latter  an entry in an electronic securities register replaces the creation of a physical global note by the issuer. With the D7 platform  Clearstream now offers the market the technical infrastructure for the issuance of electronic fixed-income products in line with the Electronic Securities Act.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.86,0.13,0.01,True,English,"['digital fixed-income bond', 'Clearstream D7', 'KfW', 'largest capital market segment', 'largest capital market issuers', 'digital post-trading platform D', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'German Electronic Securities Act', 'D7 digital post-trade platform', 'post-trade service provider', 'electronic securities register', 'central register security', 'structured products offering', 'outstanding market demand', 'central securities depository', 'electronic fixed-income products', 'bearer bond issuers', 'physical global note', 'pioneering electronic transaction', 'multi-day issuance process', 'New Digital Markets', 'digital fixed-income bond', 'conventional securities issuance', 'fixed-income securities', 'electronic issuance', 'Deutsche Bank', 'other issuers', 'German legislator', 'digital issuance', 'D7 platform', 'digital technologies', 'digital alternative', 'debt securities', 'central component', 'financial products', 'market participants', 'market interest', 'new infrastructure', 'conventional paper-based', 'future-ready markets', 'financial markets', 'looking step', 'fixed income', 'two years', 'lead manager', 'Hengeler Mueller', 'legal advisor', 'KfWplus strategy', 'operating risks', 'Melanie Kehr', 'Executive Board', 'important signal', 'Tim Armbruster', 'effective use', 'main concerns', 'Jens Hachmeister', 'scalable solution', 'successful launch', 'commercial papers', 'manual effort', 'next step', 'decentral capabilities', 'respective regulations', 'technical infrastructure', 'KfW Group', 'first issuer', 'transaction management', 'Issuer Services', 'straight bonds', 'transaction costs', 'Source', 'Clearstream', 'forward', 'digitalisation', 'volume', 'term', 'coupon', 'April', 'treasury', 'world', 'innovation', 'area', 'refinancing', 'order', 'efficiency', 'Member', 'way', 'issues', 'Treasurer', 'benefits', 'elements', 'account', 'liquidity', 'Head', 'clients', 'quicker', 'journey', 'time', 'extensive', 'minutes', 'jurisdictions', 'Luxembourg', 'line', 'dematerialisation', 'legislation', 'option', 'latter', 'entry', 'creation', '2.']",2022-12-08,2022-12-09,finextra.com

The Xtrackers Emerging Markets Net Zero Pathway Paris Aligned Ucits ETF had been listed on Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange ,Latest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison toolsDWS has expanded its range of exchange traded funds aligned with the Paris climate agreement with the launch of an emerging market equities strategy.The Xtrackers Emerging Markets Net Zero Pathway Paris Aligned Ucits ETF had been listed on Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange  with other exchanges to follow  the Frankfurt-listed asset manager said.The ETF tracks the Solactive ISS ESG Emerging Markets Net Zero Pathway Index  which aims to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in carbon intensity compared with an equivalent non-environmental  social and governance market index  as well as a continuous reduction in carbon intensity of 7 per cent per year.DWS said the index  provided by Germany-based Solactive  met the EU’s Paris Aligned Benchmark regulations.This article was previously published by Ignites Europe  a title owned by the FT Group.The product bolsters the Deutsche Bank-owned asset manager’s existing line-up of PAB-compliant ETFs  which provide global  US  European  eurozone and Japan exposure.According to Simon Klein  global head of passive sales at DWS  the fund group offers “a full range of products aligned with the Paris climate agreement — giving investors suitable solutions for both developed and emerging markets”.All six of the ETFs in the asset manager’s Net Zero Pathway series also take into account recommendations of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change  meaning the indices do not weight the included index members solely on the basis of their carbon intensity  in accordance with IIGCC recommendations.According to DWS  weighting of companies in the indices is partly based on the extent to which they adopt science-based targets. Also relevant for the index weighting are the standards for climate reporting as defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and efforts to mitigate climate change.*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

The event attracted over 100 international participants from the scientific  academic  and industrial worlds to exchange on the advances in the field of biological recycling  and how to bring these innovations for a circular economy to market.The two-day conference gathered world-renowned scientists from various academic institutions to share their latest research on PET enzymatic depolymerization. Bertrand Piccard  Initiator and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation1  joined as the Keynote Speaker for the last session focused on PET circularity  and praised Carbios’ contribution to reducing plastic pollution. The Summit concludes with a visit of Carbios’ demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand today. The demonstration plant was inaugurated in September 2021 and brings Carbios’ technology one step closer to industrialization. Following the demonstration plant’s success  Carbios is on track to build and operate the world’s first industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling plant (with a processing capacity of 50.000 tons of PET waste per year) in France (Longlaville) by 20252  and to start licensing its technology throughout the world.Click here for the full program and list of speakers and follow #biorecyclingsummit #carbiosPETsummit on Carbios’ social channels.Scientific researchers from 10 countries  including North America  UK  Japan and GermanyBertrand Piccard  Solar Impulse Foundation  as Keynote SpeakerSpeakers from strategic partnerships: L’Oréal  Salomon  and McKinseyBertrand Piccard  Serial explorer  psychiatrist and clean technology pioneer  Initiator and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation: “Reducing plastic waste is one of the major challenges of our times. Carbios’ technology for the biological recycling of plastics was one of the first innovations labeled “Efficient Solution” by the Solar Impulse Foundation back in 20193. Carbios has my continued support and I commend today’s initiative to gather key stakeholders in the fight to protect the environment.”Alain Marty  Chief Scientific Officer of Carbios: “At Carbios  our teams have developed a unique enzymatic process that makes it possible to biologically recycle the second most widely used plastic in the world: PET. Unlike mainstream recycling methods  our innovative process makes it possible to recycle all types of waste  even polyester textiles  to be reused in the production of new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This first PET Biorecycling Summit allowed us to explore the scientific advances in the field of enzymatic recycling and to challenge ourselves to go further  faster  with the support of an international network of experts.”Emmanuel Ladent  Chief Executive Officer of Carbios: “The success of our industrialization model is based on our ability to forge strategic partnerships. Since Carbios’ inception  we have built partnerships in research  business  and finance  as well as consortiums with major brand owners in both the packaging and textile industries. I am honored that so many delegates were present for the first PET Biorecycling Summit  as I am convinced that we can reach a truly circular economy with biological recycling only if academics and industry work hand in hand.”About CarbiosEstablished in 2011 by Truffle Capital  Carbios is a green chemistry company  developing biological and innovative processes. Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L’Oréal co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/en / Twitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the English version shall prevail1 To address sustainability challenges while enabling economic growth  Bertrand Piccard and the Solar Impulse Foundation have identified 1000+ clean and profitable solutions.

The New Deferred Shares will not carry any dividend or voting rights  and holders of New Deferred Shares will only be entitled to a payment on a return of capital on a winding up of the Company after each holder of New Ordinary Shares has received a payment of £1 000 000 in respect of each such share. The New Deferred Shares therefore have effectively no value.The effective time of the Reorganisation is 7am (UK time) on 13 December 2022. Application has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on Euronext  and it is expected that admission will become effective at 7 a.m. on 13 December 2022. There will be 435 935 792 New Ordinary Shares in issue following completion of the Reorganisation. Each holder of New Ordinary Shares holds the same number of ordinary shares as was the case immediately prior to the Reorganisation. Therefore  each shareholder's percentage interest in the Company's issued ordinary share capital is unchanged. The New Ordinary Shares have the same rights and restrictions as those currently attached to the Existing Ordinary Shares under the existing articles of association. No new share certificates have been issued as part of the Reorganisation  and the validity of existing share certificates is unaffected.The New Deferred Shares will not be traded on Euronext or any other market  and no share certificates will be issued in respect of the New Deferred Shares.About Rapid NutritionDedicated to the development and distribution of premium  science-based health and wellness brands across the globe  Rapid Nutrition shares a wealth of award-winning products with consumers who are passionate about innovations that are ""made by nature  refined by science.""

The ceremony was held in the presence of Low Yen Ling  Singapore's Minister of State for Trade and Industry  and Her Excellency  Minh-di Tang  Ambassador of France to Singapore.The fab extension will be dedicated to the production of 300mm SOI wafers  which are used to produce chips for smartphones  particularly in 5G communications  as well as vehicles and smart devices. Upon its completion in 2024  the extension will add 45 000 square meters of clean room and office space and enable Soitec to double its annual production capacity in Singapore to around two million 300mm SOI wafers.The extension has been designed to support Soitec's commitments to an energy-efficient use of resources and make the new facility a sustainable  state-of-the-art working environment. Soitec aims to double its workforce in Pasir Ris to more than 600 by 2026. In parallel to this extension  Soitec is also expanding its technology presence in Singapore with the operational start of its characterization Lab within Soitec's Singapore Technology Center.Soitec's addressable market for engineered wafers is expected to expand more than twofold by 2026  from around 3.5 million to over 7 million wafers  fueled by increasing 5G adoption  vehicle electrification and automation as well as burgeoning demand for connected  intelligent devices.The extension of Pasir Ris in Singapore complements Soitec's investments in France and is part of its strategy to meet the increasing demand by ramping up its global annual production capacity to around 4.5 million wafers by fiscal year 2026. This includes a wide range of specialized energy-efficient wafers  using different materials (Silicon-on-Insulator  Gallium Nitride  Piezoelectric-on-Insulator and Silicon Carbide) and to serve different markets.

Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).""We are excited to announce positive pivotal Phase 3 outcomes in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa which support our strong belief in bimekizumab and provide the first Phase 3 evidence suggesting that targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A may be a promising treatment approach. We look forward to bringing bimekizumab to people living with this chronic inflammatory disease as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.Across the two studies  bimekizumab met the primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and consistent clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in the proportion of patients who achieved the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR50) at week 16.1 2 Bimekizumab demonstrated depth of response with statistically significant improvements at week 16 over placebo in the percentage of patients achieving HiSCR75  a key secondary endpoint in both studies.1 2 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.3 4 The safety profile of bimekizumab in both studies was consistent with previously reported studies with no new observed safety signals.1 2Story continues""Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic  painful and debilitating inflammatory skin disease that impacts patients' physical  psychological  and social well-being. This reduced quality of life is compounded by the limited treatment options currently available "" said Professor Gregor Jemec  MD  Ph.D.  Chairman  Department of Dermatology Zeeland University  Roskilde  Denmark. ""The positive top-line clinical outcomes from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are promising and demonstrate the value that bimekizumab can potentially bring to the hidradenitis suppurativa community.""Detailed results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD IBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 BE HEARD I enrolled 505 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD I on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE HEARD IIBE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 BE HEARD II enrolled 509 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD II on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.5 6 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.5 6 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.5 6HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries and is three times more common in women than in men.5 6 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.8 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.5 7About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.10 11 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

The technology designed by Dronétix is very complementary for Donecle. Their pooling also makes it possible to pool artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. On the commercial front  the operation opens a new line of development aimed at the inspection of aeronautical equipment.For its part  Donecle has become in a few years the leader in the automated inspection of the surface of aircraft fuselages and wings  thanks to a solution that combines drones for image acquisition and then an image analysis algorithm. This solution makes it possible to detect and measure automatically and in a very short time all the damage suffered during flights  in particular due to lightning strikes (sinking  degradation of paints and markings  etc.). Among its customers  Donecle has many leading references: Air France - KLM  Latam  Austrian Airlines  AAR  the Regional Jet Center and LOTAMS regional maintenance centers  the Armée de l'A ir et de l'Espace  the French Navy  etc.Matthieu Claybrough  President of Donecle welcomes the transaction: ""The acquisition of Dronétix is strategic for us  as it complements our technological know-howand opens up a new segment of the aeronautical inspection market.

The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in hidradenitis suppurativa have not been established  and it is not approved for use in hidradenitis suppurativa by any regulatory authority worldwide.""We are excited to announce positive pivotal Phase 3 outcomes in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa which support our strong belief in bimekizumab and provide the first Phase 3 evidence suggesting that targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A may be a promising treatment approach. We look forward to bringing bimekizumab to people living with this chronic inflammatory disease as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.Across the two studies  bimekizumab met the primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and consistent clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in the proportion of patients who achieved the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR50) at week 16.1 2 Bimekizumab demonstrated depth of response with statistically significant improvements at week 16 over placebo in the percentage of patients achieving HiSCR75  a key secondary endpoint in both studies.1 2 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.3 4 The safety profile of bimekizumab in both studies was consistent with previously reported studies with no new observed safety signals.1 2""Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic  painful and debilitating inflammatory skin disease that impacts patients' physical  psychological  and social well-being. This reduced quality of life is compounded by the limited treatment options currently available "" said Professor Gregor Jemec  MD  Ph.D.  Chairman  Department of Dermatology Zeeland University  Roskilde  Denmark. ""The positive top-line clinical outcomes from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are promising and demonstrate the value that bimekizumab can potentially bring to the hidradenitis suppurativa community.""Detailed results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD IBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 BE HEARD I enrolled 505 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD I on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE HEARD IIBE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 BE HEARD II enrolled 509 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD II on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.5 6 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.5 6 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.5 6HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries and is three times more common in women than in men.5 6 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.8 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.5 7About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.10 11 The label information may differ in other countries.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).""We are excited to announce positive pivotal Phase 3 outcomes in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa which support our strong belief in bimekizumab and provide the first Phase 3 evidence suggesting that targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A may be a promising treatment approach. We look forward to bringing bimekizumab to people living with this chronic inflammatory disease as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.Across the two studies  bimekizumab met the primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and consistent clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in the proportion of patients who achieved the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR50) at week 16.1 2 Bimekizumab demonstrated depth of response with statistically significant improvements at week 16 over placebo in the percentage of patients achieving HiSCR75  a key secondary endpoint in both studies.1 2 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.3 4 The safety profile of bimekizumab in both studies was consistent with previously reported studies with no new observed safety signals.1 2""Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic  painful and debilitating inflammatory skin disease that impacts patients' physical  psychological  and social well-being. This reduced quality of life is compounded by the limited treatment options currently available "" said Professor Gregor Jemec  MD  Ph.D.  Chairman  Department of Dermatology Zeeland University  Roskilde  Denmark. ""The positive top-line clinical outcomes from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are promising and demonstrate the value that bimekizumab can potentially bring to the hidradenitis suppurativa community.""Detailed results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD IBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 BE HEARD I enrolled 505 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD I on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE HEARD IIBE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 BE HEARD II enrolled 509 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD II on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.5 6 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.5 6 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.5 6HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries and is three times more common in women than in men.5 6 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.8 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.5 7About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.10 11 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.

With the development of digital technology  almost infinite information fields can be associated with it. In the metaverse  our objective is to transform this 'intelligent' point into an 'intelligible' point by resorting to algorithms. All of this is part of the same value chain.""Below is the translation in English of the original article in French.Special thanks go to the monthly magazine Géomètre© as well as to Marielle Mayo.The Abode of Chaos  a metaverse in the makingLocated close to the French city of Lyon  The ""Abode of Chaos"" (Demeure du Chaos) and its open-air museum of contemporary art have been completely digitized in collaboration with a firm of land surveyors. The resulting data will serve as the basis for the creation of a metaverse in the form of an escape game...MARIELLE MAYOIn the hills just north of Lyon  nestled between the verdant Monts d'Or and the river Saône  the village of Saint-Romain-au-Mont-d'Or offers a haven of tranquility. Upon arrival  you may be forgiven for experiencing a certain surprise when you discover  at the bend of a road lined with bourgeois sandstone houses  the blackened enclosure walls of the Abode of Chaos  entirely tagged with inscriptions and portraits… street art style. Behind these walls  Thierry Ehrmann  an entrepreneur and an artist-sculptor has transformed the Domaine de la source  a 17th-century property  into an open-air museum of contemporary art where monumental sculptures  shipping containers  giant skulls  aircraft wrecks  and industrial machinery rub shoulders with hundreds of large-scale mural portraits  inscriptions and a plethora of esoteric formulas. Thanks to extensive work undertaken since 2020 by the multidisciplinary teams of land surveyors  TT Géomètres Experts  this post-apocalyptic artworks has now been completely digitized.""Remarkable contemporary architecture""Founder of Groupe Serveur  a company specializing in databases  and of its subsidiary Artprice  a global player in art market information  Thierry Ehrmann has always been a digital pioneer and has been interested in computer-generated imagery since its origins. So  despite the somewhat daunting challenge  creating a virtual duplicate of the Abode of Chaos seemed a perfectly logical step. In the end  the various lockdowns associated with the Covid-19 crisis provided a perfect opportunity for the museum to close its doors and initiate the work. It also coincided with an initiative to obtain the ""Remarkable Contemporary Architecture"" label  which  apart from establishing a formal architectural analysis of the Abode  sought to obtain official cultural recognition as a way of protecting his ""great work"" in a long-standing legal dispute with the local municipality that began in 2004.With this in mind  Ehrmann approached architect Nicolas Detry  a specialist in the ""patrimoine martyr""  because  with its scarified walls  its bricked-up windows  its floor gutted by a meteorite  the old estate has been transformed into a 'total work of art'  drowned ""in a permanent state of war""  with certain installations recalling the attacks of September 11  2001  and major planet-damaging events such as oil spills  all surrounded by portraits and inscriptions echoing global news. Indeed  each of Ehrmann's interventions  as well as those of his guest artists  posit new traces of our tormented era. A formal architectural analysis of the site was therefore an important step in elucidating the artist's approach  and a highly detailed architectural survey of the property was an essential part of this process. ""We decided to digitize the entire site – the 6 300 works of art  the sculptures  the volumes  the buildings  the plants  everything! – using European heritage conservation standards  with surface and volume meshing for the whole space"" says Thierry Ehrmann. Nicolas Detry put him in contact with Philippe Barthélemy  head of the TTGE group's 3D Lab.The first meeting in July 2020 established the basis for a technical documentary project with a scientific digital dimension  geo-referenced and endowed with sub-centimeter resolution. ""I have been familiar with the most advanced 3D imaging systems for twenty years. What we needed was a team of top-level land surveyors! Their role as experts in collecting spatial data is vital in recreating virtual spaces that faithfully represent real spaces  and that is what we wanted!"" enthuses Thierry Ehrmann. The objective was to capture the singularity of each work  but also to create graphic illustrations allowing a better comprehension of the whole site  notably by highlighting certain recurring artistic/architectural features such as additions of materials (poured concrete  inclusions of meteorites in the facades  etc.) and the removal of certain materials. ""In the real world  I used a cherry-picker to 'sculpt' the thousands of square meters of the site's facades with a hammer and chisel""  explains the visual artist.The submission date for the base project was fixed for November 2020  and a tight schedule was drawn up for the data acquisition – covering 7555 m2 out of the total 9000 m2 surface area – as well as the processing and the calibrated colorization of all the different artistic and architectural initiatives. Philippe Barthélemy worked with a team of around fifteen TTGE employees  each with their area of expertise. ""We developed a specific and flexible methodology in order to manage the complexity and volume of the data produced during the acquisition process"" he explains. The mission included the creation of a polygonal geo-referenced map  Lidar data acquisition  and a high-resolution photogrammetric survey of the whole site  as well as all the calculations and processing required for the creation of a resized geo-referenced 3D digital twin. Ground data was acquired using a Z+F 3D laser scanner (Zoller & Fröhlich) and a NavVis VLX mobile scanning system  with Lidar and photogrammetric surveys carried out using drones. ""The technical challenge was to work with heterogeneous acquisition data and merge the results to enhance the quality of the digital twin"" specifies the engineer.Beyond the purely technical challenge  this extraordinary project involved measuring artistic and architectural initiatives accurately and proposing modes of representation that serve as real tools for understanding and documenting the works. ""Land-surveying can be extremely useful in a wide variety of contexts as long as the teams adapt to the specific requirements of each site""  says Philippe Barthélémy. So  while Nicolas Detry and historian/archaeologist Raphaëlle Rivière produced their historical and archeological analysis of the site  the team from TTGE provided site and elevation plans  architectural surveys and orthophotographs  3D models  longitudinal and transverse sections  heat maps using color gradients to highlight the additions and removal of materials  using different methods of illustration to compose eleven graphic plates to identify and highlight the major works. In short  the potential uses of digital data are numerous: measuring and documenting the evolution of the site  planning new projects  simulations  etc.TTGE also produced 37 000 360° panoramic shots and 18 000 360° 4K and 8K videos  the time-stamped and localized files corresponding respectively to 940 GB and 1.2 TB of data. All in all  the results of their work provided a perfect base for Thierry Ehrmann's latest project: ""The idea is to make a metaverse (editor's note: a virtual meta-universe) of the Abode""  he explains. As a first step  he asked TTGE's innovation center to develop an interface for the general public  allowing immersive visits in virtual and augmented reality. ""In this virtual environment  the public will be able to discover new aspects of the Abode  for example  by climbing safely onto the platform above the east wing  going inside certain works  and accessing the Abode's private areas. Everyone will also be able to access the historical documentation as well as the videos""  summarizes Thierry Ehrmann.A dynamic digital twinA smart navigation system should be launched in the first half of 2023. ""We see the metaverse as a dynamic digital twin  the challenge being to bring it to life and allow exchanges between the creator and his audience""  emphasizes Philippe Barthelemy. The recommendation engine's algorithms will guide the ""experiencer"" in an intimate discovery of the artist's approach and the connections between the works based on the experiencer's sensitivity to the history and/or the aesthetics of the works  the techniques used and the geo-political or esoteric messages  and it will offer him/her a tailor-made route through the collections. This is the first stone of a larger metaverse  which will also offer an ""agora"" to host thematic events and integrate art market-related activities initiated by Artprice  and notably an NFT Marketplace (as NFT technology allows the exchange of digital works associated with a cyber register [blockchain] that is deemed to hold unfalsifiable titles of ownership).An intelligent point becomes intelligible…All of this might seem far removed from the job of a land surveyor... But  for Philippe Barthélémy  the advent of metaverses in the service of culture offers opportunities to a profession that will greatly benefit from the integration of new skills  particularly in AI  to position themselves in the market. ""The land surveyor has the expertise to certify a point in space. With the development of digital technology  almost infinite information fields can be associated with it. In the metaverse  our objective is to transform this 'intelligent' point into an 'intelligible' point by resorting to algorithms. All of this is part of the same value chain "" he concludes.KEY DATES & FIGURES:1999The Abode of Chaos becomes an open-air museum of contemporary art (Musée l'Organe) created in 1999.
