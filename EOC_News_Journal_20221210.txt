Carbios‚Äô technology for the biological recycling of plastics was one of the first innovations labeled ‚ÄúEfficient Solution‚Äù by the Solar Impulse Foundation back in 20193. Carbios has my continued support and I commend today‚Äôs initiative to gather key stakeholders in the fight to protect the environment.‚ÄùAlain Marty  Chief Scientific Officer of Carbios: ‚ÄúAt Carbios  our teams have developed a unique enzymatic process that makes it possible to biologically recycle the second most widely used plastic in the world: PET. Unlike mainstream recycling methods  our innovative process makes it possible to recycle all types of waste  even polyester textiles  to be reused in the production of new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This first PET Biorecycling Summit allowed us to explore the scientific advances in the field of enzymatic recycling and to challenge ourselves to go further  faster  with the support of an international network of experts.‚ÄùEmmanuel Ladent  Chief Executive Officer of Carbios: ‚ÄúThe success of our industrialization model is based on our ability to forge strategic partnerships. Since Carbios‚Äô inception  we have built partnerships in research  business  and finance  as well as consortiums with major brand owners in both the packaging and textile industries. I am honored that so many delegates were present for the first PET Biorecycling Summit  as I am convinced that we can reach a truly circular economy with biological recycling only if academics and industry work hand in hand.‚ÄùAbout CarbiosEstablished in 2011 by Truffle Capital  Carbios is a green chemistry company  developing biological and innovative processes. Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L‚ÄôOr√©al co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestl√© Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/en / Twitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the English version shall prevail1 To address sustainability challenges while enabling economic growth  Bertrand Piccard and the Solar Impulse Foundation have identified 1000+ clean and profitable solutions.

The New Deferred Shares will not carry any dividend or voting rights  and holders of New Deferred Shares will only be entitled to a payment on a return of capital on a winding up of the Company after each holder of New Ordinary Shares has received a payment of ¬£1 000 000 in respect of each such share. The New Deferred Shares therefore have effectively no value.The effective time of the Reorganisation is 7am (UK time) on 13 December 2022. Application has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on Euronext  and it is expected that admission will become effective at 7 a.m. on 13 December 2022. There will be 435 935 792 New Ordinary Shares in issue following completion of the Reorganisation. Each holder of New Ordinary Shares holds the same number of ordinary shares as was the case immediately prior to the Reorganisation. Therefore  each shareholder's percentage interest in the Company's issued ordinary share capital is unchanged. The New Ordinary Shares have the same rights and restrictions as those currently attached to the Existing Ordinary Shares under the existing articles of association. No new share certificates have been issued as part of the Reorganisation  and the validity of existing share certificates is unaffected.The New Deferred Shares will not be traded on Euronext or any other market  and no share certificates will be issued in respect of the New Deferred Shares.About Rapid NutritionDedicated to the development and distribution of premium  science-based health and wellness brands across the globe  Rapid Nutrition shares a wealth of award-winning products with consumers who are passionate about innovations that are ""made by nature  refined by science.""

The ceremony was held in the presence of Low Yen Ling  Singapore's Minister of State for Trade and Industry  and Her Excellency  Minh-di Tang  Ambassador of France to Singapore.The fab extension will be dedicated to the production of 300mm SOI wafers  which are used to produce chips for smartphones  particularly in 5G communications  as well as vehicles and smart devices. Upon its completion in 2024  the extension will add 45 000 square meters of clean room and office space and enable Soitec to double its annual production capacity in Singapore to around two million 300mm SOI wafers.The extension has been designed to support Soitec's commitments to an energy-efficient use of resources and make the new facility a sustainable  state-of-the-art working environment. Soitec aims to double its workforce in Pasir Ris to more than 600 by 2026.

This includes a wide range of specialized energy-efficient wafers  using different materials (Silicon-on-Insulator  Gallium Nitride  Piezoelectric-on-Insulator and Silicon Carbide) and to serve different markets.

Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).""We are excited to announce positive pivotal Phase 3 outcomes in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa which support our strong belief in bimekizumab and provide the first Phase 3 evidence suggesting that targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A may be a promising treatment approach. We look forward to bringing bimekizumab to people living with this chronic inflammatory disease as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.Across the two studies  bimekizumab met the primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and consistent clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in the proportion of patients who achieved the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR50) at week 16.1 2 Bimekizumab demonstrated depth of response with statistically significant improvements at week 16 over placebo in the percentage of patients achieving HiSCR75  a key secondary endpoint in both studies.1 2 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.3 4 The safety profile of bimekizumab in both studies was consistent with previously reported studies with no new observed safety signals.1 2Story continues""Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic  painful and debilitating inflammatory skin disease that impacts patients' physical  psychological  and social well-being. This reduced quality of life is compounded by the limited treatment options currently available "" said Professor Gregor Jemec  MD  Ph.D.  Chairman  Department of Dermatology Zeeland University  Roskilde  Denmark. ""The positive top-line clinical outcomes from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are promising and demonstrate the value that bimekizumab can potentially bring to the hidradenitis suppurativa community.""Detailed results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD IBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 BE HEARD I enrolled 505 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD I on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE HEARD IIBE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 BE HEARD II enrolled 509 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD II on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.5 6 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.5 6 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.5 6HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries and is three times more common in women than in men.5 6 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.8 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.5 7About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.10 11 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

The technology designed by Dron√©tix is very complementary for Donecle. Their pooling also makes it possible to pool artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. On the commercial front  the operation opens a new line of development aimed at the inspection of aeronautical equipment.For its part  Donecle has become in a few years the leader in the automated inspection of the surface of aircraft fuselages and wings  thanks to a solution that combines drones for image acquisition and then an image analysis algorithm. This solution makes it possible to detect and measure automatically and in a very short time all the damage suffered during flights  in particular due to lightning strikes (sinking  degradation of paints and markings  etc.). Among its customers  Donecle has many leading references: Air France - KLM  Latam  Austrian Airlines  AAR  the Regional Jet Center and LOTAMS regional maintenance centers  the Arm√©e de l'A ir et de l'Espace  the French Navy  etc.Matthieu Claybrough  President of Donecle welcomes the transaction: ""The acquisition of Dron√©tix is strategic for us  as it complements our technological know-howand opens up a new segment of the aeronautical inspection market. Donecle now truly occupies a strong position in this fast-growingmarket. The presence of Delta Drone in our capital is an asset for us in this type of operation  thanks to the unfailing support provided over several years.""ABOUT DELTA DRONE: Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in hidradenitis suppurativa have not been established  and it is not approved for use in hidradenitis suppurativa by any regulatory authority worldwide.""We are excited to announce positive pivotal Phase 3 outcomes in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa which support our strong belief in bimekizumab and provide the first Phase 3 evidence suggesting that targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A may be a promising treatment approach. We look forward to bringing bimekizumab to people living with this chronic inflammatory disease as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.Across the two studies  bimekizumab met the primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and consistent clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in the proportion of patients who achieved the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR50) at week 16.1 2 Bimekizumab demonstrated depth of response with statistically significant improvements at week 16 over placebo in the percentage of patients achieving HiSCR75  a key secondary endpoint in both studies.1 2 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.3 4 The safety profile of bimekizumab in both studies was consistent with previously reported studies with no new observed safety signals.1 2""Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic  painful and debilitating inflammatory skin disease that impacts patients' physical  psychological  and social well-being. This reduced quality of life is compounded by the limited treatment options currently available "" said Professor Gregor Jemec  MD  Ph.D.  Chairman  Department of Dermatology Zeeland University  Roskilde  Denmark. ""The positive top-line clinical outcomes from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are promising and demonstrate the value that bimekizumab can potentially bring to the hidradenitis suppurativa community.""Detailed results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD IBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 BE HEARD I enrolled 505 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD I on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE HEARD IIBE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 BE HEARD II enrolled 509 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD II on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.5 6 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.5 6 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.5 6HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries and is three times more common in women than in men.5 6 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.8 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.5 7About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.10 11 The label information may differ in other countries.

Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be administered in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB and patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product-information_en.pdfEU summary of product characteristics date of revision December 2022Last accessed: December 2022.‚ñº This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.References",neutral,0.19,0.79,0.01,mixed,0.26,0.12,0.62,True,English,"['Positive Phase 3 Studies', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'UCB', 'Bimekizumab', 'randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group', 'humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody', 'global regulatory license applications', 'positive pivotal Phase 3 outcomes', 'positive top-line clinical outcomes', 'debilitating inflammatory skin disease', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response', 'global biopharmaceutical company', 'first Phase 3 evidence', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'positive top-line results', 'promising treatment approach', 'Executive Vice President', 'limited treatment options', 'Professor Gregor Jemec', 'upcoming scientific meeting', 'peer-reviewed medical journal', 'clinically meaningful improvements', 'key secondary endpoint', 'two key cytokines', 'hidradenitis suppurativa community', 'multicenter, Phase 3 study', 'severe hidradenitis suppurativa', 'BE HEARD II', 'sexual life impairment', 'two Phase 3 studies', 'HS experience flare-ups', 'positive results', 'clinical course', 'regulatory authority', 'primary endpoint', 'chronic, painful', 'severe pain', 'Detailed results', 'two studies', '9th December', 'moderate to', 'strong belief', 'Emmanuel Caeymaex', 'Immunology Solutions', 'U.S.', 'significant improvements', '75 percent reduction', 'nodule count', 'tunnel count', 'social well-being', 'Ph.D.', 'Zeeland University', 'additional details', 'clinicaltrials.gov', 'pus-discharging fistulas', 'major impact', 'early adulthood', 'one percent', 'one third', 'family history', 'lifestyle factors', 'crucial role', 'physical burden', 'negative attitudes', 'social isolation', 'low self-esteem', 'interpersonal relationships', 'interleukin 17A', 'interleukin 17F', 'Regulated information', 'total abscess', 'reduced quality', 'safety profile', 'safety signals', 'main symptoms', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'Inside', 'UCB', 'efficacy', 'bimekizumab', 'adults', 'basis', 'Q3', 'use', 'IL-17F', 'IL-17A', 'people', 'Head', 'proportion', 'patients', 'HiSCR50', 'week', 'depth', 'percentage', 'HiSCR75', 'baseline', 'increase', 'new', 'MD', 'Chairman', 'Department', 'Dermatology', 'Roskilde', 'Denmark', 'value', 'Notes', 'editors', '505 participants', 'diagnosis', 'nodules', 'abscesses', 'channels', 'armpits', 'groin', 'buttocks', 'population', 'countries', 'women', 'smoking', 'obesity', 'discharge', 'scarring', 'stigma', 'reactions', 'society', 'feelings', 'embarrassment', 'areas', 'education', 'work', 'processes', 'August', '07']",2022-12-09,2022-12-10,marketscreener.com

""The positive top-line clinical outcomes from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are promising and demonstrate the value that bimekizumab can potentially bring to the hidradenitis suppurativa community.""Detailed results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD IBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 BE HEARD I enrolled 505 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD I on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE HEARD IIBE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 BE HEARD II enrolled 509 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD II on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.5 6 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.5 6 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.5 6HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries and is three times more common in women than in men.5 6 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.8 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.5 7About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.10 11 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.ReferencesBE HEARD I Phase 3 Study  UCB Data on file  December 2022 .

14559,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563015-brenntag-trading-at-strong-fcf-yield,Brenntag: Trading At A 10% FCF Yield And Pursuing M&A (OTCMKTS:BNTGF),Brenntag is a German-based distributor of chemical products. Read why this company could be looking at acquisition opportunities.,Kannan D/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionIn August 2021  I mentioned I was on the sidelines and would be happy to revisit Brenntag (OTCPK:BNTGF) (OTCPK:BNTGY) at a lower share price. We're now 15 months later and Brenntag‚Äôs share price has dropped from in excess of 86 EUR to just over 60 EUR per share. That‚Äôs a 30% drop and means the company has clearly underperformed the general markets as you can see below (the blue line is the DAX index  the purple line is the S&P performance since my previous article). And that‚Äôs why I think this could be a good time to revisit this Germany-based chemical products distributor.Yahoo FinanceBrenntag's primary listing is in Germany where it's trading with BNR as ticker symbol on the Deutsche Boerse. The average daily volume in Germany is approximately 420 000 shares and this is clearly superior to any other listing. As there are 154.5M shares outstanding  the current market cap of Brenntag is just over 9.3B EUR.The first nine months of the year are promisingIn this article I‚Äôll have a closer look at the financial performance of Brenntag  as well as how the recent M&A rumors may impact the company. For a better understanding of Brenntag‚Äôs business model I‚Äôd like to refer you to this very extensive 73 page corporate presentation which provides a very detailed overview of the company and all its aspects.In the third quarter of this year  Brenntag reported a total revenue of 5.1B EUR  and generated an operating profit of 1.1B EUR on that revenue. This means the company has been able to protect its margins as it was able to keep its gross margins relatively stable around the 22% mark.Brenntag Investor RelationsSome of the other operating expenses did increase at a faster pace though as for instance the personnel expenses are 15% higher than in the third quarter of last year but with an operating profit of 377M EUR  the operating margin of 7.4% is higher than the 6.6% in Q3 2021  but a bit lower than the 8.4-8.5% achieved in the first six months of the year.But with a total net income of 1.60 EUR per share in the third quarter  which brought the 9M 2022 EPS to 5.07 EUR per share  I think shareholders of Brenntag could (and should) be pretty satisfied.Brenntag did not provide a very detailed Q4 outlook but it did confirm it expects a full-year operating EBITDA of 1.75-1.85B EUR. The operating EBITDA in the first nine months of the year was 1.46B EUR which means the Q4 EBITDA will likely come in at around 300-400M EUR. This confirms the company‚Äôs comment the inflationary headwinds will persist in the near future.Brenntag Investor RelationsThe implied Q4 EBITDA guidance now also allows us to calculate the anticipated full-year free cash flow. We know the company reported an operating cash flow of 554M EUR in the first nine months of this year  but this includes a 648M EUR investment in the working capital position and excludes 99M EUR in lease payments and almost 3M EUR in payments to non-controlling shareholders. On an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was exactly 1B EUR in the first nine months of the year.Brenntag Investor RelationsThe total capex was 149M EUR  resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of approximately 850M EUR in the first nine months of the year. That‚Äôs a strong result  but keep in mind the final quarter of the year will be capex-heavy as Brenntag has been guiding for a full-year capex of 270M EUR  indicating the Q4 capex will be around 120M EUR.Let‚Äôs now assume the Q4 EBITDA will be 350M EUR. We know the depreciation expenses will be around 95M EUR and the interest expenses will be around 25M EUR. This should result in a pre-tax income of 230M EUR and a net income of 169M EUR based on an average tax rate of 26.5%.We also know the 120M EUR capex + 25M EUR in lease expenses are about 50M EUR higher than the combined depreciation and amortization expenses. This means the Q4 free cash flow result will be approximately 50MM EUR lower than the reported net income  and 110-120M EUR would be a solid and reliable Q4 free cash flow result. This would bring the full-year free cash flow result to 950M EUR  for just over 6 EUR per share. And that makes the current share price of just over 60 EUR rather attractive.Brenntag is pursuing M&AThe chemical distribution sector is still pretty fragmented and it's ripe for more M&A. At the end of November  Brenntag confirmed it was talking to Univar Solutions (NYSE:UNVR)  a US-based competitor to discuss an acquisition of the latter. No further details have been provided yet  but a Credit Suisse (CS) analyst mentioned a $40/share acquisition would be reasonable. I tend to agree.Univar generated a free cash flow result of in excess of $550M in the first nine months of the year  and the valuation of approximately 9 times EBITDA based on the aforementioned $40/share would represent an enterprise value of just under $9B. That‚Äôs not cheap  but there surely will be synergy benefits that could be unlocked if two major players would merge.Brenntag also would be able to pursue this M&A deal with an all-cash bid. At $40/share  it would have to fork over $6.5B in cash and assume about $2.2B in net debt. This would increase its own net debt position from about $2B to $10.7B or approximately 10.2-10.3B EUR. Assuming the combined entities will hoard cash in 2023 and will be able to reduce their net debt by 1.2B EUR on a combined basis  the YE 2023 net debt would be ‚Äòjust‚Äô 9.5B EUR. That‚Äôs very high in absolute numbers  but we also know the combined EBITDA (excluding synergy benefits) would exceed 2.5B EUR. The debt ratio would thus come in below 4 times EBITDA by the end of next year and further drop to less than 3 by the end of 2024 if/when the synergy benefits kick in. This is just a theoretical calculation  but the numbers indicate it should be doable.While it‚Äôs still early days and there is no guarantee an offer will materialize  I think the combination of both companies would make sense from business perspective and a financial perspective.Investment thesisBrenntag‚Äôs current market cap of 9.3B EUR and enterprise value of 11.2B EUR (excluding lease debt) makes the company pretty attractively valued at just 6.5 times this year‚Äôs EBITDA (excluding lease amortizations). I would not oppose a transaction with Univar  even if that would happen at $40/share as I think the combined entity would be pretty strong.I currently have no position in Brenntag  but I‚Äôm getting increasingly interested now the share price has dropped by about 30% since my previous article.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.69,0.15,0.16,True,English,"['10% FCF Yield', 'M&A', 'Brenntag', 'OTCMKTS', 'BNTGF', 'reliable Q4 free cash flow result', 'full-year free cash flow result', 'extensive 73 page corporate presentation', 'Germany-based chemical products distributor', 'recent M&A rumors', 'operating cash flow', 'chemical distribution sector', 'average daily volume', 'current market cap', 'first nine months', 'first six months', 'working capital position', 'average tax rate', 'two major players', 'detailed Q4 outlook', 'Q4 EBITDA guidance', 'S&P performance', 'M&A deal', 'full-year operating EBITDA', '648M EUR investment', 'Yahoo Finance Brenntag', 'Brenntag Investor Relations', 'lower share price', 'current share price', 'other operating expenses', '120M EUR capex', 'total net income', 'strong result', 'full-year capex', 'Q4 capex', 'M&A.', 'total capex', 'other listing', 'financial performance', 'detailed overview', 'operating profit', 'operating margin', '9 times EBITDA', 'pre-tax income', 'personnel expenses', 'interest expenses', 'lease expenses', 'amortization expenses', 'Kannan D', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:BNTGF', 'general markets', 'blue line', 'DAX index', 'purple line', 'good time', 'primary listing', 'ticker symbol', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'closer look', 'business model', 'third quarter', 'faster pace', '9M 2022 EPS', 'inflationary headwinds', 'near future', 'adjusted basis', 'final quarter', 'US-based competitor', 'Credit Suisse', 'enterprise value', 'synergy benefits', 'total revenue', '99M EUR', '3M EUR', 'depreciation expenses', 'previous article', '154.5M shares', 'gross margins', 'lease payments', 'controlling shareholders', 'Univar Solutions', '$40/share acquisition', 'last year', '86 EUR', '60 EUR', '5.07 EUR', '420,000 shares', 'Editorial', 'Introduction', 'August', 'sidelines', 'excess', '30% drop', 'company', 'BNR', 'understanding', 'aspects', '5.1B', '22% mark', 'instance', '377M', 'Q3', 'comment', '554M', '850M', 'mind', 'capex-heavy', '270M', '95M', '25M', '230M', '169M', 'solid', '950M', 'end', 'November', 'UNVR', 'latter', 'details', '1.75', '300']",2022-12-10,2022-12-10,seekingalpha.com

The data were presented during the 2022 ASH (American Society Hematology) Annual Meeting  in New Orleans (United States).At the time of data cut off (April 29  2022)  the Intention To Treat (ITT1) population included 37 post mogamulizumab patients with advanced  highly refractory S√©zary syndrome  and 35 patients were Evaluable for Efficacy (EES2). The patient population was heavily pre-treated with a median of 6 prior lines of therapy. The median follow-up was 10.9 months.In the ITT population  the global objective response rate (ORR) was 21.6% (8/37). ORR in the blood was 37.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 24.1-53.9)  with 21.6% (8/37) achieving complete response (CR). ORR in the skin was 35.1% (95% CI: 21.8-51.2). In the EES population  global objective response rate (ORR) was 22.9% (8/35). ORR in the blood was 40.0% (95% CI: 25.6-56.4) and ORR in the skin was 37.1% (95% CI: 23.2‚Äë53.7).Within the subgroup of patients that achieved a global response  median duration of global response was 10.8 months (95% CI: 6.2-12.3) with median time to global response of 4 months (range: 1.0-6.5); median time to blood response was 1.0 month (range: 1.0-6.5) and median time to skin response was 2.8 months (range: 0.9-10.2).Best Global Response N=37 (ITT) N=35 (EES) Best Response in Skin N=37 (ITT) N=35 (EES) Best Response in Blood N=37 (ITT) N=35 (EES) Best Response in Lymph Node N=28 (ITT) N=26 (EES) ORR % [95% CI] ITT 21.6% [11.4-37.2] 35.1% [21.8-51.2] 37.8% [24.1-53.9] 10.7% [3.7-27.2] EES 22.9% [12.1-39.0] 37.1% [23.2-53.7] 40.0% [25.6-56.4] 11.1% [3.9-28.1]In line with previous observations  lacutamab demonstrated a favorable safety profile for patients with advanced S√©zary syndrome in the TELLOMAK Phase 2 preliminary analysis. Grade ‚â• 3 Treatment-related (TR) Treatment-Emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 6/37 (16.2%) patients. Most common TR TEAEs were general disorders and administration site conditions (N=6  16.2%)  skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (N=5  13.5%)  and gastrointestinal disorders (N=3  8.1%).Dr. Joyson Karakunnel  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma  said: ‚ÄúThis encouraging preliminary analysis in S√©zary syndrome adds to the encouraging cutaneous T-cell lymphoma data we previously shared within the Phase 1 study  and Phase 2 mycosis fungoides cohort. The data continues to support our fast to market strategy for lacutamab in the niche setting of S√©zary syndrome where lacutamab was granted U.S. Fast Track designation and EU Prime designation. We look forward to final data in 2023 while we continue investigate the role of lacutamab in other T-cell lymphomas including the monotherapy and combination trials for peripheral T-cell lymphoma.‚ÄùDr. Pierluigi Porcu  Director  Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center  Jefferson Health  Philadelphia  added: ‚ÄúIt is encouraging to see lacutamab achieve clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety in this post-mogamulizumab  heavily pre-treated population. The responses observed in the blood and skin are encouraging in terms of ORR  but also the rapid time to response and duration of response. This advanced  highly refractory and heavily pre-treated disease  where patients typically have poor prognosis  and poor quality of life is an area of significant unmet need. The interim analysis adds to growing evidence supporting the development of lacutamab in T cell lymphomas. We thank the investigators  clinical research coordinators  patients and caregivers involved in the ongoing TELLOMAK program.‚ÄùOther presentations to be held at ASH 2022ANKET‚Ñ¢ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):During the ASH annual meeting  Pr.

Patients developing refractory acute Graft-versus-Host Disease with gastrointestinal involvement (GI-aGvHD) following hematopoietic cell transplantation demonstrated an overall response rate (GI-ORR) of 56% at day 28 following MaaT013 treatment. In patients responding to MaaT013 therapy  the overall survival (OS) rate at 12 months was 59% (compared to 14% for non-responders) indicating a significant clinical benefit with MaaT013.In aGvHD patients refractory to 1st-line (steroids) and 2nd-line (ruxolitinib) treatments (n=31) and receiving MaaT013 as a 3rd-line therapy  65% demonstrated a GI-ORR at day 28. The 12-month OS rate in the MaaT013-responding group was 74%. This patient population resembles the ongoing Phase 3 ARES clinical trial (NCT04769895) being conducted in Europe.‚ÄúThe clinical benefits we continue to observe with MaaT013 are promising and reinforce the potential for our MET to improve survival outcomes for aGvHD patients when early treatment lines are unsuccessful ‚Äù said Herv√© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. ‚ÄúThe year 2022 will be remembered as a turning point for the microbiome therapeutics industry as it continues to mature. We expect to see an acceleration in the field following the first FDA approval for a microbiome-based product in preventing C. difficile infection as well as promising clinical results in various infectious disease and oncology indications.‚ÄùProf. Mohamad Mohty added  ‚ÄúPatients with severe acute GvHD that have undergone several lines of treatments have a high mortality risk with no currently proven salvage treatment options. The results observed with MaaT013 are very encouraging especially in the 3rd-line setting where we see that the survival outcome is significantly improved. Since the patient population being treated with MaaT013 in the company‚Äôs Phase III ARES pivotal study in Europe is similar to those treated in the EAP  we are hopeful that the clinical trial results will corroborate these positive results and will provide an important benefit to all patients who are in need.‚ÄùKey clinical findings with MaaT013 in compassionate use in France (Early Access Program or ‚ÄòEAP‚Äô)In the EAP  81 patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant  Grade II-IV  gastrointestinal aGvHD were treated with MaaT013 from July 2018 to May 202245 out of 81 (56%) showed objective GI response at day 28 of which 30 patients (37%) had a complete response  11 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 4 patients (5%) showed a partial response.Overall survival (OS) in MaaT013-responding patients at the 12-month follow-up was 59%  compared to 14% in non-responders (OS in all included patients was 39% at 12 months).Considering GvHD response in all organs (GI  skin  liver)  38 out of 78 patients (49%) showed an objective response rate (ORR) at day 28  of which 24 patients (31%) had a complete response  11 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (4%) showed a partial response.At the time of treatment  all patients had either Grade II (11%)  Grade III (51%) or Grade IV (38%) aGvHD (MAGIC Classification).Patients received MaaT013 after 1 to 6 (median: 2; 66/81 received ruxolitinib) lines of treatment68 out of 81 patients (84%) were steroid resistant of which 33 out of 68 (49%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  21 patients (31%) had a complete response  9 patients (13%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (4%) showed a partial response.66 out of 81 patients (81%) were refractory to ruxolitinib (any treatment line)  of which  37 out of 66 (56%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; of these 25 patients (38%) had a complete response  9 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (5%) showed a partial response31 out of 66 patients were ruxolitinib-refractory in 2 nd -line and MaaT013 was administered as a 3 rd -line treatment; 20 out of 31 patients (65%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  19 patients (61%) had a complete response  and 1 patient (3%) had a very good partial response.-line and MaaT013 was administered as a 3 -line treatment; 20 out of 31 patients (65%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  19 patients (61%) had a complete response  and 1 patient (3%) had a very good partial response. 13 out of 81 patients (16%) were steroid-dependent of which 12 out of 13 patients (92%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  9 patients (69%) had a complete response  2 patients (15%) had a very good partial response  and 1 patient (8%) showed a partial response.Evaluation of MaaT013 in the Phase III pivotal clinical trial ARESMaaT Pharma announced the first patient enrolled in the Phase III  open label  single arm  ARES pivotal trial for MaaT013 in March 2022  with a safety and data review by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB)  after enrollment of half of the patients in the study  expected in the first half of 2023.As of today  MaaT013 has been safely administered to more than 160 patients in Europe in clinical trials and in the Expanded Access Program in France. Indeed  additionally to clinical trials  MaaT Pharma has been pursuing  since 2019  the compassionate use program in France  approved by the ANSM  to faster access to MaaT013 for patients with unmet medical need  mainly for indications in acute Graft-versus-Host disease. This program also allows the Company to strengthen its supply chain and production capacities to safely provide MaaT013  on a regular basis to 24 transplantation centers in France.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  enema Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM for acute  hospital use.

ADVANCE-SC is evaluating SC VYVGART for the treatment of primary ITP. Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the second half of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ‚ÄãA total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on 'watch and wait' at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ‚ÄãPatients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ‚ÄãThe primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ‚ÄãKey secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information. For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.Important Safety Information for VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. prescribing information)What is VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and ExpositionThe 64th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition is scheduled to take place December 10-13  2022 at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans  Louisiana. This in-person event will be broadcast virtually. The ASH 2022 Annual Meeting abstracts are available at: https://www.hematology.org/meetings/annual-meeting/abstracts .About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the second half of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ‚ÄãA total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on 'watch and wait' at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ‚ÄãPatients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ‚ÄãThe primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ‚ÄãKey secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.VYVGART may increase the risk of infection.

Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART.

Morial Convention Center in New Orleans  Louisiana. This in-person event will be broadcast virtually. The ASH 2022 Annual Meeting abstracts are available at: https://www.hematology.org/meetings/annual-meeting/abstracts .About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).

Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).""We are excited to announce positive pivotal Phase 3 outcomes in moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa which support our strong belief in bimekizumab and provide the first Phase 3 evidence suggesting that targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A may be a promising treatment approach. We look forward to bringing bimekizumab to people living with this chronic inflammatory disease as soon as possible "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.Across the two studies  bimekizumab met the primary endpoint  demonstrating statistically significant and consistent clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in the proportion of patients who achieved the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR50) at week 16.1 2 Bimekizumab demonstrated depth of response with statistically significant improvements at week 16 over placebo in the percentage of patients achieving HiSCR75  a key secondary endpoint in both studies.1 2 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.3 4 The safety profile of bimekizumab in both studies was consistent with previously reported studies with no new observed safety signals.1 2""Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic  painful and debilitating inflammatory skin disease that impacts patients' physical  psychological  and social well-being. This reduced quality of life is compounded by the limited treatment options currently available "" said Professor Gregor Jemec  MD  Ph.D.  Chairman  Department of Dermatology Zeeland University  Roskilde  Denmark. ""The positive top-line clinical outcomes from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are promising and demonstrate the value that bimekizumab can potentially bring to the hidradenitis suppurativa community.""Detailed results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD IBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 BE HEARD I enrolled 505 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.3 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD I on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE HEARD IIBE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 BE HEARD II enrolled 509 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE HEARD II on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.5 6 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.5 6 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.5 6HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries and is three times more common in women than in men.5 6 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.7The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.8 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.5 7About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.10 11 Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.  and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email [email protected]U.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

14568,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/world/uk-eases-bank-rules-to-win-back-finance-industry-jobs-and-clout-lost-in-the-wake-of-brexit-vote-42209216.html,UK eases bank rules to win back finance industry jobs and clout lost in the wake of Brexit vote,The UK government has announced plans to loosen rules for banks and other financial institutions in a bid to win back jobs and investment lost since the Brexit vote in 2016.,UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt launched a major reform of the UK's financial sector with plans to rip up red tape and replace reams of EU regulationsThe UK government has announced plans to loosen rules for banks and other financial institutions in a bid to win back jobs and investment lost since the Brexit vote in 2016.Ireland has been among the big winners in that process  with around 36 UK-regulated firms shifting at least part of their operations and 1 200 finance jobs here in the five years after the vote  according to research by financial services firm EY. That included large-scale moves by global banks Barclays and Citigroup as well as dozens of smaller firms moving as few as one or two people to Ireland.A total scrapping of banker pay caps and a higher bar to penalise senior executives and directors for misbehaviour on their watch are among the new UK measures. They are designed to appeal directly to decision makers whose responsibilities were toughened up and bonuses reduced across the European Union in the wake of the losses suffered during the global financial crisis.The moves are unlikely to boost the UK operations of Irish banks including AIB and Bank of Ireland but could weigh against Ireland as a location for future investment by global investment banks  according to Diarmaid Sheridan  a financial services analyst at Davy Stockbrokers.The proposed divergence from the European Solvency 2 regime would also make it easier for the likes of insurers  which manage trillions in assets  to put capital into climate friendly investments versus the EU where rules shoehorn funds into the lowest risk bond options  he noted.While UK regulators led the push for tighter financial regulation a decade ago  Britain now sees its position outside the EU as a chance to undercut that regime so as to claw back lost investment and reassert the City of London financial district as Europe‚Äôs pre-eminent finance hub.That status suffered a symbolic blow in November when the Paris‚Äôs Euronext Stock Exchange overtook London as Europe‚Äôs most valuable ‚Äì if only briefly. Amsterdam overtook London as Europe‚Äôs busiest share-trading hub last year.Britain‚Äôs finance minister Jeremy Hunt denied the decision to scrap post-crash rules would risk repeating factors leading to that crisis.‚ÄúIt is perfectly sensible to make pragmatic changes such as the ones that we‚Äôre announcing today ‚Äù he said at an event hosted by the Financial Times.‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre doing so very  very carefully to make sure that the UK is a competitive  exciting place to be and to invest  but also that we don‚Äôt lose the guard rails that we put in place after 2008.The package of more than 30 changes includes lifting a cap on bankers‚Äô bonuses and easing capital requirements for smaller lenders. The UK also said it will review regulations that hold bankers accountable for their decisions and will relax ringfencing rules intended to separate risky investment banking from retail operations ‚Äì rules created after high-risk lending and so-called ‚Äòcasino banking‚Äô was blamed for triggering a global financial crisis in 2008.It remains to be seen whether the promise of a looser regime is enough to counter the reduced access to the EU.,neutral,0.13,0.82,0.06,mixed,0.16,0.04,0.8,True,English,"['finance industry jobs', 'bank rules', 'Brexit vote', 'UK', 'clout', 'wake', 'lowest risk bond options', 'UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt', 'banker pay caps', 'climate friendly investments', 'eminent finance hub', 'Euronext Stock Exchange', 'busiest share-trading hub', 'other financial institutions', 'financial services firm', 'financial services analyst', 'tighter financial regulation', 'new UK measures', 'competitive, exciting place', 'global financial crisis', 'European Solvency 2 regime', 'risky investment banking', 'London financial district', 'global investment banks', 'financial sector', 'Financial Times', 'global banks', '1,200 finance jobs', 'European Union', 'casino banking', 'UK government', 'UK regulators', 'The UK', 'major reform', 'red tape', 'big winners', '36 UK-regulated firms', 'five years', 'smaller firms', 'two people', 'total scrapping', 'higher bar', 'senior executives', 'Irish banks', 'future investment', 'Diarmaid Sheridan', 'Davy Stockbrokers', 'symbolic blow', 'repeating factors', 'guard rails', 'smaller lenders', 'high-risk lending', 'looser regime', 'reduced access', 'UK operations', 'retail operations', 'Brexit vote', 'large-scale moves', 'decision makers', 'pragmatic changes', 'capital requirements', 'post-crash rules', 'ringfencing rules', 'bankers‚Äô bonuses', 'EU regulations', '30 changes', 'plans', 'reams', 'bid', 'Ireland', 'process', 'part', 'research', 'EY.', 'Barclays', 'Citigroup', 'dozens', 'directors', 'misbehaviour', 'watch', 'wake', 'losses', 'AIB', 'location', 'divergence', 'likes', 'insurers', 'trillions', 'assets', 'funds', 'push', 'Britain', 'position', 'chance', 'City', 'status', 'November', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'event', 'package', 'decisions', 'promise']",2022-12-10,2022-12-10,independent.ie

Patients developing refractory acute Graft-versus-Host Disease with gastrointestinal involvement (GI-aGvHD) following hematopoietic cell transplantation demonstrated an overall response rate (GI-ORR) of 56% at day 28 following MaaT013 treatment. In patients responding to MaaT013 therapy  the overall survival (OS) rate at 12 months was 59% (compared to 14% for non-responders) indicating a significant clinical benefit with MaaT013.In aGvHD patients refractory to 1st-line (steroids) and 2nd-line (ruxolitinib) treatments (n=31) and receiving MaaT013 as a 3rd-line therapy  65% demonstrated a GI-ORR at day 28. The 12-month OS rate in the MaaT013-responding group was 74%. This patient population resembles the ongoing Phase 3 ARES clinical trial (NCT04769895) being conducted in Europe.""The clinical benefits we continue to observe with MaaT013 are promising and reinforce the potential for our MET to improve survival outcomes for aGvHD patients when early treatment lines are unsuccessful "" said Herv√© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. ""The year 2022 will be remembered as a turning point for the microbiome therapeutics industry as it continues to mature. We expect to see an acceleration in the field following the first FDA approval for a microbiome-based product in preventing C. difficile infection as well as promising clinical results in various infectious disease and oncology indications.""Prof. Mohamad Mohty added  ""Patients with severe acute GvHD that have undergone several lines of treatments have a high mortality risk with no currently proven salvage treatment options. The results observed with MaaT013 are very encouraging especially in the 3rd-line setting where we see that the survival outcome is significantly improved. Since the patient population being treated with MaaT013 in the company's Phase III ARES pivotal study in Europe is similar to those treated in the EAP  we are hopeful that the clinical trial results will corroborate these positive results and will provide an important benefit to all patients who are in need.""Key clinical findings with MaaT013 in compassionate use in France (Early Access Program or ?EAP')In the EAP  81 patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant  Grade II-IV  gastrointestinal aGvHD were treated with MaaT013 from July 2018 to May 202245 out of 81 (56%) showed objective GI response at day 28 of which 30 patients (37%) had a complete response  11 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 4 patients (5%) showed a partial response.Overall survival (OS) in MaaT013-responding patients at the 12-month follow-up was 59%  compared to 14% in non-responders (OS in all included patients was 39% at 12 months).Considering GvHD response in all organs (GI  skin  liver)  38 out of 78 patients (49%) showed an objective response rate (ORR) at day 28  of which 24 patients (31%) had a complete response  11 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (4%) showed a partial response.At the time of treatment  all patients had either Grade II (11%)  Grade III (51%) or Grade IV (38%) aGvHD (MAGIC Classification).Patients received MaaT013 after 1 to 6 (median: 2; 66/81 received ruxolitinib) lines of treatment68 out of 81 patients (84%) were steroid resistant of which 33 out of 68 (49%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  21 patients (31%) had a complete response  9 patients (13%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (4%) showed a partial response.66 out of 81 patients (81%) were refractory to ruxolitinib (any treatment line)  of which  37 out of 66 (56%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; of these 25 patients (38%) had a complete response  9 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (5%) showed a partial response31 out of 66 patients were ruxolitinib-refractory in 2 nd -line and MaaT013 was administered as a 3 rd -line treatment; 20 out of 31 patients (65%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  19 patients (61%) had a complete response  and 1 patient (3%) had a very good partial response.-line and MaaT013 was administered as a 3 -line treatment; 20 out of 31 patients (65%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  19 patients (61%) had a complete response  and 1 patient (3%) had a very good partial response. 13 out of 81 patients (16%) were steroid-dependent of which 12 out of 13 patients (92%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  9 patients (69%) had a complete response  2 patients (15%) had a very good partial response  and 1 patient (8%) showed a partial response.Evaluation of MaaT013 in the Phase III pivotal clinical trial ARESMaaT Pharma announced the first patient enrolled in the Phase III  open label  single arm  ARES pivotal trial for MaaT013 in March 2022  with a safety and data review by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB)  after enrollment of half of the patients in the study  expected in the first half of 2023.As of today  MaaT013 has been safely administered to more than 160 patients in Europe in clinical trials and in the Expanded Access Program in France. Indeed  additionally to clinical trials  MaaT Pharma has been pursuing  since 2019  the compassionate use program in France  approved by the ANSM  to faster access to MaaT013 for patients with unmet medical need  mainly for indications in acute Graft-versus-Host disease. This program also allows the Company to strengthen its supply chain and production capacities to safely provide MaaT013  on a regular basis to 24 transplantation centers in France.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  enema Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM for acute  hospital use. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of ButycoreTM (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient's functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

By embedding innovation and sustainability into the Enel Group‚Äôs business practices  we are leading the energy transition towards a zero-emission model  protecting the environment while maximizing shared value for all our stakeholders.‚ÄùLaunched in 1999  today the DJSI is one of the main global indexes tracking the performance of companies leading the way on sustainability worldwide.DJSI recognized Enel‚Äôs proactive role in tackling climate change and promoting a zero-emission energy model. Enel also excelled in other criteria focused on assessing responsible business management practices such as risk and crisis management  innovation management  market opportunities  water-related risks  human rights and stakeholder engagement. Finally  the index continued to acknowledge Enel‚Äôs commitment to promoting transparency on social and environmental performance.Furthermore  Enel's role as a global leader in sustainability was also reconfirmed in the year-end review of two other globally recognized indices that select top sustainability performers: the FTSE4Good Index Series and the Euronext Vigeo-Eiris (V.E) indices. In the latter  Enel maintained its place in the World 120 index  as well as in the regional Euronext V.E Eurozone 120 and Europe 120 indices  listing the 120 most sustainable companies out of the 500 largest free-float companies in the Eurozone and Europe.FTSE4Good and V.E awarded Enel‚Äôs commitment to embedding ESG practices into the business strategy along its entire value chain. FTSE4Good highlighted Enel‚Äôs practices and transparency on a wide range of topics  including biodiversity  health and safety  human rights  corporate governance  risk management  and tax transparency. At the same time  V.E recognized Enel‚Äôs outstanding performance in the development of its environmental strategy  managing its human capital  and fostering sound governance practices.The confirmation in these three sustainability-linked index families adds up to the wide presence of Enel in the leading existing sustainability indices and rankings  such as the MSCI ESG Leaders Indices  CDP Climate ‚ÄúA‚Äù List  the STOXX Global ESG Leaders index  the ISS ‚ÄúPrime‚Äù rating  the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index  the Refinitiv TOP 100 Diversity and Inclusion Index  the Equileap's Top 100 Gender Equality Global Ranking and the ECPI indices.Enel is increasingly attracting the attention of Socially Responsible Investors  whose stake in the company is steadily growing  representing about 14.6% of the Group‚Äôs share capital in 2021  more than double compared to 2014 levels. This increase  which is in line with the growing recognition of the importance of non-financial elements in the creation of long-term sustainable value  reflects the bolstering of Enel‚Äôs global sustainability leadership.The Group‚Äôs long track record of inclusion in the world‚Äôs leading sustainability indices is also supported by its commitment to fostering innovative business models to find solutions for the biggest challenges that society is facing  such as climate change  by promoting electric mobility and expanding the infrastructure network required for its widespread deployment.
