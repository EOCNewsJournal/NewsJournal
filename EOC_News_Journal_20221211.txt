The data were presented during the 2022 ASH (American Society Hematology) Annual Meeting  in New Orleans (United States).At the time of data cut off (April 29  2022)  the Intention To Treat (ITT1) population included 37 post mogamulizumab patients with advanced  highly refractory S√©zary syndrome  and 35 patients were Evaluable for Efficacy (EES2). The patient population was heavily pre-treated with a median of 6 prior lines of therapy. The median follow-up was 10.9 months.In the ITT population  the global objective response rate (ORR) was 21.6% (8/37). ORR in the blood was 37.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 24.1-53.9)  with 21.6% (8/37) achieving complete response (CR). ORR in the skin was 35.1% (95% CI: 21.8-51.2). In the EES population  global objective response rate (ORR) was 22.9% (8/35). ORR in the blood was 40.0% (95% CI: 25.6-56.4) and ORR in the skin was 37.1% (95% CI: 23.2‚Äë53.7).Within the subgroup of patients that achieved a global response  median duration of global response was 10.8 months (95% CI: 6.2-12.3) with median time to global response of 4 months (range: 1.0-6.5); median time to blood response was 1.0 month (range: 1.0-6.5) and median time to skin response was 2.8 months (range: 0.9-10.2).Best Global Response N=37 (ITT) N=35 (EES) Best Response in Skin N=37 (ITT) N=35 (EES) Best Response in Blood N=37 (ITT) N=35 (EES) Best Response in Lymph Node N=28 (ITT) N=26 (EES) ORR % [95% CI] ITT 21.6% [11.4-37.2] 35.1% [21.8-51.2] 37.8% [24.1-53.9] 10.7% [3.7-27.2] EES 22.9% [12.1-39.0] 37.1% [23.2-53.7] 40.0% [25.6-56.4] 11.1% [3.9-28.1]In line with previous observations  lacutamab demonstrated a favorable safety profile for patients with advanced S√©zary syndrome in the TELLOMAK Phase 2 preliminary analysis. Grade ‚â• 3 Treatment-related (TR) Treatment-Emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 6/37 (16.2%) patients. Most common TR TEAEs were general disorders and administration site conditions (N=6  16.2%)  skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (N=5  13.5%)  and gastrointestinal disorders (N=3  8.1%).Dr. Joyson Karakunnel  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma  said: ‚ÄúThis encouraging preliminary analysis in S√©zary syndrome adds to the encouraging cutaneous T-cell lymphoma data we previously shared within the Phase 1 study  and Phase 2 mycosis fungoides cohort. The data continues to support our fast to market strategy for lacutamab in the niche setting of S√©zary syndrome where lacutamab was granted U.S. Fast Track designation and EU Prime designation. We look forward to final data in 2023 while we continue investigate the role of lacutamab in other T-cell lymphomas including the monotherapy and combination trials for peripheral T-cell lymphoma.‚ÄùDr. Pierluigi Porcu  Director  Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center  Jefferson Health  Philadelphia  added: ‚ÄúIt is encouraging to see lacutamab achieve clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety in this post-mogamulizumab  heavily pre-treated population. The responses observed in the blood and skin are encouraging in terms of ORR  but also the rapid time to response and duration of response. This advanced  highly refractory and heavily pre-treated disease  where patients typically have poor prognosis  and poor quality of life is an area of significant unmet need. The interim analysis adds to growing evidence supporting the development of lacutamab in T cell lymphomas. We thank the investigators  clinical research coordinators  patients and caregivers involved in the ongoing TELLOMAK program.‚ÄùOther presentations to be held at ASH 2022ANKET‚Ñ¢ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):During the ASH annual meeting  Pr. Vivier  DVM  PhD  Chief Scientific Officer of Innate Pharma  gave an oral presentation on Innate‚Äôs multispecific antibodies platform  ANKETTM  which harnesses the antitumor functions of NK cells  boosting their capacity to proliferate  to accumulate at the tumor site and to kill tumor cells.‚ÄúNK cells are attractive alternatives to T cell-based approach. Our ANKETTM platform is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer. It leverages the advantages of harnessing NK cell effector functions against cancer cells and also provides proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells. It has shown better anti-tumor efficacy than approved benchmark antibodies in preclinical tumor models.‚Äù Pr.

Patients developing refractory acute Graft-versus-Host Disease with gastrointestinal involvement (GI-aGvHD) following hematopoietic cell transplantation demonstrated an overall response rate (GI-ORR) of 56% at day 28 following MaaT013 treatment. In patients responding to MaaT013 therapy  the overall survival (OS) rate at 12 months was 59% (compared to 14% for non-responders) indicating a significant clinical benefit with MaaT013.In aGvHD patients refractory to 1st-line (steroids) and 2nd-line (ruxolitinib) treatments (n=31) and receiving MaaT013 as a 3rd-line therapy  65% demonstrated a GI-ORR at day 28. The 12-month OS rate in the MaaT013-responding group was 74%. This patient population resembles the ongoing Phase 3 ARES clinical trial (NCT04769895) being conducted in Europe.‚ÄúThe clinical benefits we continue to observe with MaaT013 are promising and reinforce the potential for our MET to improve survival outcomes for aGvHD patients when early treatment lines are unsuccessful ‚Äù said Herv√© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. ‚ÄúThe year 2022 will be remembered as a turning point for the microbiome therapeutics industry as it continues to mature. We expect to see an acceleration in the field following the first FDA approval for a microbiome-based product in preventing C. difficile infection as well as promising clinical results in various infectious disease and oncology indications.‚ÄùProf. Mohamad Mohty added  ‚ÄúPatients with severe acute GvHD that have undergone several lines of treatments have a high mortality risk with no currently proven salvage treatment options. The results observed with MaaT013 are very encouraging especially in the 3rd-line setting where we see that the survival outcome is significantly improved. Since the patient population being treated with MaaT013 in the company‚Äôs Phase III ARES pivotal study in Europe is similar to those treated in the EAP  we are hopeful that the clinical trial results will corroborate these positive results and will provide an important benefit to all patients who are in need.‚ÄùKey clinical findings with MaaT013 in compassionate use in France (Early Access Program or ‚ÄòEAP‚Äô)In the EAP  81 patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant  Grade II-IV  gastrointestinal aGvHD were treated with MaaT013 from July 2018 to May 202245 out of 81 (56%) showed objective GI response at day 28 of which 30 patients (37%) had a complete response  11 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 4 patients (5%) showed a partial response.Overall survival (OS) in MaaT013-responding patients at the 12-month follow-up was 59%  compared to 14% in non-responders (OS in all included patients was 39% at 12 months).Considering GvHD response in all organs (GI  skin  liver)  38 out of 78 patients (49%) showed an objective response rate (ORR) at day 28  of which 24 patients (31%) had a complete response  11 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (4%) showed a partial response.At the time of treatment  all patients had either Grade II (11%)  Grade III (51%) or Grade IV (38%) aGvHD (MAGIC Classification).Patients received MaaT013 after 1 to 6 (median: 2; 66/81 received ruxolitinib) lines of treatment68 out of 81 patients (84%) were steroid resistant of which 33 out of 68 (49%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  21 patients (31%) had a complete response  9 patients (13%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (4%) showed a partial response.66 out of 81 patients (81%) were refractory to ruxolitinib (any treatment line)  of which  37 out of 66 (56%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; of these 25 patients (38%) had a complete response  9 patients (14%) had a very good partial response  and 3 patients (5%) showed a partial response31 out of 66 patients were ruxolitinib-refractory in 2 nd -line and MaaT013 was administered as a 3 rd -line treatment; 20 out of 31 patients (65%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  19 patients (61%) had a complete response  and 1 patient (3%) had a very good partial response.-line and MaaT013 was administered as a 3 -line treatment; 20 out of 31 patients (65%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  19 patients (61%) had a complete response  and 1 patient (3%) had a very good partial response. 13 out of 81 patients (16%) were steroid-dependent of which 12 out of 13 patients (92%) showed an objective GI response at day 28; among these patients  9 patients (69%) had a complete response  2 patients (15%) had a very good partial response  and 1 patient (8%) showed a partial response.Evaluation of MaaT013 in the Phase III pivotal clinical trial ARESMaaT Pharma announced the first patient enrolled in the Phase III  open label  single arm  ARES pivotal trial for MaaT013 in March 2022  with a safety and data review by an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB)  after enrollment of half of the patients in the study  expected in the first half of 2023.As of today  MaaT013 has been safely administered to more than 160 patients in Europe in clinical trials and in the Expanded Access Program in France. Indeed  additionally to clinical trials  MaaT Pharma has been pursuing  since 2019  the compassionate use program in France  approved by the ANSM  to faster access to MaaT013 for patients with unmet medical need  mainly for indications in acute Graft-versus-Host disease. This program also allows the Company to strengthen its supply chain and production capacities to safely provide MaaT013  on a regular basis to 24 transplantation centers in France.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  enema Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM for acute  hospital use. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of ButycoreTM (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient‚Äôs functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal-predominant aGvHD.

The ADVANCE study is the first of two registrational trials evaluating the efficacy  safety and tolerability of VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adult patients with primary ITP.‚ÄúWe are very excited to present our ITP data during the plenary session at ASH  giving us the opportunity to highlight the potential of a new approach to treating this rare  complex disease. People living with ITP need more treatment options with new mechanisms of action that target the underlying biology of the disease  and we look forward to sharing our findings in helping to address this gap with the broader ITP community ‚Äù said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. ‚ÄúADVANCE is the second Phase 3 clinical trial in which VYVGART has demonstrated a strong clinical benefit  underscoring our belief in the breadth of potential for this asset in a range of high-need IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.‚ÄùTopline data from ADVANCE were reported in May 2022. The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a significantly higher proportion (p=0.0316) of VYVGART-treated chronic ITP patients achieved a sustained platelet response (17/78; 21.8%) compared to placebo (2/40; 5%). Sustained platelet response was defined as having platelet counts greater than or equal to 50x109/L on at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24 of treatment. Key platelet-derived secondary endpoints (first two secondary endpoints) were also met. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week chronic dosing study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.Story continuesHighlights From ASH Plenary SessionEarly  sustained platelet count increase : 38% of VYVGART-treated participants reached a platelet count of 30x10 9 /L platelets at week 1 compared to 11.1% placeboSustained response across all subgroups : subgroup analyses (including on prior ITP therapy  time since diagnosis  baseline platelet count and age/region demographics) of patients who achieved the primary endpoint all favored VYVGART over placeboInternational Working Group ( IWG ) respon der status : VYVGART resulted in higher responses than placebo on analysis of IWG response criteria51.2% (44/86) of VYVGART-treated patients achieved an IWG response compared to 20% placebo IWG responders were defined as having a platelet count of at least 30x10 9 /L  a two-fold increase in platelet count from baseline  and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visitsExtent of disease control : VYVGART-treated patients experienced substantially more weeks with disease control  with 44% sustaining response for at least 5-9 weeks (12% placebo)  28% for at least 10-14 weeks (0% placebo)  and 17% for at least 15-19 weeks (0% placebo)Sustained platelet count response was achieved in 90% (9/10) of VYVGART responders who switched from weekly to every other week dosing (after surpassing platelet counts of 100x10 9 /L for three out of four consecutive visits); one placebo patient switched to biweekly dosing but did not achieve a sustained platelet count responseKey pharmacodynamic parameters : total IgG levels were reduced in VYVGART-treated patients throughout observation period  supporting proposed mechanism of action Mean IgG levels decreased steadily over the first 4 weeks of treatment; baseline remained >60% throughout the trialConsistent safety profile: continuous weekly or biweekly dosing was well-tolerated and did not result in any new safety signals from those reported from previous trials‚ÄúI am honored to deliver this oral presentation on behalf of my co-investigators at ASH  one of the most prestigious hematology meetings  to provide my peers with additional details on the promising results from the ADVANCE study "" stated Catherine Broome  M.D.  Associate Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center  and Principal Investigator in the ADVANCE trial. ""Along with the previously reported positive efficacy  safety and tolerability data from the trial  further analyses show efgartigimod demonstrated rapid and sustained reduction in IgG autoantibodies  which correlated with platelet count response  as well as consistent improvement over placebo across each evaluated weekly timepoint. The data generated to date give us optimism that this therapy could provide a new tool in the treatment of ITP  and we look forward to seeing results from the subcutaneous study in 2023.""The Phase 3 ADVANCE IV trial is the first of two registrational trials being conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program. ADVANCE-SC is evaluating SC VYVGART for the treatment of primary ITP. Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the second half of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ‚ÄãA total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on 'watch and wait' at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ‚ÄãPatients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ‚ÄãThe primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ‚ÄãKey secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART.

Morial Convention Center in New Orleans  Louisiana. This in-person event will be broadcast virtually. The ASH 2022 Annual Meeting abstracts are available at: https://www.hematology.org/meetings/annual-meeting/abstracts .About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

The ADVANCE study is the first of two registrational trials evaluating the efficacy  safety and tolerability of VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adult patients with primary ITP.‚ÄúWe are very excited to present our ITP data during the plenary session at ASH  giving us the opportunity to highlight the potential of a new approach to treating this rare  complex disease. People living with ITP need more treatment options with new mechanisms of action that target the underlying biology of the disease  and we look forward to sharing our findings in helping to address this gap with the broader ITP community ‚Äù said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. ‚ÄúADVANCE is the second Phase 3 clinical trial in which VYVGART has demonstrated a strong clinical benefit  underscoring our belief in the breadth of potential for this asset in a range of high-need IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.‚ÄùTopline data from ADVANCE were reported in May 2022. The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a significantly higher proportion (p=0.0316) of VYVGART-treated chronic ITP patients achieved a sustained platelet response (17/78; 21.8%) compared to placebo (2/40; 5%). Sustained platelet response was defined as having platelet counts greater than or equal to 50x109/L on at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24 of treatment. Key platelet-derived secondary endpoints (first two secondary endpoints) were also met. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week chronic dosing study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.Highlights From ASH Plenary SessionEarly  sustained platelet count increase : 38% of VYVGART-treated participants reached a platelet count of 30x10 9 /L platelets at week 1 compared to 11.1% placebo38% of VYVGART-treated participants reached a platelet count of 30x10 /L platelets at week 1 compared to 11.1% placebo Sustained response across all subgroups : subgroup analyses (including on prior ITP therapy  time since diagnosis  baseline platelet count and age/region demographics) of patients who achieved the primary endpoint all favored VYVGART over placebosubgroup analyses (including on prior ITP therapy  time since diagnosis  baseline platelet count and age/region demographics) of patients who achieved the primary endpoint all favored VYVGART over placebo International Working Group ( IWG ) respon der status : VYVGART resulted in higher responses than placebo on analysis of IWG response criteria51.2% (44/86) of VYVGART-treated patients achieved an IWG response compared to 20% placebo IWG responders were defined as having a platelet count of at least 30x10 9 /L  a two-fold increase in platelet count from baseline  and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visitsVYVGART resulted in higher responses than placebo on analysis of IWG response criteria Extent of disease control : VYVGART-treated patients experienced substantially more weeks with disease control  with 44% sustaining response for at least 5-9 weeks (12% placebo)  28% for at least 10-14 weeks (0% placebo)  and 17% for at least 15-19 weeks (0% placebo)Sustained platelet count response was achieved in 90% (9/10) of VYVGART responders who switched from weekly to every other week dosing (after surpassing platelet counts of 100x10 9 /L for three out of four consecutive visits); one placebo patient switched to biweekly dosing but did not achieve a sustained platelet count responseVYVGART-treated patients experienced substantially more weeks with disease control  with 44% sustaining response for at least 5-9 weeks (12% placebo)  28% for at least 10-14 weeks (0% placebo)  and 17% for at least 15-19 weeks (0% placebo)Key pharmacodynamic parameters : total IgG levels were reduced in VYVGART-treated patients throughout observation period  supporting proposed mechanism of action Mean IgG levels decreased steadily over the first 4 weeks of treatment; baseline remained >60% throughout the trialtotal IgG levels were reduced in VYVGART-treated patients throughout observation period  supporting proposed mechanism of actionConsistent safety profile: continuous weekly or biweekly dosing was well-tolerated and did not result in any new safety signals from those reported from previous trials‚ÄúI am honored to deliver this oral presentation on behalf of my co-investigators at ASH  one of the most prestigious hematology meetings  to provide my peers with additional details on the promising results from the ADVANCE study "" stated Catherine Broome  M.D.  Associate Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center  and Principal Investigator in the ADVANCE trial. ""Along with the previously reported positive efficacy  safety and tolerability data from the trial  further analyses show efgartigimod demonstrated rapid and sustained reduction in IgG autoantibodies  which correlated with platelet count response  as well as consistent improvement over placebo across each evaluated weekly timepoint. The data generated to date give us optimism that this therapy could provide a new tool in the treatment of ITP  and we look forward to seeing results from the subcutaneous study in 2023.""The Phase 3 ADVANCE IV trial is the first of two registrational trials being conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program. ADVANCE-SC is evaluating SC VYVGART for the treatment of primary ITP. Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the second half of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ‚ÄãA total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on 'watch and wait' at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ‚ÄãPatients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ‚ÄãThe primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ‚ÄãKey secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART.

Morial Convention Center in New Orleans  Louisiana. This in-person event will be broadcast virtually. The ASH 2022 Annual Meeting abstracts are available at: https://www.hematology.org/meetings/annual-meeting/abstracts .About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

That included large-scale moves by global banks Barclays and Citigroup as well as dozens of smaller firms moving as few as one or two people to Ireland.A total scrapping of banker pay caps and a higher bar to penalise senior executives and directors for misbehaviour on their watch are among the new UK measures. They are designed to appeal directly to decision makers whose responsibilities were toughened up and bonuses reduced across the European Union in the wake of the losses suffered during the global financial crisis.The moves are unlikely to boost the UK operations of Irish banks including AIB and Bank of Ireland but could weigh against Ireland as a location for future investment by global investment banks  according to Diarmaid Sheridan  a financial services analyst at Davy Stockbrokers.The proposed divergence from the European Solvency 2 regime would also make it easier for the likes of insurers  which manage trillions in assets  to put capital into climate friendly investments versus the EU where rules shoehorn funds into the lowest risk bond options  he noted.While UK regulators led the push for tighter financial regulation a decade ago  Britain now sees its position outside the EU as a chance to undercut that regime so as to claw back lost investment and reassert the City of London financial district as Europe‚Äôs pre-eminent finance hub.That status suffered a symbolic blow in November when the Paris‚Äôs Euronext Stock Exchange overtook London as Europe‚Äôs most valuable ‚Äì if only briefly. Amsterdam overtook London as Europe‚Äôs busiest share-trading hub last year.Britain‚Äôs finance minister Jeremy Hunt denied the decision to scrap post-crash rules would risk repeating factors leading to that crisis.‚ÄúIt is perfectly sensible to make pragmatic changes such as the ones that we‚Äôre announcing today ‚Äù he said at an event hosted by the Financial Times.‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre doing so very  very carefully to make sure that the UK is a competitive  exciting place to be and to invest  but also that we don‚Äôt lose the guard rails that we put in place after 2008.The package of more than 30 changes includes lifting a cap on bankers‚Äô bonuses and easing capital requirements for smaller lenders. The UK also said it will review regulations that hold bankers accountable for their decisions and will relax ringfencing rules intended to separate risky investment banking from retail operations ‚Äì rules created after high-risk lending and so-called ‚Äòcasino banking‚Äô was blamed for triggering a global financial crisis in 2008.It remains to be seen whether the promise of a looser regime is enough to counter the reduced access to the EU.,neutral,0.13,0.82,0.06,mixed,0.16,0.04,0.8,True,English,"['finance industry jobs', 'bank rules', 'Brexit vote', 'UK', 'clout', 'wake', 'lowest risk bond options', 'UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt', 'banker pay caps', 'climate friendly investments', 'eminent finance hub', 'Euronext Stock Exchange', 'busiest share-trading hub', 'other financial institutions', 'financial services firm', 'financial services analyst', 'tighter financial regulation', 'new UK measures', 'competitive, exciting place', 'global financial crisis', 'European Solvency 2 regime', 'risky investment banking', 'London financial district', 'global investment banks', 'financial sector', 'Financial Times', 'global banks', '1,200 finance jobs', 'European Union', 'casino banking', 'UK government', 'UK regulators', 'The UK', 'major reform', 'red tape', 'big winners', '36 UK-regulated firms', 'five years', 'smaller firms', 'two people', 'total scrapping', 'higher bar', 'senior executives', 'Irish banks', 'future investment', 'Diarmaid Sheridan', 'Davy Stockbrokers', 'symbolic blow', 'repeating factors', 'guard rails', 'smaller lenders', 'high-risk lending', 'looser regime', 'reduced access', 'UK operations', 'retail operations', 'Brexit vote', 'large-scale moves', 'decision makers', 'pragmatic changes', 'capital requirements', 'post-crash rules', 'ringfencing rules', 'bankers‚Äô bonuses', 'EU regulations', '30 changes', 'plans', 'reams', 'bid', 'Ireland', 'process', 'part', 'research', 'EY.', 'Barclays', 'Citigroup', 'dozens', 'directors', 'misbehaviour', 'watch', 'wake', 'losses', 'AIB', 'location', 'divergence', 'likes', 'insurers', 'trillions', 'assets', 'funds', 'push', 'Britain', 'position', 'chance', 'City', 'status', 'November', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'event', 'package', 'decisions', 'promise']",2022-12-10,2022-12-11,independent.ie

14579,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563015-brenntag-trading-at-strong-fcf-yield,Brenntag: Trading At A 10% FCF Yield And Pursuing M&A (OTCMKTS:BNTGF),Brenntag is a German-based distributor of chemical products. Read why this company could be looking at acquisition opportunities.,Kannan D/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionIn August 2021  I mentioned I was on the sidelines and would be happy to revisit Brenntag (OTCPK:BNTGF) (OTCPK:BNTGY) at a lower share price. We're now 15 months later and Brenntag‚Äôs share price has dropped from in excess of 86 EUR to just over 60 EUR per share. That‚Äôs a 30% drop and means the company has clearly underperformed the general markets as you can see below (the blue line is the DAX index  the purple line is the S&P performance since my previous article). And that‚Äôs why I think this could be a good time to revisit this Germany-based chemical products distributor.Yahoo FinanceBrenntag's primary listing is in Germany where it's trading with BNR as ticker symbol on the Deutsche Boerse. The average daily volume in Germany is approximately 420 000 shares and this is clearly superior to any other listing. As there are 154.5M shares outstanding  the current market cap of Brenntag is just over 9.3B EUR.The first nine months of the year are promisingIn this article I‚Äôll have a closer look at the financial performance of Brenntag  as well as how the recent M&A rumors may impact the company. For a better understanding of Brenntag‚Äôs business model I‚Äôd like to refer you to this very extensive 73 page corporate presentation which provides a very detailed overview of the company and all its aspects.In the third quarter of this year  Brenntag reported a total revenue of 5.1B EUR  and generated an operating profit of 1.1B EUR on that revenue. This means the company has been able to protect its margins as it was able to keep its gross margins relatively stable around the 22% mark.Brenntag Investor RelationsSome of the other operating expenses did increase at a faster pace though as for instance the personnel expenses are 15% higher than in the third quarter of last year but with an operating profit of 377M EUR  the operating margin of 7.4% is higher than the 6.6% in Q3 2021  but a bit lower than the 8.4-8.5% achieved in the first six months of the year.But with a total net income of 1.60 EUR per share in the third quarter  which brought the 9M 2022 EPS to 5.07 EUR per share  I think shareholders of Brenntag could (and should) be pretty satisfied.Brenntag did not provide a very detailed Q4 outlook but it did confirm it expects a full-year operating EBITDA of 1.75-1.85B EUR. The operating EBITDA in the first nine months of the year was 1.46B EUR which means the Q4 EBITDA will likely come in at around 300-400M EUR. This confirms the company‚Äôs comment the inflationary headwinds will persist in the near future.Brenntag Investor RelationsThe implied Q4 EBITDA guidance now also allows us to calculate the anticipated full-year free cash flow. We know the company reported an operating cash flow of 554M EUR in the first nine months of this year  but this includes a 648M EUR investment in the working capital position and excludes 99M EUR in lease payments and almost 3M EUR in payments to non-controlling shareholders. On an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was exactly 1B EUR in the first nine months of the year.Brenntag Investor RelationsThe total capex was 149M EUR  resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of approximately 850M EUR in the first nine months of the year. That‚Äôs a strong result  but keep in mind the final quarter of the year will be capex-heavy as Brenntag has been guiding for a full-year capex of 270M EUR  indicating the Q4 capex will be around 120M EUR.Let‚Äôs now assume the Q4 EBITDA will be 350M EUR. We know the depreciation expenses will be around 95M EUR and the interest expenses will be around 25M EUR. This should result in a pre-tax income of 230M EUR and a net income of 169M EUR based on an average tax rate of 26.5%.We also know the 120M EUR capex + 25M EUR in lease expenses are about 50M EUR higher than the combined depreciation and amortization expenses. This means the Q4 free cash flow result will be approximately 50MM EUR lower than the reported net income  and 110-120M EUR would be a solid and reliable Q4 free cash flow result. This would bring the full-year free cash flow result to 950M EUR  for just over 6 EUR per share. And that makes the current share price of just over 60 EUR rather attractive.Brenntag is pursuing M&AThe chemical distribution sector is still pretty fragmented and it's ripe for more M&A. At the end of November  Brenntag confirmed it was talking to Univar Solutions (NYSE:UNVR)  a US-based competitor to discuss an acquisition of the latter. No further details have been provided yet  but a Credit Suisse (CS) analyst mentioned a $40/share acquisition would be reasonable. I tend to agree.Univar generated a free cash flow result of in excess of $550M in the first nine months of the year  and the valuation of approximately 9 times EBITDA based on the aforementioned $40/share would represent an enterprise value of just under $9B. That‚Äôs not cheap  but there surely will be synergy benefits that could be unlocked if two major players would merge.Brenntag also would be able to pursue this M&A deal with an all-cash bid. At $40/share  it would have to fork over $6.5B in cash and assume about $2.2B in net debt. This would increase its own net debt position from about $2B to $10.7B or approximately 10.2-10.3B EUR. Assuming the combined entities will hoard cash in 2023 and will be able to reduce their net debt by 1.2B EUR on a combined basis  the YE 2023 net debt would be ‚Äòjust‚Äô 9.5B EUR. That‚Äôs very high in absolute numbers  but we also know the combined EBITDA (excluding synergy benefits) would exceed 2.5B EUR. The debt ratio would thus come in below 4 times EBITDA by the end of next year and further drop to less than 3 by the end of 2024 if/when the synergy benefits kick in. This is just a theoretical calculation  but the numbers indicate it should be doable.While it‚Äôs still early days and there is no guarantee an offer will materialize  I think the combination of both companies would make sense from business perspective and a financial perspective.Investment thesisBrenntag‚Äôs current market cap of 9.3B EUR and enterprise value of 11.2B EUR (excluding lease debt) makes the company pretty attractively valued at just 6.5 times this year‚Äôs EBITDA (excluding lease amortizations). I would not oppose a transaction with Univar  even if that would happen at $40/share as I think the combined entity would be pretty strong.I currently have no position in Brenntag  but I‚Äôm getting increasingly interested now the share price has dropped by about 30% since my previous article.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.69,0.15,0.16,True,English,"['10% FCF Yield', 'M&A', 'Brenntag', 'OTCMKTS', 'BNTGF', 'reliable Q4 free cash flow result', 'full-year free cash flow result', 'extensive 73 page corporate presentation', 'Germany-based chemical products distributor', 'recent M&A rumors', 'operating cash flow', 'chemical distribution sector', 'average daily volume', 'current market cap', 'first nine months', 'first six months', 'working capital position', 'average tax rate', 'two major players', 'detailed Q4 outlook', 'Q4 EBITDA guidance', 'S&P performance', 'M&A deal', 'full-year operating EBITDA', '648M EUR investment', 'Yahoo Finance Brenntag', 'Brenntag Investor Relations', 'lower share price', 'current share price', 'other operating expenses', '120M EUR capex', 'total net income', 'strong result', 'full-year capex', 'Q4 capex', 'M&A.', 'total capex', 'other listing', 'financial performance', 'detailed overview', 'operating profit', 'operating margin', '9 times EBITDA', 'pre-tax income', 'personnel expenses', 'interest expenses', 'lease expenses', 'amortization expenses', 'Kannan D', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:BNTGF', 'general markets', 'blue line', 'DAX index', 'purple line', 'good time', 'primary listing', 'ticker symbol', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'closer look', 'business model', 'third quarter', 'faster pace', '9M 2022 EPS', 'inflationary headwinds', 'near future', 'adjusted basis', 'final quarter', 'US-based competitor', 'Credit Suisse', 'enterprise value', 'synergy benefits', 'total revenue', '99M EUR', '3M EUR', 'depreciation expenses', 'previous article', '154.5M shares', 'gross margins', 'lease payments', 'controlling shareholders', 'Univar Solutions', '$40/share acquisition', 'last year', '86 EUR', '60 EUR', '5.07 EUR', '420,000 shares', 'Editorial', 'Introduction', 'August', 'sidelines', 'excess', '30% drop', 'company', 'BNR', 'understanding', 'aspects', '5.1B', '22% mark', 'instance', '377M', 'Q3', 'comment', '554M', '850M', 'mind', 'capex-heavy', '270M', '95M', '25M', '230M', '169M', 'solid', '950M', 'end', 'November', 'UNVR', 'latter', 'details', '1.75', '300']",2022-12-10,2022-12-11,seekingalpha.com
