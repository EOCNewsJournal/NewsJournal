Evidence of a significant reduction in the risk of infection and GvHD-related mortality following stem cell transplantation has been associated with a higher gut microbiome diversity. Our ability to maintain or induce a high richness  and a high diversity gut microbiome would be key to prevent or minimize these adverse effects and contribute to a better overall prognosis for these patients.”Key clinical findings with MaaT033 in Phase 1b study CIMONIn the dose-finding Phase 1b CIMON trial  21 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated with MaaT033 and evaluated for safety  tolerability  and initial signs of microbial species engraftment.MaaT033 was shown to be safe and tolerable in 21 patients. 4 severe adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 4 patients  only one considered as possibly related by the investigator.Treatment with MaaT033 induced increased microbiota richness as well as strong and persistent engraftment in cohorts 3 and 4 of the dose escalation study  which consisted in the intake of 3 capsules of the drug candidate per day.Engraftment following MaaT033 treatment correlated with increased anti-inflammatory marker levels and reduced inflammatory marker levels.Detailed results from the Phase 1b CIMON trial were presented in a poster on December 11 at the ASH Annual Meeting by Prof. Mohamad Mohty  Head of the Clinical Hematology and Cellular Department at the Saint-Antoine Hospital and Sorbonne University.As previously announced  MaaT Pharma is currently preparing a pivotal Phase IIb randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled to evaluate MaaT033’s safety  engraftment  and efficacy in improving overall survival at 12 months and preventing complications in patients with blood cancers receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Initiation should take place shortly and the Company will provide a detailed status update in January 2023.About MaaT033MaaT033 is an oral  full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  high-richness Microbiome Ecosystem TherapyTM. MaaT033 is designed to restore the gut ecosystem to full functionality to improve clinical outcomes as well as to control adverse events related to conventional treatments for liquid tumors. The capsule formulation facilitates administration while maintaining the high and consistent richness and diversity of microbial species  including anti-inflammatory ButycoreTM species.About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology. Committed to treating cancer and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma has launched  in March 2022  a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with acute GvHD  following the achievement of its proof of concept in a Phase 2 trial.

Many European markets benefit from the full end-to-end digital connectivity provided by the solution  enabling greater transparency  speed  and accuracy to the ecosystem.With Vote Connect  shareholders' votes are sent digitally to issuers or their agents in real-time and they receive digital confirmation that their votes have been cast and counted at the meeting. The inefficient and disjointed infrastructure of existing channels has seen a growing number of businesses reassess how they manage proxy voting  with Proxymity's platform increasingly seen as the solution of choice.Dean Little  CEO and Co-Founder  Proxymity  commented: ""We continue to develop our long-standing partnership with Clearstream and the Deutsche Börse Group  following on from the rollout of our Shareholder ID solution earlier in the year. This is another fantastic milestone for Proxymity as we expand our market coverage  including the introduction of Vote Connect into the Baltic Markets and increasing our overall global footprint.""Sam Riley  Head of Clearstream Securities Services  added: ""At Clearstream  we always seek to optimise our clients' experience throughout the whole securities life cycle. Together with our partner Proxymity  we are seeking to provide the best in digital proxy voting solutions  driving transparency  and increasing efficiency in the European capital markets.""Story continuesAbout SRD IISRD II aims to make it easier for issuers to engage with shareholders  especially across different countries  encouraging the use of modern technology to aid communication between companies  their shareholders  and the intermediaries between them.The European-wide legislation impacts  amongst others  companies with registered offices and shares trading in the EU and EEA. This suggests new platforms and technologies like Proxymity may not only help upgrade existing processes to meet SRD II demands but could also be the most efficient and effective means of complying with the legislation.-Notes to editors-About ProxymityProxymity connects the world's ecosystem of issuers  intermediaries  and investors digitally in real-time  bringing unprecedented transparency  efficiency  and accuracy to traditional paper-based processes.

(Reuters)Microsoft Corp agreed to buy a 4% stake in London Stock Exchange Group Plc as part of a $2.8 billion cloud-computing deal that pushes big tech further into financial markets.As part of the agreement  LSEG said it will spend at least that amount on cloud services with Microsoft over the next 10 years. The partnership will speed up the migration of its markets to the cloud and allow it to develop new products and services  it said Monday.The transaction adds to a recent trend of exchanges and tech firms linking up after similar partnerships between Nasdaq Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.  as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and CME Group. It points to increased demand from investors for information that gives them an edge in increasingly fast electronic markets.Global spending on financial market data and news rose 7.4% to a record $35.6 billion in 2021  according to an April report by Burton-Taylor International Consulting.“We will be generating meaningful revenue growth in the coming years by accessing new products and enhancing our existing product capabilities ” LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer said in a phone interview.At Friday’s closing price  a 4% stake in LSEG was valued at around £1.6 billion ($2 billion).Microsoft will buy its stake from a consortium made up of Blackstone  Thomson Reuters Corp. and affiliates of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore’s GIC  according to the statement. Thomson Reuters said in a statement it plans to use its proceeds from the transaction “to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities in key growth segments and provide returns to shareholders.”LSEG’s shares were up 3.2% at 11.37am in London.Minimum spendThe deal underlines LSEG’s increasing focus on data and analytics. The company completed a $27 billion purchase of Refinitiv last year  kicking off a new era where the majority of its revenues come from data. The parent company of Bloomberg News competes with Refinitiv to provide financial news  data and information.The Microsoft agreement is expected to cost LSEG between £250 million to £300 million between 2023 and 2025  including about £100 million in capital spending.Additional spending beyond the $2.8 billion minimum depends on the “success of the strategic partnership” and demand for LSEG’s data platform and professional services  according to the UK firm. Microsoft estimated in a separate statement that the “partnership  and broader market opportunity  could generate an additional $5 billion in revenue for the company over the next 10 years.”Scott Guthrie  Microsoft’s executive vice president for cloud and artificial intelligence  will be appointed as a LSEG director.Data consolidationThe past few years has seen consolidation among the finance industry’s biggest data providers. Last year  S&P Global Inc. agreed to buy IHS Markit Ltd. while Deutsche Boerse  LSE’s biggest European rival  took a majority stake in Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.  the corporate-governance adviser.It’s not the first time Microsoft has struck a deal alongside unveiling a sizeable cloud deal. In 2018  it invested in Grab  with the ride-hailing firm agreeing to adopt Azure as its preferred cloud platform.These cross-selling deals don’t always end in success. In 2012  the US tech firm spent $300 million in a stake in then struggling bookseller Barnes & Noble’s e-book division Nook.As part of the deal  Barnes & Noble agreed to make e-reading content for Microsoft.

Video Transcript [AUDIO LOGO]- Let's talk about Microsoft a little bit more  which is,Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss Microsoft buying a 4% stake in the London Stock Exchange.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Let's talk about Microsoft a little bit more  which is on the lower left of that screen there. It's up a little bit today after announcing this morning it's taking a 4% equity stake in the London Stock Exchange. This is part of 10-year partnership that will migrate the UK exchange's data onto the Microsoft Cloud. Now  Microsoft shares are up a little bit.London Stock Exchange is getting a lot of positive feedback from analysts for doing this deal  which is quite interesting  because they say it'll bring credibility and sort of beef up its data offerings compared to some of its peers. So they seem to be pretty positive on this deal  you guys.- It comes at a time-- I remember speaking to NASDAQ CEO Adena Friedman on about six or seven months ago. They've been going through an Amazon Web Service upgrade just all in the pursuit of making these markets more efficient  even faster.- Yeah  and it seems like for Microsoft  this is going to net them some spending over the next 10 years of EG or-- well  yeah  LSEG is basically going to spend that amount on cloud services with Microsoft. And hopefully with this  this should give Microsoft a little bit more insight into and for the data that Microsoft is really trying to aggregate as well and bring onto its cloud services. This has been a big wave of deals that we've seen from Microsoft.They had  of course  along with some of the other cloud participants  a big Pentagon deal. That was made known last week. And that's going to be over the course of some years for about $10 billion as well all in. But then additionally here on the exchange front  just another deal to be able to see their web services or their cloud division propped up just a little bit more.- And a deal that doesn't need regulatory approval like the Activision Blizzard does.- Right. I guess there has been a lot of consolidation in the data exchange space in the past few years. Remember  S&P Global bought IHS Markit. Deutsche Boerse also took a big stake in Institutional Shareholder Services. So there's been some--Story continues- Tentative with London Stock Exchange.- Yeah  so there's been some of these combinations. So we'll see if this is the last of them or there are more to go.- It could be the tip of that spending to come forward  especially given the acquisition we were talking about earlier and perhaps just looking for good prices for deals right now  too.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.81,0.14,0.04,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange', 'cloud deal', 'Microsoft', 'stake', 'Yahoo Finance Live anchors', 'NASDAQ CEO Adena Friedman', 'Amazon Web Service upgrade', 'S&P Global', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'other cloud participants', 'data exchange space', 'big Pentagon deal', 'web services', 'UK exchange', 'exchange front', 'cloud services', 'big wave', 'cloud division', 'Video Transcript', 'AUDIO LOGO', 'lower left', '10-year partnership', 'positive feedback', 'regulatory approval', 'Activision Blizzard', 'IHS Markit', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'big stake', 'good prices', 'data offerings', '4% equity stake', 'Microsoft Cloud', 'next 10 years', 'Microsoft shares', '4% stake', 'screen', 'lot', 'analysts', 'credibility', 'peers', 'time', 'pursuit', 'markets', 'spending', 'LSEG', 'amount', 'little', 'insight', 'deals', 'course', 'consolidation', 'past', 'Story', 'combinations', 'tip', 'acquisition']",2022-12-12,2022-12-12,ca.finance.yahoo.com

The consultant’s report identified problems from timelines to communication to complexity  and suggested that its implementation  which the ASX had indicated as near-ready  was no more than 63% complete.In the aftermath  in November  the ASX halted the project and said it would write off as much as A$255 million ($173 million) in technology costs. A parliamentary committee has followed and questions have been raised about the ASX’s culture  governance and technology capability.,negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.25,0.03,0.72,True,English,"['ASX blockchain landmark', 'House Electronic Subregister System', 'real-world financial markets', 'Australian Securities Exchange', 'Deutsche Börse', 'SIX Digital Exchange', 'distributed-ledger system', 'game changer', 'great step', 'blockchain technology', 'nebulous idea', 'two years', '25-year-old clearing', 'settlement systems', 'stock exchanges', 'greater scale', 'multiple delays', 'technology costs', 'parliamentary committee', 'technology capability', 'clever', 'heart', 'study', 'company', 'ASX', 'plenty', 'examples', 'Switzerland', 'something', 'complexity', 'August', 'Accenture', 'state', 'project', 'consultant', 'report', 'problems', 'timelines', 'communication', 'implementation', 'aftermath', 'November', 'questions', 'culture', 'governance']",2022-12-12,2022-12-12,euromoney.com

Microsoft will acquire the shares as part of a new long-term strategic partnership that will see it provide cloud computing services to the exchange  LSEG said in a statement on Monday. At Friday's closing price  a 4pc stake in the bourse was valued at around £1.6bn (€1.85bn). The stake is part of a broader  10-year agreement to help the London Stock Exchange owner improve its data analytics and cloud infrastructure using Microsoft's products. Scott Guthrie  Microsoft's executive vice president for cloud and artificial intelligence  will be appointed as a director. The agreement is the latest sign of surging demand from investors for information that gives them an edge in increasingly fast electronic markets. Global spending on financial market data and news rose 7.4pc to a record $35.6bn in 2021  according to an April report by Burton-Taylor International Consulting. ""We will be generating meaningful revenue growth in the coming years by accessing new products and enhancing our existing product capabilities "" LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer said in a phone interview. Microsoft will buy its stake from a consortium made up of Blackstone  Thomson Reuters Corp. and affiliates of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore's GIC  according to the statement. Shares in LSEG rose 3.8pc at 10:01 a.m. in London. The deal underlines LSEG's increasing focus on data and analytics. The company completed a $27bn purchase of Refinitiv last year  kicking off a new era where the majority of its revenues come from data. The parent company of Bloomberg News competes with Refinitiv to provide financial news  data and information. The agreement is expected to cost LSEG between £250m to £300 million between 2023 and 2025  including about £100 million in capital spending. The group said it has made a contractual commitment with Microsoft to spend a minimum of $2.8bn on cloud-related services and support over the next 10 years. Additional spending depends on the ""success of the strategic partnership"" and demand for LSEG's data platform and professional services  according to the UK firm. Microsoft estimated in a separate statement that the ""partnership  and broader market opportunity  could generate an additional $5 billion in revenue for the company over the next 10 years."" Azure Platform Under the arrangement  LSEG's data platform and other key technology infrastructure will migrate to Microsoft's Azure cloud environment while its data and analytics will interface with certain Microsoft applications. The past few years has seen consolidation among the finance industry's biggest data providers. Last year  S&P Global Inc agreed to buy IHS Markit Ltd. while Deutsche Boerse  LSE's biggest European rival  took a majority stake in Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.  the corporate-governance adviser. It's not the first time Microsoft has struck a deal alongside unveiling a sizeable cloud deal. In 2018  it invested in Grab  with the ride-hailing firm agreeing to adopt Azure as its preferred cloud platform. These cross-selling deals don't always end in success. In 2012  the US tech firm spent $300m in a stake in then struggling bookseller Barnes & Noble's e-book division Nook. As part of the deal  Barnes & Noble agreed to make e-reading content for Microsoft. Two years later  Barnes & Noble bought out Microsoft's stake for about $125m  after Nook struggled to win over customers.

See why I'm neutral on the stock.,"metamorworks/iStock via Getty ImagesABC Arbitrage: ticker ABCA.PA (Euronext Paris)Market cap: €380M ($400M)A few years ago  I introduced ABC Arbitrage (ABCA.PA  OTCPK:ABCCF)  a small-cap French stock with a very specific business model: arbitrage strategies  whereby the company takes advantage of mispriced assets in financial markets. These trading strategies thrive in times of elevated volatility  meaning that ABC Arbitrage performs especially well in downturns.The company's performance has been satisfactory  but not outstanding  in my opinion. It offers a generous dividend of about 6%  but this yield comes with a high payout ratio. With the stock too expensive for my liking  I prefer another Paris-listed stock  Viel & Cie (VIL.PA)  which also benefits from volatility. Viel's steady performance and undemanding valuation make it an excellent choice for income investors.Not all retail investors will have access to ABC Arbitrage or Viel  given that the stocks only trade on Euronext Paris (the OTC ticker ABCCF for ABC Arbitrage has very little liquidity). For those seeking exposure to larger companies in the long volatility niche  let me mention Virtu (VIRT)  Flow Traders (OTCPK:FLTDF) and BGC Partners (BGCP). A thorough analysis of Virtu can be found here.ABC Arbitrage: Making Money Out Of Market VolatilityABC Arbitrage was founded in 1995. It is headquartered in Paris  France  and also has offices in Dublin and Singapore. The company defines itself as a quantitative asset manager. It deploys a variety of arbitrage strategies  using both managed money and its own equity.These trading strategies can be broken down into four categories  per the company's website :Liquidity arbitrage: detecting and correcting differences in trading prices between linked assets.Risk arbitrage: taking advantage of risk mispricing in capital markets.Statistical arbitrage: pair-trading within an industry  lead-lag effects (e.g. interaction between commodity prices and inflation).Derivatives arbitrage: detecting mispricing in options and other derivatives.ABC Arbitrage has a successful track record  having generated 27 consecutive profitable years  with a ROE (Return on Equity) in excess of 10%. These results have convinced institutional clients to entrust the company with their funds  to the tune of €350M. In total  including its own equity  ABC Arbitrage manages around €500M - a rather small amount  but enough for the company to fund its arbitrage operations (some of which couldn't be scaled up anyway).H1 '22 presentationThe main driver of the company's performance  unsurprisingly  is volatility. Volatility  in fact  increases trading activity (velocity) and creates price dislocations that arbitrage strategies can exploit. The table below shows various drivers and their typical impact on ABC Arbitrage's financial performance.H1 '22 presentationAfter muted volatility levels for most of the 2010s  including some ""no life"" years  as the company calls them  the Covid crisis finally woke up financial markets.H1 '22 presentationThis resulted in strong financial performance for ABC Arbitrage in 2020  and  to a lesser extent  in 2021 and 2022 YTD. The record results of 2008  during the Great Recession  are further proof of volatility's impact on ABC Arbitrage.H1 '22 presentationNote: 2022A above is just an extrapolation of H1 performance  the actual yearly results of course remain unknown.ABC Arbitrage : A Generous Dividend Policy  But A High Payout RatioBased on its track record  ABC Arbitrage is seen to be a decent portfolio hedge  which tends to do especially well in periods when many stocks underperform. Financial performance in the first half of 2022 was satisfactory  though one might have expected the company to capitalize even more on the volatility generated by the war in Ukraine  and by the monetary tightening from central banks.H1 '22 results press releaseCentral banks' behavior  in fact  makes the company's management hopeful that markets in the 2020s will be more favorable for arbitrage strategies than the previous decade: ""The year 2022 seems to outline the end of the central bank paradigm established since 2012"".What about the distributions? The dividend history suggests a rather generous dividend payer  with a yield generally around 6% in the past couple of years. For 2022  based on the expected €0.40/share dividend (€0.1 quarterly)  the yield is 6.25% at the current share price of €6.40.Investors need to be aware  though  that ABC Arbitrage has a high payout ratio. In 2021 and 2020  it was around 80%. During the volatility lull of 2017-2019  the payout ratio exceeded 100% of earnings  and the distributions were made in part as return of capital to shareholders.abc-arbitrage.comABC Arbitrage is a good company with an original business model that it masters well  but at the end of the day  I make my decisions based on valuation. At a trailing P/E of 13  ABC Arbitrage is not cheap for a French small cap. Many European blue chips trade at multiples lower than this. I don't consider this valuation attractive enough for me to buy ABC Arbitrage's stock at this point  even if I used to have some in my portfolio a few years back.Instead  I prefer another French small cap stock that offers the same kind of disconnect from the economic cycle and positive exposure to volatility. This stock is Viel & Cie (VIL.PA).My Favorite Volatility Pick: Viel & CieViel  which also trades on Euronext Paris  is a holding company whose main asset is a controlling stake in Compagnie Financière Tradition (SW:CFT  OTCPK:CFNCF)  a Swiss entity that is one of the top 3 interdealer brokers in the world. Tradition operates across many asset classes:Tradition's H1 '22 presentationI will not detail here the thesis supporting an investment in Viel  but readers can refer to my earlier article : Tradition: How To Get This Swiss Inter-Dealer Broker On The Cheap. In short  I like Viel for 3 reasons:Tradition performs well in volatile times  thus fulfilling the same function as ABC Arbitrage  Virtu  Flow Traders and peer BGC Partners  as a portfolio hedge.Viel enables investors to buy Tradition at a steep discount  thanks to the holding company discount.The other holdings of Viel  though minor compared to Tradition  perform well too.On the back on Tradition's strong performance in H1 '22  Viel posted excellent interim results. Net profit was €42M for the half-year (Group share).Viel's H1 '22 earningsFurthermore  when compared to other volatility plays  Viel gets an additional  direct  favorable impact from higher interest rates:A shift in central-bank monetary policy  away from quantitative easing and rate hikes  was beneficial for the Group’s operations. This positive trend was reflected in all regions  and particularly in foreign exchange and interest rate products and securities and security derivatives. Source: Tradition's earnings releaseThis bodes well for Viel in the coming quarters  even if volatility itself abates. For the full year 2022  even if we assume a conservative net profit (Group share) of €60M  Viel's shares are currently trading at a cheap P/E of 7 (based on the market cap of €420M). To be honest  I expect the company to do even better than this  given the strong Q3 '22 revenue announced by Tradition.In terms of distributions  Viel has paid a growing dividend in recent years  and offers a 5% yield based on the 2021 distribution. What's key is the low payout ratio of only 35%. Finally  I like the fact that the number of shares has been going down in recent years thanks to buybacks being performed at an attractive share price.TakeawayABC Arbitrage and Viel share some common performance drivers  above all the level of volatility in financial markets. They trade on the same exchange  have more or less the same market cap  and their dividend yields are pretty similar.However  their valuations differ greatly. I like to look at my stocks through the prism of earnings yield: at a P/E of 7  Viel's earnings yield is ~14% (1/7). In the case of ABC Arbitrage  it is 1/13  meaning less than 8%. This is why Viel is by far my preferred option when it comes to small-cap stocks bringing something different to the portfolio.",positive,0.91,0.02,0.07,mixed,0.29,0.06,0.65,True,English,"['ABC Arbitrage', 'Intriguing Hedge', 'Better Option', 'Viel', 'ABCCF', 'Many European blue chips', ""H1 '22 results press release"", 'specific business model', 'quantitative asset manager', 'decent portfolio hedge', 'original business model', 'central bank paradigm', 'high payout ratio', 'actual yearly results', 'current share price', 'Generous Dividend Policy', ""Central banks' behavior"", 'generous dividend payer', 'small-cap French stock', '27 consecutive profitable years', 'French small cap', 'successful track record', 'long volatility niche', 'strong financial performance', 'OTC ticker ABCCF', 'record results', 'Market cap', 'small amount', 'price dislocations', 'many stocks', '€0.40/share dividend', ""H1 '22 presentation"", 'H1 performance', 'Getty Images', 'mispriced assets', 'Paris-listed stock', 'undemanding valuation', 'excellent choice', 'little liquidity', 'larger companies', 'Flow Traders', 'BGC Partners', 'thorough analysis', 'four categories', 'trading prices', 'linked assets', 'commodity prices', 'other derivatives', 'institutional clients', 'main driver', 'trading activity', 'various drivers', 'life"" years', 'Covid crisis', 'lesser extent', 'Great Recession', 'first half', 'monetary tightening', 'previous decade', 'past couple', 'trailing P/E', 'ABC Arbitrage', 'Liquidity arbitrage', 'Risk arbitrage', 'Statistical arbitrage', 'Derivatives arbitrage', 'financial markets', 'steady performance', 'Euronext Paris', 'income investors', 'retail investors', 'elevated volatility', 'Market Volatility', 'volatility levels', 'volatility lull', 'OTCPK:FLTDF', 'risk mispricing', 'typical impact', 'trading strategies', 'VIL.PA', 'capital markets', 'good company', 'ABCA', 'advantage', 'times', 'downturns', 'opinion', 'yield', 'liking', 'Viel', 'Cie', 'access', 'exposure', 'Virtu', 'BGCP', 'Money', 'France', 'offices', 'Dublin', 'Singapore', 'variety', 'managed', 'equity', 'website', 'differences', 'industry', 'interaction', 'inflation', 'options', 'ROE', 'Return', 'excess', 'funds', 'tune', 'operations', 'fact', 'velocity', '2010s', '2022 YTD.', 'proof', 'Note', 'extrapolation', 'course', 'periods', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'management', '2020s', 'distributions', 'history', 'earnings', 'shareholders', 'day', 'decisions', 'multiples']",2022-12-12,2022-12-12,seekingalpha.com

The empty bottles are collected  cleaned and refilled. The brand hopes to reuse 30-40% of all bottles sold locally  with an estimated 60% CO2 saving per bottle.The Cointreau and Mount Gay brands have announced a partnership with ecoSPIRITS in the UK to promote greater circularity in the on-trade. The 4.5 litre ecoTOTES will be deployed in selected London bars  restaurants and hotels and then collected  cleaned and refilled locally. This pilot programme aims to achieve a 30-50% reduction in backroom storage and a 95% reduction in daily glass and cardboard waste in the participating locations. With this launch  Cointreau is becoming the first international liqueur to partner with ecoSPIRITS  and Rémy Cointreau  the first spirits Group in the UK.Finally  true to its vision of always being ahead of its time  the LOUIS XIII brand is continuing its quest for “The Sustainable Exception”  which is at the heart of the values dear to the House of Rémy Martin. LOUIS XIII THE INFINITY WHEEL now offers the opportunity to refill its decanter an unlimited number of times in LOUIS XIII boutiques. The ceremony is personalised  and the life of the decanter is extended indefinitely.These actions are part of a global approach to sobriety and circularity  and support the commitments of the Group's CSR transformation roadmap  The Sustainable Exception. As part of the plan  Rémy Cointreau aims to reduce its carbon emissions per bottle by 50% by 2030 and to achieve Net Zero by 2050.Rémy Cointreau’s Chief Executive Officer  Eric Vallat  said: “Group’s objective is clear: we want to reduce our carbon emissions per bottle from 2kg to 1kg by 2030. In order to achieve this  rethinking our glass bottles through an active eco-design approach and increasing their circularity in different formats are key levers. These circular initiatives mark the beginning of a collective journey  undertaken hand-in-hand with our stakeholders  from our glassmakers to our clients!”About Rémy CointreauThere are clients all over the world seeking exceptional experiences – clients who know that a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavours.

This payment of the first tranche of €25 million  triggered by the progress made on our NATiV3 Phase III trial and the completion of the cash injections condition precedent for this tranche  will further support the development of lanifibranor. We remain strongly focused on the recruitment of patients in our Phase III trial and are hoping to satisfy all conditions for the disbursement of the second tranche of €25 million from the EIB.”As previously announced  the Finance Contract provides funding in two tranches of €25 million each  which are both subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent. Any drawings under the terms of the Finance Contract that have not been disbursed within 36 months from the signing of the Finance Contract  (i.e.  before May 16  2025)  cannot be completed at a later date.

The warrants will automatically be deemed null and void if not exercised within the twelve-year period.EIB has a put option which may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the unexercised warrants then exercisable at their intrinsic value (subject to a cap equal to the amount drawn under the Finance Contract) under certain circumstances (for example  in the event of a change of control or on the maturity date of the first tranche or in the event of default).

There is no assurance that EIB will exercise any or all of the warrants or that the Company will receive any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

Today  they must also be addressed through solutions reducing impacts on biodiversity and climate  and favorable to the preservation of natural ecosystems.Through its bioindustrial innovations  Fermentalg is resolutely committed to an economic development approach that respects the environment  as the signatory countries of the COP-15[1] have committed to do by 2050. Among the priorities set for the current decade are the preservation of natural and fisheries resources  better traceability  the circular economy and the valorization of co-products  as well as preventive nutrition and the agroecological transition.To address these challenges  Bpifrance wishes to promote the development of healthier  more sustainable foodstuffs that meet consumer expectations  in particular by reducing or replacing additives and processing aids from petroleum-based chemistry. It also aims to develop new sources of plant proteins produced in our territories to contribute to the food sovereignty of our country.To support innovations targeting high-growth markets and responding to major societal issues  and in a logic of sovereignty to limit dependence on protein imports  Bpifrance has awarded Fermentalg a €4.4 million grant as part of the 4th Future Investment Program (PIA) of the ""France 2030"" plan.On this occasion  Philippe Lavielle  CEO of Fermentalg  declares:""The production of microalgal biomass by fermentation offers a very large field of applications for a more responsible  safer and more functional food. This development is possible with the tremendous commitment of all economic actors and we are very proud to put our expertise in marine biology at the service of this cause  which is essential for the sustainable health of our planet and future generations.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.

When running on a 3rd gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor  the BkS450 software enables video service providers to deliver low-latency 4K and 8K video streaming services  VR content  and other bandwidth-intensive offerings at a reduced cost while consuming significantly less power than traditional video servers.""Introducing the next-gen BkS450 software to our solutions family underscores our commitment to enabling greener video streaming while ensuring a superior quality of experience for consumers at a reasonable cost "" said Nivedita Nouvel  vice president of product marketing at Broadpeak. ""Working with Intel  we have achieved a giant leap forward in video streaming performance and energy efficiency  helping our customers deliver advanced video streaming services with increased agility  a smaller hardware footprint  and a reduced impact on the environment.""The BkS450 video streaming software offers a massive improvement in performance and sustainability  which is critical as video service providers look to address growing concerns about the energy impact of video streaming. Leveraging an ultra-efficient usage of hardware resources  the BkS450 delivers video services at 725 Gbps in HTTP on servers consuming 900 Watts  reducing the power required to stream 1 Gbps by a factor of 4 compared with previous-generation video streaming solutions. Broadpeak obtained this measurement using a sophisticated benchmark tool developed in collaboration with Intel  recreating a production environment.This collaboration demonstrates the power of software optimized with Intel Xeon CPUs. The two companies will continue to work together and push the performance-per-Watt envelope toward a more sustainable future for the rapidly growing media streaming market.In addition  Broadpeak's BkS450 video streamer features a high-density design that saves crucial space in data centers. Available as a container running on off-the-shelf hardware  the BkS450 eliminates the need for operators to use proprietary components  speeding up the time to market for new video streaming services while enhancing operators' flexibility  operational efficiency  and cost savings. Furthermore  the BkS450 video streamer is future-proof  natively supporting all of the latest HTTP protocols — as well as DASH and HLS low-latency streaming formats — to ensure a flawless video streaming experience.The new caching software engine built into the BkS450 will also extract maximum performance from more modest and cost-effective hardware configurations  including existing CDN deployments. This innovation unlocks CDN capacity across the board and better uses resources. This is only the first step  as Broadpeak plans to reach even higher numbers by continuously leveraging the new capabilities made available at the hardware level in its software.More information about Broadpeak solutions can be found at https://broadpeak.tv.# # #About Broadpeak® (broadpeak.tv)Broadpeak® designs and manufactures video delivery components for content providers and network service providers deploying IPTV  cable  OTT  and mobile services.

Today  they must also be addressed through solutions reducing impacts on biodiversity and climate  and favorable to the preservation of natural ecosystems.Through its bioindustrial innovations  Fermentalg is resolutely committed to an economic development approach that respects the environment  as the signatory countries of the COP-15[1] have committed to do by 2050. Among the priorities set for the current decade are the preservation of natural and fisheries resources  better traceability  the circular economy and the valorization of co-products  as well as preventive nutrition and the agroecological transition.To address these challenges  Bpifrance wishes to promote the development of healthier  more sustainable foodstuffs that meet consumer expectations  in particular by reducing or replacing additives and processing aids from petroleum-based chemistry. It also aims to develop new sources of plant proteins produced in our territories to contribute to the food sovereignty of our country.To support innovations targeting high-growth markets and responding to major societal issues  and in a logic of sovereignty to limit dependence on protein imports  Bpifrance has awarded Fermentalg a €4.4 million grant as part of the 4th Future Investment Program (PIA) of the ""France 2030"" plan.On this occasion  Philippe Lavielle  CEO of Fermentalg  declares:""The production of microalgal biomass by fermentation offers a very large field of applications for a more responsible  safer and more functional food. This development is possible with the tremendous commitment of all economic actors and we are very proud to put our expertise in marine biology at the service of this cause  which is essential for the sustainable health of our planet and future generations.
