Proxymity's Vote Connect solution to be deployed across nine European countries  fueling further expansion of dig‚Ä¶,"LONDON  Dec. 12  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Proxymity  the leading digital investor communication platform  announced today that Clearstream has gone live with its digital proxy voting service  Vote Connect  across nine European markets. This digital proxy voting service connects issuers  intermediaries  and investors  ensuring that investor communications are delivered in real-time.Proxymity Vote Connect is the flagship digital proxy service powered by Proxymity's investor communications platform. The service includes ""issuer golden source"" meeting announcements published directly from issuers to investors. Many European markets benefit from the full end-to-end digital connectivity provided by the solution  enabling greater transparency  speed  and accuracy to the ecosystem.With Vote Connect  shareholders' votes are sent digitally to issuers or their agents in real-time and they receive digital confirmation that their votes have been cast and counted at the meeting. The inefficient and disjointed infrastructure of existing channels has seen a growing number of businesses reassess how they manage proxy voting  with Proxymity's platform increasingly seen as the solution of choice.Dean Little  CEO and Co-Founder  Proxymity  commented: ""We continue to develop our long-standing partnership with Clearstream and the Deutsche B√∂rse Group  following on from the rollout of our Shareholder ID solution earlier in the year. This is another fantastic milestone for Proxymity as we expand our market coverage  including the introduction of Vote Connect into the Baltic Markets and increasing our overall global footprint.""Sam Riley  Head of Clearstream Securities Services  added: ""At Clearstream  we always seek to optimise our clients' experience throughout the whole securities life cycle. Together with our partner Proxymity  we are seeking to provide the best in digital proxy voting solutions  driving transparency  and increasing efficiency in the European capital markets.""About SRD IISRD II aims to make it easier for issuers to engage with shareholders  especially across different countries  encouraging the use of modern technology to aid communication between companies  their shareholders  and the intermediaries between them.The European-wide legislation impacts  amongst others  companies with registered offices and shares trading in the EU and EEA. This suggests new platforms and technologies like Proxymity may not only help upgrade existing processes to meet SRD II demands but could also be the most efficient and effective means of complying with the legislation.-Notes to editors-About ProxymityProxymity connects the world's ecosystem of issuers  intermediaries  and investors digitally in real-time  bringing unprecedented transparency  efficiency  and accuracy to traditional paper-based processes. Trusted by the world's largest financial institutions  it is the leading digital investor communications platform  serving over 25 markets world-wide.

(Reuters)Microsoft Corp agreed to buy a 4% stake in London Stock Exchange Group Plc as part of a $2.8 billion cloud-computing deal that pushes big tech further into financial markets.As part of the agreement  LSEG said it will spend at least that amount on cloud services with Microsoft over the next 10 years. The partnership will speed up the migration of its markets to the cloud and allow it to develop new products and services  it said Monday.The transaction adds to a recent trend of exchanges and tech firms linking up after similar partnerships between Nasdaq Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.  as well as Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google and CME Group. It points to increased demand from investors for information that gives them an edge in increasingly fast electronic markets.Global spending on financial market data and news rose 7.4% to a record $35.6 billion in 2021  according to an April report by Burton-Taylor International Consulting.‚ÄúWe will be generating meaningful revenue growth in the coming years by accessing new products and enhancing our existing product capabilities ‚Äù LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer said in a phone interview.At Friday‚Äôs closing price  a 4% stake in LSEG was valued at around ¬£1.6 billion ($2 billion).Microsoft will buy its stake from a consortium made up of Blackstone  Thomson Reuters Corp. and affiliates of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore‚Äôs GIC  according to the statement. Thomson Reuters said in a statement it plans to use its proceeds from the transaction ‚Äúto pursue organic and inorganic opportunities in key growth segments and provide returns to shareholders.‚ÄùLSEG‚Äôs shares were up 3.2% at 11.37am in London.Minimum spendThe deal underlines LSEG‚Äôs increasing focus on data and analytics. The company completed a $27 billion purchase of Refinitiv last year  kicking off a new era where the majority of its revenues come from data. The parent company of Bloomberg News competes with Refinitiv to provide financial news  data and information.The Microsoft agreement is expected to cost LSEG between ¬£250 million to ¬£300 million between 2023 and 2025  including about ¬£100 million in capital spending.Additional spending beyond the $2.8 billion minimum depends on the ‚Äúsuccess of the strategic partnership‚Äù and demand for LSEG‚Äôs data platform and professional services  according to the UK firm. Microsoft estimated in a separate statement that the ‚Äúpartnership  and broader market opportunity  could generate an additional $5 billion in revenue for the company over the next 10 years.‚ÄùScott Guthrie  Microsoft‚Äôs executive vice president for cloud and artificial intelligence  will be appointed as a LSEG director.Data consolidationThe past few years has seen consolidation among the finance industry‚Äôs biggest data providers. Last year  S&P Global Inc. agreed to buy IHS Markit Ltd. while Deutsche Boerse  LSE‚Äôs biggest European rival  took a majority stake in Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.  the corporate-governance adviser.It‚Äôs not the first time Microsoft has struck a deal alongside unveiling a sizeable cloud deal. In 2018  it invested in Grab  with the ride-hailing firm agreeing to adopt Azure as its preferred cloud platform.These cross-selling deals don‚Äôt always end in success. In 2012  the US tech firm spent $300 million in a stake in then struggling bookseller Barnes & Noble‚Äôs e-book division Nook.As part of the deal  Barnes & Noble agreed to make e-reading content for Microsoft. Two years later  Barnes & Noble bought out Microsoft‚Äôs stake for about $125 million  after Nook struggled to win over customers.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.04,0.12,0.83,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange Group', 'cloud deal', 'Microsoft', 'LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer', 'Canada Pension Plan Investment Board', 'London Stock Exchange Group Plc', 'S&P Global Inc.', 'Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.', 'executive vice president', 'Union Flag umbrella', 'Amazon.com Inc.', 'existing product capabilities', 'key growth segments', 'broader market opportunity', 'IHS Markit Ltd.', 'biggest European rival', 'fast electronic markets', 'meaningful revenue growth', 'biggest data providers', 'US tech firm', 'preferred cloud platform', 'financial market data', '$2.8 billion cloud-computing deal', 'Thomson Reuters Corp.', 'sizeable cloud deal', 'CME Group', 'Nasdaq Inc.', 'Alphabet Inc', 'Global spending', 'big tech', 'data platform', 'financial markets', '$27 billion purchase', '$2.8 billion minimum', 'UK firm', 'ride-hailing firm', 'cloud services', 'professional services', 'new products', 'recent trend', 'similar partnerships', 'April report', 'phone interview', 'closing price', 'inorganic opportunities', 'Minimum spend', 'increasing focus', 'new era', 'financial news', 'capital spending', 'Additional spending', 'Scott Guthrie', 'artificial intelligence', 'finance industry', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'corporate-governance adviser', 'first time', 'cross-selling deals', 'book division', 'reading content', 'next 10 years', 'coming years', 'LSEG director', 'Microsoft Corp', 'Bloomberg News', 'Data consolidation', 'parent company', 'strategic partnership', 'separate statement', 'Microsoft agreement', 'majority stake', '4% stake', 'PHOTO', 'worker', 'rain', 'Britain', 'amount', 'migration', 'transaction', 'exchanges', 'firms', 'Google', 'demand', 'investors', 'information', 'edge', 'record', 'Friday', 'consortium', 'Blackstone', 'affiliates', 'Singapore', 'proceeds', 'returns', 'shareholders', 'shares', 'analytics', 'Refinitiv', 'revenues', 'The', 'success', 'past', 'Grab', 'Azure', 'bookseller', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'Nook', 'customers', '11.']",2022-12-12,2022-12-13,bangkokpost.com

14616,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4563877-abc-arbitrage-stock-intriguing-hedge-viel-better-option,ABC Arbitrage: Intriguing Hedge  But Viel Is A Better Option (OTCMKTS:ABCCF),ABC Arbitrage (ABCCF) is a French small-cap company that engages in arbitrage strategies in financial markets. See why I'm neutral on the stock.,"metamorworks/iStock via Getty ImagesABC Arbitrage: ticker ABCA.PA (Euronext Paris)Market cap: ‚Ç¨380M ($400M)A few years ago  I introduced ABC Arbitrage (ABCA.PA  OTCPK:ABCCF)  a small-cap French stock with a very specific business model: arbitrage strategies  whereby the company takes advantage of mispriced assets in financial markets. These trading strategies thrive in times of elevated volatility  meaning that ABC Arbitrage performs especially well in downturns.The company's performance has been satisfactory  but not outstanding  in my opinion. It offers a generous dividend of about 6%  but this yield comes with a high payout ratio. With the stock too expensive for my liking  I prefer another Paris-listed stock  Viel & Cie (VIL.PA)  which also benefits from volatility. Viel's steady performance and undemanding valuation make it an excellent choice for income investors.Not all retail investors will have access to ABC Arbitrage or Viel  given that the stocks only trade on Euronext Paris (the OTC ticker ABCCF for ABC Arbitrage has very little liquidity). For those seeking exposure to larger companies in the long volatility niche  let me mention Virtu (VIRT)  Flow Traders (OTCPK:FLTDF) and BGC Partners (BGCP). A thorough analysis of Virtu can be found here.ABC Arbitrage: Making Money Out Of Market VolatilityABC Arbitrage was founded in 1995. It is headquartered in Paris  France  and also has offices in Dublin and Singapore. The company defines itself as a quantitative asset manager. It deploys a variety of arbitrage strategies  using both managed money and its own equity.These trading strategies can be broken down into four categories  per the company's website :Liquidity arbitrage: detecting and correcting differences in trading prices between linked assets.Risk arbitrage: taking advantage of risk mispricing in capital markets.Statistical arbitrage: pair-trading within an industry  lead-lag effects (e.g. interaction between commodity prices and inflation).Derivatives arbitrage: detecting mispricing in options and other derivatives.ABC Arbitrage has a successful track record  having generated 27 consecutive profitable years  with a ROE (Return on Equity) in excess of 10%. These results have convinced institutional clients to entrust the company with their funds  to the tune of ‚Ç¨350M. In total  including its own equity  ABC Arbitrage manages around ‚Ç¨500M - a rather small amount  but enough for the company to fund its arbitrage operations (some of which couldn't be scaled up anyway).H1 '22 presentationThe main driver of the company's performance  unsurprisingly  is volatility. Volatility  in fact  increases trading activity (velocity) and creates price dislocations that arbitrage strategies can exploit. The table below shows various drivers and their typical impact on ABC Arbitrage's financial performance.H1 '22 presentationAfter muted volatility levels for most of the 2010s  including some ""no life"" years  as the company calls them  the Covid crisis finally woke up financial markets.H1 '22 presentationThis resulted in strong financial performance for ABC Arbitrage in 2020  and  to a lesser extent  in 2021 and 2022 YTD. The record results of 2008  during the Great Recession  are further proof of volatility's impact on ABC Arbitrage.H1 '22 presentationNote: 2022A above is just an extrapolation of H1 performance  the actual yearly results of course remain unknown.ABC Arbitrage : A Generous Dividend Policy  But A High Payout RatioBased on its track record  ABC Arbitrage is seen to be a decent portfolio hedge  which tends to do especially well in periods when many stocks underperform. Financial performance in the first half of 2022 was satisfactory  though one might have expected the company to capitalize even more on the volatility generated by the war in Ukraine  and by the monetary tightening from central banks.H1 '22 results press releaseCentral banks' behavior  in fact  makes the company's management hopeful that markets in the 2020s will be more favorable for arbitrage strategies than the previous decade: ""The year 2022 seems to outline the end of the central bank paradigm established since 2012"".What about the distributions? The dividend history suggests a rather generous dividend payer  with a yield generally around 6% in the past couple of years. For 2022  based on the expected ‚Ç¨0.40/share dividend (‚Ç¨0.1 quarterly)  the yield is 6.25% at the current share price of ‚Ç¨6.40.Investors need to be aware  though  that ABC Arbitrage has a high payout ratio. In 2021 and 2020  it was around 80%. During the volatility lull of 2017-2019  the payout ratio exceeded 100% of earnings  and the distributions were made in part as return of capital to shareholders.abc-arbitrage.comABC Arbitrage is a good company with an original business model that it masters well  but at the end of the day  I make my decisions based on valuation. At a trailing P/E of 13  ABC Arbitrage is not cheap for a French small cap. Many European blue chips trade at multiples lower than this. I don't consider this valuation attractive enough for me to buy ABC Arbitrage's stock at this point  even if I used to have some in my portfolio a few years back.Instead  I prefer another French small cap stock that offers the same kind of disconnect from the economic cycle and positive exposure to volatility. This stock is Viel & Cie (VIL.PA).My Favorite Volatility Pick: Viel & CieViel  which also trades on Euronext Paris  is a holding company whose main asset is a controlling stake in Compagnie Financi√®re Tradition (SW:CFT  OTCPK:CFNCF)  a Swiss entity that is one of the top 3 interdealer brokers in the world. Tradition operates across many asset classes:Tradition's H1 '22 presentationI will not detail here the thesis supporting an investment in Viel  but readers can refer to my earlier article : Tradition: How To Get This Swiss Inter-Dealer Broker On The Cheap. In short  I like Viel for 3 reasons:Tradition performs well in volatile times  thus fulfilling the same function as ABC Arbitrage  Virtu  Flow Traders and peer BGC Partners  as a portfolio hedge.Viel enables investors to buy Tradition at a steep discount  thanks to the holding company discount.The other holdings of Viel  though minor compared to Tradition  perform well too.On the back on Tradition's strong performance in H1 '22  Viel posted excellent interim results. Net profit was ‚Ç¨42M for the half-year (Group share).Viel's H1 '22 earningsFurthermore  when compared to other volatility plays  Viel gets an additional  direct  favorable impact from higher interest rates:A shift in central-bank monetary policy  away from quantitative easing and rate hikes  was beneficial for the Group‚Äôs operations. This positive trend was reflected in all regions  and particularly in foreign exchange and interest rate products and securities and security derivatives. Source: Tradition's earnings releaseThis bodes well for Viel in the coming quarters  even if volatility itself abates. For the full year 2022  even if we assume a conservative net profit (Group share) of ‚Ç¨60M  Viel's shares are currently trading at a cheap P/E of 7 (based on the market cap of ‚Ç¨420M). To be honest  I expect the company to do even better than this  given the strong Q3 '22 revenue announced by Tradition.In terms of distributions  Viel has paid a growing dividend in recent years  and offers a 5% yield based on the 2021 distribution. What's key is the low payout ratio of only 35%. Finally  I like the fact that the number of shares has been going down in recent years thanks to buybacks being performed at an attractive share price.TakeawayABC Arbitrage and Viel share some common performance drivers  above all the level of volatility in financial markets. They trade on the same exchange  have more or less the same market cap  and their dividend yields are pretty similar.However  their valuations differ greatly. I like to look at my stocks through the prism of earnings yield: at a P/E of 7  Viel's earnings yield is ~14% (1/7). In the case of ABC Arbitrage  it is 1/13  meaning less than 8%. This is why Viel is by far my preferred option when it comes to small-cap stocks bringing something different to the portfolio.",positive,0.91,0.02,0.07,mixed,0.29,0.06,0.65,True,English,"['ABC Arbitrage', 'Intriguing Hedge', 'Better Option', 'Viel', 'ABCCF', 'Many European blue chips', ""H1 '22 results press release"", 'specific business model', 'quantitative asset manager', 'decent portfolio hedge', 'original business model', 'central bank paradigm', 'high payout ratio', 'actual yearly results', 'current share price', 'Generous Dividend Policy', ""Central banks' behavior"", 'generous dividend payer', 'small-cap French stock', '27 consecutive profitable years', 'French small cap', 'successful track record', 'long volatility niche', 'strong financial performance', 'OTC ticker ABCCF', 'record results', 'Market cap', 'small amount', 'price dislocations', 'many stocks', '‚Ç¨0.40/share dividend', ""H1 '22 presentation"", 'H1 performance', 'Getty Images', 'mispriced assets', 'Paris-listed stock', 'undemanding valuation', 'excellent choice', 'little liquidity', 'larger companies', 'Flow Traders', 'BGC Partners', 'thorough analysis', 'four categories', 'trading prices', 'linked assets', 'commodity prices', 'other derivatives', 'institutional clients', 'main driver', 'trading activity', 'various drivers', 'life"" years', 'Covid crisis', 'lesser extent', 'Great Recession', 'first half', 'monetary tightening', 'previous decade', 'past couple', 'trailing P/E', 'ABC Arbitrage', 'Liquidity arbitrage', 'Risk arbitrage', 'Statistical arbitrage', 'Derivatives arbitrage', 'financial markets', 'steady performance', 'Euronext Paris', 'income investors', 'retail investors', 'elevated volatility', 'Market Volatility', 'volatility levels', 'volatility lull', 'OTCPK:FLTDF', 'risk mispricing', 'typical impact', 'trading strategies', 'VIL.PA', 'capital markets', 'good company', 'ABCA', 'advantage', 'times', 'downturns', 'opinion', 'yield', 'liking', 'Viel', 'Cie', 'access', 'exposure', 'Virtu', 'BGCP', 'Money', 'France', 'offices', 'Dublin', 'Singapore', 'variety', 'managed', 'equity', 'website', 'differences', 'industry', 'interaction', 'inflation', 'options', 'ROE', 'Return', 'excess', 'funds', 'tune', 'operations', 'fact', 'velocity', '2010s', '2022 YTD.', 'proof', 'Note', 'extrapolation', 'course', 'periods', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'management', '2020s', 'distributions', 'history', 'earnings', 'shareholders', 'day', 'decisions', 'multiples']",2022-12-12,2022-12-13,seekingalpha.com

Based on this premise  the R√©my Cointreau Group (Paris:RCO) has been working for several years now on its ‚ÄúOne Bottle for Eternity‚Äù project  which aims to increase the circularity of the Group‚Äôs bottles and thus significantly reduce the emissions associated with glass production.The Group is delighted to announce the launch of three pilots to be conducted by its brands  to explore different circularity formats:The Mount Gay brand is testing a deposit system in Barbados  its island of origin and production. The empty bottles are collected  cleaned and refilled. The brand hopes to reuse 30-40% of all bottles sold locally  with an estimated 60% CO2 saving per bottle.The Cointreau and Mount Gay brands have announced a partnership with ecoSPIRITS in the UK to promote greater circularity in the on-trade. The 4.5 litre ecoTOTES will be deployed in selected London bars  restaurants and hotels and then collected  cleaned and refilled locally. This pilot programme aims to achieve a 30-50% reduction in backroom storage and a 95% reduction in daily glass and cardboard waste in the participating locations. With this launch  Cointreau is becoming the first international liqueur to partner with ecoSPIRITS  and R√©my Cointreau  the first spirits Group in the UK.Finally  true to its vision of always being ahead of its time  the LOUIS XIII brand is continuing its quest for ‚ÄúThe Sustainable Exception‚Äù  which is at the heart of the values dear to the House of R√©my Martin. LOUIS XIII THE INFINITY WHEEL now offers the opportunity to refill its decanter an unlimited number of times in LOUIS XIII boutiques. The ceremony is personalised  and the life of the decanter is extended indefinitely.These actions are part of a global approach to sobriety and circularity  and support the commitments of the Group's CSR transformation roadmap  The Sustainable Exception. As part of the plan  R√©my Cointreau aims to reduce its carbon emissions per bottle by 50% by 2030 and to achieve Net Zero by 2050.R√©my Cointreau‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer  Eric Vallat  said: ‚ÄúGroup‚Äôs objective is clear: we want to reduce our carbon emissions per bottle from 2kg to 1kg by 2030. In order to achieve this  rethinking our glass bottles through an active eco-design approach and increasing their circularity in different formats are key levers. These circular initiatives mark the beginning of a collective journey  undertaken hand-in-hand with our stakeholders  from our glassmakers to our clients!‚ÄùAbout R√©my CointreauThere are clients all over the world seeking exceptional experiences ‚Äì clients who know that a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavours.

Among the priorities set for the current decade are the preservation of natural and fisheries resources  better traceability  the circular economy and the valorization of co-products  as well as preventive nutrition and the agroecological transition.To address these challenges  Bpifrance wishes to promote the development of healthier  more sustainable foodstuffs that meet consumer expectations  in particular by reducing or replacing additives and processing aids from petroleum-based chemistry. It also aims to develop new sources of plant proteins produced in our territories to contribute to the food sovereignty of our country.To support innovations targeting high-growth markets and responding to major societal issues  and in a logic of sovereignty to limit dependence on protein imports  Bpifrance has awarded Fermentalg a ‚Ç¨4.4 million grant as part of the 4th Future Investment Program (PIA) of the ""France 2030"" plan.On this occasion  Philippe Lavielle  CEO of Fermentalg  declares:""The production of microalgal biomass by fermentation offers a very large field of applications for a more responsible  safer and more functional food. This development is possible with the tremendous commitment of all economic actors and we are very proud to put our expertise in marine biology at the service of this cause  which is essential for the sustainable health of our planet and future generations.

One of the world's largest financial clearing houses collaborating with the majority of the 50 largest banks worldwide  informed investors about its decision last week ,"Starting January 2023  Euroclear will reportedly no longer support trades of cannabis stocks.One of the world's largest financial clearing houses collaborating with the majority of the 50 largest banks worldwide  informed investors about its decision last week  reported BusinessCann.UK investors who have a stake in North American companies such as Tilray Brands  Inc (NASDAQ:TLRY)  Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL)  Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ:CGC) (TSX:WEED)  and Mind Medicine (NASDAQ:MNMD)  to name a few  and ETFs were told that they would 'no longer be able to trade or hold' these shares from January 27.""Euroclear  a custodian that we and a number of UK stockbrokers use  have announced they will no longer support the international cannabis-related stock "" the email stated. ""They are making this change following a review of all international cannabis-related stocks in which they decided they no longer meet the admission criteria to trade.""Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) was the first to tell customers it would no longer execute transactions in shares of cannabis companies with US operations  followed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (NYSE:JPM) similar move last year  reported Reuters. The banking giant told its prime brokerage clients in November 2021 that it will no longer allow them to buy stocks in US cannabis companies that have a ""direct nexus to marijuana-related activities"" and are not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange  the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange.Why?Cannabis continues to be an issue for banks and other financial institutions due to its illegal status at the federal level. Moreover  the lack of access to traditional banking services continues to make trading firms leery of handling transactions involving cannabis stocks.To that end  hopes were high that the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2021 (SAFE Banking Act)  expungements and other marijuana reform legislation would pass last week as part of the NDAA and end up on President Biden's desk during this lame-duck session. However  that didn't happen.What's Next?UK investors who reported receiving emails from their stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown about the changes last week now have a few options.They can either do nothing and let Hargreaves Lansdown sell the shares on their behalf; sell their own shares up until market close on January 26  or transfer their holdings to another provider.Photo: Courtesy of Nicholas Cappello on Unsplash",neutral,0.11,0.45,0.43,negative,0.04,0.12,0.84,True,English,"['Financial Giant', 'Cannabis Stocks', 'Credit Suisse Group AG', 'other marijuana reform legislation', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'largest financial clearing houses', 'Fair Enforcement Banking Act', 'other financial institutions', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'SAFE Banking Act', 'international cannabis-related stock', 'Canopy Growth Corporation', 'prime brokerage clients', 'traditional banking services', 'North American companies', 'Nasdaq Stock Exchange', 'stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown', 'US cannabis companies', 'banking giant', '50 largest banks', 'US operations', 'cannabis stocks', 'Tilray Brands', 'Sundial Growers', 'TSX:WEED', 'Mind Medicine', 'UK stockbrokers', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'similar move', 'direct nexus', 'marijuana-related activities', 'illegal status', 'federal level', 'trading firms', 'President Biden', 'lame-duck session', 'Nicholas Cappello', 'NASDAQ:TLRY', 'NASDAQ:CGC', 'UK investors', 'January', 'Euroclear', 'trades', 'world', 'majority', 'decision', 'BusinessCann', 'stake', 'Inc', 'SNDL', 'MNMD', 'ETFs', 'shares', 'custodian', 'number', 'email', 'review', 'criteria', 'CS', 'customers', 'transactions', 'Co.', 'Reuters', 'November', 'issue', 'lack', 'access', 'end', 'hopes', 'Secure', 'expungements', 'part', 'NDAA', 'desk', 'changes', 'options', 'behalf', 'market', 'holdings', 'provider', 'Photo', 'Courtesy', 'Unsplash']",2022-12-13,2022-12-13,markets.businessinsider.com

Featured...,"Proxymity's Vote Connect solution to be deployed across nine European countries  fueling further expansion of digital proxy voting in the region.Featured Image for ProxymityFeatured Image for ProxymityLONDON  Dec. 12  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Proxymity  the leading digital investor communication platform  announced today that Clearstream has gone live with its digital proxy voting service  Vote Connect  across nine European markets.

The inefficient and disjointed infrastructure of existing channels has seen a growing number of businesses reassess how they manage proxy voting  with Proxymity's platform increasingly seen as the solution of choice.Dean Little  CEO and Co-Founder  Proxymity  commented: ""We continue to develop our long-standing partnership with Clearstream and the Deutsche B√∂rse Group  following on from the rollout of our Shareholder ID solution earlier in the year.

STAHL‚Äôs explosion protection products continued to grow in the fourth quarter after gaining significant momentum in the third quarter.

14719,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/world/microsoft-takes-stake-in-london-stock-exchange-operator-42213346.html,Microsoft takes stake in London Stock Exchange operator,Microsoft has agreed to buy a stake in the London Stock Exchange Group Plc that will give the software company a 4pc equity holding  a deal that underlines the pivotal position data  analytics and technology play in increasingly computerized financial markets‚Ä¶,"Microsoft has agreed to buy a stake in the London Stock Exchange Group Plc that will give the software company a 4pc equity holding  a deal that underlines the pivotal position data  analytics and technology play in increasingly computerized financial markets. Microsoft will acquire the shares as part of a new long-term strategic partnership that will see it provide cloud computing services to the exchange  LSEG said in a statement on Monday. At Friday's closing price  a 4pc stake in the bourse was valued at around ¬£1.6bn (‚Ç¨1.85bn). The stake is part of a broader  10-year agreement to help the London Stock Exchange owner improve its data analytics and cloud infrastructure using Microsoft's products. Scott Guthrie  Microsoft's executive vice president for cloud and artificial intelligence  will be appointed as a director. The agreement is the latest sign of surging demand from investors for information that gives them an edge in increasingly fast electronic markets. Global spending on financial market data and news rose 7.4pc to a record $35.6bn in 2021  according to an April report by Burton-Taylor International Consulting. ""We will be generating meaningful revenue growth in the coming years by accessing new products and enhancing our existing product capabilities "" LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer said in a phone interview. Microsoft will buy its stake from a consortium made up of Blackstone  Thomson Reuters Corp. and affiliates of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore's GIC  according to the statement. Shares in LSEG rose 3.8pc at 10:01 a.m. in London. The deal underlines LSEG's increasing focus on data and analytics. The company completed a $27bn purchase of Refinitiv last year  kicking off a new era where the majority of its revenues come from data. The parent company of Bloomberg News competes with Refinitiv to provide financial news  data and information. The agreement is expected to cost LSEG between ¬£250m to ¬£300 million between 2023 and 2025  including about ¬£100 million in capital spending. The group said it has made a contractual commitment with Microsoft to spend a minimum of $2.8bn on cloud-related services and support over the next 10 years. Additional spending depends on the ""success of the strategic partnership"" and demand for LSEG's data platform and professional services  according to the UK firm. Microsoft estimated in a separate statement that the ""partnership  and broader market opportunity  could generate an additional $5 billion in revenue for the company over the next 10 years."" Azure Platform Under the arrangement  LSEG's data platform and other key technology infrastructure will migrate to Microsoft's Azure cloud environment while its data and analytics will interface with certain Microsoft applications. The past few years has seen consolidation among the finance industry's biggest data providers. Last year  S&P Global Inc agreed to buy IHS Markit Ltd. while Deutsche Boerse  LSE's biggest European rival  took a majority stake in Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.  the corporate-governance adviser. It's not the first time Microsoft has struck a deal alongside unveiling a sizeable cloud deal. In 2018  it invested in Grab  with the ride-hailing firm agreeing to adopt Azure as its preferred cloud platform. These cross-selling deals don't always end in success. In 2012  the US tech firm spent $300m in a stake in then struggling bookseller Barnes & Noble's e-book division Nook. As part of the deal  Barnes & Noble agreed to make e-reading content for Microsoft. Two years later  Barnes & Noble bought out Microsoft's stake for about $125m  after Nook struggled to win over customers.

(NASDAQ: PRAX)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  and UCB (EURONEXT BRUSSELS: UCB)  a global biopharmaceutical company  today announced a strategic collaboration  based upon Praxis‚Äô PRAX-020 program  for the discovery of small molecule therapeutics as potential treatments of KCNT1 related epilepsies.‚ÄúWe are excited to partner with UCB  a global leader in epilepsy drug development  as we work together toward a novel approach for the treatment of KCNT1 related epilepsy  which has no approved therapies currently ‚Äù said Marcio Souza  president and chief executive officer of Praxis. ‚ÄúOur internal research efforts give us confidence that small molecules can selectively inhibit the KCNT1 channel  and potentially could be an effective treatment for individuals suffering from KCNT1 related epilepsy. The collaboration with UCB validates this approach and will allow us to accelerate efforts toward a potential treatment for KCNT1 patients.‚ÄùUnder the terms of the collaboration  UCB retains an exclusive option to in-license global development and commercialization rights to any resulting KCNT1 small molecule development candidate. Praxis will receive an upfront payment from UCB  and if the option is exercised by UCB  would be eligible to receive an option fee and future success-based development and commercialization milestone payments  for a total of up to approximately $100 million  in addition to tiered royalties on net sales of any resulting products from the collaboration. Further financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.‚ÄúUCB is dedicated to the discovery and development of treatments for epilepsy  including rare and genetic epilepsies  with an ambition to develop solutions that move from symptomatic relief to those that could address the root causes of disease ‚Äù said Dhaval Patel  chief scientific officer of UCB. ‚ÄúPraxis‚Äô genetics-driven approach has led to compelling preclinical proof of concept  and we look forward to progressing this novel research program together for the benefit of individuals and families affected by this devastating form of epilepsy.‚ÄùStory continuesAbout PraxisPraxis Precision Medicines is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for CNS disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance. Praxis is applying insights from genetic epilepsies to both rare and more prevalent neurological disorders  using our understanding of shared biological targets and circuits in the brain.

Quadient therefore confirms that there are now four international carriers that will be actively using Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers for their last and first mile deliveries  since the launch of the roll out of a UK open network announced in June. Global parcel delivery experts DPD UK and DHL have been the first carriers officially confirming their commitment to Quadient‚Äôs open network. The names of the two other international carriers will be confirmed in due course  as they make the new service available to their customers.The addition of a fourth international carrier to use Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers further demonstrates the relevance of Quadient‚Äôs open business model with delivery points available to all carriers  offering consumers more choice and convenience for parcel delivery and returns. According to consulting company Apex Insight1  the final mile is also the most expensive part of the e-commerce fulfilment chain  representing an average of close to 50% of the overall cost of delivering a parcel. Out-of-home delivery options help reduce these costs  improve overall delivery success rates and achieve better customer satisfaction and retention.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  commented: ‚ÄúI am pleased to see such rapid adoption of our open parcel locker network in the UK by main international players. With now four global carriers having committed to add our Parcel Pending by Quadient parcel lockers in their delivery options  we are confident that our open and agnostic approach to parcel locker delivery in the UK has become a key component both for first and last mile delivery. Whether it is for cost optimization  24/7 availability or reducing fuel usage and CO2 emissions  the early and wide adoption of parcel locker solutions for first and last mile delivery confirms the relevance of our offer as a key differentiator in a growing e-commerce market.‚ÄùQuadient‚Äôs parcel locker ambition in the UK market is to reach 5 000 locations in the coming years. As usage for the more than 150 lockers already installed is ramping up in the light of year-end peak season  the pace of installations is set to accelerate significantly in 2023 to reach c. 200 new locations per month.Quadient continues to look to develop the adoption of its network and expects to announce additional users in the UK  whether carriers or retailers in the coming months. Globally  Quadient now operates more than 17 300 units in major e-commerce markets such as Canada  France  Japan  UK and USA.About Quadient¬ÆQuadient is the driving force behind the world‚Äôs most meaningful customer experiences.

The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 50x106 (DL1)  110x106 (DL2) and 250x106 (DL3). As of 8 November 2022  9 patients were enrolled; baseline and safety data for 8 patients were available (n=4 at DL1; n=4 at DL2). 7 patients reached the follow-up period of 28-days and were eligible for efficacy evaluation.The initial results from 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy evaluation (cut-off date: 8 November 2022) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 86% observed and all responding patients achieving a complete response (CR). A duration of response of up to 7 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Two patients who received DL1 that progressed after initial stable disease or CR respectively  had a CD19-negative escape. No CD19-positive relapses have been observed.In the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. No grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was observed in any of the patients. At DL2  CRS grade 1 or 2 was reported in 4 patients and ICANS grade 1 was reported in 3 patients. Patients at DL1 did not experience any grade of CRS or ICANS. Dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenia grade 4 for >21 days) was observed in 1 patient (DL2) and the majority of grade ‚â•3 adverse events were hematological toxicities.‚ÄúWe are committed to accelerating transformational innovation to address unmet needs of patients with advanced cancers ‚Äù said Dr. Paul Stoffels1  CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Galapagos. ‚ÄúDespite significant medical advancements in recent years  many cancer patients relapse  become resistant to treatment or are diagnosed too late. We believe that differentiation and broader access to therapy can come from a disruptive CAR-T manufacturing model at the point-of-care  closer to patients. We are excited to present initial encouraging safety  efficacy and feasibility data from the ATALANTA-1 study with GLPG5101 manufactured at point-of-care  which support that potential. We are on track to report topline data from the completed study in the first half of 2023.‚ÄùThe poster presentation was given by Marie Jos√© Kersten  MD  PhD  Professor of Hematology and Head of the Department of Hematology at the Academic Center in Amsterdam:Abstract Title Authors Presentation date/time Initial Clinical Results of ATALANTA-1  a Phase 1/2 Trial of Point-of-Care Manufactured GLPG5101 (19CP02) in rrNHL S√©bastien Anguille  Ilse Kuipers  Kirsten Saevels  Yves Beguin  Anna Van Muyden  Christian Jacques  and Marie Jos√© Kersten Poster Number: 4637Date: 12 December 2022  6:00‚Äì8:00 PM ETSession: 704. Cellular Immunotherapies: Early Phase and Investigational Therapies: Poster IIICellPoint has developed  in a strategic collaboration with Lonza  a novel point-of-care supply model  which is designed to enable clinicians to administer fresh CAR T cells within 7 days of leukapheresis  without complex logistics or cryopreservation  thereby aiming to address important limitations of current CAR-T treatments. The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint‚Äôs end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software and Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies.About the ATALANTA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003272-13)ATALANTA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5101  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (rrNHL). GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as an intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101. The planned dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 are 50x106  110x106 and 250x106 CAR T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) while the secondary objectives include complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing. The study is currently enrolling rrNHL patients in Europe and the first expansion cohort for Mantle Cell Lymphoma  a form of NHL  is currently open for recruitment. The company aims to broaden the study to include US patients in 2023 and to provide topline results in the first half of 2023.About Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs LymphomaNon-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma is a cancer originating from lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell which is part of the body‚Äôs immune system. Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85 percent of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas depend on the stage and type of disease.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

Eutelsat‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer Eva Berneke and Jean-Fran√ßois Cazenave  TSF's Chairman  met at Eutelsat's headquarters to set out further initiatives to be conducted as part of this close collaborative relationship.TSF with missions in more than 70 countriesT√©l√©coms Sans Fronti√®res is a non-governmental organisation headquartered in Pau  France  with two regional sites in Asia and South America. Its role is to bring back connectivity and raise awareness and protect communities in various emergency situations by providing them with advanced technological solutions for communication and access to information.With their unique deployment capacity  TSF's teams can be operational in any part of the world within 24 hours of being notified of a humanitarian crisis situation.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYNovember was a strong month for Volta with a performance of +6.3%.It is mainly due to the solid performance of Volta‚Äôs CLO Equity positions  especially European ones  catching-up following months of underperformances but it is also due to better-than-expected recoveries on specific distressed names held in Volta‚Äôs loan funds.Diving into Volta‚Äôs underlying sub asset classes  monthly performances** were as follow: +1.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +7.2% for CLO Equity tranches (+16.8% for European CLO Equity tranches); +2.5% for CLO Debt tranches; and +44.4% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund‚Äôs NAV).November is usually a relatively quiet month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. Volta received in November the equivalent of ‚Ç¨2.1m in terms of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received ‚Ç¨23.9m of interests and coupons. A 21.8% annualized cash flow to NAV.Over the month  we purchased a European CLO Equity position (‚Ç¨2m nominal  purchased at 56%) with a projected yield in the 24% context (under reasonable assumptions).There are still slightly more downgrades than upgrades in both the US and the European loan markets  although at a very moderate pace. In terms of default rates  we have been  for the-last-12-month measure  at 0.4% default rate for European loans and 0.7% for US loans. After the invasion of Ukraine  rating agencies were forecasting 2022 default rates to be between 2% and 2.5% for the US and European loan markets. We are one month from the end of the year and still far from such levels.Story continuesRating agencies currently forecast default rates between 4% and 5.5% for 2023. Our default rates view for 2023 still lands in the 2% to 3% area for both US and European loans.Such kind of default pattern should not materially impact the distribution of interests of Volta‚Äôs assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.Despite being relatively constructive and convinced that  at current prices  there is a lot of long-term value in Volta portfolio  we believe the recession that everybody expect in 2023 might be more pronounced that what we have in mind. We decided to hedge part of this risk by adding some overlay in terms of duration. We built some positions recently and Volta is long duration on a 4 years Euro swap for the equivalent of 0.8 years of duration (at 2.85% yield level) and long T-notes at roughly 3.9% yield level for circa 2 years of duration.The idea here is to consider that if we are wrong on the fundamental scenario and if things get worse than our current anticipations  rates will very likely decrease  generating positive performances on our duration overlay positions. At the time of writing this comment we have a mark-to-market gain in the 0.6% area.As at the end of November 2022  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨219.8m or ‚Ç¨6.01 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.9% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 6.3% as at 31 October 2022  0.6% was at 30 September 2022.** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 50x106 (DL1)  110x106 (DL2) and 250x106 (DL3). As of 8 November 2022  9 patients were enrolled; baseline and safety data for 8 patients were available (n=4 at DL1; n=4 at DL2). 7 patients reached the follow-up period of 28-days and were eligible for efficacy evaluation.The initial results from 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy evaluation (cut-off date: 8 November 2022) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 86% observed and all responding patients achieving a complete response (CR). A duration of response of up to 7 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Two patients who received DL1 that progressed after initial stable disease or CR respectively  had a CD19-negative escape. No CD19-positive relapses have been observed.Story continuesIn the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. No grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was observed in any of the patients. At DL2  CRS grade 1 or 2 was reported in 4 patients and ICANS grade 1 was reported in 3 patients. Patients at DL1 did not experience any grade of CRS or ICANS. Dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenia grade 4 for >21 days) was observed in 1 patient (DL2) and the majority of grade ‚â•3 adverse events were hematological toxicities.‚ÄúWe are committed to accelerating transformational innovation to address unmet needs of patients with advanced cancers ‚Äù said Dr. Paul Stoffels1  CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Galapagos. ‚ÄúDespite significant medical advancements in recent years  many cancer patients relapse  become resistant to treatment or are diagnosed too late. We believe that differentiation and broader access to therapy can come from a disruptive CAR-T manufacturing model at the point-of-care  closer to patients. We are excited to present initial encouraging safety  efficacy and feasibility data from the ATALANTA-1 study with GLPG5101 manufactured at point-of-care  which support that potential. We are on track to report topline data from the completed study in the first half of 2023.‚ÄùThe poster presentation was given by Marie Jos√© Kersten  MD  PhD  Professor of Hematology and Head of the Department of Hematology at the Academic Center in Amsterdam:Abstract Title Authors Presentation date/time Initial Clinical Results of ATALANTA-1  a Phase 1/2 Trial of Point-of-Care Manufactured GLPG5101 (19CP02) in rrNHL S√©bastien Anguille  Ilse Kuipers  Kirsten Saevels  Yves Beguin  Anna Van Muyden  Christian Jacques  and Marie Jos√© Kersten Poster Number: 4637Date: 12 December 2022  6:00‚Äì8:00 PM ETSession: 704. Cellular Immunotherapies: Early Phase and Investigational Therapies: Poster IIICellPoint has developed  in a strategic collaboration with Lonza  a novel point-of-care supply model  which is designed to enable clinicians to administer fresh CAR T cells within 7 days of leukapheresis  without complex logistics or cryopreservation  thereby aiming to address important limitations of current CAR-T treatments. The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint‚Äôs end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software and Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies.About the ATALANTA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003272-13)ATALANTA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5101  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (rrNHL). GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as an intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101. The planned dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 are 50x106  110x106 and 250x106 CAR T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) while the secondary objectives include complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing. The study is currently enrolling rrNHL patients in Europe and the first expansion cohort for Mantle Cell Lymphoma  a form of NHL  is currently open for recruitment. The company aims to broaden the study to include US patients in 2023 and to provide topline results in the first half of 2023.About Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs LymphomaNon-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma is a cancer originating from lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell which is part of the body‚Äôs immune system. Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85 percent of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas depend on the stage and type of disease.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

Better earnings will stem from LSEG apps being available on Microsoft platforms such as Teams  opening up new opportunities globally.The deal is intended to enhance the LSEG-Refinitiv competitiveness with Bloomberg  including better messaging services.There is a significant contrast to be drawn. Euronext continues to be focused on tying up Europe alone. The LSEG will aim its Refinitiv  cloud and other data services on Europe  across the Atlantic and the rest of the planet.China syndromeOne has to question how thoroughly Grant Shapps and the Department for Business scrutinised the ¬£10billion bid by France‚Äôs Schneider for UK software pioneer Aveva under the terms of the National Security and Investment Act.As reporting by my colleague Mark Shapland has established  the bond between Beijing and Schneider boss Jean-Pascal Tricoire is far from casual.When this column suggested that selling the 40 per cent minority in Aveva to Schneider might lead to tech-transfer to Beijing  it elicited this response from the French company‚Äôs advisers: ‚ÄòOn China  the joint venture that you have mentioned a couple of times makes basic low voltage products ‚Äì it is not a digital business and there is no IP sharing.It works in China for Chinese customers  and exports very little. It is not part of Aveva‚Äôs industrial software business.‚ÄôMaybe. But  as those who have worked closely with Beijing know  among the main reasons why China is anxious to do business with the West is to gain access to advanced technology.Under Tricoire‚Äôs leadership  Schneider turned itself into a China-focused digital systems champion. He helped to do this by moving to Hong Kong and befriending Chinese elites.The FT has reported that the French firm sought to line itself-up against President Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts (still US policy) to distance itself from trade with China.It may be just about tolerable for the UK to accept French command and control over software. However  to allow China access to vital technologies  via Schneider  is unconscionable and flies in the face of Tory government dogma.Law fareBy the snails-pace standards of financial justice  the ¬£10million fine levied on Metro Bank for misrepresenting the risk in its commercial lending portfolios in 2019 must be considered swift.The incorrect weightings  which resulted in a share prices collapse and the departure of flamboyant founder and chairman Vernon Hill  was first reported on these pages.Former top executives Craig Donaldson and David Arden have also been fined for their knowing involvement in the breach. They are appealing against the decision.If the past is any guide  that could take years. Bankers are among the privileged litigants who can afford to resist regulators.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.11,0.66,True,English,"['ALEX BRUMMER', 'Microsoft deal', 'LSEG', 'horizons', 'The London Stock Exchange Group', 'powerful ¬£1.5billion cornerstone shareholder', 'basic low voltage products', 'chief executive Lucian Grainge', 'China-focused digital systems champion', 'Microsoft techie Scott Guthrie', 'chief executive David Schwimmer', 'UK software pioneer Aveva', 'Silicon Valley tech', '40 per cent minority', 'President Donald Trump', 'Tory government dogma', 'commercial lending portfolios', 'chairman Vernon Hill', 'Former top executives', 'share prices collapse', 'Universal Music listing', 'other data services', 'industrial software business', 'The LSEG deal', 'The FT', 'David Arden', 'digital underpinnings', 'share stake', 'messaging services', 'digital business', 'data powerhouse', 'European rivals', 'long-term investment', 'global trading', 'Chicago-based CME', 'recent broadcast', 'big claims', 'greater connectivity', 'EMI antecedents', 'British background', 'new listings', 'minimum spend', 'cloud computing', 'new opportunities', 'LSEG-Refinitiv competitiveness', 'significant contrast', 'Refinitiv, cloud', 'Grant Shapps', '¬£10billion bid', 'National Security', 'Investment Act', 'Mark Shapland', 'French company', 'joint venture', 'IP sharing', 'Chinese customers', 'main reasons', 'advanced technology', 'Hong Kong', 'Chinese elites', 'French firm', 'US policy', 'French command', 'vital technologies', 'Law fare', 'snails-pace standards', 'financial justice', '¬£10million fine', 'Metro Bank', 'incorrect weightings', 'flamboyant founder', 'Craig Donaldson', 'knowing involvement', 'privileged litigants', 'Microsoft cloud', 'Microsoft platforms', 'ground-breaking deal', 'LSEG board', 'LSEG apps', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'past year', 'Continental exchanges', 'next decade', 'Better earnings', 'Jean-Pascal Tricoire', 'Schneider boss', 'China syndrome', 'cake', 'register', 'capabilities', 'Nasdaq', 'future', 'alliances', 'Tie-up', 'Euronext', 'perspective', 'superiority', 'network', 'basis', 'Amsterdam', 'triumph', 'answers', 'fact', 'value', 'turnover', 'City', 'presence', 'forecasts', 'Teams', 'Bloomberg', 'Atlantic', 'rest', 'planet', 'Department', 'France', 'terms', 'reporting', 'colleague', 'bond', 'Beijing', 'column', 'response', 'advisers', 'couple', 'times', 'West', 'access', 'leadership', 'efforts', 'trade', 'control', 'face', 'risk', 'departure', 'pages', 'breach', 'decision', 'guide', 'years', 'Bankers', 'regulators']",2022-12-12,2022-12-13,thisismoney.co.uk

Quadient therefore confirms that there are now four international carriers that will be actively using Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers for their last and first mile deliveries  since the launch of the roll out of a UK open network announced in June. Global parcel delivery experts DPD UK and DHL have been the first carriers officially confirming their commitment to Quadient‚Äôs open network. The names of the two other international carriers will be confirmed in due course  as they make the new service available to their customers.The addition of a fourth international carrier to use Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers further demonstrates the relevance of Quadient‚Äôs open business model with delivery points available to all carriers  offering consumers more choice and convenience for parcel delivery and returns. According to consulting company Apex Insight1  the final mile is also the most expensive part of the e-commerce fulfilment chain  representing an average of close to 50% of the overall cost of delivering a parcel. Out-of-home delivery options help reduce these costs  improve overall delivery success rates and achieve better customer satisfaction and retention.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  commented: ‚ÄúI am pleased to see such rapid adoption of our open parcel locker network in the UK by main international players. With now four global carriers having committed to add our Parcel Pending by Quadient parcel lockers in their delivery options  we are confident that our open and agnostic approach to parcel locker delivery in the UK has become a key component both for first and last mile delivery. Whether it is for cost optimization  24/7 availability or reducing fuel usage and CO2 emissions  the early and wide adoption of parcel locker solutions for first and last mile delivery confirms the relevance of our offer as a key differentiator in a growing e-commerce market.‚ÄùQuadient‚Äôs parcel locker ambition in the UK market is to reach 5 000 locations in the coming years. As usage for the more than 150 lockers already installed is ramping up in the light of year-end peak season  the pace of installations is set to accelerate significantly in 2023 to reach c. 200 new locations per month.Quadient continues to look to develop the adoption of its network and expects to announce additional users in the UK  whether carriers or retailers in the coming months. Globally  Quadient now operates more than 17 300 units in major e-commerce markets such as Canada  France  Japan  UK and USA.About Quadient¬ÆQuadient is the driving force behind the world‚Äôs most meaningful customer experiences.

Good news for employers  the mandate will require businesses with 50 or more covered employees to offer employees a pre-tax payroll deduction to help them commute to the office by public transportation. Employees who choose to ride a bike can also get reimbursements for qualified bike expenses.Alternately  employers can offer a paid benefit for employees to ride public transportation. For a business to qualify  at least 50 employees must be in the city.Employees who work 30 or more hours per week on average are eligible for the benefit if they have worked for the same employer for the past year. They have access to the pre-tax benefit that allows them to deduct money from their paychecks before taxes and use it towards commuting costs.In 2022  the federal government allowed employees to deduct a maximum of $280 per month for commuter costs and is expected to increase to $300 per month starting on January 1st  2023.Edenred can help any Philadelphia business offer the best commuter benefits programs for their employees. Since 1985  Edenred is the nation's only comprehensive pre-tax commuter benefits in the U.S.  providing quality programs  competitive pricing  and full compliance with IRS regulations to more than 10 000 employers and 10 million eligible employees. Edenred also offers several features  including easy online administration  in-house customer service  direct employee delivery  and a simple sign-up process.Edenred has worked in the Philadelphia area on other transportation initiatives  including being the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's longtime fulfillment partner and operating the RideEco commuter benefit program since March 2020. RideEco offers commuter benefits to companies located in the Delaware Valley who want to offer the benefit to employees. Riders can purchase passes  tickets  and tokens from every transit agency in the area. Vanpool services are eligible for commuter benefits and there's a premium program that allows employees to order prepaid commuter benefit cards or transit cards  and other materials.""With our presence in the Philadelphia area  we are excited to help more businesses add commuter benefits to their benefit packages "" said Ed Fleischmann  General Manager of Edenred USA.

Organizations  priv‚Ä¶","WALLIX and 3DS OUTSCALE join forces to construct a trusted digital space that preserves freedom  where personal and industrial data are protected ""by design""  and where users have the choice to share them or not.Organizations  private or public  that have sensitive data  and that put cloud and cybersecurity at the heart of their digital transformation can now choose WALLIX PAM4ALL on the 3DS OUTSCALE marketplace .They will benefit from one of the best PAM solutions on the market  hosted in a cloud that meets the highest performance  security and data protection requirements .Paris  December 13th 2022 ‚Äì WALLIX  (Euronext ALLIX) a E uropean cybersecurity software provider and expert in Access and Identity Solutions  recognized as a world leader by the analyst firms Gartner  KuppingerCole  Quadrant Knowledge Solutions and Frost & Sullivan  and labeled Cybersecurity Made in Europe  aims to contribute to the construction of a 3rd European way  a trusted digital space  secured ""by design""  where users will have the choice to share or not their data. This must involve the emergence of a resilient European digital offer  where cybersecurity is embedded by design. WALLIX is taking a key step in this ambition by signing a contract with the hyper-trust cloud: 3DS OUTSCALE  and making its WALLIX PAM4ALL solution available in its marketplace. Thus  private or public organizations  including the most sensitive ones (hospitals  industrialists  OSE - Operators of Essential Services  etc.) protect their data thanks to WALLIX PAM4ALL  a solution certified as robust by the French government's cybersecurity agency : ANSSI (CSPN certification)  now stored in a cloud that meets the highest requirements in terms of performance  security and data protection (certified ISO 27001  ISO 27017  ISO 27018  HDS (health data storage)  and qualified SecNumCloud by the ANSSI)With the pandemic  organizations around the world have experienced an acceleration of their digital transformation. To ensure business continuity  organizations have turned to cloud services that enable remote and collaborative work (data storage and sharing  software accessible from a web application  etc.). Post-pandemic  the use of cloud services has become widespread. Indeed  cloud services offer many advantages in addition to facilitating remote working: agility  flexibility  cost reduction  and performance. To take advantage of all the benefits of the cloud  organizations are moving to cloud-hosted solutions  including cybersecurity solutions.Today  to reduce cyber risk  whether external (cyberattacks) or internal (malicious acts  human error)  a cybersecurity solution such as PAM (Privileged Access Management) has become essential for all organizations. The challenge is to be able to regain control of their digital access (authenticate users  manage passwords  have traceability of all actions...). This is now vital. PAM (Privileged Access Management) is the optimimum way to comply with regulatory requirements for data protection (RGPD  NIS1-NIS2  HDS  PCI-DSS...).Furthermore  for WALLIX and 3DS OUTSCALE  two members of the HEXATRUST consortium  organizations must demonstrate digital responsibility when choosing their digital cloud or cybersecurity solutions. Indeed  a successful digital transformation must ensure data protection  privacy and transparency. This is also what organizations must be able to promise to their customers. It's about freedom and autonomy for all of us. This requires the choice of solutions that respect current European legislation  to provide a trusted digital environment for the long term. This digital environment must become a standard for all companies working in Europe and worldwide.The digital industry has a key role to play to provide a Europena alternative with a comprehensive  reliable and unique offer. That's why WALLIX and 3DS OUTSCALE have signed a partnership agreement that aims to expand the portfolio of identity management  authentication and digital access security solutions in the OUTSCALE marketplace. Thus  the two leaders strengthen the European cybersecurity and digital offer.Organizations now have the opportunity to choose one of the best PAM solutions on the market  in a hyper-trusted cloud  to host and protect their sensitive data.""Companies and public organizations can now benefit from the highest level of cybersecurity on the cloud. It is with great pride that our highest level solutions are also sovereign in France and in Europe"" says David CHASSAN  Chief Strategy Officer at 3DS OUTSCALE.""In a complex world where mobility and resource optimization are having a lasting impact on our lives as well as our ways of working and communicating  mastering our digital services and data means taking control of our future.

14755,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564258-exor-6-5-billion-firepower,Exor Stock: ‚Ç¨6.5 Billion Firepower (OTCMKTS:EXXRF),Exor aims for a relative majority stake in a listed company. Read why we believe that the Amsterdam stock exchange might reduce the historic discount on the NAV.,Bill Pugliano/Getty Images NewsHere at the Lab  we are particularly delighted with our analysis on Exor (OTCPK:EXXRF). This year  we have already covered the company four times with many updates in its single investments (Ferrari  CNH  and Stellantis are all covered by the Mare Evidence Lab team). In our last publication  our conclusive paragraph was related to the company's valuation. We emphasised how:Exor is still worth 40% less than the sum of its jewels and we believe that this discount is not justified  Exor portfolio is safer and more resilient than in the past. Speaking of numbers  the NAV discount is above Exor's historical average (25% versus 40%); however  we continue to apply a 20% discount  reaffirming our target price at ‚Ç¨96 per share.Source: Supportive Track RecordStarting with our conclusive remarks  today we provided the latest company news thanks to a recent Capital Market Day release and a follow-up note on how Mare Evidence Lab sees a likely future reduction in Exor NAV discount.At Exor's Analyst Day  the company discussed that it's ready to invest ‚Ç¨6.5 billion. About ‚Ç¨5 billion will be allocated to new acquisitions  one of which will be a large cap. The remaining ‚Ç¨1.5 billion will be entrusted to the managers of Lingotto  the new asset management company  and Exor Venture  the venture capital arm of the holding company. The holding company's new asset management company is itself divided into two branches. A hedge fund with a NAV (net asset value) of ‚Ç¨1.7 billion  managed by Matteo Scolari and dedicated to investments in listed companies  and a fund specialized in private markets led by Nikhil Srinivasan. Lingotto will receive about ‚Ç¨1.1 billion from Exor and a similar sum from Cov√©a  the French reinsurer  to which Exor recently sold Partner Re for ‚Ç¨9 billion. However  the asset manager will also be open to contributions from other external investors.Exor Firepower (Exor Analyst Day Presentation)At the same time  Exor will continue investing in startups  one of John Elkann's favorite sectors. The venture capital arm of the holding company already has around 70 investments for a total of around ‚Ç¨500 million but intends to increase the pace in the coming years. Elkann specified that the annual availability of Exor Ventures will rise from ‚Ç¨100 to ‚Ç¨150 million and that the Italian innovation ecosystem will be among the main beneficiaries.Where will Exor look for the next company? Health  luxury  and technology are the company's favorite hunting grounds  which also does not rule out seizing opportunities in other sectors. In recent years  the company's CEO recalled that the companies operating in the three markets identified have enjoyed high evaluations  sometimes unjustified with respect to their fundamentals. The recent stock market correction has generated opportunities above all on listed markets  where Exor is focusing its attention.As for the large companies already in the portfolio  Exor limited itself to highlighting their excellent results and guaranteeing support for their transformation plans. At the request of the analysts  a brief analysis was dedicated to CNH Industrial. Confirming what was written on this site  Suzanne Heywood  general manager of Exor  revealed that the tractor group is weighing the pros and cons of the dual listing in Milan and New York. Here at the Lab  we already covered this topic in CNH's latest publication.Our take on NAV and ConclusionDuring the summer  Exor moved its listing headquarters from Milan to Amsterdam. From Monday 19th December  the company will enter the AEX  the index of securities with the largest capitalization of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Following the periodic review of the indices  the holding company of the Agnelli-Elkann family takes the place of Just Eat Takeaway. Exor will also enter the AEX ESG index in place of a historic Dutch bank  ABN Amro. The AEX comprises the 25 largest listed companies in the Netherlands by free-float market capitalization and includes firms such as consumer goods giant Unilever as well as brewer Heineken. We believe that the transition to the two Euronext Amsterdam indices will help to increase the liquidity of the stock and indirectly could help reduce the discount on the NAV  which still remains at 40%. The recent presentation to investors did not highlight particular catalysts at an operational level that could significantly affect the discount in the short term. However  as already mentioned  the NAV discount is around 40% compared to an average of 26% since 2013. Thanks to a positive track record  a solid financial structure  and the high firepower of ‚Ç¨6.5 billion  we reaffirm our target price at ‚Ç¨96 per share.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.72,0.11,0.17,True,English,"['Exor Stock', '6.5 Billion Firepower', 'OTCMKTS', 'EXXRF', 'recent Capital Market Day release', 'consumer goods giant Unilever', 'recent stock market correction', 'Mare Evidence Lab team', 'new asset management company', 'two Euronext Amsterdam indices', 'Exor Analyst Day Presentation', 'free-float market capitalization', 'venture capital arm', 'net asset value', 'Getty Images News', 'Supportive Track Record', 'Italian innovation ecosystem', 'Monday 19th December', 'Just Eat Takeaway', 'historic Dutch bank', 'positive track record', 'solid financial structure', 'favorite hunting grounds', 'Amsterdam Stock Exchange', 'other external investors', 'latest company news', 'AEX ESG index', '25 largest listed companies', 'recent presentation', 'asset manager', 'recent years', 'new acquisitions', 'two branches', 'New York', 'largest capitalization', 'Exor NAV discount', 'favorite sectors', 'other sectors', 'latest publication', 'listed markets', 'Exor Venture', 'Bill Pugliano', 'many updates', 'last publication', 'conclusive paragraph', 'target price', 'conclusive remarks', 'follow-up note', 'future reduction', 'large cap', 'Matteo Scolari', 'private markets', 'Nikhil Srinivasan', 'Cov√©a', 'French reinsurer', 'Partner Re', 'same time', 'coming years', 'annual availability', 'main beneficiaries', 'three markets', 'high evaluations', 'large companies', 'excellent results', 'transformation plans', 'Suzanne Heywood', 'general manager', 'tractor group', 'dual listing', 'listing headquarters', 'periodic review', 'Agnelli-Elkann family', 'ABN Amro', 'The AEX', 'brewer Heineken', 'particular catalysts', 'operational level', 'short term', 'high firepower', 'holding company', 'next company', 'historical average', 'hedge fund', 'similar sum', 'John Elkann', 'brief analysis', 'Exor Firepower', 'single investments', 'CNH Industrial', 'Exor portfolio', '20% discount', '70 investments', 'EXXRF', 'Ferrari', 'Stellantis', 'jewels', 'past', 'numbers', 'share', 'Source', 'likely', 'managers', 'Lingotto', 'contributions', 'startups', 'total', 'pace', 'Health', 'luxury', 'technology', 'opportunities', 'CEO', 'respect', 'fundamentals', 'attention', 'request', 'analysts', 'site', 'pros', 'Milan', 'topic', 'Conclusion', 'summer', 'securities', 'place', 'Netherlands', 'firms', 'transition', 'liquidity']",2022-12-13,2022-12-13,seekingalpha.com

(the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  today will host a live webcast reviewing updated clinical data on its Phase 1/2a BALLI-01 clinical trial (evaluating UCART22) and on its Phase 1 AMELI-01 clinical trial (evaluating UCART123) that were presented in an oral session on December 12  2022 at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).Preliminary Data from the BALLI-01 Clinical StudyBALLI-01 is a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of UCART22 given at escalating dose levels after lymphodepletion (LD) with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). Alemtuzumab was added to the LD regimen to sustain host T-cell and Natural Killer (NK) cell depletion and to promote UCART22 cell expansion and persistence.Compared to the last clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  the webcast presented data from five additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3) 5x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FCA. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)  Grade 2 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or adverse events of special interest (AESI) were observed.Story continuesEvidence of UCART22 anti-tumor activity was observed in 60% (n=3) of the five patients at DL3 after lymphodepletion with FCA:A patient experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi) that continues beyond 6 months.A patient experienced an MRD negative complete response (CR) that continues beyond Day 56.A patient experienced a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) that continues beyond Day 84 (MRD-negative until Day 84; MRD-positive at Day 117).All three of the responders failed multiple lines of prior therapy including chemotherapy  CD19-directed autologous CAR T cell therapy  and allogeneic stem cell transplant. Additionally  the patient with the MRD negative CR also failed both prior blinatumomab (a CD19-directed bi-specific antibody) and inotuzumab (a CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugate).‚ÄúThese treatment responses in combination with the safety data are very encouraging for patients with r/r B-cell ALL who have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant ‚Äù said Nitin Jain  M.D.  The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  Department of Leukemia  and coordinating investigator for the BALLI-01 study.Next StepsOverall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART22 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r ALL. The Company is now enrolling patients in BALLI-01 with product candidate manufactured fully in-house at DL2 after FCA lymphodepletion. The first patient has been dosed at dose level 2 (DL2) 1x106 cells/kg. The next data set is expected to be released in 2023.Preliminary Clinical Data from the AMELI-01 Study Presented at ASH 2022AMELI-01 is a Phase 1 open-label dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety  tolerability  expansion and preliminary activity of UCART123 given at escalating dose levels after lymphodepletion (LD) with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML).The oral presentation reviewed preliminary data from patients who received UCART123 at one of the following dose levels: dose level 1 (DL1) 2.5x105 cells/kg; dose level 2 (DL2) 6.25x105 cells/kg; intermediate dose level 2 (DL2i) 1.5x106 cells/kg; or dose level 3 (DL3) 3.30x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FC ([n=8]  DL1 ‚Äì DL3) or FCA ([n=9]  DL2 & DL2i).Preliminary Safety DataThe FCA LD regimen resulted in robust lymphodepletion for greater than 28 days in all patients. Seven out of nine patients demonstrated UCART123 expansion  with maximum concentration (C max) ranging from 13 177 to 330 530 copies/Œºg DNA  an almost nine-fold increase compared with FC LD  and a significant increase in area under the curve (AUC)(0-28 days) (p=0.04; FC 10.2¬±15.7 vs. FCA 34.9¬±28.4).Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in eight patients in the FC arm and nine patients in the FCA arm. In the FC arm  one patient experienced Grade 3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and two patients experienced Grade 4 protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) secondary to CRS. In the FCA arm  two patients experienced Grade 5 DLTs secondary to CRS. Grade 4 toxicities are potentially life threatening and Grade 5 toxicities result in death.Preliminary Efficacy DataEvidence of UCART123 anti-tumor activity was observed in four patients out of fifteen at DL2 or above with best overall responses in the FCA arm. Two out of eight patients (25%) at DL2 with FCA arm achieved meaningful response:A patient who failed five prior lines of therapy experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) with full count recovery at Day 56 that continues beyond one year.A patient with stable disease achieved greater than 90% bone marrow blast reduction (60% to 5%) at Day 28.‚ÄúExemplary activity was seen in a 64-year-old female with AML who had relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and has maintained a durable MRD-negative complete response for over one year without salvage donor lymphocyte infusion or second allo-SCT ‚Äù said David A. Sallman  M.D.  Moffit Cancer Center  Department of Malignant Hematology  Tampa  FL. ‚ÄúOverall  these encouraging clinical data are a meaningful step forward for patients and support further enrollment into the study. This trial addresses a patient population with severe unmet medical need  where a successful CAR T-cell product candidate could be a major breakthrough.‚ÄùThe preliminary data show that adding alemtuzumab to the FC LD regimen was associated with sustained lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  which correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.Next Steps: 2-Dose RegimenOverall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML. Based on observed UCART123 expansion patterns and cytokine profiles  pursuant to an amended protocol (as described below)  a second dose of UCART123 will be given after 10-14 days to allow for additional UCART123 expansion and clinical activity without the use of additional lymphodepletion. The second expansion phase in the setting of reduced disease burden is expected to be safe and allow for clearance of residual disease.After a protocol-based pause in patient recruitment following a Grade 5 event related to CRS  the protocol treatment strategy has been modified and AMELI-01 has now commenced enrolling patients in the FCA 2-dose regimen arm at DL2  a dose that has already been administered and cleared for safety as a single dose. The arm incorporates the use of prophylactic tocilizumab  which is associated with reduced incidence of CRS.A copy of the ASH oral presentation is available on Cellectis‚Äô website.‚ÄúThese clinically meaningful preliminary data from both the BALLI-01 and AMELI-01 studies are very encouraging for patients and for the future of allogeneic CART-cell therapy. Both ALL and AML are diseases with an urgent need for alternative treatment options for patients  and we are excited to be moving each of these studies forward ‚Äù said Dr. Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis. ‚ÄúWe are now implementing a two-dose regimen arm for our AMELI-01 trial  as well as enrolling patients with in-house manufactured product for our BALLI-01 trial. We look forward to sharing future updates as they become available for both of these clinical studies.‚ÄùPipeline OverviewThe following chart highlights our and our licensee‚Äôs key product candidates:ENGLISH PR imagehttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8537f59f-74ad-49d2-a243-9c6af66b6d17NATHALI-01 Study (evaluating UCART20x22):Cellectis is enrolling patients at dose level 1 (50x106 cells) with a fludarabine  cyclophosphamide  and alemtuzumab lymphodepletion regimen in the NATHALI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study of UCART20x22.

Quadient therefore confirms that there are now four international carriers that will be actively using Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers for their last and first mile deliveries  since the launch of the roll out of a UK open network announced in June. Global parcel delivery experts DPD UK and DHL have been the first carriers officially confirming their commitment to Quadient‚Äôs open network. The names of the two other international carriers will be confirmed in due course  as they make the new service available to their customers.The addition of a fourth international carrier to use Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers further demonstrates the relevance of Quadient‚Äôs open business model with delivery points available to all carriers  offering consumers more choice and convenience for parcel delivery and returns. According to consulting company Apex Insight1  the final mile is also the most expensive part of the e-commerce fulfilment chain  representing an average of close to 50% of the overall cost of delivering a parcel. Out-of-home delivery options help reduce these costs  improve overall delivery success rates and achieve better customer satisfaction and retention.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  commented: ‚ÄúI am pleased to see such rapid adoption of our open parcel locker network in the UK by main international players. With now four global carriers having committed to add our Parcel Pending by Quadient parcel lockers in their delivery options  we are confident that our open and agnostic approach to parcel locker delivery in the UK has become a key component both for first and last mile delivery. Whether it is for cost optimization  24/7 availability or reducing fuel usage and CO2 emissions  the early and wide adoption of parcel locker solutions for first and last mile delivery confirms the relevance of our offer as a key differentiator in a growing e-commerce market.‚ÄùStory continuesQuadient‚Äôs parcel locker ambition in the UK market is to reach 5 000 locations in the coming years. As usage for the more than 150 lockers already installed is ramping up in the light of year-end peak season  the pace of installations is set to accelerate significantly in 2023 to reach c. 200 new locations per month.Quadient continues to look to develop the adoption of its network and expects to announce additional users in the UK  whether carriers or retailers in the coming months. Globally  Quadient now operates more than 17 300 units in major e-commerce markets such as Canada  France  Japan  UK and USA.About Quadient¬ÆQuadient is the driving force behind the world‚Äôs most meaningful customer experiences.

This designation was issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA).ADV7103 is a proprietary innovative combination of two active pharmaceutical ingredients (potassium citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate) in the form of prolonged release coated granules. The specific formulation of ADV7103 aims to optimize the daily dosing of active ingredients and thus improve the adherence to treatment and quality of life of patients with dRTA.Didier Laurens  Chief Executive Officer of Advicenne  stated: ""ADV7103 being granted orphan drug designation in dRTA is a major step for our drug candidate and Advicenne. This regulatory status is of critical importance in the ongoing discussions for the signing of a commercial partnership in North America. The real-world clinical data obtained from patients with dRTA  in European countries for more than 5 years  confirm both the therapeutic benefit of ADV7103 and its safety  and significantly strengthen the prospects for its development in the United States.""ADV7103 has the potential to become the first drug to treat dRTA in North America. This disease results in a decrease in blood pH that causes many complications such as growth retardation  rickets (a disease of bone development in children)  lithiasis  nephrocalcinosis and  in some cases  hearing loss. This disease can ultimately lead to chronic kidney dysfunction.In the United States  dRTA in its genetic and secondary forms affects between 20 000 and 30 000 patients. In Europe  it is estimated that between 30 000 and 50 000 patients are living with this condition.Story continuesWith a view to creating additional value  Advicenne is also studying the possibility of applying for an orphan designation in the cystinuria indication in the United States.About Advicenne Advicenne (Euronext: ALDVI) is a specialty pharmaceutical company founded in 2007  specializing in the development of innovative treatments in Nephrology. Its lead product Sibnayal¬Æ (ADV 7103) has received its Marketing Approval for distal renal tubular acidosis in EU and the UK. ADV 7103 is currently in late-stage development in cystinuria in Europe and in dRTA and cystinuria in the US and in Canada.
