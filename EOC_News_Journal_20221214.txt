(NASDAQ: PRAX)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  and UCB (EURONEXT BRUSSELS: UCB)  a global biopharmaceutical company  today announced a strategic collaboration  based upon Praxis‚Äô PRAX-020 program  for the discovery of small molecule therapeutics as potential treatments of KCNT1 related epilepsies.‚ÄúWe are excited to partner with UCB  a global leader in epilepsy drug development  as we work together toward a novel approach for the treatment of KCNT1 related epilepsy  which has no approved therapies currently ‚Äù said Marcio Souza  president and chief executive officer of Praxis. ‚ÄúOur internal research efforts give us confidence that small molecules can selectively inhibit the KCNT1 channel  and potentially could be an effective treatment for individuals suffering from KCNT1 related epilepsy. The collaboration with UCB validates this approach and will allow us to accelerate efforts toward a potential treatment for KCNT1 patients.‚ÄùUnder the terms of the collaboration  UCB retains an exclusive option to in-license global development and commercialization rights to any resulting KCNT1 small molecule development candidate. Praxis will receive an upfront payment from UCB  and if the option is exercised by UCB  would be eligible to receive an option fee and future success-based development and commercialization milestone payments  for a total of up to approximately $100 million  in addition to tiered royalties on net sales of any resulting products from the collaboration. Further financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.‚ÄúUCB is dedicated to the discovery and development of treatments for epilepsy  including rare and genetic epilepsies  with an ambition to develop solutions that move from symptomatic relief to those that could address the root causes of disease ‚Äù said Dhaval Patel  chief scientific officer of UCB. ‚ÄúPraxis‚Äô genetics-driven approach has led to compelling preclinical proof of concept  and we look forward to progressing this novel research program together for the benefit of individuals and families affected by this devastating form of epilepsy.‚ÄùStory continuesAbout PraxisPraxis Precision Medicines is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating genetic insights into the development of therapies for CNS disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance. Praxis is applying insights from genetic epilepsies to both rare and more prevalent neurological disorders  using our understanding of shared biological targets and circuits in the brain. Praxis has established a broad portfolio including multiple programs across movement disorders and epilepsy  with four clinical-stage product candidates.

The project is supported by the French government with a grant from the French Treasury.The project will combine Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô 3DEXPERIENCE platform and Egis‚Äô and B4‚Äôs construction engineering expertise  in a two-phase approach: a damage assessment and reconstruction cost analysis in the Chernihiv Oblast  followed by a strategic master planning for reconstruction in the city of Chernihiv.The first phase will consist of diagnosing the damages in the Oblast  to forecast the reconstruction costs and define which infrastructures to rebuild first. Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô 3DEXPERIENCE platform will support the collaboration and host all the information and analysis gathered by EGIS and B4 experts. Satellite data analysis will automatically detect and highlight impacted areas and will be cross-checked by inspections in the field to validate the calculations and the prioritization strategy.The second phase will involve building a virtual twin of the city of Chernihiv on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. It will focus on optimizing how the city will be rebuilt including the design of new buildings and the organization of city transportation  infrastructure and other services. Stakeholders from diverse sectors will use the virtual twin to collaboratively test different scenarios involving parameters such as flooding risks  accessibility  transportation  land use  position of key urban assets  and existing water  heat  sewage and other infrastructure networks. In parallel  they will source information from existing documents and city departments to ensure that the needs and expectations of inhabitants in each neighborhood  the vision of elected officials  and economic and social development challenges are all taken into account.Throughout the project  all information collected will be fed into the virtual twin of the city to enable the partners to collaboratively build the city master plan.‚ÄúEgis has been operating in Ukraine since 1993  working on a variety of private and government funded projects across various sectors such as civil engineering  road and bridge construction  water  urban transport; ports and waterways and energy. Today we run 23 projects in Ukraine that aim to rebuild cities and infrastructure.

Quadient therefore confirms that there are now four international carriers that will be actively using Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers for their last and first mile deliveries  since the launch of the roll out of a UK open network announced in June. Global parcel delivery experts DPD UK and DHL have been the first carriers officially confirming their commitment to Quadient‚Äôs open network. The names of the two other international carriers will be confirmed in due course  as they make the new service available to their customers.The addition of a fourth international carrier to use Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers further demonstrates the relevance of Quadient‚Äôs open business model with delivery points available to all carriers  offering consumers more choice and convenience for parcel delivery and returns. According to consulting company Apex Insight1  the final mile is also the most expensive part of the e-commerce fulfilment chain  representing an average of close to 50% of the overall cost of delivering a parcel. Out-of-home delivery options help reduce these costs  improve overall delivery success rates and achieve better customer satisfaction and retention.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  commented: ‚ÄúI am pleased to see such rapid adoption of our open parcel locker network in the UK by main international players. With now four global carriers having committed to add our Parcel Pending by Quadient parcel lockers in their delivery options  we are confident that our open and agnostic approach to parcel locker delivery in the UK has become a key component both for first and last mile delivery. Whether it is for cost optimization  24/7 availability or reducing fuel usage and CO2 emissions  the early and wide adoption of parcel locker solutions for first and last mile delivery confirms the relevance of our offer as a key differentiator in a growing e-commerce market.‚ÄùQuadient‚Äôs parcel locker ambition in the UK market is to reach 5 000 locations in the coming years. As usage for the more than 150 lockers already installed is ramping up in the light of year-end peak season  the pace of installations is set to accelerate significantly in 2023 to reach c. 200 new locations per month.Quadient continues to look to develop the adoption of its network and expects to announce additional users in the UK  whether carriers or retailers in the coming months.

The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 50x106 (DL1)  110x106 (DL2) and 250x106 (DL3). As of 8 November 2022  9 patients were enrolled; baseline and safety data for 8 patients were available (n=4 at DL1; n=4 at DL2). 7 patients reached the follow-up period of 28-days and were eligible for efficacy evaluation.The initial results from 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy evaluation (cut-off date: 8 November 2022) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 86% observed and all responding patients achieving a complete response (CR). A duration of response of up to 7 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Two patients who received DL1 that progressed after initial stable disease or CR respectively  had a CD19-negative escape. No CD19-positive relapses have been observed.In the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. No grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was observed in any of the patients. At DL2  CRS grade 1 or 2 was reported in 4 patients and ICANS grade 1 was reported in 3 patients. Patients at DL1 did not experience any grade of CRS or ICANS. Dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenia grade 4 for >21 days) was observed in 1 patient (DL2) and the majority of grade ‚â•3 adverse events were hematological toxicities.‚ÄúWe are committed to accelerating transformational innovation to address unmet needs of patients with advanced cancers ‚Äù said Dr. Paul Stoffels1  CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Galapagos. ‚ÄúDespite significant medical advancements in recent years  many cancer patients relapse  become resistant to treatment or are diagnosed too late. We believe that differentiation and broader access to therapy can come from a disruptive CAR-T manufacturing model at the point-of-care  closer to patients. We are excited to present initial encouraging safety  efficacy and feasibility data from the ATALANTA-1 study with GLPG5101 manufactured at point-of-care  which support that potential. We are on track to report topline data from the completed study in the first half of 2023.‚ÄùThe poster presentation was given by Marie Jos√© Kersten  MD  PhD  Professor of Hematology and Head of the Department of Hematology at the Academic Center in Amsterdam:Abstract Title Authors Presentation date/time Initial Clinical Results of ATALANTA-1  a Phase 1/2 Trial of Point-of-Care Manufactured GLPG5101 (19CP02) in rrNHL S√©bastien Anguille  Ilse Kuipers  Kirsten Saevels  Yves Beguin  Anna Van Muyden  Christian Jacques  and Marie Jos√© Kersten Poster Number: 4637Date: 12 December 2022  6:00‚Äì8:00 PM ETSession: 704.

The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint‚Äôs end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software and Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies.About the ATALANTA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003272-13)ATALANTA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5101  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (rrNHL). GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as an intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101. The planned dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 are 50x106  110x106 and 250x106 CAR T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) while the secondary objectives include complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing. The study is currently enrolling rrNHL patients in Europe and the first expansion cohort for Mantle Cell Lymphoma  a form of NHL  is currently open for recruitment. The company aims to broaden the study to include US patients in 2023 and to provide topline results in the first half of 2023.About Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs LymphomaNon-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma is a cancer originating from lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell which is part of the body‚Äôs immune system. Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85 percent of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas depend on the stage and type of disease.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

Eutelsat‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer Eva Berneke and Jean-Fran√ßois Cazenave  TSF's Chairman  met at Eutelsat's headquarters to set out further initiatives to be conducted as part of this close collaborative relationship.TSF with missions in more than 70 countriesT√©l√©coms Sans Fronti√®res is a non-governmental organisation headquartered in Pau  France  with two regional sites in Asia and South America. Its role is to bring back connectivity and raise awareness and protect communities in various emergency situations by providing them with advanced technological solutions for communication and access to information.With their unique deployment capacity  TSF's teams can be operational in any part of the world within 24 hours of being notified of a humanitarian crisis situation. TSF's assistance is built on a combination of direct assistance to the affected communities and support for connectivity to humanitarian coordination centres  using best-in-class technologies  in particular satellite infrastructure.Fifteen years working together in the fieldWith logistic support from Eutelsat since 2007  this NGO of truly global scope has been able to equip communities and crisis units with broadband links for data  image and voice communications within a few hours. For several years now  Eutelsat has successfully partnered with TSF in large-scale conflict areas and natural disaster zones to coordinate the various relief efforts in the field. Now a sponsor of TSF  Eutelsat is stepping up its financial support  helping the NGO to strengthen its capacity in order to rise to the communications challenges associated with emergency aid.Eva Berneke  Eutelsat's Chief Executive Officer  commented: ""In emergency and disaster situations  satellite connectivity often remains the only viable solution for restoring critical communications services for communities and local and global humanitarian responders as quickly as possible. Our partnership with TSF is an integral part of our corporate responsibility in the area of emergency telecoms. We are delighted to further contribute to the activities of this outstanding NGO.‚ÄùJean-Fran√ßois Cazenave  Chairman of T√©l√©coms sans fronti√®res  added: ‚ÄúFor 15 years  Eutelsat's unfailing support has enabled TSF to set up critical satellite-based connections during major humanitarian emergencies around the world  from natural disasters to major conflicts and mass population displacements. The strong cooperation between TSF's teams in the field and Eutelsat's departments has enhanced TSF's response capacity. This combination of capabilities enables us to serve the connectivity requirements of governmental authorities  United Nations agencies and humanitarian organisations with technologies that are most effective and best suited to their needs. When disaster strikes  it is in the early days that the largest number of lives can be saved. Through our joint efforts  we are delivering Communications for life.‚ÄùAbout T√©l√©coms Sans Fronti√®resT√©l√©coms Sans Fronti√®res (TSF) was founded in 1998 as the world‚Äôs first NGO focusing on emergency-response technologies.

From its early days  the culture of first emergency response has been core to TSF‚Äôs identity  but we have grown and evolved as the role of technologies in emergencies has expanded.In parallel to this core activity  we also develop  adapt  and make available innovative and cost-effective solutions to assist migrants  refugees  displaced people and other disadvantaged communities in different areas  including education  healthcare  women‚Äôs rights and food security.TSF is a member of the United Nations Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (UNETC)  a partner of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and a member of the US State Department‚Äôs Advisory Committee on International Communications and Information Policy.Since its creation  TSF responded to over 150 crises in more than 70 countries providing communication means to over 20 million people and nearly 1 000 NGOs.For more information about TSF: tsfi.org ; Tel.: +33 5 59 84 43 60 ; communication@tsfi.orgAbout Eutelsat CommunicationsFounded in 1977  Eutelsat Communications is one of the world's leading satellite operators.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYNovember was a strong month for Volta with a performance of +6.3%.It is mainly due to the solid performance of Volta‚Äôs CLO Equity positions  especially European ones  catching-up following months of underperformances but it is also due to better-than-expected recoveries on specific distressed names held in Volta‚Äôs loan funds.Diving into Volta‚Äôs underlying sub asset classes  monthly performances** were as follow: +1.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +7.2% for CLO Equity tranches (+16.8% for European CLO Equity tranches); +2.5% for CLO Debt tranches; and +44.4% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.3% of the fund‚Äôs NAV).November is usually a relatively quiet month in terms of CLO Equity distributions. Volta received in November the equivalent of ‚Ç¨2.1m in terms of interests and coupons. Over the usual 6-month-basis time frame Volta received ‚Ç¨23.9m of interests and coupons. A 21.8% annualized cash flow to NAV.Over the month  we purchased a European CLO Equity position (‚Ç¨2m nominal  purchased at 56%) with a projected yield in the 24% context (under reasonable assumptions).There are still slightly more downgrades than upgrades in both the US and the European loan markets  although at a very moderate pace. In terms of default rates  we have been  for the-last-12-month measure  at 0.4% default rate for European loans and 0.7% for US loans. After the invasion of Ukraine  rating agencies were forecasting 2022 default rates to be between 2% and 2.5% for the US and European loan markets. We are one month from the end of the year and still far from such levels.Story continuesRating agencies currently forecast default rates between 4% and 5.5% for 2023. Our default rates view for 2023 still lands in the 2% to 3% area for both US and European loans.Such kind of default pattern should not materially impact the distribution of interests of Volta‚Äôs assets in the near term. We believe that we can maintain a high level of coupons in the coming quarters and are actively looking to seize investment opportunities with the extra cash that is being generated.Despite being relatively constructive and convinced that  at current prices  there is a lot of long-term value in Volta portfolio  we believe the recession that everybody expect in 2023 might be more pronounced that what we have in mind. We decided to hedge part of this risk by adding some overlay in terms of duration. We built some positions recently and Volta is long duration on a 4 years Euro swap for the equivalent of 0.8 years of duration (at 2.85% yield level) and long T-notes at roughly 3.9% yield level for circa 2 years of duration.The idea here is to consider that if we are wrong on the fundamental scenario and if things get worse than our current anticipations  rates will very likely decrease  generating positive performances on our duration overlay positions. At the time of writing this comment we have a mark-to-market gain in the 0.6% area.As at the end of November 2022  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨219.8m or ‚Ç¨6.01 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.9% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 6.3% as at 31 October 2022  0.6% was at 30 September 2022.** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 50x106 (DL1)  110x106 (DL2) and 250x106 (DL3). As of 8 November 2022  9 patients were enrolled; baseline and safety data for 8 patients were available (n=4 at DL1; n=4 at DL2). 7 patients reached the follow-up period of 28-days and were eligible for efficacy evaluation.The initial results from 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy evaluation (cut-off date: 8 November 2022) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 86% observed and all responding patients achieving a complete response (CR). A duration of response of up to 7 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Two patients who received DL1 that progressed after initial stable disease or CR respectively  had a CD19-negative escape. No CD19-positive relapses have been observed.Story continuesIn the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. No grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was observed in any of the patients. At DL2  CRS grade 1 or 2 was reported in 4 patients and ICANS grade 1 was reported in 3 patients. Patients at DL1 did not experience any grade of CRS or ICANS. Dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenia grade 4 for >21 days) was observed in 1 patient (DL2) and the majority of grade ‚â•3 adverse events were hematological toxicities.‚ÄúWe are committed to accelerating transformational innovation to address unmet needs of patients with advanced cancers ‚Äù said Dr. Paul Stoffels1  CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Galapagos. ‚ÄúDespite significant medical advancements in recent years  many cancer patients relapse  become resistant to treatment or are diagnosed too late. We believe that differentiation and broader access to therapy can come from a disruptive CAR-T manufacturing model at the point-of-care  closer to patients. We are excited to present initial encouraging safety  efficacy and feasibility data from the ATALANTA-1 study with GLPG5101 manufactured at point-of-care  which support that potential. We are on track to report topline data from the completed study in the first half of 2023.‚ÄùThe poster presentation was given by Marie Jos√© Kersten  MD  PhD  Professor of Hematology and Head of the Department of Hematology at the Academic Center in Amsterdam:Abstract Title Authors Presentation date/time Initial Clinical Results of ATALANTA-1  a Phase 1/2 Trial of Point-of-Care Manufactured GLPG5101 (19CP02) in rrNHL S√©bastien Anguille  Ilse Kuipers  Kirsten Saevels  Yves Beguin  Anna Van Muyden  Christian Jacques  and Marie Jos√© Kersten Poster Number: 4637Date: 12 December 2022  6:00‚Äì8:00 PM ETSession: 704. Cellular Immunotherapies: Early Phase and Investigational Therapies: Poster IIICellPoint has developed  in a strategic collaboration with Lonza  a novel point-of-care supply model  which is designed to enable clinicians to administer fresh CAR T cells within 7 days of leukapheresis  without complex logistics or cryopreservation  thereby aiming to address important limitations of current CAR-T treatments. The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint‚Äôs end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software and Lonza‚Äôs Cocoon¬Æ Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies.About the ATALANTA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003272-13)ATALANTA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5101  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (rrNHL). GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as an intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101. The planned dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 are 50x106  110x106 and 250x106 CAR T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) while the secondary objectives include complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing. The study is currently enrolling rrNHL patients in Europe and the first expansion cohort for Mantle Cell Lymphoma  a form of NHL  is currently open for recruitment. The company aims to broaden the study to include US patients in 2023 and to provide topline results in the first half of 2023.About Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs LymphomaNon-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma is a cancer originating from lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell which is part of the body‚Äôs immune system. Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85 percent of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas depend on the stage and type of disease.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing innovative medicines.

Quadient therefore confirms that there are now four international carriers that will be actively using Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers for their last and first mile deliveries  since the launch of the roll out of a UK open network announced in June. Global parcel delivery experts DPD UK and DHL have been the first carriers officially confirming their commitment to Quadient‚Äôs open network. The names of the two other international carriers will be confirmed in due course  as they make the new service available to their customers.The addition of a fourth international carrier to use Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers further demonstrates the relevance of Quadient‚Äôs open business model with delivery points available to all carriers  offering consumers more choice and convenience for parcel delivery and returns. According to consulting company Apex Insight1  the final mile is also the most expensive part of the e-commerce fulfilment chain  representing an average of close to 50% of the overall cost of delivering a parcel. Out-of-home delivery options help reduce these costs  improve overall delivery success rates and achieve better customer satisfaction and retention.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient  commented: ‚ÄúI am pleased to see such rapid adoption of our open parcel locker network in the UK by main international players. With now four global carriers having committed to add our Parcel Pending by Quadient parcel lockers in their delivery options  we are confident that our open and agnostic approach to parcel locker delivery in the UK has become a key component both for first and last mile delivery. Whether it is for cost optimization  24/7 availability or reducing fuel usage and CO2 emissions  the early and wide adoption of parcel locker solutions for first and last mile delivery confirms the relevance of our offer as a key differentiator in a growing e-commerce market.‚ÄùQuadient‚Äôs parcel locker ambition in the UK market is to reach 5 000 locations in the coming years. As usage for the more than 150 lockers already installed is ramping up in the light of year-end peak season  the pace of installations is set to accelerate significantly in 2023 to reach c. 200 new locations per month.Quadient continues to look to develop the adoption of its network and expects to announce additional users in the UK  whether carriers or retailers in the coming months. Globally  Quadient now operates more than 17 300 units in major e-commerce markets such as Canada  France  Japan  UK and USA.About Quadient¬ÆQuadient is the driving force behind the world‚Äôs most meaningful customer experiences.

Good news for employers  the mandate will require businesses with 50 or more covered employees to offer employees a pre-tax payroll deduction to help them commute to the office by public transportation. Employees who choose to ride a bike can also get reimbursements for qualified bike expenses.Alternately  employers can offer a paid benefit for employees to ride public transportation. For a business to qualify  at least 50 employees must be in the city.Employees who work 30 or more hours per week on average are eligible for the benefit if they have worked for the same employer for the past year. They have access to the pre-tax benefit that allows them to deduct money from their paychecks before taxes and use it towards commuting costs.In 2022  the federal government allowed employees to deduct a maximum of $280 per month for commuter costs and is expected to increase to $300 per month starting on January 1st  2023.Edenred can help any Philadelphia business offer the best commuter benefits programs for their employees. Since 1985  Edenred is the nation's only comprehensive pre-tax commuter benefits in the U.S.  providing quality programs  competitive pricing  and full compliance with IRS regulations to more than 10 000 employers and 10 million eligible employees. Edenred also offers several features  including easy online administration  in-house customer service  direct employee delivery  and a simple sign-up process.Edenred has worked in the Philadelphia area on other transportation initiatives  including being the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's longtime fulfillment partner and operating the RideEco commuter benefit program since March 2020.

This must involve the emergence of a resilient European digital offer  where cybersecurity is embedded by design. WALLIX is taking a key step in this ambition by signing a contract with the hyper-trust cloud: 3DS OUTSCALE  and making its WALLIX PAM4ALL solution available in its marketplace. Thus  private or public organizations  including the most sensitive ones (hospitals  industrialists  OSE - Operators of Essential Services  etc.) protect their data thanks to WALLIX PAM4ALL  a solution certified as robust by the French government's cybersecurity agency : ANSSI (CSPN certification)  now stored in a cloud that meets the highest requirements in terms of performance  security and data protection (certified ISO 27001  ISO 27017  ISO 27018  HDS (health data storage)  and qualified SecNumCloud by the ANSSI)With the pandemic  organizations around the world have experienced an acceleration of their digital transformation. To ensure business continuity  organizations have turned to cloud services that enable remote and collaborative work (data storage and sharing  software accessible from a web application  etc.). Post-pandemic  the use of cloud services has become widespread. Indeed  cloud services offer many advantages in addition to facilitating remote working: agility  flexibility  cost reduction  and performance. To take advantage of all the benefits of the cloud  organizations are moving to cloud-hosted solutions  including cybersecurity solutions.Today  to reduce cyber risk  whether external (cyberattacks) or internal (malicious acts  human error)  a cybersecurity solution such as PAM (Privileged Access Management) has become essential for all organizations. The challenge is to be able to regain control of their digital access (authenticate users  manage passwords  have traceability of all actions...). This is now vital. PAM (Privileged Access Management) is the optimimum way to comply with regulatory requirements for data protection (RGPD  NIS1-NIS2  HDS  PCI-DSS...).Furthermore  for WALLIX and 3DS OUTSCALE  two members of the HEXATRUST consortium  organizations must demonstrate digital responsibility when choosing their digital cloud or cybersecurity solutions. Indeed  a successful digital transformation must ensure data protection  privacy and transparency. This is also what organizations must be able to promise to their customers. It's about freedom and autonomy for all of us. This requires the choice of solutions that respect current European legislation  to provide a trusted digital environment for the long term. This digital environment must become a standard for all companies working in Europe and worldwide.The digital industry has a key role to play to provide a Europena alternative with a comprehensive  reliable and unique offer. That's why WALLIX and 3DS OUTSCALE have signed a partnership agreement that aims to expand the portfolio of identity management  authentication and digital access security solutions in the OUTSCALE marketplace. Thus  the two leaders strengthen the European cybersecurity and digital offer.Organizations now have the opportunity to choose one of the best PAM solutions on the market  in a hyper-trusted cloud  to host and protect their sensitive data.""Companies and public organizations can now benefit from the highest level of cybersecurity on the cloud. It is with great pride that our highest level solutions are also sovereign in France and in Europe"" says David CHASSAN  Chief Strategy Officer at 3DS OUTSCALE.""In a complex world where mobility and resource optimization are having a lasting impact on our lives as well as our ways of working and communicating  mastering our digital services and data means taking control of our future.

14755,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564258-exor-6-5-billion-firepower,Exor Stock: ‚Ç¨6.5 Billion Firepower (OTCMKTS:EXXRF),Exor aims for a relative majority stake in a listed company. Read why we believe that the Amsterdam stock exchange might reduce the historic discount on the NAV.,Bill Pugliano/Getty Images NewsHere at the Lab  we are particularly delighted with our analysis on Exor (OTCPK:EXXRF). This year  we have already covered the company four times with many updates in its single investments (Ferrari  CNH  and Stellantis are all covered by the Mare Evidence Lab team). In our last publication  our conclusive paragraph was related to the company's valuation. We emphasised how:Exor is still worth 40% less than the sum of its jewels and we believe that this discount is not justified  Exor portfolio is safer and more resilient than in the past. Speaking of numbers  the NAV discount is above Exor's historical average (25% versus 40%); however  we continue to apply a 20% discount  reaffirming our target price at ‚Ç¨96 per share.Source: Supportive Track RecordStarting with our conclusive remarks  today we provided the latest company news thanks to a recent Capital Market Day release and a follow-up note on how Mare Evidence Lab sees a likely future reduction in Exor NAV discount.At Exor's Analyst Day  the company discussed that it's ready to invest ‚Ç¨6.5 billion. About ‚Ç¨5 billion will be allocated to new acquisitions  one of which will be a large cap. The remaining ‚Ç¨1.5 billion will be entrusted to the managers of Lingotto  the new asset management company  and Exor Venture  the venture capital arm of the holding company. The holding company's new asset management company is itself divided into two branches. A hedge fund with a NAV (net asset value) of ‚Ç¨1.7 billion  managed by Matteo Scolari and dedicated to investments in listed companies  and a fund specialized in private markets led by Nikhil Srinivasan. Lingotto will receive about ‚Ç¨1.1 billion from Exor and a similar sum from Cov√©a  the French reinsurer  to which Exor recently sold Partner Re for ‚Ç¨9 billion. However  the asset manager will also be open to contributions from other external investors.Exor Firepower (Exor Analyst Day Presentation)At the same time  Exor will continue investing in startups  one of John Elkann's favorite sectors. The venture capital arm of the holding company already has around 70 investments for a total of around ‚Ç¨500 million but intends to increase the pace in the coming years. Elkann specified that the annual availability of Exor Ventures will rise from ‚Ç¨100 to ‚Ç¨150 million and that the Italian innovation ecosystem will be among the main beneficiaries.Where will Exor look for the next company? Health  luxury  and technology are the company's favorite hunting grounds  which also does not rule out seizing opportunities in other sectors. In recent years  the company's CEO recalled that the companies operating in the three markets identified have enjoyed high evaluations  sometimes unjustified with respect to their fundamentals. The recent stock market correction has generated opportunities above all on listed markets  where Exor is focusing its attention.As for the large companies already in the portfolio  Exor limited itself to highlighting their excellent results and guaranteeing support for their transformation plans. At the request of the analysts  a brief analysis was dedicated to CNH Industrial. Confirming what was written on this site  Suzanne Heywood  general manager of Exor  revealed that the tractor group is weighing the pros and cons of the dual listing in Milan and New York. Here at the Lab  we already covered this topic in CNH's latest publication.Our take on NAV and ConclusionDuring the summer  Exor moved its listing headquarters from Milan to Amsterdam. From Monday 19th December  the company will enter the AEX  the index of securities with the largest capitalization of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Following the periodic review of the indices  the holding company of the Agnelli-Elkann family takes the place of Just Eat Takeaway. Exor will also enter the AEX ESG index in place of a historic Dutch bank  ABN Amro. The AEX comprises the 25 largest listed companies in the Netherlands by free-float market capitalization and includes firms such as consumer goods giant Unilever as well as brewer Heineken. We believe that the transition to the two Euronext Amsterdam indices will help to increase the liquidity of the stock and indirectly could help reduce the discount on the NAV  which still remains at 40%. The recent presentation to investors did not highlight particular catalysts at an operational level that could significantly affect the discount in the short term. However  as already mentioned  the NAV discount is around 40% compared to an average of 26% since 2013.

14778,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-kept-promise-confirms-064500754.html,Artmarket.com has kept its promise and confirms the successful deployment of its new Artprice Artists Homepages  with already promising uptake stats and an excellent outlook for 2023 as we progress toward the grail of art valuation.,Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's...,"PARIS  Dec. 14  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists indeed are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin.The new Artprice Artist Homepage: featuring Wassily KandinskyWith this new version ‚Äì the most successful since Artprice's creation ‚Äì Artprice by Artmarket has received enthusiastic feedback over the past two months from a selection of target users throughout the global art market's twelve principal countries. Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.Story continuesAccording to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

14780,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.cityam.com/apple-is-now-embracing-crypto-style-security-to-protect-your-data/,Apple is now embracing crypto-style security to protect your data,Jonny Fry delves into the world of identity and data protection as Apple takes its security cue from cryptocurrency.The post Apple is now embracing crypto-style security to protect your data¬† appeared first on CityAM.,Apple is now embracing crypto-style security to protect your dataThe challenges of privacy and protection for on-line data and assets is particularly relevant to us all as we increasingly rely on digital data to lead our lives.The average daily time people spend on their mobile ‚Äòphones is three and a quarter hours  with 20% of people spending over four hours ‚Äòswiping and typing‚Äô. More unbelievable is that  on average  we look at our phone 58 times a day!Similarly  like cash  we spend money yet many of us do not even have a purse/wallet. Many mobile ‚Äòphone owners do not call  let alone leave a voicemail (so passe‚Äò)  but text  message  email  check the weather  bank account  etc ‚Äì that is  we are switching to digital. Digital cash  digital messages and digital data are all either here for you now  or are likely to be soon.The whole topic of digital data may sound boring and not relevant to you  but think again. Do you really aspire to have your messages  photos  data  etc  on your laptop/mobile ‚Äòphone available for all to see? Is not encryption and privacy fundamentally important for the majority of us?More recently  it seems that the crazy crypto sector is teaching the rest of the world a lesson or two in security and privacy  and big tech firms such as Apple (itself not yet overtly crypto) are embracing the cryptographic security that underpins cryptocurrencies. However  one of the barriers in preventing the public holding digital assets ‚Äì that is  cryptocurrencies  NFTs  digital equities  digital funds  digital gold  digital $or ¬£ or ‚Ç¨ ‚Äì is the user experience  or as our techy friends refer to as the ‚ÄòUX‚Äô.Quite frankly  it can be daunting not only to have to remember all the terminology but to then be required to invent 12-24 random words to act as your private key. Yes  you need a key to unlock to give you access to your digital assets your digital data  provided you can remember your 12-24 random string of words‚Ä¶..Apple Advanced Data ProtectionSource: AppleWell  by the end of December 2022  Apple Inc. is to launch in the US and then globally its new Advanced Data Protection with the intention to encrypt almost all the data that its customers store on the Apple iCloud. This is hugely significant  bearing in mind that Apple has over 1.2 billion active iPhones. As an aside  the only data that Apple will not be encrypting is your mail  contacts and calendars due to these data sets being reliant older internet technology  but it will be ‚Äòend to end‚Äô encrypting its customers‚Äô data as listed here:passwords and keychainhealth datahome datapayment informationApple card transactionsmapsQuickType keyboard learned vocabularySafariscreen TimeSiri informationWi-Fi passwordsW1 and H1 Bluetooth keysmemojiThis all sounds like a vast improvement  but what happens if I cannot remember my private key i.e.  my 12-24 random string of numbers? ‚Äì a challenge that many crypto investors have faced.Apple has reported that it will not be holding customers private keys (a nightmare for those of us who forget)  but at least it means your data is well and truly protected. Protected so well that  in future  even if the FBI demands access to your digital data  Apple cannot help.Apple did indeed have a court battle with the FBI in 2015 and were asked to hand over data  but its new Advanced Data Protection will mean it now cannot do so. This possibly explains why governments have reportedly pressured Apple for years not to release this new security feature. In many jurisdictions you have the right to remain silent  yet law enforcement agents appear to have attempted to run ‚Äòrough shod‚Äô in trying to force tech firms such as Apple to release customer data held by them.Even when being interrogated by these agents  information is often disclosed by questionable means. Yet these days with facial recognition ID  all that is required is to hold someone‚Äôs phone to their face so as to unlock their phone and gain access their private personal information. Presently  it seems that the legislation and protection of physical assets differs from digital assets ‚Äì but surely this is now not tenable in the long term?Apple‚Äôs new security measure is a significant advancement regarding the privacy of personal information for its customers. It offers the possibility to create new ways in which trust can be built (that is  interaction remotely between people and organisations) and will introduce millions of users globally to security processes and procedures that hitherto had largely been only employed by crypto users.In effect  it forces users of Apple‚Äôs Advance Data Protection service to not rely on a third-party custodians but to make them be responsible for their private key  and so be their own bank- i.e.  because Apple will not be able to help reset your private key.As mentioned before  if we think that previously remembering the letters of our password was a challenge  how will we now cope with remembering our 12-24 random passwords? Consequently  Apple has tried to negate this in two ways ‚Äì either customers can have recovery keys i.e.  print out their private words/key or  alternatively  they can access their Advanced Data Protected iCloud account by setting up a recovery contact which involves the help of another person with an Apple ID and Apple device.Then there is the issue of trust. According to Vocabulary.com: ‚ÄúThe word custodian comes from Latin custos  meaning ‚Äúguardian ‚Äù and anyone who looks after something can be a custodian‚Äù. This is exactly what custodians do ‚Äì i.e.  look after other organisations‚Äô assets and so  in effect  provide a level of trust and assurance.But if you are in control of your assets  then potentially the role of a custodian is questioned? The three largest custodians  BNY Mellon  Euroclear and JP Morgan control almost $70 trillion of assets and yes  they charge a fee ‚Äì a fee paid for ultimately by the public via the public‚Äôs savings and pension funds. One of the key factors concerning trust when buying and selling is to have comfort as regards the identity of the other party in a transaction.Previously  identify was more straight forward if the transaction took place face to face but  as more transactions happen on-line and often globally  the topic of identity becomes of greater importance. In the past we have relied on various forms of identity such as signatures  of which the world‚Äôs oldest known signature is believed to be Sumerian (now Iraq) in 3100 BC. And the earliest use of fingerprints to help identify someone is thought to date back to China‚Äôs Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) to help solve burglaries. In more recent times  fingerprints where used in 1901 in British courts as a means of identifying someone and have been used extensively since then by law enforcement agencies across the world.A more modern and increasingly common identity method is facial recognition  pioneered by an American  Woody Bledsoe in the 1960s  who managed to program a computer to review photos of  and divide a face into  common features. In Japan in 1973  Takeo Kanade used a computer to extract facial features such as the nose  mouth and eyes  and so gave birth to what we now know as facial biometric identification.As we glean more digital data and assets  a growing need for people to have a digital identity in order to be able to look after their data and privacy will no doubt develop. This type of identity offers us the potential to transact digitally ‚Äì such as using central bank digital currencies (CBDC) ‚Äì without allowing central bankers and governments to have privy to what we are spending  where  when and with whom.As users become comfortable with employing private keys  it ought to make the transition to holding and managing other digital assets (whether that be their health data  digital stock or cash) much easier. So  whilst not embracing digital assets as such  Apple does appear to be educating and introducing the world to the technology and procedures that digital asset users have been utilising themselves for a while.This could well be significant since Visa  Mastercard  PayPal and Apple Pay  to name just a few  already accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment on their platforms. If we are to see more countries issue CBDCs  then digital ¬£  $  ‚Ç¨  Yen  etc  could well become common place and indeed will if the promises of faster  more efficient transactions become a reality. After all  why would users wish to continue relying on other less expensive ways to pay for goods and services?,positive,0.62,0.38,0.0,mixed,0.17,0.13,0.71,True,English,"['crypto-style security', 'Apple', 'data', 'Apple Advanced Data Protection Source', 'vocabulary Safari screen Time', 'average daily time people', 'Apple card transactions maps', 'Advance Data Protection service', 'new Advanced Data Protection', 'public holding digital assets', 'Many mobile ‚Äòphone owners', '12-24 random string', '1.2 billion active iPhones', 'older internet technology', 'facial recognition ID', 'crazy crypto sector', 'many crypto investors', 'a quarter hours', 'H1 Bluetooth keys', 'new security feature', 'new security measure', 'big tech firms', '12-24 random words', 'law enforcement agents', '12-24 random passwords', 'private personal information', 'new ways', 'many jurisdictions', 'private keys', 'four hours', 'digital data', 'physical assets', 'crypto-style security', 'cryptographic security', 'security processes', 'digital equities', 'digital funds', 'digital gold', 'line data', 'data sets', 'health data', 'home data', 'customer data', 'bank account', 'user experience', 'techy friends', 'payment information', 'QuickType keyboard', 'Siri information', 'Wi-Fi passwords', 'vast improvement', 'court battle', 'rough shod', 'questionable means', 'long term', 'significant advancement', 'crypto users', 'third-party custodians', 'bank- i', 'two ways', 'laptop/mobile ‚Äòphone', 'Digital cash', 'digital messages', 'Apple Inc.', 'Apple iCloud', 'customers‚Äô data', 'challenges', 'privacy', 'lives', 'three', 'money', 'purse/wallet', 'voicemail', 'text', 'weather', 'topic', 'photos', 'encryption', 'majority', 'rest', 'world', 'lesson', 'cryptocurrencies', 'barriers', 'NFTs', 'UX', 'access', 'December', 'intention', 'mind', 'aside', 'contacts', 'calendars', 'keychain', 'W1', 'memoji', 'numbers', 'nightmare', 'future', 'FBI', 'governments', 'years', 'right', 'someone', 'face', 'legislation', 'possibility', 'trust', 'organisations', 'millions', 'procedures', 'effect', 'letters']",2022-12-14,2022-12-14,cityam.com

Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comfor your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.com Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Its 7.2 million ('members log in'+social media) users have access to ads posted by other members  a network that today represents the leading Global Standardized Marketplace¬Æ to buy and sell artworks at a fixed or bid price (auctions regulated by paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article L 321.3 of France's Commercial Code).Artmarket with its Artprice department  has been awarded the State label ""Innovative Company"" by the Public Investment Bank (BPI) (for the second time in November 2018 for a new period of 3 years) which is supporting the company in its project to consolidate its position as a global player in the market art.Artprice releases its 2022 Ultra-Contemporary Art Market Report:https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2022The Artprice 2022 half-year report: the art market returns to strong growth in the West:https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/global-art-market-in-h1-2022-by-artprice-comArtprice by Artmarket's 2020 Global Art Market Report published in March 2022:https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2021Artprice's 2020/21 Contemporary Art Market Report by Artmarket.com:https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2021Index of press releases posted by Artmarket with its Artprice department:serveur.serveur.com/Press_Release/pressreleaseEN.htmFollow all the Art Market news in real time with Artmarket and its Artprice department on Facebook and Twitter:www.facebook.com/artpricedotcom/ (over 5.9 million followers)twitter.com/artmarketdotcomtwitter.com/artpricedotcomDiscover the alchemy and universe of Artmarket and its artprice department https://www.artprice.com/video headquartered at the famous Organe Contemporary Art Museum ""The Abode of Chaos"" (dixit The New York Times): https://issuu.com/demeureduchaos/docs/demeureduchaos-abodeofchaos-opus-ix-1999-2013L'Obs - The Museum of the Future: https://youtu.be/29LXBPJrs-owww.facebook.com/la.demeure.du.chaos.theabodeofchaos999 (over 4 million followers)https://vimeo.com/124643720Contact Artmarket.com and its Artprice department - Contact: Thierry Ehrmann  ir@artmarket.comPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1967770/Artprice_Artist_Homepage.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1009603/Art_Market_logo.jpgSOURCE Artmarket.com",positive,0.99,0.01,0.0,mixed,0.72,0.21,0.07,True,English,"['new Artprice Artists Homepages', 'promising uptake stats', 'Artmarket.com', 'successful deployment', 'excellent outlook', 'art valuation', 'promise', 'grail', 'The new Artprice Artist Homepage', 'short data sample', 'average connexion time', 'official Google stats', 'evergreen content mode', 'vast educational resource', 'extensive UI/UX research', 'preferred entry points', 'methodical feedback retrieval', 'solid UI/UX approach', 'past two months', 'global art market', 'twelve principal countries', 'Art Market news', 'major network deployment', 'best possible navigation', 'substantial price increase', 'high-level external consultants', 'Art Market information', 'major Artprice overhaul', 'major deployment', 'enthusiastic feedback', 'complete overhaul', 'substantial contribution', 'essential points', 'new version', 'major boost', 'major accounts', '4th century', 'Wassily Kandinsky', 'beta testing', 'rigorous specifications', 'significant increase', 'good signs', 'one month', '28.8 million pages', 'exploration process', 'Googlebot user-agent', 'legal decision', 'paying directories', 'SEO terms', 'online indexation', 'thierry Ehrmann', 'different sites', 'foregone conclusion', 'adrenaline rush', 'different teams', 'several centuries', 'natural way', 'complex history', 'straightforward pedagogy', 'personalized recommendations', 'sophisticated subscriptions', 'precise specifications', 'similar processes', 'key role', '25th anniversary', 'innovative ergonomics', 'sophisticated system', 'privileged players', 'UX) design', 'UX Design', 'new users', 'Artmarket.com', 'world leader', 'largest number', 'Artprice.com', 'present day', ""800,000 Artists' Homepages"", 'direct result', 'Artprice tutorials', 'Artmarket databases', 'User Experience', 'Artprice databases', 'Artprice customers', '18 months', 'PARIS', 'Dec.', 'PRNewswire', 'primary', 'services', 'foundation', 'origin', 'creation', 'selection', 'target', 'visits', 'extension', 'ACT', 'future', 'November', 'Googlebots', 'user-agents', 'opening', 'works', 'heart', 'javascript', 'business', 'engines', 'consequence', 'turnover', 'millions', 'Founder', 'CEO', 'Everything', 'members', 'knowledge', '25 years', 'historians', 'editors', 'intuitive', 'exceptional', 'human', 'identity', 'confidence', 'GAFAs', 'access', 'relevant', 'discovery', 'change', 'beginning', 'revenue', 'request', 'proposals', 'demanding', 'references', 'audit', 'development', 'quality', 'efficiency', 'partnership', 'expectations', 'needs', 'signposts', 'mobile', 'tablet', 'PC/Mac', '2019']",2022-12-14,2022-12-14,prnewswire.co.uk

Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann   Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:‚ÄúAny major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.‚ÄùSee the new version of the Artist Homepage:https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ‚ÄúArtprice tutorials‚Äù that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ‚ÄúThis new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.‚ÄùThe new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice.

Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue.

Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual ‚Äòpremium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called ‚ÄòUX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ‚Äúformativity‚Äù (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a ‚Äòclimatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png ]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services : https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

14785,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-magistrate-tackling-eu-qatar-european-parliament-corruption-eva-kaili-michel-claise-prosecutor-roberta-metsola/,The crime-writing Belgian ‚Äòsheriff‚Äô fighting EU corruption,Crooked eurocrats beware: Michel Claise is on your case.,Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.One thing European parliamentarians should know about the man driving allegations of Qatari cash and influence peddling at the heart of the EU: He won‚Äôt stop.Also  they might end up as characters in a crime thriller  written by the person who locked them up.Belgian investigative magistrate Michel Claise  whose role is similar to that of a U.S. public prosecutor  was there on Saturday night  alongside the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola  when police raided the home of Belgian MEP Marc Tarabella. On Monday  as POLITICO reporters tried to find out which offices in the Parliament in Brussels were being raided in the escalating Qatari probe  security officers told them the ‚Äúmagistrate‚Äù was working inside.In a series of raids that continued Tuesday  Claise and his team has secured ‚Ç¨1.5 million in cash and arrested six people on preliminary charges of corruption  money laundering and criminal organization. One suspect is Eva Kaili  a Greek MEP who was one of the European Parliament‚Äôs vice presidents until she was stripped of that title Tuesday. The probe centers on a group who may have used their positions in parliament to promote Qatari interests. Kaili has said she is innocent and is due in court on Wednesday.If others are involved  they would do well to worry. In the endless corridors of the Palais de Justice in Brussels  Claise is known as ‚ÄúThe Sheriff‚Äù for his relentless pursuit of his targets. Perhaps most concerning for any MEPs and aides who may still be his crosshairs  is how much he appears to be enjoying himself. ‚ÄúBingo!‚Äù was his response to a successful raid on another case  he said in a recent interview: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot of fun.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs this ‚Äúexuberance ‚Äù that makes Claise stand out  said John Crombez  who was Belgium‚Äôs Secretary of State for combating fraud between 2011 and 2014.‚ÄúLots of others in this field are quiet and modest  he is not. And he shouldn‚Äôt be  I‚Äôve never experienced that as grandstanding ‚Äù Crombez told POLITICO. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like an investigative judge entertainer. That‚Äôs fantastic. He just waltzes over everything  and it all comes out of these deeply rooted social concerns. That‚Äôs what makes him so exceptional.‚ÄùA revolutionary humanistClaise‚Äôs biography reads like a crime-fighting prosecutor from central casting. His youthful parents abandoned him as a baby in a basket at his grandparents‚Äô bakery in the Brussels suburb of Anderlecht  he told Le Soir in 2020. He grew up cutting bread before school and scrambling to read as many books as he could. His father never wanted to be part of his life and his relationship with his mother  who is now dead  was ‚Äúextremely hard.‚ÄùHe cites French revolutionary humanist values as his guiding principles. For him  financial crime has destroyed fundamental aspects of society. ‚ÄúWhite-collar crime is the cancer of democracy ‚Äù Claise wrote in one of his books  ‚ÄúLe Forain‚Äù (The Showman).At the fashionable bookshop Filigranes  which serves the EU‚Äôs intellectual elite  you can find Claise‚Äôs novelizations of his own crime-fighting. ‚ÄúHe has two parts to his life: personal and professional ‚Äù said the owner of the bookshop Marc Filipson  a friend. ‚ÄúWhen he is here  he has no phone  nothing.‚ÄùClaise‚Äôs charge sheet is a who‚Äôs who of Belgian white collar crime across the past two decades: it includes local banks Fortis and Belgolaise and insurance company AGF  but also multinational companies and Belgian nobility. In 2019  he forced the U.K. bank HSBC to pay a Belgian record penalty of ‚Ç¨295 million for tax evasion  money laundering and other assorted crimes. Another nickname for Claise is ‚ÄòMr. Hundred Millions ‚Äô because of all the cash he has hauled back for the state.‚ÄúHe did not care at all about the order of magnitude of his opponents ‚Äù said Crombez. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how he operates: he doesn‚Äôt get scared easily.‚ÄùOperation ZeroClaise is known in Belgium for following through on cases  even those that are highly sensitive. His pursuit against money laundering gangs in Belgian football clubs  dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Zero ‚Äù shook up the entire football world  which is deeply intertwined with Belgian business and politics. Touchy diplomacy hasn‚Äôt perturbed him either  like issuing an international arrest warrant for the head of the Libyan Investment Authority because of their alleged links with Euroclear  a financial institution headquartered in Brussels.One of his biggest operations was overseeing the dismantling of encrypted service SKY ECC  which led to the arrests of dozens of drug traffickers and suspected criminals. The bust was the largest-ever by police and prosecutors against drug cartels in the country  which is a key traffic point for cocaine in Europe.Claise‚Äôs dramatic intervention has left the European institutions headquartered in Brussels scrambling to explain why it took a Belgian official to uncover corruption at the core of European democracy. A fleet of investigations is being launched amid calls for institutional reforms  including by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.His character and his public touting of his achievements are very un-Belgian  as Belgians are generally taught to be humble about any individual achievements. As the EU‚Äôs host country  it sometimes feels like Belgium is the David fighting the giants of Russian or Chinese espionage  terrorism or corruption in the international institutions they host.Now  the notoriety attracted by the investigation is giving the Belgians something to be proud of in the eyes of the world. For days  Belgian media have been all over the case  feasting on minute details ‚Äî including how long it took to count the vast quantity of seized cash ‚Äî some of which look like they could be straight out of one of Claise‚Äôs own crime novels.‚ÄúBelgian justice is doing what at first sight the European Parliament hasn‚Äôt done ‚Äù the country‚Äôs Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told reporters in his first comments on the scandal on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe European Parliament has a lot of means to regulate itself. It turns out that this is largely a system of self-regulation based on voluntary efforts  which has clearly not been sufficient.‚ÄùBut that peacocking would be ironic to Claise  who complained in October that Belgium‚Äôs police are under-resourced  fighting a war against modern  high-tech corruption using ‚Äúcatapults.‚Äù Earlier in the year  he said the Belgian government was ‚Äúon Xanax rather than Viagra.‚Äù Now it‚Äôs the European Parliament he has found dozing on the job.Clothilde Goujard  Pieter Haeck and Sarah-Ta√Øssir Bencharif contributed reporting.,negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.21,0.06,0.73,True,English,"['crime-writing Belgian ‚Äòsheriff', 'EU corruption', 'Belgian investigative magistrate Michel Claise', 'U.S. public prosecutor', 'French revolutionary humanist values', 'Belgian white collar crime', 'Belgian MEP Marc Tarabella', 'European Commission President Urs', 'investigative judge entertainer', 'U.K. bank', 'Belgian record penalty', 'Belgian football clubs', 'Palais de Justice', 'other assorted crimes', 'Mr. Hundred Millions', 'entire football world', 'international arrest warrant', 'Libyan Investment Authority', 'key traffic point', 'past two decades', 'money laundering gangs', 'escalating Qatari probe', 'Belgian nobility', 'Belgian business', 'Belgian official', 'Greek MEP', 'Marc Filipson', 'crime thriller', 'crime-fighting prosecutor', 'financial crime', 'White-collar crime', 'two parts', 'European parliamentarians', 'Qatari interests', 'European institutions', 'artificial intelligence', 'One thing', 'Saturday night', 'Roberta Metsola', 'security officers', 'six people', 'preliminary charges', 'criminal organization', 'One suspect', 'vice presidents', 'endless corridors', 'The Sheriff', 'successful raid', 'recent interview', 'social concerns', 'central casting', 'youthful parents', 'grandparents‚Äô bakery', 'Le Soir', 'guiding principles', 'fundamental aspects', 'The Showman', 'intellectual elite', 'charge sheet', 'local banks', 'insurance company', 'multinational companies', 'tax evasion', 'Operation Zero', 'Touchy diplomacy', 'alleged links', 'financial institution', 'biggest operations', 'encrypted service', 'SKY ECC', 'drug traffickers', 'drug cartels', 'dramatic intervention', 'institutional reforms', 'European democracy', 'Qatari cash', 'POLITICO reporters', 'Eva Kaili', 'relentless pursuit', 'many books', 'fashionable bookshop', 'John Crombez', 'Brussels suburb', 'Press', 'article', 'allegations', 'heart', 'characters', 'person', 'role', 'police', 'home', 'Monday', 'offices', 'series', 'raids', 'team', 'corruption', 'title', 'group', 'positions', 'court', 'Wednesday', 'others', 'targets', 'MEPs', 'aides', 'crosshairs', 'response', 'case', 'lot', 'exuberance', 'Belgium', 'Secretary', 'State', 'fraud', 'field', 'everything', 'biography', 'baby', 'basket', 'Anderlecht', 'bread', 'school', 'father', 'life', 'relationship', 'mother', 'society', 'cancer', 'Forain', 'Filigranes', 'novelizations', 'owner', 'friend', 'phone', 'Fortis', 'Belgolaise', 'AGF', 'HSBC', 'order', 'magnitude', 'opponents', 'politics', 'head', 'Euroclear', 'dismantling', 'arrests', 'dozens', 'criminals', 'bust', 'prosecutors', 'country', 'cocaine', 'core', 'fleet', 'investigations', 'calls']",2022-12-14,2022-12-14,politico.eu

Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022   Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.According to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:"" Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational. ""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros ). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022 ).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ( $1.62 billion ) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services : https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The IDMC assessment included an evaluation of interim efficacy and safety data from three-month data  with a total of 31 patients. Top-line data from the study is anticipated in the second half of 2023.‚ÄúWe are very pleased to continue the KALAHARI trial following the IDMC‚Äôs recommendation after their review of our interim data ‚Äù said Andy De Deene  MD  Chief Development Officer of Oxurion. ‚ÄúThis trial is evaluating THR-149 for the treatment of DME against the current standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. THR-149 could provide an important alternative for the up to 50% of patients with DME who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF.‚ÄùOxurion‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer  Tom Graney  CFA  added that ‚ÄúContinuing this trial based on the results of the interim analysis is a critical milestone for patients with DME  which is the leading cause of blindness in working-age people. We look forward to completing this study  which  if positive  would enable Phase 3 development that could position THR-149 as an important second line therapy in the $5+ billion global DME market.‚ÄùDiabetic Macular Edema (DME)Approximately 22 million people worldwide have DME  with prevalence increasing due to the growing global diabetic epidemic. DME is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  and the market for treatments is currently estimated at $5+ billion.Story continuesPeople who suffer from DME have leaking vessels in the back of the eye. This leakage leads to a thickening of the retina and causes vision problems. DME may cause blurriness in the center of vision  the appearance of dark spots or patches in the field of vision  and colors to look dull. These symptoms may affect the ability to read  write  drive  and recognize faces ‚Äì presenting a significant patient and caregiver burden.Current treatments for DME include inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  steroids and laser therapy. However  while anti-VEGF is the mainstay of therapy  up to 50% of patients do not respond optimally. Moreover  the treatment regimen itself presents a high burden: patients must have intravitreal injections on a frequent basis (can be as often as monthly)  resulting in a lack of compliance and an increase in loss of vision.About THR-149THR-149 is a bicyclic peptide that selectively inhibits human plasma kallikrein (PKal) with an inhibition constant of 0.22 nM. Through the inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS)  THR-149 prevents the induction of retinal vascular permeability  neurodegeneration  and inflammation.THR-149 is currently being evaluated in the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of DME.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part BPart B is the second part of the Phase 2 KALAHARI study  a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center study assessing multiple (3) injections of THR-149 in DME patients. Part B is double-masked and actively controlled  with the high dose of THR-149 selected from Part A of the trial being evaluated. Part B of the study is enrolling just over one hundred patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy  and where THR-149 is being evaluated against aflibercept  the current standard of care  as the active comparator.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part APart A of the KALAHARI study demonstrated that all dose levels of THR-149 had a favorable safety profile. All adverse events in the study eye were mild to moderate in intensity and no severe ocular adverse events were reported and no inflammation observed. High-level data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021  which demonstrated that the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  achieved a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint. A post-hoc analysis was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022 based on an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment.The masked reading center identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3  which was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial. The Month 6 data also demonstrated THR-149‚Äôs attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended study design excluding patients that would not respond to any treatment.

Quadient therefore confirms that there are now four international carriers that will be actively using Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers for their last and first mile deliveries  since the launch of the roll out of a UK open network announced in June. Global parcel delivery experts DPD UK and DHL have been the first carriers officially confirming their commitment to Quadient‚Äôs open network. The names of the two other international carriers will be confirmed in due course  as they make the new service available to their customers.The addition of a fourth international carrier to use Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers further demonstrates the relevance of Quadient‚Äôs open business model with delivery points available to all carriers  offering consumers more choice and convenience for parcel delivery and returns.

This new WAGABOX¬Æ unit will supply over 3 000 households  and avoid the emission of 3 300 metric tons of CO2eq into the atmosphere each year[1].Waga Energy (EPA: WAGA)  a specialist in Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) production from landfills  has signed a contract with Veolia  a major player in the green transformation  to produce RNG at the Granges landfill (Burgundy  France). The contract provides for Waga Energy to build an upgrading unit on the site using its proprietary WAGABOX¬Æ technology to convert the gas naturally produced by the breakdown of organic matter into RNG. The RNG will be directly injected into the pipeline operated by the French grid operator GRDF via a 2.5-mile connection.Through this new facility  the Granges landfill will supply 60 000 MMBtu (20 GWh) of RNG per year  equivalent to the consumption of 3 000 local households. It will avoid the emission of 3 300 tons of CO2eq per year into the atmosphere by substituting fossil-based natural gas. The Granges landfill receives 130 000 tons of non-hazardous waste per year from businesses and households. Landfill gas is currently upgraded by two power engines.Sixth project for Waga Energy and VeoliaThe WAGABOX¬Æ unit will be commissioned in the second quarter of 2024  replacing one of the power engines. It will guarantee higher energy efficiency and will supply renewable energy that is capable of replacing fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) for transportation and heating needs  which account for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions. The project will also help to improve the region‚Äôs energy independence amid tensions over natural gas imports into Europe.It is the sixth RNG production project undertaken by Waga Energy and Veolia in France. Three WAGABOX¬Æ units are currently in operation in Saint-Palais  Claye-Souilly and Le Ham  while two others are under construction. These six projects offer a combined installed capacity of 800 000 MMBtu (235 GWh) per year.Mathieu Lefebvre  CEO of Waga Energy: ‚ÄúThis sixth RNG project engaged with Veolia over the five past years proves our common commitment to the energy transition. We are very happy to be continuing this partnership with a world leader in waste management and recovery  which considers RNG a key part of its strategy.‚ÄùGuillaume Dury  Regional Director Bourgogne Auvergne Rh√¥ne Alpes: ‚ÄúConverting biogas captured at our landfills into RNG allows us to save natural resources and also provides a genuine alternative to importing fossil-based gas. As a green transformation player  Veolia seeks to develop practical regional solutions aimed at cutting carbon emissions and promoting sufficiency. The WAGABOX¬Æ technology is a perfect example of this‚Äù.Veolia and Renewable Natural Gas Veolia is now one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of energy from biogas  with 6 TWh of primary energy resources. A world leader in ecological transformation  Veolia aims to maximize biogas recovery in the form of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and to increase its global reserves  in a circular economy approach. The Group‚Äôs ambition is to become a leader in the RNG sector and further develop green energy production capacities to help in the fight against climate change.About Waga EnergyWaga Energy (EPA: WAGA) produces competitively priced Renewable Natural Gas (also known as ‚Äúbiomethane‚Äù) by upgrading landfill gas using a patented purification technology called WAGABOX¬Æ. The RNG produced is injected directly into the gas distribution networks that supply individuals and businesses  providing a substitute for natural gas. Waga Energy finances  builds and operates its WAGABOX¬Æ units under long-term contracts with landfill operators for the supply of raw gas  and generates income by selling the RNG it generated. Waga Energy operates fourteen WAGABOX¬Æ units in France  representing an installed capacity of 415 GWh/year. Fifteen units are under construction in France  Spain  Canada and the US. Each project initiated by Waga Energy contributes to the fight against global warming and helps the energy transition.

The IDMC assessment included an evaluation of interim efficacy and safety data from three-month data  with a total of 31 patients. Top-line data from the study is anticipated in the second half of 2023.‚ÄúWe are very pleased to continue the KALAHARI trial following the IDMC‚Äôs recommendation after their review of our interim data ‚Äù said Andy De Deene  MD  Chief Development Officer of Oxurion. ‚ÄúThis trial is evaluating THR-149 for the treatment of DME against the current standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. THR-149 could provide an important alternative for the up to 50% of patients with DME who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF.‚ÄùOxurion‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer  Tom Graney  CFA  added that ‚ÄúContinuing this trial based on the results of the interim analysis is a critical milestone for patients with DME  which is the leading cause of blindness in working-age people. We look forward to completing this study  which  if positive  would enable Phase 3 development that could position THR-149 as an important second line therapy in the $5+ billion global DME market.‚ÄùDiabetic Macular Edema (DME)Approximately 22 million people worldwide have DME  with prevalence increasing due to the growing global diabetic epidemic. DME is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  and the market for treatments is currently estimated at $5+ billion.People who suffer from DME have leaking vessels in the back of the eye. This leakage leads to a thickening of the retina and causes vision problems. DME may cause blurriness in the center of vision  the appearance of dark spots or patches in the field of vision  and colors to look dull. These symptoms may affect the ability to read  write  drive  and recognize faces ‚Äì presenting a significant patient and caregiver burden.Current treatments for DME include inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  steroids and laser therapy. However  while anti-VEGF is the mainstay of therapy  up to 50% of patients do not respond optimally. Moreover  the treatment regimen itself presents a high burden: patients must have intravitreal injections on a frequent basis (can be as often as monthly)  resulting in a lack of compliance and an increase in loss of vision.About THR-149THR-149 is a bicyclic peptide that selectively inhibits human plasma kallikrein (PKal) with an inhibition constant of 0.22 nM. Through the inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS)  THR-149 prevents the induction of retinal vascular permeability  neurodegeneration  and inflammation.THR-149 is currently being evaluated in the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF standard of care for treatment of DME.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part BPart B is the second part of the Phase 2 KALAHARI study  a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center study assessing multiple (3) injections of THR-149 in DME patients. Part B is double-masked and actively controlled  with the high dose of THR-149 selected from Part A of the trial being evaluated. Part B of the study is enrolling just over one hundred patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy  and where THR-149 is being evaluated against aflibercept  the current standard of care  as the active comparator.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part APart A of the KALAHARI study demonstrated that all dose levels of THR-149 had a favorable safety profile. All adverse events in the study eye were mild to moderate in intensity and no severe ocular adverse events were reported and no inflammation observed. High-level data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021  which demonstrated that the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149  achieved a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint. A post-hoc analysis was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022 based on an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment.The masked reading center identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3  which was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial.

The electric yard tractors will be used at Amazon's U.S. sites. ""This important electric yard tractor order by Amazon represents a significant milestone for GAUSSIN's revenue growth and global expansion. Amazon's choice of GAUSSIN is a recognition of the maturity of our turn-keyzero-emission solutions  and of our technical  functional  and design differentiators "" said Christophe Gaussin  CEO and President of GAUSSIN Group. ""We look forward to working with Amazon to help achieve their decarbonization goals."" The agreement with Amazon commits to delivering the electric yard tractors to Amazon sites in the United States beginning in 2023. They will be manufactured at GAUSSIN's facility in France  which currently has the capacity to produce 2 400 electric yard tractors per year. The order is subject to terms and conditions  including that it is cancellable without penalty for a specified period in advance of each tractor's scheduled delivery date. GAUSSIN NA is also planning to open a manufacturing facility in the U.S. in 2023 to begin transitioning to local fulfillment. A clean and flexible technology GAUSSIN vehicles are distinguished by their performance and modularity. The ATM¬Æ tractors are capable of towing loads of up to 38 tons  some of which will feature drive-by-wire capabilities. An ATM¬Æ 38T ""FULL ELEC"" yard tractors"" from the GAUSSIN logistics range to transport trailers and semi-trailersA step forward in the U.S. for GAUSSIN These orders represent a step towards expanding GAUSSIN's commercial and production footprint in North America. They follow previous orders from Plug Power and a series of strategic partnerships and commercial agreements in recent months with other North American companies  the first step in a large- scale deployment across the Atlantic. GAUSSIN NA has capitalized on recent U.S. federal and state government initiatives to provide financial incentives for electric trucks in the form of subsidies and tax breaks  the tightening of emission regulations  and falling battery prices. These developments provide growth opportunities for companies like GAUSSIN  by making the capital investment required to purchase electric trucks more attractive than their diesel counterparts. Warrants to subscribe for GAUSSIN shares Amazon will receive warrants without payment for up to 20% of GAUSSIN's fully diluted shares on a post- issuance basis as of the date of signing of the warrant issuance agreement  subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to be convened in 2023. Each warrant will entitle its holder to subscribe to one GAUSSIN share  subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The warrants  which do not represent a direct investment or acquisition of GAUSSIN shares by Amazon  will have a 10-year term from the date of their issuance after shareholder approval and will vest in three successive tranches based on payments by Amazon to GAUSSIN in connection with the orders during such term  with full vesting either if payments reach $500 million  or upon a change of control of GAUSSIN. The exercise price for the initial 15% of warrant coverage will be ‚Ç¨4.04 (i.e.  the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for the 30 trading days preceding this press release)  and the exercise price for the remaining 5% will be determined on the date on which payments made by AMAZON in connection with the orders result in the full vesting and exercisability of the initial 15% and will be equal to ninety percent (90%) of the 30-day VWAP preceding such date. The theoretical dilution on the shareholding of a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of GAUSSIN prior to the exercise of all the warrants (calculated on the basis of the number of shares representing the share capital of GAUSSIN as of that date) would be as follows: 0.80% (and 0.75% on a diluted basis).

14831,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-kept-promise-confirms-064500754.html,Artmarket.com has kept its promise and confirms the successful deployment of its new Artprice Artists Homepages  with already promising uptake stats and an excellent outlook for 2023 as we progress toward the grail of art valuation.,Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's...,"PARIS  Dec. 14  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Our new version of 800 000 Artists' Homepages from the 4th century to the present day  bolsters the primary and preferred entry points to all of Artprice's databases and services because artists indeed are the foundation on which the art market has been based since its origin.The new Artprice Artist Homepage: featuring Wassily KandinskyWith this new version ‚Äì the most successful since Artprice's creation ‚Äì Artprice by Artmarket has received enthusiastic feedback over the past two months from a selection of target users throughout the global art market's twelve principal countries. Our beta testing was accompanied by a methodical feedback retrieval based on rigorous specifications designed by the team of external consultants involved in the complete overhaul of Artprice.com over 18 months.First of all  on a short data sample  Artprice observed a very significant increase in visits to its site  as well as an extension of the average connexion time (ACT)  especially on its databases  all good signs for the future of Artmarket.com.Similarly  according to official Google stats for November 2022  Googlebots have indicated that its user-agents over one month indexed 28.8 million pages in the Artprice by Artmarket databases  i.e. 960 000 per day.As a result of this major deployment and the opening of Artprice databases to crawling Googlebots (exploration process)  the number of Artists' Homepages and their works (which are the heart of Artprice by Artmarket) crawled has risen from 0.96 to 2.5 million per day in evergreen content mode (Googlebot user-agent allowing it to execute javascript).A direct result of a well-considered business and legal decision to open its non-paying directories to indexing engines  this increase represents  in SEO terms  a major boost to our online indexation.The consequence will therefore be a very substantial contribution to turnover in 2023 because Artprice by Artmarket.com  as the world leader in Art Market information  has by far the largest number of artists and artworks in its databases  numbering in the tens of millions.Story continuesAccording to thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com:""Any major network deployment on our different sites/countries is never a foregone conclusion and it's always an adrenaline rush for our different teams (myself included) when we switch to such a substantially new version of Artmarket.com. Everything went remarkably well and this new version is now 100% operational.""See the new version of the Artist Homepage: https://www.artprice.com/artist/15079/wassily-kandinskyThus  Artprice customers and members will discover  from the Artists' Homepages  several centuries of knowledge that have been organized for 25 years by the historians and editors of Artprice by Artmarket. In a perfectly intuitive and natural way  they will now be able to immerse themselves in the exceptional and complex history of the Art Market  via a human and straightforward pedagogy that is specific to the identity of Artprice. This will give them a level of confidence  which is often lacking in the world of GAFAs.These Artists' Homepages will allow users access to very relevant and personalized recommendations to pursue their discovery of the Art Market and thus generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore more turnover for Artmarket.com.As previously announced  this change ‚Äì implemented after extensive UI/UX research ‚Äì comes ahead of a substantial price increase at the beginning of 2023 and is aimed at boosting Artmarket.com's revenue.Following a request for proposals with demanding and precise specifications at the end of 2019  Artprice by Artmarket selected a team of very high-level external consultants with references from major accounts with similar processes to those of Artprice. This team has played a key role in the audit and development of this major Artprice overhaul  using a solid UI/UX approach.The quality and efficiency of the work conducted by our consultants have prompted Artprice by Artmarket to extend the partnership to 2023  which will mark Artprice's 25th anniversary.As a result of the UI/UX approach  new users of Artprice by Artmarket will be able to explore a vast educational resource quickly and intuitively via innovative ergonomics designed per the expectations and needs of users.The experience now involves ""Artprice tutorials"" that constantly guide navigation by providing information on the essential points to be discovered. These tutorials represent a highly sophisticated system of signposts that allow the user the best possible navigation as quickly as possible.As a result  customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket will intuitively dive into the heart of Art Market news and will feel like privileged players.We used User Experience (UX) design to enhance the experience of Artprice customers and members as much as possible; to make it as pleasant and intuitive as possible  whether on mobile  tablet  or PC/Mac.Thanks to UX Design  navigation on our site is now more fluid and more efficient. UX Design is particularly sensitive to eliminating the feeling of being lost  and this has involved a careful analysis of the irrational and emotive aspects of navigation within the Artprice universe.We used UI Design (User Interface design) to enhance users' interaction with Artprice databases and services. UI analysis has been involved in all stages of development up to final deployment and will continue to play a role in the permanent monitoring of the public operation phase.Unlike UX  UI is more focused on the visual aspect to attract the user's eye and to encourage Artprice users to remain on the various databases and services.The UI approach has facilitated navigation through all of Artprice's decision support tools. Its primary objective is to attract new prospects and customers  enthusiasts  collectors  and art market professionals. Thus  Artprice has modified its R&D policy by collaborating in a highly selective manner with the very best consultants in the field to acquire new market share.thierry Ehrmann: ""This new policy of collaborating with specialized consultants with fresh perspectives provides a definite gain in time and competitiveness for Artprice which  until recently  has always managed its new developments internally. In this digital century  you have to know how to adapt and change very quickly. Of course  Artprice's original computer programming is not subject to any outsourcing.""The new deployment implies a complete change in our economic model  notably by fully integrating paying advertisers into our databases and services.These are essentially the 6 500 auction houses around the world ‚Äì affiliated with Artprice for over two decades ‚Äì and which now spend 98% of their communication budgets (to announce upcoming sales) on Internet advertising.These 6 500 historical partner Auction Houses actively collaborated over the last 18 months development phase of this latest version of Artprice. They are of course aware that it is in their interest to collaborate with Artprice as it will draw attention with discreet and effective prestige to their future sales. This in turn will generate new recurring income for Artprice via its proprietary Intranet - a real reference tool for Auction Houses around the world for 25 years used to appraise  price and edit their digital and paper sales catalogs.They can now benefit by being featured on the Artists Homepage as a paying advertiser and with the aid of search criteria of 7.2 million Artprice clients and members  be able to promote their future sales with extremely relevant targeting  while being in perfect compliance with European and American regulations on confidentiality and the protection of personal data.Indeed  a 'public sale' is above all dependent on a very precise corpus of artists whose works 'ultimately' form the basis of the catalog of the public sale.On average over the past 50 years  auction houses have spent 34% of their overall costs on advertising future sales at public auctions  regardless of the country or the size of the auction business.As auctions are now advertised almost exclusively on the Internet  pressure from Artprice-affiliated auction houses in 2022 to promote their future sales for a fee has found the best response with this successful new deployment of our Artists' Homepages.Indeed  the auction houses consider it perfectly logical to spend their future sales advertising budgets (amounting to 34% of the costs of the sale) on the Internet  rather than on expensive and non-computer-targeted newspaper advertising  as the former targets specifically the profiles of collectors who follow specific artists.Sellers of art are willing to invest 34% of their overall budgets on advertising because they want the works they offer for sale to fetch the best prices. Above all  they want to avoid unsold lots which can undermine the value of the works in future sales.In the past  Artprice considered online advertising (banners  etc.) as incompatible with its databases  in terms of readability and reputation. It was therefore a major challenge to respond to the demand from Auction Houses while maintaining Artprice's original DNA.In this new successful deployment  for the announcement of their future sales  the 6 500 Auction Houses will be able to integrate and merge into the entire industrial process of Artprice by Artmarket  via the new Artists Homepages and via the alerts sent to Artprice's 7.2 million customers and members (by SMS  RSS  instant messaging  e-mail  my artists' page  etc.).It is now possible that future revenue generated from the promotion of upcoming sales by the 6 500 auction houses (advertisers affiliated with Artprice since 1997) will ultimately generate higher revenue than subscriptions  which currently represent 90% of Artprice's revenue. Artprice by Artmarket.com's plan is clearly to double its revenue by responding to a long-standing demand from its partner auction houses.It should be noted that Artprice's economic outlook is primarily based on incoming requests from auction houses/auctioneers  and not outgoing in prospecting mode  which makes all the difference in terms of human resources and financial costs.The success of this major deployment will therefore substantially contribute to a smooth acceptance of the significant increase in prices of subscriptions and services at the beginning of January 2023.With this major revamp of our website and our economic model  Artprice also aims to reposition artists at the heart of the art market by introducing the production of Art NFTs  which are one of the foundations of Web 3.0.This tremendous overhaul of Artprice by Artmarket.com will also highlight Artprice's proprietary archive of manuscripts and original printed auction catalogs (the largest in the world) dating back to 1700. This archive  in turn  legitimizes its digital standardization of the Art Market and bolsters its position as World Leader in Art Market Information for 25 years.Since 1997 Artprice's primary ambition has been to foster art market transparency by expanding knowledge from a circle of insiders to the general population to facilitate its development and growth. The new presentation of Artprice by Artmarket will enhance this transparency through access to verified  verifiable  and above all contextualized data.At the end of January 2023 when the redesigned homepage is online  Artprice customers and members will be able to virtually visit all of its ultra-secure document collections  manuscripts  and annotated catalogs. This section is currently being produced and filmed to showcase Artprice's multiple skills.In an all-digital era  this gives Artprice customers and members a unique layer of additional confidence. Artprice has been a Pure Internet Player since 1997 (with its parent company Serveur Groupe  which has been on the Internet since 1987)  whose knowledge and processes are based on a core of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and original auction catalogs going back over 300 years (and valued in Artmarket.com's balance sheet at 16 million euros). These documents represent the entire History of the Art Market since its birth.Artprice's position as World Leader in Art Market Information has also been forged by our acquisition of a large number of well-known specialist art and art-price publishers  as well as numerous prestigious editorial archives in Europe and the USA during its first ten years of activity (see our Universal Registration Document (URD) filed each year with the AMF).Our new Artists Homepages highlight the wealth and high-added value of Artmarket.com's databases and services. The use of algorithmic AI (Artificial Intelligence) allows the 7.2 million customers and members of Artprice by Artmarket access to highly relevant and personalized recommendations  and it allows them to deepen their knowledge of the art market. It will therefore generate more sophisticated subscriptions and hence more revenue.Artprice by Artmarket in 2023: toward the Grail of Art Market expertiseOne of Artprice by Artmarket.com's objectives is to roll out  in 2023  a premium professional subscription above ‚Ç¨1 800. Artprice  with its globally unique editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity can use the repeat sales method to retrace the progression of a unique (and therefore homogeneous) work through the decades  centuries  countries  and current or past auction houses.In terms of art valuation  this service represents an absolute grail and it will be the basis for a premium subscription that only Artprice by Artmarket is capable of producing  based on its editorial collection covering over 300 years of art market activity  combined with its Big Data analysis capacity and its highly sophisticated proprietary econometric tools.Note that with just one single relevant request on Artprice  a subscriber can justify the price of an annual 'premium' subscription  which is not necessarily the case for all professional databases.In addition  our new Artists Homepages bring Artprice by Artmarket customers and members fully into the world of Web 3.0 and ‚Äì by extension ‚Äì into the domain of Art NFTs  thereby giving Artmarket.com a considerable lead in its core business.With cryptocurrencies  Art NFTs  and the Metaverse  new collectors and art enthusiasts have arrived  often considerably younger than their predecessors. There are now more than 450 million potential buyers of Art NFTs. These art enthusiasts and collectors have no intention of abandoning their Web 3.0 crypto-universe  which is indisputably the future of the Internet.This overhaul includes  of course  the arrival of Art NFTs  the growth of which is exponential and constitutes a paradigm shift for artists in the art market who find themselves once again masters of their destiny  as was the case during the Renaissance.All of the art market's market-makers  and in particular the majority of its auction houses around the world  now have an NFT department for cataloged and online sales throughout the year. Likewise  all the major structures in the museum/art galleries industry are starting to publish their own NFTs.With its globally unique specificities  Artprice now has ambitions to capture the market for the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs via legitimate and fair market competition.In preparation for this major and successful revamp of our site and our model Artprice and its consultants had the opportunity to conduct a series of interviews and user tests (so-called 'UX/UI guerilla testing') with its historical clients and its new customers and members. This opportunity was provided by the Covid lockdowns since many of our customers found themselves with more time on their hands than usual.thierry Ehrmann  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  also emphasizes the eco-responsible aspect of Artprice's latest deployments: ""Since 2017 we have been developing processes to optimize the use of our servers by adapting the energy requirement and reducing the energy consumption of Artprice's Data Centers worldwide by 40% in 2022  and a target of a 50% reduction in 2023. This has been achieved by using the principle of micro-grids which allow better exploitation of production units (a multiple technologies decision) and the use of mainly renewable energies.Through its commitment to the micro-grid  the Artprice by Artmarket Data Centers are part of a responsible and shared environmental logic (without risk for Artprice's processing requirements) which involves analyzing the evolution of renewable energies concerning new applied sciences and ongoing research according to the principle of ""formativity"" (notion coined by Luigi Pareyson).Given the generous geography of our head office (Domaine de la Source  built in 1630)  we are developing  with partners  a 'climatic' system based on the technique of artesian wells which capture water from deep layers of subsoil. This system will be protected by patents that will be filed by Artprice and Groupe Serveur  and it will respond in an ecologically responsible manner to the current energy crisis which is far more serious than the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and is only just beginning.As a global leader  Artprice considers eco-responsibility a philosophical and moral obligation. It is coherent with our market position  our corporate culture  and the sentiments of our customers and shareholders.Artprice by Artmarket's offer will remain highly competitive even after the January 2023 price increase  with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Artprice's databases are today unquestionably the most comprehensive in the world with nearly 800 000 artists referenced with their biographies  auction results  indices  decision-making help tools  signatures & monograms  and information about past and future sales. In total  this adds up to several tens of millions of inter-connected and high-value-added data logs  all protected by various intellectual property rights.Artmarket.com has been profitable for a decade  so the bulk of the additional revenue will translate into additional net income because under the French fiscal regime  we can generate up to 90 million euros p/a without incurring additional tax charges.Despite the substantial price increase  Artprice by Artmarket's offer remains by far the best-placed compared with the slowly evolving offer from our competition which offers limited-search annual professional subscriptions (e.g. 150 queries for ‚Ç¨350/year  450 queries for ‚Ç¨975/year and  in the event of overrun  ‚Ç¨2.45 per search). (Information certified by Court Bailiff in November 2022).In the world of ""unlimited"" offers  these offers are quite simply anachronistic. Moreover  the competition's offer is based on data regarding only 330 000 artists and from a selection of only 1 600 auction houses  whereas Artprice by Artmarket covers 800 000 artists and 6 400 auction houses  with unlimited subscriptions from ‚Ç¨265 to ‚Ç¨529/year including a range of indices  decision-making tools and signatures & monograms that is unique in the world.In short  Artprice's offer will remain highly competitive even after the fee increase and with a further margin for additional price rises in the future.Going forward  our indisputable position as World Leader in Art Market Information since 1997 should enable Artprice to generate additional income through annual price increases  justified as required  notably by the constant enrichment of its various databases with at least one million ultra-qualified data logs added every year for its customers. Because Artprice provides its customers with essential data that cannot be found anywhere else.The Art Market is displaying insolent health  with regular records hammered across all artistic periods during recent sales in 2022 and  very likely  in future sales during 2023.Somewhat counter-intuitively ‚Äì given the geopolitical and economic context ‚Äì the global art market is displaying insolent health  with regular auction records being hammered for works from all artistic periods  regardless of the country  during recent sales sessions. And there have been no cancellations of classic and/or prestige cataloged sales for 2022 or 2023 which are the main indicators of the Art Market.The major auction houses and investors are well aware that art is a safe-haven investment  as shown by the Artprice100¬© index  which has outperformed traditional stock market indices. The current period of stock market jitters has channeled new funds and investments into the art market.Artprice had already noted that during the main crises of the past (the Nasdaq crash in 2000  9/11 in 2001  the Afghan war in 2001  the Iraq war in 2003  the subprime and CDS crises in 2007  the negative rates crisis in 2011  the 2019 Covid crisis  etc.) the art market was less impacted than other markets and the economy.Christie's recent dispersal of the Paul Allen collection proves this point very firmly by turning a new page in the history of auctions. It was the first private collection to generate over one billion dollars at auction ($1.62 billion) with five works selling above the $100 million threshold.This new record follows one set by Christie's competitor Sotheby's when it took $922 million from the sale of the Macklowe Collection between autumn 2021 and spring 2022.Thanks to the dispersion of these exceptional American collections  the year 2022 has become an outstanding year in the history of public sales.As we approach the end of 2022  it is abundantly clear that the war on European soil and fears of a recession have not got the better of the Art Market.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/12/tablette-page-artiste_en.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

When Dr. Goran Stojmenovik retires as chair  it will see the end of Barco's eight-year run heading the industry body. The previous chair  Jan Daem  was also from Barco. A founding member of LIPA in 2011  Barco still intends to play ""a very active role"" moving forward.Educating the marketLIPA's role is to present the world with a single industry voice when it comes to rationalizing laser regulations. One example is the governmental regulations that put onerous and costly requirements on the cinema exhibitors that integrate laser engines into their projectors. LIPA has had some success with better explaining the industry's position  noting that regulators prefer that the industry stakeholders speak with a single unified voice.Stojmenovik's tenure was marked by what he calls ""market education""  providing science-based responses to regulatory issues. These have included articles  interviews  webinars  white papers and blog articles. ""This body of work now constitutes a bank of material for rationalization and education around technical and regulatory topics "" according to Stojmenovik.LIPA also worked the optical hazard department of the FDA in the US. This led to the easing of some requirements for laser illuminated projectors  notably reducing their minimum height from 3 meters to 2.5 in some cases. ""The goal was to avoid people getting the light in their eyes from too close "" he says. ""The requirement is there for safety purposes  which we understand. But it also has to be rational.""""Engaging with the community""The Covid restrictions also provided a challenge  with LIPA struggling to continue ""engaging with the LIPA community"" during lockdown. The annual general and board meetings of 2020 and 2021 were moved online. Webinars kept people in touch and the ten-year celebration of LIPA was done online.Aptly  Barco's eight-year chairmanship of LIPA will close with the 2023 board and annual general meetings that it will host at its campus in Kortrijk  Belgium.Looking aheadOver the last four years  LIPA's membership fluctuated with comings and goings but has remained stable overall. Stojmenovik can still see lots of work for the body over the next four years. ""All the standards governing laser projections - notably cinema - are up for review. So it's important the industry's voice is heard."" He compares it to the early days of LIPA when legislation and standards were being written worldwide. Now new standards are appearing  notably in emerging markets. ""We need to follow these developments. A lot has changed in the laser market  so it's not easy to predict what will happen.""About BarcoBarco is a global technology leader that develops networked visualization solutions for the entertainment  enterprise  and healthcare markets.

In the three programmes assessed by CDP  the Jer√≥nimo Martins Group was awarded the top score (A) in the first two (climate change and water) and leadership level (A-) in managing all the commodities associated with deforestation risk: palm oil  timber  cattle and soy. No other food retailer  worldwide  achieved such a high score.Pedro Soares dos Santos  Chairman and CEO of the Jer√≥nimo Martins Group states that ""the consolidation of our leadership position worldwide in these challenges shows that we are on the right track in the sustainable management of our businesses and that the transparency with which we report on our activities and their impacts is widely recognised. It is with great satisfaction  and also with a reinforced sense of responsibility  that we receive the good news the CDP annual assessments have brought us. This year we are celebrating our Group's 230 anniversary and I'm certain that only companies with a very strong commitment to the economic  social and environmental sustainability of their business  with societies and also with the planet  are able to achieve such longevity.""Maxfield Weiss  Executive Director of CDP Europe said: ""CDP saw nearly 20 000 companies disclose environmental data this year  including 70% of European companies by market value. COP27 showed the need for transformational change is more critical than ever if we are to limit warming to 1.5 ¬∞C. We must cut emissions by half and eliminate deforestation by 2030  alongside achieving water security on the same timescale. CDP A-list companies are showing that they are ahead of the game - taking clear actions to reduce emissions and to address environmental impacts throughout their value chains. This is the type of environmental transparency and action we need economy-wide to prevent ecological collapse.

(the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  today will host a live webcast reviewing updated clinical data on its Phase 1/2a BALLI-01 clinical trial (evaluating UCART22) and on its Phase 1 AMELI-01 clinical trial (evaluating UCART123) that were presented in an oral session on December 12  2022 at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).Preliminary Data from the BALLI-01 Clinical StudyBALLI-01 is a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of UCART22 given at escalating dose levels after lymphodepletion (LD) with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). Alemtuzumab was added to the LD regimen to sustain host T-cell and Natural Killer (NK) cell depletion and to promote UCART22 cell expansion and persistence.Compared to the last clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  the webcast presented data from five additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3) 5x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FCA. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)  Grade 2 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or adverse events of special interest (AESI) were observed.Evidence of UCART22 anti-tumor activity was observed in 60% (n=3) of the five patients at DL3 after lymphodepletion with FCA:A patient experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi) that continues beyond 6 months.A patient experienced an MRD negative complete response (CR) that continues beyond Day 56.A patient experienced a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) that continues beyond Day 84 (MRD-negative until Day 84; MRD-positive at Day 117).All three of the responders failed multiple lines of prior therapy including chemotherapy  CD19-directed autologous CAR T cell therapy  and allogeneic stem cell transplant. Additionally  the patient with the MRD negative CR also failed both prior blinatumomab (a CD19-directed bi-specific antibody) and inotuzumab (a CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugate).‚ÄúThese treatment responses in combination with the safety data are very encouraging for patients with r/r B-cell ALL who have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant ‚Äù said Nitin Jain  M.D.  The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  Department of Leukemia  and coordinating investigator for the BALLI-01 study.Next StepsOverall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART22 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r ALL. The Company is now enrolling patients in BALLI-01 with product candidate manufactured fully in-house at DL2 after FCA lymphodepletion. The first patient has been dosed at dose level 2 (DL2) 1x106 cells/kg. The next data set is expected to be released in 2023.Preliminary Clinical Data from the AMELI-01 Study Presented at ASH 2022AMELI-01 is a Phase 1 open-label dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety  tolerability  expansion and preliminary activity of UCART123 given at escalating dose levels after lymphodepletion (LD) with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML).The oral presentation reviewed preliminary data from patients who received UCART123 at one of the following dose levels: dose level 1 (DL1) 2.5x105 cells/kg; dose level 2 (DL2) 6.25x105 cells/kg; intermediate dose level 2 (DL2i) 1.5x106 cells/kg; or dose level 3 (DL3) 3.30x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FC ([n=8]  DL1 ‚Äì DL3) or FCA ([n=9]  DL2 & DL2i).Preliminary Safety DataThe FCA LD regimen resulted in robust lymphodepletion for greater than 28 days in all patients. Seven out of nine patients demonstrated UCART123 expansion  with maximum concentration (C max) ranging from 13 177 to 330 530 copies/Œºg DNA  an almost nine-fold increase compared with FC LD  and a significant increase in area under the curve (AUC)(0-28 days) (p=0.04; FC 10.2¬±15.7 vs. FCA 34.9¬±28.4).Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in eight patients in the FC arm and nine patients in the FCA arm. In the FC arm  one patient experienced Grade 3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and two patients experienced Grade 4 protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) secondary to CRS. In the FCA arm  two patients experienced Grade 5 DLTs secondary to CRS. Grade 4 toxicities are potentially life threatening and Grade 5 toxicities result in death.Preliminary Efficacy DataEvidence of UCART123 anti-tumor activity was observed in four patients out of fifteen at DL2 or above with best overall responses in the FCA arm. Two out of eight patients (25%) at DL2 with FCA arm achieved meaningful response:A patient who failed five prior lines of therapy experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) with full count recovery at Day 56 that continues beyond one year.A patient with stable disease achieved greater than 90% bone marrow blast reduction (60% to 5%) at Day 28.‚ÄúExemplary activity was seen in a 64-year-old female with AML who had relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and has maintained a durable MRD-negative complete response for over one year without salvage donor lymphocyte infusion or second allo-SCT ‚Äù said David A. Sallman  M.D.  Moffit Cancer Center  Department of Malignant Hematology  Tampa  FL. ‚ÄúOverall  these encouraging clinical data are a meaningful step forward for patients and support further enrollment into the study. This trial addresses a patient population with severe unmet medical need  where a successful CAR T-cell product candidate could be a major breakthrough.‚ÄùThe preliminary data show that adding alemtuzumab to the FC LD regimen was associated with sustained lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  which correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.Next Steps: 2-Dose RegimenOverall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML. Based on observed UCART123 expansion patterns and cytokine profiles  pursuant to an amended protocol (as described below)  a second dose of UCART123 will be given after 10-14 days to allow for additional UCART123 expansion and clinical activity without the use of additional lymphodepletion. The second expansion phase in the setting of reduced disease burden is expected to be safe and allow for clearance of residual disease.After a protocol-based pause in patient recruitment following a Grade 5 event related to CRS  the protocol treatment strategy has been modified and AMELI-01 has now commenced enrolling patients in the FCA 2-dose regimen arm at DL2  a dose that has already been administered and cleared for safety as a single dose. The arm incorporates the use of prophylactic tocilizumab  which is associated with reduced incidence of CRS.A copy of the ASH oral presentation is available on Cellectis‚Äô website.‚ÄúThese clinically meaningful preliminary data from both the BALLI-01 and AMELI-01 studies are very encouraging for patients and for the future of allogeneic CART-cell therapy.

(the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  today will host a live webcast reviewing updated clinical data on its Phase 1/2a BALLI-01 clinical trial (evaluating UCART22) and on its Phase 1 AMELI-01 clinical trial (evaluating UCART123) that were presented in an oral session on December 12  2022 at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).Preliminary Data from the BALLI-01 Clinical StudyBALLI-01 is a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of UCART22 given at escalating dose levels after lymphodepletion (LD) with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). Alemtuzumab was added to the LD regimen to sustain host T-cell and Natural Killer (NK) cell depletion and to promote UCART22 cell expansion and persistence.Compared to the last clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  the webcast presented data from five additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3) 5x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FCA. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)  Grade 2 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS)  immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or adverse events of special interest (AESI) were observed.Evidence of UCART22 anti-tumor activity was observed in 60% (n=3) of the five patients at DL3 after lymphodepletion with FCA:A patient experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi) that continues beyond 6 months.A patient experienced an MRD negative complete response (CR) that continues beyond Day 56.A patient experienced a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) that continues beyond Day 84 (MRD-negative until Day 84; MRD-positive at Day 117).All three of the responders failed multiple lines of prior therapy including chemotherapy  CD19-directed autologous CAR T cell therapy  and allogeneic stem cell transplant. Additionally  the patient with the MRD negative CR also failed both prior blinatumomab (a CD19-directed bi-specific antibody) and inotuzumab (a CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugate).‚ÄúThese treatment responses in combination with the safety data are very encouraging for patients with r/r B-cell ALL who have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant ‚Äù said Nitin Jain  M.D.  The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  Department of Leukemia  and coordinating investigator for the BALLI-01 study.Next StepsOverall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART22 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r ALL. The Company is now enrolling patients in BALLI-01 with product candidate manufactured fully in-house at DL2 after FCA lymphodepletion. The first patient has been dosed at dose level 2 (DL2) 1x106 cells/kg. The next data set is expected to be released in 2023.Preliminary Clinical Data from the AMELI-01 Study Presented at ASH 2022AMELI-01 is a Phase 1 open-label dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety  tolerability  expansion and preliminary activity of UCART123 given at escalating dose levels after lymphodepletion (LD) with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML).The oral presentation reviewed preliminary data from patients who received UCART123 at one of the following dose levels: dose level 1 (DL1) 2.5x105 cells/kg; dose level 2 (DL2) 6.25x105 cells/kg; intermediate dose level 2 (DL2i) 1.5x106 cells/kg; or dose level 3 (DL3) 3.30x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FC ([n=8]  DL1 ‚Äì DL3) or FCA ([n=9]  DL2 & DL2i).Preliminary Safety DataThe FCA LD regimen resulted in robust lymphodepletion for greater than 28 days in all patients. Seven out of nine patients demonstrated UCART123 expansion  with maximum concentration (C max) ranging from 13 177 to 330 530 copies/Œºg DNA  an almost nine-fold increase compared with FC LD  and a significant increase in area under the curve (AUC)(0-28 days) (p=0.04; FC 10.2¬±15.7 vs. FCA 34.9¬±28.4).Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in eight patients in the FC arm and nine patients in the FCA arm. In the FC arm  one patient experienced Grade 3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and two patients experienced Grade 4 protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) secondary to CRS. In the FCA arm  two patients experienced Grade 5 DLTs secondary to CRS. Grade 4 toxicities are potentially life threatening and Grade 5 toxicities result in death.Preliminary Efficacy DataEvidence of UCART123 anti-tumor activity was observed in four patients out of fifteen at DL2 or above with best overall responses in the FCA arm. Two out of eight patients (25%) at DL2 with FCA arm achieved meaningful response:A patient who failed five prior lines of therapy experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) with full count recovery at Day 56 that continues beyond one year.A patient with stable disease achieved greater than 90% bone marrow blast reduction (60% to 5%) at Day 28.‚ÄúExemplary activity was seen in a 64-year-old female with AML who had relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and has maintained a durable MRD-negative complete response for over one year without salvage donor lymphocyte infusion or second allo-SCT ‚Äù said David A. Sallman  M.D.  Moffit Cancer Center  Department of Malignant Hematology  Tampa  FL. ‚ÄúOverall  these encouraging clinical data are a meaningful step forward for patients and support further enrollment into the study. This trial addresses a patient population with severe unmet medical need  where a successful CAR T-cell product candidate could be a major breakthrough.‚ÄùThe preliminary data show that adding alemtuzumab to the FC LD regimen was associated with sustained lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  which correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.Next Steps: 2-Dose RegimenOverall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML. Based on observed UCART123 expansion patterns and cytokine profiles  pursuant to an amended protocol (as described below)  a second dose of UCART123 will be given after 10-14 days to allow for additional UCART123 expansion and clinical activity without the use of additional lymphodepletion. The second expansion phase in the setting of reduced disease burden is expected to be safe and allow for clearance of residual disease.After a protocol-based pause in patient recruitment following a Grade 5 event related to CRS  the protocol treatment strategy has been modified and AMELI-01 has now commenced enrolling patients in the FCA 2-dose regimen arm at DL2  a dose that has already been administered and cleared for safety as a single dose. The arm incorporates the use of prophylactic tocilizumab  which is associated with reduced incidence of CRS.A copy of the ASH oral presentation is available on Cellectis‚Äô website.‚ÄúThese clinically meaningful preliminary data from both the BALLI-01 and AMELI-01 studies are very encouraging for patients and for the future of allogeneic CART-cell therapy. Both ALL and AML are diseases with an urgent need for alternative treatment options for patients  and we are excited to be moving each of these studies forward ‚Äù said Dr. Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis. ‚ÄúWe are now implementing a two-dose regimen arm for our AMELI-01 trial  as well as enrolling patients with in-house manufactured product for our BALLI-01 trial.

ENDS About Spasticity Spasticity is a condition in which there is an abnormal increase in muscle tone or stiffness in one or more muscles  which might interfere with movement. Spasticity is usually caused by damage to nerve pathways in the brain or spinal cord that control muscle movement  and may occur in association with cerebral palsy  spinal cord injury  multiple sclerosis  stroke  and brain or head trauma. In adults  approximately one in three stroke patients  one in three patients with spinal cord injury  one in six patients with traumatic brain injury  and two in three patients with MS will develop lower limb spasticity. About Dysport Dysport¬Æ (abobotulinumtoxinA) is an injectable form of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) product  which is a substance derived from Clostridium bacteria producing BoNT-A that inhibits the effective transmission of nerve impulses and thereby reduces muscular contractions. It is supplied as a lyophilized powder. AbobotulinumtoxinA has marketing authorization in more than 90 countries  more than 30 years of clinical experience and 6 million treatment years of patient experience. The detailed recommendations for the use of Dysport are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Dysport (300 units)Powder and Dysport (500 units)Powder.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share.

The move by KraussMaffei follows the announcement by BMW of the opening of a Battery Competence Centre in the same park last May. Together  KraussMaffei ‚Äì with 212 000 m2 gross lettable area ‚Äì and BMW ‚Äìwith 64 000 m2 gross lettable area ‚Äì occupy the existing park. Building D  which is to be completed by 2026 will provide 38 000 m2 gross lettable area and is an extension option for KraussMaffei. Once fully developed  VGP Park M√ºnchen will consist of five logistics buildings  two stand-alone parking houses and one office building for a total gross lettable area of ca. 314 000 m2.As a result of the successful completion of the project with delivery well within budget and within the original timeframe  VGP will receive a cash payment from Allianz Real Estate accordingly. VGP Park M√ºnchen is the third 50:50 joint venture between VGP and Allianz Real Estate  which was established in June 2020 with an objective to develop VGP Park M√ºnchen.Jan Van Geet  CEO of VGP  underlines the importance of the completion of the project for his company:""The completion of the new Munich business park represents another milestone in the history of our company. Apart from the Grade A location  cutting edge ESG standards applied and the sheer size of the project  I am particularly proud of our team having been able to deliver such a complex project in time and well within budget despite the very difficult market circumstances during and in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.""In line with the VGP sustainability strategy  the park is planned to the latest ESG standards: It accommodates one of the largest rooftop photovoltaic systems in Europe with a capacity of 12.5 megawatts. In addition  a biotope has been created next to the KraussMaffei site as a compensatory area. This will help to significantly improve the habitat for animals as well as insects and birds and increase the comfort for employees on the footpaths through the biotope.In addition  care was taken in the planning of the park to integrate natural areas into the project. Thus  in addition to green roofs and the greening of the fa√ßades  the multi-storey parking garages are also greened. In addition  the VGP Park Munich has electric charging stations for e-cars  energy-efficient hall heating with LED lighting and groundwater heat pumps. These measures contribute to achieving the requirements of a DGNB Gold certification for VGP Park Munich.Very near to the city centre  directly adjacent to S-Bahn station (S2-Grub) and only 30 minutes by car from Munich Airport  the park is located north of the Parsdorf junction on the A 94 motorway in a region of economic importance for agriculture  industry and trade.CONTACT DETAILS VGP FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESMartijn VluttersVP ‚Äì Business Development & Investor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433Karen HuybrechtsHead of Marketing Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.
